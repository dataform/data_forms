This tool allows us to select source problem solutions that match the current user solution and generate hints based on next problem steps that are most likely to lead to a successful solution. However, within such a tool it is possible to generate hints that did not turn out to be useful in the source problem solution. Therefore, we have proposed a metric to measure and integrate a "utility" function to choose source material for hint generation. In this paper we present our metric and an experiment to investigate its use on real data from a logic proof tutorial.

Diagnostics is frequently performed in a stepwise manner which consists of several consecutive tests (steps). The ultimate step in this process is often the "gold standard" reference method. In stepwise testing, results of each diagnostic test can be interpreted in a probabilistic manner by using prior (pre-test) probability and test characteristics (sensitivity and specificity). By using Bayes' formula on these quantities, the posterior (post-test) probability is calculated. If the post-test probability is sufficiently high (or low) to confirm (or exclude) the presence of a disease, diagnostic process is stopped. Otherwise, it proceeds to the next step in sequence. Our case study focuses on improving probabilistic interpretation of scintigraphic images obtained from the penultmiate step in coronary artery disease diagnostics. We use automatic image parameterization on multiple resolutions, based on texture description with specialized association rules. Extracted image parameters are combined into more informative composite parameters by means of principle component analysis, and finally used to build automatic classifiers with machine learning methods. Experiments show that the proposed approach significantly increases the number of reliable diagnoses as compared to clinical results in terms.

In this work we propose a machine learning approach to segmenting lung tumours in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans in order to provide a radiation therapist with a "second reader" opinion about the tumour location. For each PET slice, our system extracts a set of attributes, passes them to a trained Support, Vector Machine (SVM), and returns the optimal threshold value for distinguishing tumour from healthy voxels in that particular slice. We use this technique to analyse Four different PET/CT 3D studies. The system produced fairly accurate segmentation, with Jaccard and Dice's similarity coefficients between 0.82 and 0.98 (the areas outlined by the returned thresholds vs. the ones outlined by the reference thresholds). Besides the high level of geometric similarity, a significant correlation between the returned and the reference thresholds also indicates that during the training phase, the learning algorithm effectively acquired the dependency between the extracted attributes and optimal thresholds.

To this end, a patient's laryngeal oscillation patterns are captured with state-of-the-art endoscopic high-speed (HS) camera systems capable of recording 4000 frames/second. To date the clinical analysis of these HS videos is commonly performed in a subjective manner via slow-motion playback. Hence, the resulting diagnoses are inherently error-prone, exhibiting high inter-rater variability. In this paper an objective method for overcoming this drawback is presented which employs a quantitative description and classification approach based on a. novel image analysis,strategy called Phonovibrography. By extracting the relevant VF, movement, information from HS videos the spatio-temporal patterns of laryngeal activity are captured using a set of specialized features. As reference for performance, conventional voice analysis features are also computed. The derived features are analyzed with different machine learning (ML) algorithms regarding clinically meaningful classification tasks. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated using a clinical data. set comprising individuals with normophonic and paralytic voices. The results indicate that the presented approach holds a lot of promise for providing reliable diagnosis support, in the future.

Non-traditional medical records such as emails and e-documents containing PHI are in a high risk of privacy leakage. We are facing the challenges of locating and managing PHI in the distributed environment. The goal of this study is to classify, electronic documents into PHI and non-PHI. A supervised machine learning method was used for this text; categorization task. Three classifiers: SVM, decision tree and Naive Bayesian were used and tested on three data sets. Lexical, semantic and syntactic features and their combinations were compared in terms of their effectiveness of classifying PHI documents. The results show that combining semantic and/or syntactic with lexical features is more effective than lexical features alone for PHI classification. The supervised machine learning method is effective in classifying documents into PHI and non-PHI.

We quantify the complexity of a biomedical dataset using five complexity measures: correlation-based feature selection subset merit, noise. imbalance ratio. missing values and information gain. The effect of these complexity measures on classification accuracy is evaluated using five diverse machine learning algorithms: J48 (decision tree), SMO (support vector machines), Naive Bayes (probabilistic). IBk (instance based learner) and JRIP (rule-based induction). The results of our experiments show that noise and correlation-based feature selection subset merit - not a particular choice of algorithm - play a major role in determining the classification accuracy. In the end, we provide researchers with a meta-model and an empirical equation to estimate the classification potential of a dataset on the basis of its complexity. This well help researchers to efficiently pre-process the dataset for automatic knowledge extraction.

We show the definition to be computationally tractable; and apply it to the domain of generative art, utilizing a collection of features drawn from image processing. We next utilize our model of creativity in an interactive evolutionary art task, that of generating biomorphs. An individual biomorph is considered a potentially creative system by considering its capacity to generate novel children. We consider the creativity of biomorphs discovered via interactive evolution; via our creativity measure; and as a control; via totally random generation. It is shown that both the former methods find individuals deemed creative by our measure; Further, we argue that several of the discovered "creative" individuals are novel in a human-understandable way. We conclude that our creativity measure has the capacity to aid in user-guided evolutionary tasks.

Decision tree is a typical model for symbolic learning, and neural network is a model for sub-symbolic learning. For pattern recognition, decision trees are more efficient than neural networks for two reasons. First, the computations in making decisions are simpler. Second, important features can be selected automatically during the design process. This paper introduces models for modular neural network that are a neural network tree where each node being an expert neural network and modular neural architecture where interconnections between modules are reduced. In this paper, we will study adaptation processes of neural network trees, modular neural network and conventional neural network. Then, we will compare all these adaptation processes during experimental work with the Fisher's Iris data set that is the bench test database from the area of machine learning. Experimental results with a recognition problem show that both models (e.g. neural network tree and modular neural network) have better adaptation results than conventional multilayer neural network architecture but the time complexity for trained neural network trees increases exponentially with the number of inputs.

It is argued that transformation models are a natural candidate to study ranking models and ordinal regression in a context of machine learning. We do implement a structural risk minimization strategy based on a Lipschitz smoothness condition of the transformation model. Then, it is shown how the estimate can be obtained efficiently by solving a convex quadratic program with O(n) linear constraints and unknowns, with n the number of data points. A set of experiments do support these findings.	[Van Belle, Vanya; Pelckmans, Kristiaan; Suykens, Johan A.

Transition from a single neuron solving linearly separable problems, to multithreshold neuron solving k-separable problems, to neurons implementing prototypes solving q-separable problems, is investigated. Using Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) approach this transition is presented as going from two prototypes defining a single hyperplane, to many co-linear prototypes defining parallel hyperplanes, to unconstrained prototypes defining Voronoi tessellation. For most datasets relaxing the co-linearity condition improves accuracy increasing complexity of the model, but for data with inherent logical structure LVQ algorithms with constraints significantly outperforms original LVQ and many other algorithms.

The ensemble uses fuzzy rules derived by the Adaboost metalearning. The rules are used in an ensemble of neuro-fuzzy rough set systems to gain the ability to work with incomplete data (in terms of missing features). This feature is not common among different machine learning methods like neural networks or fuzzy systems. The systems are combined into the larger ensemble to achieve better accuracy. Simulations on a well-known benchmark showed the ability of the proposed system to perform relatively well.

Predictive modeling of such data is very ill-posed and prone to overfitting. Several recent studies for modeling high-dimensional data employ new learning methodology called Learning through Contradictions or Universum Learning due to Vapnik (1998,2006). This method incorporates a priori knowledge about application data, in the form of additional Universum samples, into the learning process. This paper investigates generalization properties of the Universum-SVM and how they are related to characteristics of the data. We describe practical conditions for evaluating the effectiveness of Random Averaging Universum.

However, these models have not yet been broadly accepted. This fact is mainly due to its inherent complexity. In particular, not only for being extremely complex information processing models, but also because of a computational expensive learning phase. The most popular training method for these models is back-propagation through the structure. This algorithm has been revealed not to be the most appropriate for structured processing due to problems of convergence, while more sophisticated training methods enhance the speed of convergence at the expense of increasing significantly the computational cost. In this paper, we firstly perform an analysis of the underlying principles behind these models aimed at understanding their computational power. Secondly, we propose an approximate second order stochastic learning algorithm. The proposed algorithm dynamically adapts the learning rate throughout the training phase of the network without incurring excessively expensive computational effort. The algorithm operates in both on-line and batch modes. Furthermore, the resulting learning scheme is robust against the vanishing gradients problem. The advantages of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated with a real-world application example.

This is the major complication after allogeneic haematopoietic stern cell transplantation (HSCT) in which functional immune cells of donor recognize the recipient as "foreign" and mount an immunologic attack. in this paper we analyzed gene-expression profiles of 47 genes associated with allo-reactivity in 59 patients submitted to HSCT. We have applied 2 feature selection algorithms combined with 2 different classifiers to detect the aGVHD at on-set of clinical signs. This is a preliminary study and the first paper which tackles both computational and biological evidence for the involvement of a limited number of genes for diagnosis of aGVHD. Directions for further studies are outlined.

Strengthening the Forward Variable Selection Stopping Criterion	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS - ICANN 2009, PT II	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	19th International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (ICANN 2009)	SEP 14-17, 2009	Limmassol, CYPRUS	European Neural Network Soc, Int Neural Network Soc, Japanese Neural Network Soc, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc		Variable Selection; Mutual Information; Function Approximation	MUTUAL INFORMATION	Given any modeling problem, variable selection is a preprocess step that selects the most relevant variables with respect to the output variable. Forward selection is the most straightforward strategy for variable selection; its application using the mutual information is simple, intuitive and effective, and is commonly used in the machine learning literature. However the problem of when to stop the forward process doesn't have a direct satisfactory solution due to the inaccuracies of the Mutual Information estimation, specially as the number of variables considered increases. This work proposes a modified stopping criterion for this variable selection methodology that uses the Markov blanket concept. As it will be shown, this approach can increase the performance and applicability of the stopping criterion of a forward selection process using mutual information.

Two approaches have been developed to estimate parametric and residual uncertainty, and they were tested on process based hydrological models. One approach emulates computationally expensive Monte Carlo simulations, and the second one uses residuals of a calibrated model M outputs to assess the remaining uncertainty of this model. ML models are trained to approximate the functional relationships between the input (and state) variables of the model M and the uncertainty descriptors. ML, model, being trained, encapsulates the information about the model M errors specific for different conditions in the past, and is used to estimate the probability distribution of the model M error or the new model runs. Methods are tested to estimate uncertainty of a conceptual rainfall-runoff model of a catchment in UK.

Consequently, an important task is to isolate to the few key attributes that contribute to the signal from among a large collection. We it this contributor problem to ate machine learning community and present a solution for monitoring in modern systems (with nonlinear reference conditions, high dimensions, categorical attributes, missing data, and so forth). The objective is to identify attributes that contribute to a signal, for both individual and multiple anomalies, or from several anomaly groups. Although related to the feature selection problem, the extreme sparseness of anomalies leads to scores that are designed specifically for the contributors problem. Statistical criteria are provided to quantitatively address decision rules and false alarms and the method can be compared quickly. Comparisons are made to traditional contribution plots.

However, in practice it is quite common that the observed samples are not informative enough, so that wrong learning results and failure in control may arise. Incorporating prior knowledge (PK) is a potential solution to this difficulty. This paper proposes a novel control scheme, the Nonlinear Model Based Control with PK Based Learning (NMBC-PKBL) characterized by incorporating the PK into the learning based modeling procedure in a model based controller. A case study is given to illustrate the whole design procedure of the proposed control scheme. The validity of the NMBC-PKBL is verified by numerical simulations, and the effects of various types of PK on the control performance are investigated via contrast experiments.

The EYECane is the white-cane with embedding a camera and a computer. It automatically detects obstacles and recommends some avoidable paths to the user through acoustic interface. For this, it is performed by three steps: Firstly, it extracts obstacles from image streaming using online background estimation, thereafter generates the occupancy grid map, which is given to neural network. Finally, the system notifies a user of an paths recommended by machine learning. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed EYECane, it was tested with 5 users and the results show that it can support more safe navigation, and diminish the practice and efforts to be adept in using the white cane.

Unfortunately, the high dimensionality of input feature vectors impacts on the classification speed. The kernel parameters setting for SVM in a training process impacts on the classification accuracy. Feature selection is another factor that impacts classification accuracy. The objective of this work is to reduce the dimension of feature vectors, optimizing the parameters to improve the SVM classification accuracy and speed. In order to improve classification speed we spent rough sets theory to reduce the feature vector space. We present a genetic algorithm approach for feature selection and parameters optimization to improve classification accuracy. Experimental results indicate our method is more effective than traditional SVM methods and other traditional methods.

As part of the training process, we created a large warehouse of light-curve sources with well-labelled classes that serve as priors to the classification engine. This web-based interactive framework, which we are now making public via DotAstro.org(4), allows us to ingest time-variable source data in a wide variety of formats and store it in a common internal data model. Data is passed between pipeline modules in a prototype XML representation of time-series format (VO-Timeseries), which can also be emitted to collaborators through dotastro.org. After import, the sources can be visualized using Google Sky, light curves can be inspected interactively, and classifications can be manually adjusted.

The TCP's classification machine-learning algorithms are trained using a comprehensive science class hierarchy of light-curves which are resarnpled to emulate the cadence and quality of incoming observatory data streams. The referenced classified light-curves are contained within our growing public data warehouse, DotAstro.ore(4). To effectively distinguish a source's classification from neighboring classes or hierarchical parents, dozens of real-number metrics ("features") are derived from its light-curve, color information, spatial context, and historical data. Upon science class identification (or reclassification), a VOEvent XML containing all available information is broadcast to subscribed telescopes and science groups for followup. Subsequently acquired data for that source can then be fed back to DotAstro.org which the TCP will use to reinforce its internal model of the source's science class.

The ability to rapidly acquire and reason over urban scenes is critically important to such tasks as mission and route planning, visibility prediction, communications simulation, target recognition, and inference of higher-level form and function. Under DARPA's Urban Reasoning and Geospatial ExploitatioN Technology (URGENT) Program, the BAE Systems team has developed a system that combines a suite of complementary feature extraction and matching algorithms with higher-level inference and contextual reasoning to detect, segment, and classify urban entities of interest in a fully automated fashion. Our system operates solely on colored 3D point clouds, and considers object categories with a wide range of specificity (fire hydrants, windows, parking lots), scale (street lights, roads, buildings, forests), and shape (compact shapes, extended regions, terrain). As no single method can recognize the diverse set of categories under consideration, we have integrated multiple state-of-the-art technologies that couple hierarchical associative reasoning with robust computer vision and machine learning techniques. Our solution leverages contextual cues and evidence propagation from features to objects to scenes in order to exploit the combined descriptive power of 3D shape, appearance, and learned inter-object spatial relationships. The result is a set of tools designed to significantly enhance the productivity of analysts in exploiting emerging 3D data sources.

When using a traditional parametric approach, the functional model of the PDF is assumed to be known. However, these models often do not capture the complexity of the underlying distribution. Furthermore, the problems of validating the model and estimating its parameters are often complicated by the sparsity of prior examples. The need for exemplars grows exponentially with the dimension of the feature space. These methods may yield PDFs that do not generalize well to unseen data because these tend to overfit or underfit the training exemplars. We investigate and compare alternate approaches for estimating a PDF and consider instead kernel based estimation methods which generalize the Parzen estimator and use a Linear Mixture of Kernels (LMK) model. The methods reported here are derived from machine learning methods such as the Support Vector Machines and the Relevance Vector Machines. These PDF estimators provide the following benefits: (a) they are data driven; (b) they do not overfit the data and consequently have good generalization properties; (c) they can accommodate highly irregular and multi-modal data distributions; (d) they provide a sparse and succinct description of the underlying data which leads to efficient computation and communication. Comparative experimental results are provided illustrating these properties using simulated Mixture of Gaussian-distributed data.

Several autonomic architectures have been proposed. Each of these architectures includes sort of a knowledge plane which is very important to mimic an autonomic behavior. Knowledge plane has a central role for self-functions by providing suitable knowledge to equipment and needs to learn new strategies for more accuracy. However, defining knowledge plane's architecture is still a challenge for researchers. Specially, defining the way cognitive supports interact each other in knowledge plane and implementing them. Decision making process depends on these interactions between reasoning and learning parts of knowledge plane. In this paper we propose a knowledge plane's architecture based on machine learning (inductive logic programming) paradigm and situated view to deal with distributed environment. This architecture is focused on two self-functions that include all other self-functions: self-adaptation and self-organization. Study cases are given and implemented.

In the human-machine communication aspect, the autonomic system performs its services autonomously, adjusting the behavior of its services to suit what the user might request implicitly or explicitly. The pervasive multimodal multimedia computing system aims at realizing anytime, anywhere computing. Its autonomic communication includes the protocols that selects, on behalf of the user, the modalities and media devices that are appropriate to the given interaction context. The modalities are the modes of interaction (i.e. for data input and output) between the user and the computer while the media devices are the physical devices that are used to support the chosen modalities. The interaction context itself is the combined user, environment, and system contexts. In this paper, we present the autonomic communication protocols involved in the detection of interaction context and the multimodal computing system's corresponding adaptation. The heart of this paradigm's design is the machine learning's knowledge acquisition and the use of the layered virtual machine for definition and detection of interaction context.

This method incorporates well-studied computer vision and machine learning techniques to form an unsupervised system, where vehicles are automatically "learned" from video sequences. First an enhanced adaptive background mixture model is used to identify positive and negative examples. Then a classifier is trained with these examples. In the detection phase, both background subtraction and the classifier are used to achieve very accurate results while not compromising efficiency. We tested our method with very low-, medium- and high-quality crowded and very crowded surveillance videos and got detection accuracies ranging between 90% to 96%.	[Tamersoy, Birgi; Aggarwal, J.

The recorded music is modeled as a superposition of known sounds from a library weighted by unknown weights. Similar observation models are commonly used in statistics and machine learning. Many methods for estimation of the weights are available. These methods differ in the assumptions imposed on the weights. In Bayesian paradigm, these assumptions are typically expressed in the form of prior probability density function (pdf) on the weights. In this paper, commonly used assumptions about music signal are summarized and complemented by a new assumption. These assumptions are translated into pdfs and combined into a single prior density using combination of pdfs. Validity of the model is tested in simulation using synthetic data.

This light sensor has been used previously in the Knuth Cyberphysics Laboratory on a robotic arm that performs its own experiments to locate a white circle in a dark field (Knuth et al., 2007). To use the light sensor to learn about its surroundings, the robot's inference software must be able to model and predict the light sensor's response to a hypothesized stimulus. Previous models of the light sensor treated it as a point sensor and ignored its spatial characteristics. Here we propose a parametric approach where the SSF is described by a mixture of Gaussians (MOG). By performing controlled calibration experiments with known stimulus inputs, we used nested sampling to estimate the SSF of the light sensor using an MOG model with the number of Gaussians ranging from one to five. By comparing the evidence computed for each MOG model, we found that one Gaussian is sufficient to describe the SSF to the accuracy we require. Future work will involve incorporating this more accurate SSF into the Bayesian machine learning software for the robotic system and studying how this detailed information about the properties of the light sensor will improve robot's ability to learn.

Nonlinear Statistical Modeling of Speech	BAYESIAN INFERENCE AND MAXIMUM ENTROPY METHODS IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	29th International Workshop on Bayesian Inference and Maximum Entropy Methods in Science and Engineering	JUL 05-10, 2009	Oxford, MS	Boise State Univ, Edwin T Jaynes Ctr, Univ Mississippi, Sch Engn, Off Res & Sponsored Programs		nonlinear statistical models; chaos; machine learning; speech recognition		Contemporary approaches to speech and speaker recognition decompose the problem into four components: feature extraction, acoustic modeling, language modeling and search. Statistical signal processing is an integral part of each of these components, and Bayes Rule is used to merge these components into a single optimal choice. Acoustic models typically use hidden Markov models based on Gaussian mixture models for state output probabilities. This popular approach suffers from an inherent assumption of linearity in speech signal dynamics. Language models often employ a variety of maximum entropy techniques, but can employ many of the same statistical techniques used for acoustic models. In this paper, we focus on introducing nonlinear statistical models to the feature extraction and acoustic modeling problems as a first step towards speech and speaker recognition systems based on notions of chaos and strange attractors. Our goal in this work is to improve the generalization and robustness properties of a speech recognition system. Three nonlinear invariants are proposed for feature extraction: Lyapunov exponents, correlation fractal dimension, and correlation entropy. We demonstrate an 11% relative improvement on speech recorded under noise-free conditions, but show a comparable degradation occurs for mismatched training conditions on noisy speech. We conjecture that the degradation is due to difficulties in estimating invariants reliably from noisy data. To circumvent these problems, we introduce two dynamic models to the acoustic modeling problem: (1) a linear dynamic model (LDM) that uses a state space-like formulation to explicitly model the evolution of hidden states using an autoregressive process, and (2) a data-dependent mixture of autoregressive (MixAR) models. Results show that LDM and MixAR models can achieve comparable performance with HMM systems while using significantly fewer parameters. Currently we are developing Bayesian parameter estimation and discriminative training algorithms for these new models to improve noise robustness.

Automated Classification of Radiology Reports for Acute Lung Injury: Comparison of Keyword and Machine Learning Based Natural Language Processing Approaches	BIBMW: 2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS AND BIOMEDICINE WORKSHOP			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine Workshop (BIBMW 2009)	NOV 01-04, 2009	Washington, DC	IEEE				This paper compares the performance of keyword and machine learning-based chest x-ray report classification for Acute Lung Injury (ALI). ALI mortality is approximately 30 percent. High mortality is, in part, a consequence of delayed manual chest x-ray classification. An automated system could reduce the time to recognize ALI and lead to reductions in mortality. For our study, 96 and 857 chest x-ray reports in two corpora were labeled by domain experts for ALI. We developed a keyword and a Maximum Entropy-based classification system. Word unigram and character n-grams provided the features for the machine learning system. The Maximum Entropy algorithm with character 6-gram achieved the highest performance (Recall=0.91, Precision=0.90 and F-measure=0.91) on the 857-report cot-pus. This study has shown that for the classification of ALI chest x-ray reports, the machine learning approach is superior to the keyword based system and achieves comparable results to highest performing physician annotators.

Correlation between computed equilibrium secondary structure free energy and siRNA efficiency	BIBMW: 2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS AND BIOMEDICINE WORKSHOP			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine Workshop (BIBMW 2009)	NOV 01-04, 2009	Washington, DC	IEEE		RNA interference (RNAi); RNAi efficiency; RNA secondary structure; RNAi equilibrium thermodynamics; Support Vector Machines		We have explored correlations between the measured efficiency of the RNAi process and several computed signatures that characterize equilibrium secondary structure of the participating mRNA, siRNA, and their complexes. A previously published data set of 609 experimental points (with efficiency represented as percentage of remaining mRNA) was used for the analysis. While virtually no correlation with the computed structural signatures are observed for individual data points, several clear trends emerge when the "noise" is reduced by averaging over 10 bins of N similar to 60 data points per bin. The strongest of the trends is a positive linear (r(2) = 0.87) correlation between In(remaining mRNA) and Delta G(ms), the combined free energy cost of unraveling the siRNA and creating the break in the mRNA secondary structure at the complementary target strand region. At the same time, the free energy change Delta G(total) of the entire process mRNA + siRNA -> (mRNA - siRNA)(complex) is not correlated with RNAi efficiency, even after the averaging. These general findings appear to be robust to details of the computational protocols, suggesting that, while straightforward analysis based on equilibrium secondary structure thermodynamics may not be directly applicable to the entire RNAi process, it is applicable to at least one of its key stages. The correlation between computed Delta G(ms) and experimentally observed RNAi efficiency can be used to enhance the ability of a machine learning algorithm based on a support vector machine (SVM) to predict effective siRNA sequences for a given target mRNA. Specifically, we observe modest, 3 to 7%, but consistent improvement in the positive predictive value (PPV) when the SVM training set is pre- or post-filtered to half the original size according to a Delta G(ms) threshold.

These two methods are evaluated on five different regression datasets and their results are compared. The results confirm the goodness of both methods although RCGA-SP performs clearly better than RCGA-S because it adds the possibility of projecting the input variables onto a lower dimensional space.

Cessation in breathing often causes Electroencephalographic (EEG) arousals as a response, and therefore detection of arousals is important since they provide important evidence for localization of apneic events and their number is directly related with SAHS severity. Arousals result in fragmented sleep and so they are one of the most important causes of daytime sleepiness. In this paper we present an approach to detect these arousals over polysomnographic recordings based on the machine learning paradigm. First a signal processing technique is proposed for the construction of learning patterns. Subsequently classifiers based on Fisher's linear and quadratic discriminates, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are compared for the learning process. The more suitable model was chosen finally showing an accuracy of 0.92.

The classifier is a single hidden-layer feedforward neural network (SLFN), of which the activation function of the hidden units is 'tansig'.

Towards global empirical upscaling of FLUXNET eddy covariance observations: validation of a model tree ensemble approach using a biosphere model	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							GROSS PRIMARY PRODUCTION; NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE; COMBINING MODIS; AMERIFLUX DATA; CARBON; CLIMATE; REGRESSION; COMPETITION; FORESTS; FLUXES	Global, spatially and temporally explicit estimates of carbon and water fluxes derived from empirical up-scaling eddy covariance measurements would constitute a new and possibly powerful data stream to study the variability of the global terrestrial carbon and water cycle. This paper introduces and validates a machine learning approach dedicated to the upscaling of observations from the current global network of eddy covariance towers (FLUXNET). We present a new model TRee Induction ALgorithm (TRIAL) that performs hierarchical stratification of the data set into units where particular multiple regressions for a target variable hold. We propose an ensemble approach (Evolving tRees with RandOm gRowth, ERROR) where the base learning algorithm is perturbed in order to gain a diverse sequence of different model trees which evolves over time. We evaluate the efficiency of the model tree ensemble (MTE) approach using an artificial data set derived from the Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land (LPJmL) biosphere model. We aim at reproducing global monthly gross primary production as simulated by LPJmL from 1998-2005 using only locations and months where high quality FLUXNET data exist for the training of the model trees. The model trees are trained with the LPJmL land cover and meteorological input data, climate data, and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation simulated by LPJmL. Given that we know the 'true result' in the form of global LPJmL simulations we can effectively study the performance of the MTE upscaling and associated problems of extrapolation capacity. We show that MTE is able to explain 92% of the variability of the global LPJmL GPP simulations. The mean spatial pattern and the seasonal variability of GPP that constitute the largest sources of variance are very well reproduced (96% and 94% of variance explained respectively) while the monthly interannual anomalies which occupy much less variance are less well matched (41% of variance explained). We demonstrate the substantially improved accuracy of MTE over individual model trees in particular for the monthly anomalies and for situations of extrapolation. We estimate that roughly one fifth of the domain is subject to extrapolation while MTE is still able to reproduce 73% of the LPJmL GPP variability here. This paper presents for the first time a benchmark for a global FLUXNET upscaling approach that will be employed in future studies. Although the real world FLUXNET upscaling is more complicated than for a noise free and reduced complexity biosphere model as presented here, our results show that an empirical upscaling from the current FLUXNET network with MTE is feasible and able to extract global patterns of carbon flux variability.

Genetic algorithms for simultaneous variable and sample selection in metabonomics	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							PATTERN-RECOGNITION; SPECTROSCOPIC DATA; SUBSET-SELECTION; DRUG TOXICITY; CLASSIFICATION; URINE; METABOLOMICS; OPTIMIZATION; URINALYSIS; REGRESSION	Motivation: Metabolic profiles derived from high resolution (1)H-NMR data are complex, therefore statistical and machine learning approaches are vital for extracting useful information and biological insights. Focused modelling on targeted subsets of metabolites and samples can improve the predictive ability of models, and techniques such as genetic algorithms (GAs) have a proven utility in feature selection problems. The Consortium for Metabonomic Toxicology (COMET) obtained temporal NMR spectra of urine from rats treated with model toxins and stressors. Here, we develop a GA approach which simultaneously selects sets of samples and spectral regions from the COMET database to build robust, predictive classifiers of liver and kidney toxicity. Results: The results indicate that using simultaneous sample and variable selection improved performance by over 9% compared with either method alone. Simultaneous selection also halved computation time. Successful classifiers repeatedly selected particular variables indicating that this approach can aid de. ning biomarkers of toxicity. Novel visualizations of the results from multiple computations were developed to aid the interpretability of which samples and variables were frequently selected. This method provides an efficient way to determine the most discriminatory variables and samples for any post-genomic dataset.

With recent improvements in mass spectrometry, phosphorylation site data are rapidly accumulating. Despite this wealth of data, computational prediction of phosphorylation sites remains a challenging task. This is particularly true in plants, due to the limited information on substrate specificities of protein kinases in plants and the fact that current phosphorylation prediction tools are trained with kinase-specific phosphorylation data from non-plant organisms. In this paper, we proposed a new machine learning approach for phosphorylation site prediction. We incorporate protein sequence information and protein disordered regions, and integrate machine learning techniques of k-nearest neighbor and support vector machine for predicting phosphorylation sites. Test results on the PhosPhAt dataset of phosphoserines in Arabidopsis and the TAIR7 non-redundant protein database show good performance of our proposed phosphorylation site prediction method.

Although, hundreds of miRNAs have been identified, recent studies indicate that more remain to be discovered. Identifying novel miRNAs remains a very important aspect to the understanding of their biological roles. Computational methods can complement experimental approaches and can play an important role in identifying miRNAs candidates for further experimental validation. Most computational approaches utilize features extracted from miRNA precursors (pre-miRNA) sequences and/or their secondary structures to detect miRNAs. A key characteristic of pre-miRNAs is their hairpin structure. In this paper, Fuzzy decision trees are applied to the prediction and classification of real and pseudo pre-miRNAs. In our model, a number of features that encode local and global characteristics of pre-miRNA sequence structure are used. A fuzzy model of the extracted features was constructed. The fuzzified data was then fed into a fuzzy decision tree induction algorithm. Our experimental results showed that our method achieved better accuracy than other machine-learning based computational approaches.

Artificial Metaplasticity is a novel ANN training algorithm that gives more relevance to less frequent training patterns and subtract relevance to the frequent ones during training phase, achieving a much more efficient training, while at least maintaining the Multilayer Perceptron performance. Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database (WBCD) was used to train and test MMLPs. WBCD is a well-used database in machine learning, neural networks and signal processing. Experimental results show that MMLPs reach better accuracy than any other recent results.

J	Castellini, C; van der Smagt, P				Castellini, Claudio; van der Smagt, Patrick			Surface EMG in advanced hand prosthetics	BIOLOGICAL CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Learning and adaptive systems; Rehabilitation robotics; Physical human-robot interaction		One of the major problems when dealing with highly dexterous, active hand prostheses is their control by the patient wearing them. With the advances in mechatronics, building prosthetic hands with multiple active degrees of freedom is realisable, but actively controlling the position and especially the exerted force of each finger cannot yet be done naturally. This paper deals with advanced robotic hand control via surface electromyography. Building upon recent results, we show that machine learning, together with a simple downsampling algorithm, can be effectively used to control on-line, in real time, finger position as well as finger force of a highly dexterous robotic hand. The system determines the type of grasp a human subject is willing to use, and the required amount of force involved, with a high degree of accuracy. This represents a remarkable improvement with respect to the state-of-the-art of feed-forward control of dexterous mechanical hands, and opens up a scenario in which amputees will be able to control hand prostheses in a much finer way than it has so far been possible.

BIOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS AND ORIGIN OF SYNTAX	Strungmann Forum Reports		English	Proceedings Paper	Ernst Strungmann Forum	JUL 13-18, 2008	Frankfurt, GERMANY					This working group staked out the landscape of mathematical and computational modeling approaches to language evolution. The authors attempt both to provide a survey of existing research in this field and to suggest promising novel directions for investigations. The focus was set on cultural evolution; biological evolution is covered in other chapters of this volume. The field is young, manifold, and highly productive, with contributions not only from theoretical linguists but also from theoretical physics, robotics, computational neuroscience, and machine learning. This chapter provides a systematic presentation and comparison of different modeling paradigms, which range from a rigorous mathematical analysis of macroscopic language transmission dynamics to computational (even robotic) studies of complex systems populated by learning agents. Original contributions of modeling research to the understanding of cultural language evolution are highlighted, shedding light on the magnification of learning bias through cultural transmission, restricting the space of possible grammars, coevolution of categories and names, and the emergence of linguistic ontologies.

In this chapter, first, three new variants of the expectation-maximization (EM) method for semisupervised document classification (Machine Learning 39:103-134, 2000) arc introduced to refine biomedical literature meta-searches. The retrieval performance of a multi-mixture per class EM variant with Agglomerative Information Bottleneck clustering (Slonim and Tishby (1999) Agglomerative information bottleneck. In Proceedings of NIPS-12) using Davies-Bouldin cluster validity index (IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 1:224-227, 1979), rivaled the state-of-the-art transductive support vector machines (TSVM) (Joachims (1999) Transductive inference for text classification Using support vector machines. In Proccedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)). Moreover, the multi-mixture per class EM variant refined search results more quickly with more than one order of magnitude improvement in execution time compared with TSVM. A second tool, CRFNER, uses conditional random fields (Lafferty et al. (2001) Conditional random fields: Probabilistic models for segmenting and labeling sequence data.

The detection of smiles, however, has received less attention. Its distinctive configuration may pose less problem than other, at times subtle, expressions. Oil the other hand, smiles can still be very useful as a measure of happiness, enjoyment or even approval. Geometrical or local-based detection approaches like the use of lip edges may not be robust enough and thus researchers have focused on applying machine learning to appearance-based and self-similarity descriptors. This work makes an extensive experimental study of smile detection testing the Local Binary Patterns (LBP) combined with self similarity (LAC) as main descriptors of the image, along with the powerful Support Vector Machines classifier. Results show that error rates can be acceptable and the self similarity approach for the detection of smiles is suitable for real-time interaction, although there is still room for improvement.

In this paper we intend to improve classification accuracy by taking advantage of a feature of BCIs: instances run in sequences belonging to the same class. In that case, the classification problem can be reformulated into two subproblems: detecting class transitions and determining the class for sequences of instances between transitions. We detect a transition when the Euclidean distance between the power spectra at two different times is larger than a threshold. To tackle the second problem, instances are classified by taking into account, not just the prediction for that instance, but a moving window of predictions for previous instances. Our results are competitive with those obtained in the BCI III competition.

Researchers analyse fMRI data to investigate the functions and structure of the brain. Using machine learning tools that have been widely used in recent years in fMRI area, has enabled to predict the cognitive states of subject which is called "brain reading" also.

There is, therefore, a need for translational clinical tools based on molecular bioinformatics, particularly in current cancer care, that can acquire, analyze the data, and interpret and present information from multiple diagnostic modalities to help the clinician make effective decisions. Results: We present a platform for molecular signature discovery and clinical decision support that relies on genomic and epigenomic measurement modalities as well as clinical parameters such as histopathological results and survival information. Our Physician Accessible Preclinical Analytics Application (PAPAyA) integrates a powerful set of statistical and machine learning tools that leverage the connections among the different modalities. It is easily extendable and reconfigurable to support integration of existing research methods and tools into powerful data analysis and interpretation pipelines. A current configuration of PAPAyA with examples of its performance on breast cancer molecular profiles is used to present the platform in action. Conclusion: PAPAyA enables analysis of data from (pre)clinical studies, formulation of new clinical hypotheses, and facilitates clinical decision support by abstracting molecular profiles for clinicians.

Andrew; Johnson, Kevin A.; George, Mark S.; Lu, Xinghua			Feature selection for fMRI-based deception detection	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article	2nd Summit on Translational Bioinformatics	MAR 15-17, 2009	San Francisco, CA	Amer Med Informat Assoc			EXPRESSION DATA; LIE DETECTION; CLASSIFICATION; CANCER	Background: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a technology used to detect brain activity. Patterns of brain activation have been utilized as biomarkers for various neuropsychiatric applications. Detecting deception based on the pattern of brain activation characterized with fMRI is getting attention - with machine learning algorithms being applied to this field in recent years. The high dimensionality of fMRI data makes it a difficult task to directly utilize the original data as input for classification algorithms in detecting deception. In this paper, we investigated the procedures of feature selection to enhance fMRI-based deception detection. Results: We used the t-statistic map derived from the statistical parametric mapping analysis of fMRI signals to construct features that reflect brain activation patterns. We subsequently investigated various feature selection methods including an ensemble method to identify discriminative features to detect deception. Using 124 features selected from a set of 65,166 original features as inputs for a support vector machine classifier, our results indicate that feature selection significantly enhanced the classification accuracy of the support vector machine in comparison to the models trained using all features and dimension reduction based models. Furthermore, the selected features are shown to form anatomic clusters within brain regions, which supports the hypothesis that specific brain regions may play a role during deception processes. Conclusion: Feature selection not only enhances classification accuracy in fMRI-based deception detection but also provides support for the biological hypothesis that brain activities in certain regions of the brain are important for discrimination of deception.

Abbreviation recognition is related to NER and can be considered as a pair recognition task of a terminology and its corresponding abbreviation from free text. The successful identification of abbreviation and its corresponding definition is not only a prerequisite to index terms of text databases to produce articles of related interests, but also a building block to improve existing gene mention tagging and gene normalization tools. Results: Our approach to abbreviation recognition (AR) is based on machine-learning, which exploits a novel set of rich features to learn rules from training data. Tested on the AB3P corpus, our system demonstrated a F-score of 89.90% with 95.86% precision at 84.64% recall, higher than the result achieved by the existing best AR performance system. We also annotated a new corpus of 1200 PubMed abstracts which was derived from BioCreative II gene normalization corpus. On our annotated corpus, our system achieved a F-score of 86.20% with 93.52% precision at 79.95% recall, which also outperforms all tested systems. Conclusion: By applying our system to extract all short form-long form pairs from all available PubMed abstracts, we have constructed BIOADI. Mining BIOADI reveals many interesting trends of bio-medical research. Besides, we also provide an off-line AR software in the download section on http://bioagent.iis.sinica.edu.tw/BIOADI/.

However, the development of new statistical and computational tools for effective processing of these data has not been equally as fast. In particular, Machine Learning literature is limited to relatively few papers which are focused on the development and application of data mining methods for the analysis of genetic variability. On the other hand, these papers apply to genetic data procedures which had been developed for a different kind of analysis and do not take into account the peculiarities of population genetics. The aim of our study was to define a new similarity measure, specifically conceived for measuring the similarity between the genetic profiles of two groups of subjects (i.e., cases and controls) taking into account that genetic profiles are usually distributed in a population group according to the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. Results: We set up a new kernel function consisting of a similarity measure between groups of subjects genotyped for numerous genetic loci. This measure weighs different genetic profiles according to the estimates of gene frequencies at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the population. We named this function the "Hardy-Weinberg kernel". The effectiveness of the Hardy-Weinberg kernel was compared to the performance of the well established linear kernel. We found that the Hardy-Weinberg kernel significantly outperformed the linear kernel in a number of experiments where we used either simulated data or real data. Conclusion: The "Hardy-Weinberg kernel" reported here represents one of the first attempts at incorporating genetic knowledge into the definition of a kernel function designed for the analysis of genetic data. We show that the best performance of the "Hardy-Weinberg kernel" is observed when rare genotypes have different frequencies in cases and controls. The ability to capture the effect of rare genotypes on phenotypic traits might be a very important and useful feature, as most of the current statistical tools loose most of their statistical power when rare genotypes are involved in the susceptibility to the trait under study.

(2) The search results do not highlight the hypertension-related genes discovered in the abstract. (3) Even though some text mining services mark up gene names in the abstract, the key genes investigated in a paper are still not distinguished from other genes. To facilitate the information gathering process for hypertension researchers, one solution would be to extract the key hypertension-related genes in each abstract. Three major tasks are involved in the construction of this system: (1) gene and hypertension named entity recognition, (2) section categorization, and (3) gene-hypertension relation extraction. Results: We first compare the retrieval performance achieved by individually adding template features and position features to the baseline system. Then, the combination of both is examined. We found that using position features can almost double the original AUC score (0.8140vs.0.4936) of the baseline system. However, adding template features only results in marginal improvement (0.0197). Including both improves AUC to 0.8184, indicating that these two sets of features are complementary, and do not have overlapping effects. We then examine the performance in a different domain-diabetes, and the result shows a satisfactory AUC of 0.83. Conclusion: Our approach successfully exploits template features to recognize true hypertension-related gene mentions and position features to distinguish key genes from other related genes. Templates are automatically generated and checked by biologists to minimize labor costs. Our approach integrates the advantages of machine learning models and pattern matching. To the best of our knowledge, this the first systematic study of extracting hypertension-related genes and the first attempt to create a hypertension-gene relation corpus based on the GAD database. Furthermore, our paper proposes and tests novel features for extracting key hypertension genes, such as relative position, section, and template features, which could also be applied to key-gene extraction for other diseases.

J	Yeniterzi, S; Sezerman, U				Yeniterzi, Sueveyda; Sezerman, U@ur			EnzyMiner: automatic identification of protein level mutations and their impact on target enzymes from PubMed abstracts	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article	Joint Meeting of the 7th European Conference on Computational Biology/5th Meeting of the Bioinformatics-Italian-Society	SEP 22-26, 2008	Cagliari, ITALY	Bioinformat Italian Soc			DATABASE; MECHANISM	Background: A better understanding of the mechanisms of an enzyme's functionality and stability, as well as knowledge and impact of mutations is crucial for researchers working with enzymes. Though, several of the enzymes' databases are currently available, scientific literature still remains at large for up-to-date source of learning the effects of a mutation on an enzyme. However, going through vast amounts of scientific documents to extract the information on desired mutation has always been a time consuming process. In this paper, therefore, we describe an unique method, termed as EnzyMiner, which automatically identifies the PubMed abstracts that contain information on the impact of a protein level mutation on the stability and/or the activity of a given enzyme. Results: We present an automated system which identifies the abstracts that contain an amino-acid-level mutation and then classifies them according to the mutation's effect on the enzyme. In the case of mutation identification, MuGeX, an automated mutation-gene extraction system has an accuracy of 93.1% with a 91.5 F-measure. For impact analysis, document classification is performed to identify the abstracts that contain a change in enzyme's stability or activity resulting from the mutation. The system was trained on lipases and tested on amylases with an accuracy of 85%. Conclusion: EnzyMiner identifies the abstracts that contain a protein mutation for a given enzyme and checks whether the abstract is related to a disease with the help of information extraction and machine learning techniques. For disease related abstracts, the mutation list and direct links to the abstracts are retrieved from the system and displayed on the Web. For those abstracts that are related to non-diseases, in addition to having the mutation list, the abstracts are also categorized into two groups. These two groups determine whether the mutation has an effect on the enzyme's stability or functionality followed by displaying these on the web.

Machine learning is one strategy that works by uncovering and using useful properties that are implicit in the text. However these properties are usually not reported in the literature explicitly. By investigating specific properties of biological text passages in this paper, we aim to facilitate an alternative strategy, the use of text empirics, to support mining of biomedical texts for biomolecular interactions. We report on our application of this approach, and also report some empirical findings about an important class of passages. These may be useful to others who may also wish to use the empirical properties we describe. Results: We manually analyzed syntactic and semantic properties of sentences likely to describe interactions between biomolecules. The resulting empirical data were used to design an algorithm for the PathBinder system to extract biomolecular interactions from texts. PathBinder searches PubMed for sentences describing interactions between two given biomolecules. PathBinder then uses probabilistic methods to combine evidence from multiple relevant sentences in PubMed to assess the relative likelihood of interaction between two arbitrary biomolecules. A biomolecular interaction network was constructed based on those likelihoods. Conclusion: The text empirics approach used here supports computationally friendly, performance competitive, automatic extraction of biomolecular interactions from texts.

J	Ruan, JH; Deng, YP; Perkins, EJ; Zhang, WX				Ruan, Jianhua; Deng, Youping; Perkins, Edward J.; Zhang, Weixiong			An ensemble learning approach to reverse-engineering transcriptional regulatory networks from time-series gene expression data	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article							CELL-CYCLE; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS; YEAST; DIFFERENTIATION; IDENTIFICATION; DISCOVERY; PATTERNS; SEQUENCE; ELEMENTS	Background: One of the most challenging tasks in the post-genomic era is to reconstruct the transcriptional regulatory networks. The goal is to reveal, for each gene that responds to a certain biological event, which transcription factors affect its expression, and how a set of transcription factors coordinate to accomplish temporal and spatial specific regulations. Results: Here we propose a supervised machine learning approach to address these questions. We focus our study on the gene transcriptional regulation of the cell cycle in the budding yeast, thanks to the large amount of data available and relatively well-understood biology, although the main ideas of our method can be applied to other data as well. Our method starts with building an ensemble of decision trees for each microarray data to capture the association between the expression levels of yeast genes and the binding of transcription factors to gene promoter regions, as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation microarray (ChIP-chip) experiment. Cross-validation experiments show that the method is more accurate and reliable than the naive decision tree algorithm and several other ensemble learning methods. From the decision tree ensembles, we extract logical rules that explain how a set of transcription factors act in concert to regulate the expression of their targets. We further compute a profile for each rule to show its regulation strengths at different time points. We also propose a spline interpolation method to integrate the rule profiles learned from several time series expression data sets that measure the same biological process. We then combine these rule profiles to build a transcriptional regulatory network for the yeast cell cycle. Compared to the results in the literature, our method correctly identifies all major known yeast cell cycle transcription factors, and assigns them into appropriate cell cycle phases. Our method also identifies many interesting synergetic relationships among these transcription factors, most of which are well known, while many of the rest can also be supported by other evidences. Conclusion: The high accuracy of our method indicates that our method is valid and robust. As more gene expression and transcription factor binding data become available, we believe that our method is useful for reconstructing large-scale transcriptional regulatory networks in other species as well.

Prediction of DNA-binding residues from protein sequence information using random forests	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article							STRUCTURAL INFORMATION; SITES	Background: Protein-DNA interactions are involved in many biological processes essential for cellular function. To understand the molecular mechanism of protein-DNA recognition, it is necessary to identify the DNA-binding residues in DNA-binding proteins. However, structural data are available for only a few hundreds of protein-DNA complexes. With the rapid accumulation of sequence data, it becomes an important but challenging task to accurately predict DNA-binding residues directly from amino acid sequence data. Results: A new machine learning approach has been developed in this study for predicting DNA-binding residues from amino acid sequence data. The approach used both the labelled data instances collected from the available structures of protein-DNA complexes and the abundant unlabeled data found in protein sequence databases. The evolutionary information contained in the unlabeled sequence data was represented as position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) and several new descriptors. The sequence-derived features were then used to train random forests (RFs), which could handle a large number of input variables and avoid model overfitting. The use of evolutionary information was found to significantly improve classifier performance. The RF classifier was further evaluated using a separate test dataset, and the predicted DNA-binding residues were examined in the context of three-dimensional structures. Conclusion: The results suggest that the RF-based approach gives rise to more accurate prediction of DNA-binding residues than previous studies. A new web server called BindN-RF http://bioinfo.ggc.org/bindn-rf/ has thus been developed to make the RF classifier accessible to the biological research community.

However, little attention has been paid to the overall system behavior, most published work being focused on the signal classification (i.e., translation) stage. More recently an increasing amount of work has been centred around the feature selection stage that precedes translation. The emphasis in feature selection and translation has stemmed from the large number of researchers with a machine learning or pattern recognition background who have recently joined the field. While there is an important contribution to BMIs, two crucial elements have not been sufficiently explored: the selection of suitable mental tasks and feedback protocols. This review presents an overview of BMIs and its main elements, with a focus on why each stage is important for the overall performance of such systems.

S	Padmanabhan, B		Adomavicius, G; Gupta, A		Padmanabhan, Balaji			Web Clickstream Data and Pattern Discovery: A Framework and Applications	BUSINESS COMPUTING	Handbooks in Information Systems		English	Article; Book Chapter								There is tremendous potential for firms to make effective use of Web clickstream data. In a perfect world a firm will be able to optimally manage online customer interactions by using real-time Web clickstream data. Here it may be possible to proactively serve users by determining customer interests and needs before they are even expressed. Effective techniques for learning from this data are needed to bridge the gap between the potential inherent in clickstream data and the goal of optimized customer interactions. Techniques developed in various fields including statistics, machine learning, databases, artificial intelligence, information systems and bioinformatics can be of value here, and]Indeed several pattern discovery techniques have been proposed in these areas in the recent past. In this chapter we discuss a few applications of pattern discovery in Web clickstream data in the context of a new pattern discovery framework presented here. The framework is general and we note other applications and opportunities for research that this framework suggests.

In this chapter, we introduce two types of spatial-temporal data analysis techniques and discuss their applications in public health informatics. The first technique focuses on clustering or hotspot analysis. Both statistical and machine learning-based analysis techniques are discussed in off-line (retrospective) and online (prospective) data analysis contexts. The second technique aims to analyze multiple data streams and identify significant correlations among them. Both classical spatial correlation analysis methods and new research on spatial-temporal correlation are presented.

Mapping of hyperspectral AVIRIS data using machine-learning algorithms	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; IMAGING SPECTROMETER DATA; SPECTRAL ANGLE MAPPER; DECISION FUSION; RANDOM FOREST; MULTICLASS; IMAGERY; MULTISOURCE; ACCURACY	Hyperspectral imaging provides detailed spectral and spatial information from the land cover that enables a precise differentiation between various surface materials. On the other hand, the performance of traditional and widely used statistical classification methods is often limited in this context, and thus alternative methods are required. In the study presented here, the performance of two machine-learning techniques, namely support vector machines (SVMs) and random forests (RFs), is investigated and the classification results are compared with those from well-known methods (i.e., maximum likelihood classifier and spectral angle mapper). The classifiers are applied to an Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) dataset that was acquired near the Hekla volcano in Iceland. The results clearly show the advantages of the two proposed classifier algorithms in terms of accuracy. They significantly outperform the other methods and achieve overall accuracies of approximately 90%. Although SVM and RF show some diversity in the classification results, the global performance of the two classifiers is very similar. Thus, both methods can be considered attractive for the classification of hyperspectral data.

An advantage of this high-level concept is to enable the user to incorporate his preferences regarding the semantic aspects of music and images. For example, the user might request the system to automatically create a slideshow, which plays soft music and shows pictures with sunsets from the last 10 years of his own photo collection. The high-level feature extraction on both, the audio and the visual information is based on the same underlying machine learning core, which processes different audio- and visual- low- and mid-level features. This paper describes the technical realization and evaluation of the algorithms with suitable test databases.

A song's mood is expressed by a supervised machine learning approach based on musical features extracted from the raw audio signal. A ground truth, used for training, is created using both social network information systems and individual experts. Tests of 7 different classification configurations have been performed, showing that Support Vector Machines perform best for the task at hand. Moreover, we evaluate the algorithm robustness to different audio compression schemes. This fact, often neglected, is fundamental to build a system that is usable in real conditions. In addition, the integration of a fast and scalable version of this technique with the European Project PHAROS is discussed.

In this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised multi-view learning method, which partition or select the abundant attributes (called attribute partition or attribute selection) into subsets. We consider each subset as a view and on each subset train a classifier to label the unlabeled examples. Based on the ensemble learning, we combine their predictions to classify the unlabeled examples. The semi-supervised learning idea is that to make use of the large number unlabeled example to modify the classifiers iteratively. Experiments on UCI datasets show that this method is feasible and can improve the efficiency. Both theoretical analysis and experiments show that the proposed method has excellent accuracy and speed of classification.

In the improved source-channel model, maximum entropy model is used, and the discriminative training is introduced. And the rhythm model is proposed to describe the property of the utterance. The phrase-length model and the foot-pattern model both are used to describe the rhythm model, respectively. The experiments show that this approach achieved a good performance for prosodic phrasing. The improved source-channel model achieve a better performance than the Hidden Markov Model. And the foot-pattern model is the better one as a rhythm model.

A Probabilistic Approach to Hybrid Role Mining	CCS'09: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 16TH ACM CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER AND COMMUNICATIONS SECURITY			English	Proceedings Paper	16th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security	NOV 09-13, 2009	Chicago, IL	ACM SIGSAC		RBAC; Role Mining; Hybrid Role Mining; Machine Learning; Business Meaning		Role mining algorithms address an important access control problem configuring a role-based access control system Given a direct assignment of users to permissions, role mining discovers a set of roles together with an assignment of users to roles The results should closely agree with the direct assignment. Moreover, the roles should be understandable from the business perspective in that they reflect functional roles within the enterprise. This requires hybrid role mining methods that work with both direct assignments and business Information from the enterprise. In this paper, we provide statistical measures to analyze the relevance of different kinds of business information for defining roles. We then present an approach that incorporates relevant business information into a probabilistic model with an associated algorithm for hybrid role mining Experiments on actual enterprise data show that our algorithm yields roles that both explain the given user-permission assignments and are meaningful from the business perspective	[Frank, Mario; Streich, Andreas P.; Basin, David; Buhmann, Joachim M.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland	Frank, M (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.	mafrank@inf.ethz.ch; astreich@inf.ethz.ch; basin@inf.ethz.ch; jbuhmann@inf.ethz.ch					Agrawal R., 1994, P 20 INT C VER LARG, P487; BUHMANN J, 1993, IEEE T INFORM THEORY, V39, P1133, DOI 10.1109/18.243432; CANTER B, 2005, LECT NOTES COMPUTER, V3626; COLANTONIO A, 2009, P 14 ACM S ACC CONTR; COLANTONIO A, 2008, P 23 ACM S APPL COMP, V3, P2129; Cover T.

Central to such an approach is that machine learning techniques typically rely upon summaries or features of the program. The quality of these features is critical to the accuracy of the resulting machine learned algorithm; no machine learning method will work well with poorly chosen features. However, due to the size and complexity of programs, theoretically there are an infinite number of potential features to choose from. The compiler writer now has to expend effort in choosing the best features from this space. This paper develops a novel mechanism to automatically find those features which most improve the quality of the machine learned heuristic. The feature space is described by a grammar and is then searched with genetic programming and predictive modeling. We apply this technique to loop unrolling in GCC 4.3.1 and evaluate our approach on a Pentium 6. On a benchmark suite of 57 programs, GCC's hard-coded heuristic achieves only 3% of the maximum performance available, while a state of the art machine learning approach with hand-coded features obtains 59%. Our feature generation technique is able to achieve 76% of the maximum available speedup, outperforming existing approaches.

Unfortunately, this truism is hard to reduce to practice. Usually, modelers produce hundreds to hundreds of thousands of predictions, most (if not all) of which go untested. In a best-case scenario, a small subsample of predictions (three to ten usually) is experimentally validated, as it quality control step to attest to the global Soundness of the full set of predictions. However, whether this small set is even representative of the global algorithm's performance is a question usually left unaddressed. Thus, a clear understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of an algorithm most often remains elusive, especially to the experimental biologists who must decide which tool to use to address a specific problem. In this chapter, we describe the first systematic set of challenges posed to the systems biology community in the framework of the DREAM (Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods) project. These tests, which came to be known as the DREAM2 challenges, consist of data generously donated by participants to the DREAM project and corated in such it way its to become problems of network reconstruction and whose solutions, the actual networks behind the data, were withheld from the participants. The explanation of the resulting five challenges, a global comparison of the submissions, and a discussion of the best performing strategies are the main topics discussed.

One such challenge is the requirement of energy efficiency in the Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) protocols. Although traditional ARQ protocols are optimized for a better throughput, they fail to minimize the energy consumption. In some applications in sensor networks, delay can be tolerated. Using this aspect, we propose a link quality aware ARQ (LQ-ARQ) protocol which only retransmits packets from a buffer when the link from the sender to the receiver is relatively good. The link quality is judged by checking the Received Signal Strength (RSS) of the data packets, thus no extra overhead is introduced. To avoid using an inflexible threshold of RSS to judge a good or bad link, which is hard to decide in practise, we propose a machine learning mechanism to decide the threshold softly depending on link quality. Our protocol is able to deliver packets reliably with least amount of retransmissions. Thus energy consumption is reduced. Moreover, usage of limited resources such as memory is minimized in the protocol. We compared our protocol with traditional ARQ protocols with real field experimental data. Results show significant improvements.	[Guo, Cheng; Prasad, R.

A variety of in silico models have been reported to aid in the identification of compounds blocking the human ether-a-go-go related gene channel. Herein, we present a classification approach for the detection of diverse human ether-a-go-go related gene blockers that combines cluster analysis of training data, feature selection and support vector machine learning. Compound learning sets are first divided into clusters of similar molecules. For each cluster, independent support vector machine models are generated utilizing preselected MACCS structural keys as descriptors. These models are combined to predict human ether-a-go-go related gene inhibition of our large compound data set with consistent experimental measurements (i.e. only patch clamp measurements on mammalian cell lines). Our combined support vector machine model achieves a prediction accuracy of 85% on this data set and performs better than alternative methods used for comparison.

Predicting Ligand Interactions with ABC Transporters in ADME	CHEMISTRY & BIODIVERSITY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th LogP Symposium 2009	FEB 08-11, 2009	Zurich, SWITZERLAND		Swiss Fed Inst Technol		RESISTANCE P-GLYCOPROTEIN; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANCE; SUBSTRATE RECOGNITION; TRANSMEMBRANE DOMAINS; PHARMACOPHORE MODEL; BOUND STATE; CLASSIFICATION; INHIBITORS; BINDING; MSBA	ABC-type drug efflux pumps, e.g., ABCB1 (= P-glycoprotein, =MDR1), ABCC1 (=MRP1), and ABCG2 (=MXR, =BCRP), confer a multi-drug resistance (MDR) phenotype to cancer cells. Furthermore, the important contribution of ABC transporters for bioavailability, distribution, elimination, and blood-brain barrier permeation of drug candidates is increasingly recognized. This review presents an overview on the different computational methods and models pursued to predict ABC transporter substrate properties of drug-like compounds. They encompass ligand-based approaches ranging from 'simple rule'-based efforts to sophisticated machine learning methods. Many of these models show excellent performance for the data sets used. However, due to the complex nature of the applied methods, useful interpretation of the models that can be directly translated into chemical structures by the medicinal chemist is rather difficult. Additionally, very recent and promising attempts in the field of structure-based modeling of ABC transporters, which embody homology modeling as well as recently published X-ray structures of murine ABCB1, will be discussed.

Distinguishing Informational and Conversational Questions in Social Q&A Sites	CHI2009: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 27TH ANNUAL CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS, VOLS 1-4			English	Proceedings Paper	27th Annual CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems	APR 04-09, 2009	Boston, MA	ACM SIGCHI, Autodesk, Google, Microsoft, NSF, eLearn Magazine, interations, Yahoo		Q&A; online community; machine learning		Tens of thousands of questions are asked and answered every day on social question and answer (Q&A) Web sites such as Yahoo Answers. While these sites generate an enormous volume of searchable data, the problem of determining which questions and answers are archival quality has grown. One major component of this problem is the prevalence of conversational questions, identified both by Q&A sites and academic literature as questions that are intended simply to 'start discussion. For example, a conversational question such as "do you believe in evolution?" might successfully engage users in discussion, but probably will not yield a useful web page for users searching for information about evolution. Using data from three popular Q&A sites, we confirm that humans can reliably distinguish between these conversational questions and other informational questions, and present evidence that conversational questions typically have much lower potential archival value than informational questions. Further, we explore the use of machine learning techniques to automatically classify questions as conversational or informational, learning in the process about categorical, linguistic, and social differences between different question types. Our algorithms approach human performance, attaining 89.7% classification accuracy in our experiments.	[Harper, F.

They allow a user to understand why an application is behaving a certain way, and to change its behavior. Because of their importance to end users, they must be addressed at an interface level. However, often the sensors or machine learning systems that users need to understand and control are created long before a. specific application is built, or created separately from the application interface. Thus, supporting interface designers in building intelligibility and control into interfaces requires application logic and underlying infrastructure to be exposed in some structured fashion. As context-aware infrastructures do not provide generalized support for this, we extended one such infrastructure with Situations, components that appropriately exposes application logic, and supports debugging and simple intelligibility and control interfaces, while making it easier for an application. developer to build context-aware applications and facilitating designer access to application state and behavior. We developed support for interface designers in Visual Basic and Flash. We demonstrate the usefulness of this support through an evaluation of programmers, an evaluation of the usability of the new infrastructure with interface designers, and the augmentation of three common context-aware applications.

EnsembleMatrix: Interactive Visualization to Support Machine Learning with Multiple Classifiers	CHI2009: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 27TH ANNUAL CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS, VOLS 1-4			English	Proceedings Paper	27th Annual CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems	APR 04-09, 2009	Boston, MA	ACM SIGCHI, Autodesk, Google, Microsoft, NSF, eLearn Magazine, interations, Yahoo		Visualization; interactive machine learning; ensemble classifiers; object recognition; Caltech-101		Machine learning is an increasingly used computational tool within human-computer interaction research. While most researchers currently utilize an iterative approach to refining classifier models and performance, we propose that ensemble classification techniques may be a viable and even preferable alternative. In ensemble learning, algorithms combine multiple classifiers to build one that is superior to its components. In this paper, we present EnsembleMatrix, an interactive visualization system that presents a graphical view of confusion matrices to help users understand relative merits of various classifiers. EnsembleMatrix allows users to directly interact with the visualizations in order to explore and build combination models. We evaluate the efficacy of the system and the approach in a user study.

Such lack of system intelligibility can lead to loss of user trust, satisfaction and acceptance of these systems. However, automatically providing explanations about a system's decision process can help mitigate this problem. In this paper we present results from a controlled study with over 200 participants in which the effectiveness of different types of explanations was examined. Participants were shown examples of a system's operation along with various automatically generated explanations, and then tested on their understanding of the system. We show, for example, that explanations describing why the system behaved a certain way resulted in better understanding and stronger feelings of trust. Explanations describing why the system did not behave a certain way, resulted in lower understanding yet adequate performance. We discuss implications for the use of our findings in real-world context-aware applications.

This paper presents a comparison of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees (DT) in an effort to identify potentiators of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), compounds that have potential as novel treatments against schizophrenia. When training and testing each of the three techniques on the same dataset enrichments of 61, 64, and 43 were obtained and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.77, 0.78, and 0.63 was determined for ANNs, SVMs, and DTs, respectively. For the top percentile of predicted active compounds, the true positives for all three methods were highly similar, while the inactives were diverse offering the potential use of jury approaches to improve prediction accuracy.

The proposed algorithm is a two phase algorithm which combines an Artificial Bee Colony Optimization algorithm for the solution of the feature selection problem and a GRASP algorithm for the solution of the clustering problem. As the feature selection problem is a discrete problem, a modification of the initially proposed Artificial Bee Colony optimization algorithm, a Discrete Artificial Bee Colony optimization algorithm, is proposed in this study. The performance of the algorithm is compared with other popular metaheuristic methods like classic genetic algorithms, tabu search, GRASP, ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization and honey bees mating optimization algorithm. In order to assess the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, this methodology is evaluated on datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The high performance of the proposed algorithm is achieved as the algorithm gives very good results and in some instances the percentage of the corrected clustered samples is very high and is larger than 98%.

Unsupervised text classification does not need training data but is often criticized to cluster blindly. Supervised text classification needs large quantities of labeled training data to achieve high accuracy. However, in practice, labeled samples are often difficult, expensive or time consuming to obtain. In the meanwhile, unlabeled documents can be collected easily owing to the rapid developing Internet. Class associated words are the words which represent the subject of classes and provide prior knowledge of classification for training a classifier. A learning algorithm, based on the combination of Expectation-Maximization (EM) and a Naive Bayes classifier, is introduced to classify documents from fully unlabeled documents using class associated words. Experimental results show that it has good classification capability with high accuracy, especially for those categories with small quantities of samples. In the algorithm, class associated words are used to set classification constraints during learning process to restrict to classify documents into corresponding class labels and improve the classification accuracy.

Conformal Predictors are a recently developed set of machine learning algorithms that allow not just risk classification on new patients, but add valid measures of confidence in predictions for individual patients. In this work, we have applied a novel Support Vector Machine (SVM) based conformal prediction framework to predict the risk of complications following a coronary DES procedure. This predictive model helps to risk stratify a patient for post-DES complications, and the valid measures of confidence can be used by the physician to make an informed, evidence-based decision to manage the patient appropriately.

Spatial Projection of Tachycardia Electrograms for Morphology Discrimination in Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators	CINC: 2009 36TH ANNUAL COMPUTERS IN CARDIOLOGY CONFERENCE	Computers in Cardiology Series		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual Computers in Cardiology Conference (CinC 2009)	SEP 13-16, 2009	Pk City, UT	EMB, IEEE, Medtron, CareFus, Biosense Webster, Mortara Instrument, Vitamin Water, Coca-Cola, IBM, GE Healthcare, Forest Pharmaceut Inc, St Jude Med, IOP Publishing, Zoll, Philips Healthcare, SCI - Univ Utah			RHYTHM DISCRIMINATION; ALGORITHM	Discrimination of Ventricular Tachycardia OM from Supra-Ventricular Tachycardia (SVT) remains a major challenge for appropriate therapy delivery in Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs), especially in single chamber devices. We propose here a new discrimination algorithm that analyzes, with a machine learning approach, the morphology of a two-dimensional representation of both afar-field and a near-field ventricular sensing channel. Features extracted from this representation allow comparisons between curves. Thus, arrhythmia discrimination is performed by comparing an arrhythmia curve to a reference curve. A statistical classifier was trained on a private database and tested on the standard Ann Arbor Electrogram Libraries. Our discrimination algorithm demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for VT/SVT discrimination. The requirements of this algorithm make it appropriate for implementation in the simplest ICD system.

Ranking Predictors of Complications following a Drug Eluting Stent Procedure Using Support Vector Machines	CINC: 2009 36TH ANNUAL COMPUTERS IN CARDIOLOGY CONFERENCE	Computers in Cardiology Series		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual Computers in Cardiology Conference (CinC 2009)	SEP 13-16, 2009	Pk City, UT	EMB, IEEE, Medtron, CareFus, Biosense Webster, Mortara Instrument, Vitamin Water, Coca-Cola, IBM, GE Healthcare, Forest Pharmaceut Inc, St Jude Med, IOP Publishing, Zoll, Philips Healthcare, SCI - Univ Utah			OUTCOMES	Predictive and risk stratification models using machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), have been used in cardiology and medicine to improve patient care and prognosis. In this work, we have used SVM based Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) methods to select patient attributes/features relevant to the etio-pathogenesis of complications following a drug eluting stent (DES) procedure. With a high dimensional feature space (145 features, in our case), and comparatively few patients, there is a high risk of 'over-fitting'. Also, for the model to be clinically relevant, the number of patient features need to be reduced to a manageable number, to be used in patient care. SVM-RFE selects subsets of patient features that have maximal influence on the risk of a complication. In our results, when compared with our initial model with all the 145 features, we obtained better performance of the classifiers with 75 top ranked patient features, a 50% reduction in the original dimensionality of the data space. There was a universal improvement in performance of all SVMs with different kernels and parameters. This method of feature ranking helps to determine the most informative patient features. Use of these relevant features improves the prediction of complications following a DES procedure.	[Gouripeddi, R. K.; Balasubramanian, V.

An Electrophysiological Cardiac Model with Applications to Ischemia Detection and Infarction Localization	CINC: 2009 36TH ANNUAL COMPUTERS IN CARDIOLOGY CONFERENCE	Computers in Cardiology Series		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual Computers in Cardiology Conference (CinC 2009)	SEP 13-16, 2009	Pk City, UT	EMB, IEEE, Medtron, CareFus, Biosense Webster, Mortara Instrument, Vitamin Water, Coca-Cola, IBM, GE Healthcare, Forest Pharmaceut Inc, St Jude Med, IOP Publishing, Zoll, Philips Healthcare, SCI - Univ Utah				A novel electrophysiological cardiac model is introduced in this paper. The proposed cardiac model considers six key regions that characterize the cardiac electrical activity. This allows the model to solve the forward and inverse electrocardiology problems in near real time. The proposed cardiac model is used as a basis for two near real time clinical diagnostic applications. The first is the detection of myocardial ischemia. The second is the localization of myocardial infarction. These diagnostic methods use the proposed forward and inverse problem solutions and machine learning approaches to diagnose automatically, noninvasively, and accurately these two serious heart conditions. Moreover, the proposed diagnostic methods have high true positive and negative accuracies suitable to be used in clinical expert systems. The accuracies for the ischemia detection and infarction localization methods are 91% and 68.57%, respectively.	[Mneimneh, M. A.; Povinelli, R.

We introduce a threat model, which represents a specific threat pattern, and a methodology that compiles the threat into a set of rules using machine learning algorithms. This methodology based upon the inductive threat model could be used to classify real-time threats. Further, we calculate the expected utilities of countermeasures which are applicable given a situation, and provide an intelligent command and control agent with the best countermeasure to threats. We present empirical results that demonstrate the agent's capabilities of classifying threats and choosing countermeasures to them in simulated electronic warfare settings.

However, the design, development, evaluation and deployment of context-aware systems are still at its infancy. In this paper, we propose an operational mechanism approach to context acquisition driven by the relevant dependency between users' ongoing activities and context in ubiquitous computing environments. We present a Bayesian model to classify and predict users' activities and associated context that offers more interactive and construed context awareness to users. The model performance is examined in terms of its classification accuracy in predicting users' activities and the associated context trends. The results demonstrate that such probabilistic models can provide an effective and feasible approach to learning and predicting users' context that can yield further the development of deployable context-aware systems.

With the growing popularity of tagging, more and more tags have been collected by a variety of applications. An item may be associated with tags describing its different aspects, such as appearance, functionality, and location. However, little attention has been paid in the organization of tags; in most tagging systems, all the tags associated with an item are listed together regardless of their meanings. When the number of tags becomes large, finding useful information with regards to a certain aspect of an item becomes difficult. Improving the organization of tags in existing tagging systems is thus highly desired. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical approach to organize tags. In our approach, tags are placed into different categories based on their meanings. To find information with respect to a certain aspect of an item, one just needs to refer to its associated tags in the corresponding category. Since existing applications have already collected a large number of tags, manually categorizing all the tags is infeasible. We propose to use data-mining and machine-learning techniques to automatically and rapidly classify tags in tagging systems. A prototype of our approaches has been developed for a real-word tagging system.

We first consider an important class of machine learning algorithms: large margin classifiers, such as Support Vector Machines. The notion of margin complexity quantifies the extent to which a given class of functions can be learned by large margin classifiers. We prove that up to a small multiplicative constant, margin complexity is equal to the inverse of discrepancy. This establishes a strong tie between seemingly very different notions from two distinct areas. In the same way that matrix rigidity is related to rank, we introduce the notion of rigidity of margin complexity. We prove that sign matrices with small margin complexity rigidity are very rare. This leads to the question of proving lower bounds on the rigidity of margin complexity. Quite surprisingly, this question turns out to be closely related to basic open problems in communication complexity, e.g., whether PSPACE can be separated from the polynomial hierarchy in communication complexity. Communication is a key ingredient in many types of learning. This explains the relations between the field of learning theory and that of communication complexity [6, 10, 16, 26].

We survey the research challenges of designing cognitive radio networks for opportunistic spectrum sharing, with the aim of sparking new research interests in this field. We follow a layered approach where PHY and LINK layer functions are classified respectively and associated open research questions are proposed. In our work, firstly various proposed cognitive radio network architectures are reviewed associated with open research questions for each of those network architectures. Secondly, we survey the cognitive radio physical layer functions and propose open research questions at physical layer. Thirdly, we focus on link layer functions of cognitive radio networks and propose the open research questions.

In this paper, a network-based semi-supervised classification method is proposed. Class labels are propagated by combined random-deterministic walking of particles and competition among them. Different from other graph-based methods, our model does not rely on loss function or regularizer. Computer simulations were performed with synthetic and real data, which show that the proposed method can classify arbitrarily distributed data, including linear non-separable data. Moreover, it is much faster due to lower order of complexity and it can achieve better results with few pre-labeled data than other graph based methods.

Statistical Analysis on Microarray Data: Selection of Gene Prognosis Signatures	COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY: ISSUES AND APPLICATIONS IN ONCOLOGY	Applied Bioinformatics and Biostatistics in Cancer Research		English	Article; Book Chapter							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; MULTIPLE CANCER TYPES; EXPRESSION DATA; RANDOM FORESTS; SVM-RFE; CROSS-VALIDATION; BREAST-CANCER; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; DIAGNOSIS	Microarrays are being increasingly used in cancer research for a better understanding of the molecular variations among tumours or other biological conditions. They allow for the measurement of tens of thousands of transcripts simultaneously in one single experiment. The problem of analysing these data sets becomes non-standard and represents a challenge for both statisticians and biologists, as the dimension of the feature space (the number of genes or transcripts) is much greater than the number of tissues. Therefore, the selection of marker genes among thousands to diagnose a cancer type is of crucial importance and can help clinicians to develop gene-expression-based diagnostic tests to guide therapy in cancer patients. In this chapter, we focus on the classification and the prediction of a sample given some carefully chosen gene expression profiles. We review some state-of-the-art machine learning approaches to perform gene selection: recursive feature elimination, nearest-shrunken centroids and random forests. We discuss the difficulties that can be encountered when dealing with microarray data, such as selection bias, multiclass and unbalanced problems. The three approaches are then applied and compared on a typical cancer gene expression study.

During the past ten years, we have developed mathematical models and bioinformatics approaches for deconvolution of positional scanning synthetic combinatorial libraries (PS-SCL). PS-SCL are composed of trillions of peptides systematically arranged in mixtures with defined amino acids at each position. Starting from the mathematical model building to deconvolute the spectrum of PS-SCL, we proposed a biometrical approach using the score matrix to systematically search the protein databases for putative antigenic peptide candidates. We then evaluated of the assumption of independent contribution of the side chains of the amino acids in peptides and applied more sophisticated machine learning algorithms to improve the prediction accuracy based on synthesized peptide data. Finally, we implemented the above approach into a web based tool for searching protein database for T-cell epitopes based on experimental data from PS-SCL with the website employed a strong statistical analysis package, relational database and Java applets.

Data mining is it time and hardware resources consuming process of building analytical models of data. Distribution is often it part of organizations' Structure. Authors propose methodology of distributed data mining by combining local analytical models (build in parallel in nodes of a distributed computer system) into a global one without necessity to construct distributed version of data mining algorithm. Different combining strategies are proposed and their verification method as well. Proposed solutions were tested with data sets coming from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

A Machine Learning Approach to Off-Line Signature Verification Using Bayesian Inference	COMPUTATIONAL FORENSICS, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Workshop on Computational Forensics	AUG 13-14, 2009	The Hague, NETHERLANDS	Univ Amsterdam	Netherlands Forens Inst		TRACKING	A machine learning approach to off-fine signature verification is presented. The prior distributions are determined from genuine and forged signatures of several individuals. The task of signature verification is a problem of determining genuine-class membership of a questioned (test) signature. We, take a, 3-step, writer independent approach: 1) Determine the prior parameter distributions for means of both "genuine vs. genuine" and "forgery vs. known" classes using a distance metric. 2) Enroll n genuine and m. forgery signatures for a particular writer and calculate both the posterior class probabilities for both classes. 3) When evaluating a questioned signature, determine the probabilities for each class and choose the class with bigger probability. By using this approach, performance over other approaches to the same problem is dramatically improved, especially when the number of available signatures for enrollment is small. On the NISDCC dataset, when enrolling 4 genuine signatures, the new method yielded a 12.1% average error rate, a significant improvement over a previously described Bayesian method.

After determining the background color, samples from the image that are representative of the colors to be separated are mapped to a feature space. Given the clusters of samples of either color the support vector machine (SVM) method is used to find an optimal separating line between the clusters in feature space. Deconvolution image processing parameters are determined from the separating line. A number of examples of applications in forensic casework are presented.	[Berger, Charles E.

Although fMRI has been widely used to determine average activation in different brain regions, the problem of automatically decoding the cognitive state from instantaneous brain activations has only recently been investigated. We argue that machine learning might be an effective approach to deal with fMRI image interpretation when data are collected through a free design stimulation protocol. The brain decoding task can be shaped as a classification problem. Given in input the fMRI signal of the brain, a trained model can predict the corresponding cognitive state. This study investigates the use of recurrent neural network to interpret fMRI brain images. We present the results of an empirical analysis on PBAIC data. PBAIC, namely Pittsburgh Brain Activity Interpretation Contest, proposes a brain decoding problem based on free design protocol of stimuli.

This paper proposes a dEA based on IGT. The dEA uses a ring topology,with each population choosing a random individual from it in a migration interval. The individual will be sent to next population and replace the worst individual of the population. It can be seen from the experiment that dEA with Ring transmission can produce better solutions when the population size of a TSP problem is large enough. The numerical results show the utility, versatility, efficiency and potential value of the proposed distributed evolutionary algorithm.

They are non coding RNAs which control gene expression either by translation repression or mRNA degradation. Plants and animals both contain miRNAs which have been classified by wet lab techniques. These techniques are highly expensive, labour intensive and time con. suming. Hence faster and economical computational approaches are needed. In view of above a machine learning model has been developed for classification of plant and animal miRNAs using decision tree classifier. The model has beer tested on available data and it gives results with 91 % accuracy.

In this context we discuss both dynamic team formation among the former, as well as partner selection strategies with the latter type of agent. One-shot, long-term, and (fuzzy-based) flexible formation strategies are compared and contrasted, and experiments described which compare these strategies along dimensions of Agent Search Time and Award Distribution Situation. We find that the flexible formation strategy is best suited to self-interested agents in open, dynamic environments. Agent negotiation among competitive agents is also discussed, in the context of collaborative problem solving. We present a modification to Zhang's Dual Concern Model which enables agents to make reasonable estimates of potential partner behavior during negotiation. Lastly, we introduce a Quadratic Regression approach to partner behavior analysis/estimation, which overcomes some of the limitations of Machine Learning-based approaches.

S	Brahnam, S; Nanni, L		Mumford, CL; Jain, LC		Brahnam, Sheryl; Nanni, Loris			Predicting Trait Impressions of Faces Using Classifier Ensembles	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: COLLABORATION, FUSION AND EMERGENCE	Intelligent Systems Reference Library		English	Article; Book Chapter							PHYSICAL ATTRACTIVENESS; RECOGNITION; IMAGES; PERCEPTION; MODELS	In the experiments presented in this chapter, single classifier systems and ensembles are trained to detect the social meanings people perceive in facial morphology. Exploring machine models of people's impressions of faces has value in the fields of social psychology and human-computer interaction. Our first concern in designing this study was developing a sound ground truth for this problem domain. We accomplished this by collecting a large number of faces that exhibited strong human consensus in a comprehensive set of trait categories. Several single classifier systems and ensemble systems composed of Levenberg-Marquardt neural networks using different methods of collaboration were then trained to match the human perception of the faces in the six trait dimensions of intelligence, maturity, warmth, sociality, dominance, and trustworthiness. Our results show that machine learning methods employing ensembles are as capable as most individual human beings are in their ability to predict the social impressions certain faces make on the average human observer. Single classifier systems did not match human performance as well as the ensembles did. Included in this chapter is a tutorial, suitable for the novice, on the single classifier systems and collaborative methods used in the experiments reported in the study.

We suggest that two factors contribute to this; firstly, that the metaphor has been applied to insufficiently complex domains, and secondly, that isolated mechanisms that occur in the immune system have been used naively and out of context. We outline the properties of domains which may benefit from an immune approach and then describe a number of immune mechanisms and perspectives that are ripe for exploration from a computational perspective. In each of these mechanisms collaboration plays a key role. The concepts are illustrated using two exemplars of practical applications of selected mechanisms from the domains of machine learning and wireless sensor networks. The article suggests that exploiting the collaborations that occur between actors and signals in the immune system will lead to a new generation of engineered systems that are fit for purpose in the same way as their biological counterparts.

Recently it has been shown that integrating a sonar system with an auxiliary array of magnetic sensors can improve the effectiveness of the intruder detection system. One of the major issues that arise from the integrated magnetic and acoustic system is the interpretation of the magnetic signals coming from the sensors. In this paper a machine learning approach is explored for the detection of divers or, in general, of underwater magnetic sources that should ultimately support an automatic detection system which currently requires a human online monitoring or an offline signal processing. The research proposed here, by means of a windowing of the signals, uses Support Vector Machines for classification, as tool for the detection problem. Empirical results show the effectiveness of the method.

We exploit two key relationships among event sequences: their edit distance proximity and state information embedded in event data. We integrate two techniques that employ these relationships to reduce both false positives and false negatives. Our techniques consider event sequences in their entirety, and thus better leverage correlations among events over longer time periods than most other techniques that use small, fixed length sliding windows over such sequences. We employ cluster signatures that minimize adverse effects of noise in anomaly detection, thereby further reducing false positives. We leverage state information in event data to summarize loop structures in sequences which, in turn, leads to better classification of program behavior. We have performed initial validations of these techniques using Asterisk (R), a widely deployed, open source digital PBX.

Stability in clustering may be related to clustering quality or ensemble diversity, and therefore used in several ways to achieve a deeper understanding or better confidence in bioinformatic data analysis. In the specific field of fuzzy biclustering, stability can be analyzed by porting the definition of existing stability indexes to a fuzzy setting, and then adapting them to the biclustering problem. This paper presents work done in this direction, by selecting some representative stability indexes and experimentally verifying and comparing their properties. Experimental results are presented that indicate both a general agreement and some differences among the selected methods.

Mass spectra, however; are high dimensional data and a large number of local maxima. (a.k.a. peaks) have to be analyzed; to tackle this problem we have developed a three-step strategy. After data pre-processing we perform an unsupervised feature selection please aimed at detecting salient parts of the spectra, which could be useful for the subsequent classification phase. The main contribution of the paper is the development of this feature selection and extraction procedure grounded on the theory of multi-scale spaces. Then we use support vector machines for classification. Results obtained by the analysis of a. data, set; of tumor/health samples allowed its to correctly classify more than 95% of samples.

BY adapting NLP corpus annotation methods to the task of knowledge transfer from domain experts, we compensated for the lack of operational definitions of components of the model, such as Serious event. The machine learning depended oil the ticket classes, but it, was not the end goal. Rather, our rule-based document classification determines both the labels of examples and their feature representations. Changes in our Classification of events led to improvements in our model, as reflected ill the AUC scores for the full ranked list of over 51 K structures. The improvements for the very top of the ranked list, which is of most importance for prioritizing work oil the electrical grid, affected one in every four or five structures.

In this paper we present a parallel corpus of 4500 questions in Spanish and English on the touristic domain, obtained from real users. With the aim of training a question answering system, the questions were labeled with the expected answer type, according to two different ontologies. The first, one is, an open domain ontology based on Sekine's Extended Named Entity Hierarchy, while the second one is a restricted domain ontology, specific for the touristic field. Due to the use of two ontologies with different characteristics, we had to solve many problematic cases and adjusted our annotation thinking on the characteristics of each one. We present, the analysis of the domain coverage of these ontologies and the results of the inter-annotator agreement. Finally we use a question classification system to evaluate the labeling of the corpus.	[Boldrini, E.; Ferrandez, S.; Izquierdo, R.; Tornas, D.; Vicedo, J.

We use a syntactic parser, a corpus annotated for proteins, and manual decisions as training material. After automatically parsing the GENIA corpus, which is manually annotated for proteins, all syntactic paths between proteins are extracted. These syntactic paths are manually disambiguated between meaningful paths and irrelevant paths. Meaningful paths are paths that express an interaction between the syntactically connected proteins, irrelevant paths are paths that do not convey any interaction. The resource created by these manual decisions is used in two ways. First, words that appear frequently inside a meaningful paths are learnt using simple machine learning. Second, these resources are applied to the task of automatically detecting interactions between proteins in biomedical literature. We use the IntAct corpus as in application corpus. After detecting proteins in the IntAct texts, we automatically parse them and classify the syntactic paths between them using the meaningful paths from the resource created on GENIA and addressing sparse data problems by shortening the paths based on the words frequently appearing inside the meaningful paths, so-called transparent words. We conduct an evaluation showing that we achieve acceptable recall and good precision, and we discuss the importance of transparent words for the task.

We compare different ways to address the data sparseness problem: using the corpus as the initial seed of a bootstrapping procedure, generalizing classes of relations via the GENIA ontology and generalizing classes via clustering.

We apply these approaches on the discussion topics contained in a corpus of American Congressional speech data. We propose three approaches to classifying opinion at the speech segment level, firstly using similarity measures to the affect, opinion and attitude lexicon, secondly dependency analysis and thirdly SVM machine learning. Further, we study the impact of taking into consideration the Source of opinion and the consistency in the opinion expressed, and propose three methods to classify opinion at the speaker intervention level, showing improvements over the classification of individual text segments. Finally, we propose a method to identify the party the opinion belongs to, through the identification of specific affective and non-affective lexicon used in the argumentations. We present the results obtained when evaluating the different methods we developed, together with a discussion on the issues encountered and some possible solutions. We conclude that, even at a more general level, our approach performs better than trained classifiers on specific data.

The method uses WordNet-based distance metrics to construct a similarity matrix, and expectation maximization to find and represent clusters of semantically-related terms. Using these clusters as features for machine learning helps maintain performance across distinct, domain-specific vocabularies While reducing the size of the document representation. We present promising results along these lines, and evaluate several algorithms and parameters that influence machine learning performance. We discuss limitations of the study and future work for optimizing and evaluating the method.

The conventional robot control consists of methods for path generation and path following. When a robot moves away the estimated path, it must return immediately, and while doing so, the obstacle avoidance behavior and the effectiveness of such a path are not guaranteed. So, motion control is a difficult task, especially in real time and high speed control. This paper describes the use of fuzzy logic control for the low level motion of a soccer robot. Firstly, the modelling of the soccer robot is presented. The soccer robot based on MiroSoT Small Size league is a differential-drive mobile robot with non-slipping and pure-rolling. Then, the design of fuzzy controller is describes. Finally, the computer simulations in MATLAB Simulink show that proposed fuzzy logic controller works well.

Feeding the input of these algorithms with patient diseases data, medical diagnostic decision trees and their corresponding rules are outputted. These rules can be mapped on multithreaded object oriented programs and hardware chips. The programs can simulate the working of the chips and can exhibit the inherent parallelism of the chips design. The circuit of a chip can consist of many blocks, which are operating concurrently for various parts of the whole circuit. Threads and inter-thread communication can be used to simulate the blocks of the chips and the combination of block output signals. The chips and the corresponding parallel programs constitute medical classifiers, which can classify new patient instances. Measures taken from the patients can be fed both into chips and parallel programs and can be recognized according to the classification rules incorporated in the chips and the programs design.

Different machine learning techniques-classification trees, support vector machines and Bayesian networks-were applied with the aim of evaluating and comparing their interpretability and prediction capacities. The predictive capacity of these models for the samples analyzed was highly satisfactory, both for ceramic quality and paper quality. However, Bayesian networks generally proved to be the most useful technique for our study, as this approach combines good predictive capacity with excellent interpretability of the kaolin quality structure, as it graphically represents relationships between variables and facilitates what-if analyses.

Framework type determination relying on the combined information of coordination sequences and vertex symbols is appropriate for crystals with no defects. In this work we present an alternative machine learning model to classify zeolite crystals according to their framework types. The model is based on an eighteen-dimensional feature vector generated from the crystallographic data of zeolite crystals that contains topological, physical-chemical and statistical descriptors. Trained with sufficient known data, this model predicts the framework types of unknown zeolite crystals within 1-2 % error and shows to be better suited when dealing with real zeolite crystals, all of which always have geometrical defects even when the structure is resolved by crystallography.

Feature selection algorithms can be grouped into wrappers and filters: the former use machine learning models to evaluate feature sets, the latter use other criteria to evaluate features individually. We present a new approach to feature selection that combines advantages of both wrapper as well as filter approaches, by using logistic regression and the area, under the ROC curve (AUC) to evaluate pairs of features. After choosing as starting feature the one with the highest individual discriminatory power, we incrementally rank features by choosing as next feature the one that achieves the highest, AUC in combination with an already chosen feature. To evaluate our approach, we compared it to standard filter and wrapper algorithms. Using two data sets from the biomedical domain, we are able to demonstrate that the performance of our approach exceeds that of filter methods, while being comparable to wrapper methods at smaller computational cost.

EKMs have been successfully demonstrated in other machine-learning contexts such as learning sensori-motor control and feedback tasks. Through a quantitative analysis of the algorithmic process, an indirect-mapping EKM can self-organise from a given input space, such as the WSN's external factors, to administer the WSN's routing and clustering functions with a control parameter space. Preliminary results demonstrate indirect mapping with EKMs provide an economical control and feedback mechanism by operating in a continuous sensory control space when compared with direct mapping techniques. By training the control parameter, a faster convergence is made with processes such as the recursive least squares method. The management of a WSN's clustering and routing procedures are enhanced by the co-operation of multiple self-organising EKMs to adapt to actively changing conditions in the environment	[Chaczko, Zenon; Moses, Perez; Chiu, Christopher] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & IT, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia	Chaczko, Z (reprint author), Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & IT, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.	zenon.chaczko@uts.edu.au; zindpm@gmail.com; christopher.chiu@uts.edu.au					Chaczk Z., 2007, P 14 ANN IEEE INT C, P145, DOI 10.1109/ECBS.2007.48; GHOSH J, 2001, OVERVIEW RADIAL BASI, P1; Halkidi M, 2001, J INTELL INF SYST, V17, P107, DOI 10.1023/A:1012801612483; Kaelbling LP, 1996, J ARTIF INTELL RES, V4, P237; Kohonen T., 2000, SELF ORG MAPS; Low KH, 2005, NEURAL COMPUT, V17, P1411, DOI 10.1162/0899766053630378; Low K.H., 2004, 19 NAT C ART INT, P28; Martinetz T M, 1990, IEEE Trans Neural Netw, V1, P131, DOI 10.1109/72.80212; Mill 'an J. del R., 2002, MACH LEARN, P249; POMERLEAU DA, 1991, NEURAL COMPUT, P88; Ritter H., 1986, AIP Conference Proceedings; SHARKEY AJC, 1997, COMBINING DIVERSE NE, P231	12	1	1	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743	978-3-642-04771-8	LECT NOTES COMPUT SC			2009	5717						897	904				8	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BMZ81	WOS:000273999000114

Machine learning has been proven effective in the automatic generation of caricatures. However, the lack of 3D caricature samples makes it challenging to train a good model. This paper addresses this problem by two steps. First, the training set is enlarged by reconstructing 3D caricatures. We reconstruct 3D caricatures based on some 2D caricature samples with a Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based method. Secondly, between the 2D real faces and the enlarged 3D caricatures, a regressive model is learnt by the semi-supervised manifold regularization (MR) method. We then predict 3D caricatures for 2D real faces with the learnt model. The experiments show that our novel approach synthesizes the 3D caricature more effectively than traditional methods. Moreover, our system has been applied successfully in a massive multi-user educational game to provide human-like avatars.

For musical features representation, we propose to adopt a histogram structure in order to preserve a maximum amount of information. The melodic dimension of the data is described in terms of pitch values, pitch intervals, melodic direction and durations of notes as well as silences. Our purpose is to have a data representation well Suited to a generic framework for classifying melodies by means of known supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Since Such algorithms are not expected to handle histogram-based feature values, we propose to transform the representation space in the pattern recognition process. This transformation is realized by partitioning the domain of each attribute using a clustering technique.

People tend to use nicknames to replace the original names. However, the traditional named entity recognition does not perform well on the nickname recognition problem. Thus, we chose the automobile domain and accomplished a whole process of Chinese automobile domain and accomplished a whole process of Chinese automobiles nickname recognition. This paper discusses a new method to tackle the porblem of automobile's nickname recognition in Chinese text. First we have given the nicknames a typical definition. Then we have used methods of machine learning to acquire the probabilities of transition and emission based on our training set. Finally the nicknames are identified through maximum matching on the optimal state sequence. The result revealed that our method can achieve competitive performance in nickname recognition. We got precision 95.2%: recall 91.5% and F-measure 0.9331 on our passages test set. The method will contribute to build a database of nicknames, and could be used in data mining and search engines on automobile domain, etc.	[Wang, Cheng; Yu, Wenyuan; Li, Wenxin; Xu, Zhuoqun] Peking Univ, Key Lab Machine Percept, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China		cici@pku.edu.cn; yuwy@pku.edu.cn; lwx@pku.edu.cn; zqxu@pku.edu.cn					ANDREI M, 1999, P EACL; BICK E, 2004, P 4 INT C LANG RES E; BIKEL D, 1997, MACH LEARN, V34, P211; CHANG JT, 2006, TEXT MINING BIOL BIO, P99; COLLILLS M, 1999, P EMNLP VLC 1999; LIU F, 2006, J CHINESE INFORM PRO; LUO Z, 2001, P INT C CHIN COMP; OKAZAKI N, 2006, P COLING ACL MAIN C; Pierre JM, 2002, LECT NOTES ARTIF INT, V2569, P537; QIN B, SEARCH ENGINE CHINES; SUN X, 2006, LNCS; ZHANG H, 2002, P 7 GRAD C COMP SCI; ZHANG H, 2003, COMPUTATIONAL LINGUI	13	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743	978-3-642-00830-6	LECT NOTES ARTIF INT			2009	5459						68	78				11	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Linguistics; Language & Linguistics	Computer Science; Linguistics	BJD21	WOS:000264880500007

However, the Chinese SRL researchers now focus on the transplant of existing statistical machine learning methods which have been proven to be effective on English. In this paper, we have established a semantic chunking based method which is different from the traditional ones. Semantic chunking is named because of its similarity with syntactic chunking. The difference is that semantic chunking is used to identify the semantic chunks, i.e. the semantic roles. Based on semantic chunking, the process of SRL is changed from "parsing - semantic role identification - semantic role classification", to "semantic chunk identification - semantic chunk classification". With the elimination of the parsing stage, the SRL task can get rid of the dependency on parsing, which is the bottleneck both of speed and precision. The experiments have shown that the semantic chunking based method outperforms previously best-reported results on Chinese SRL and saves a large amount of time.

However, as larger and larger data become acceptable for the current computational machines, trained CRFs Models for a real application quickly inflate. Recently, researchers often have to use models with tens of millions features. This paper considers pruning an existing CRFs model for storage reduction and decoding speedup. We propose a simple but efficient rank metric for feature group rather than features that previous work usually focus on. A series of experiments in two typical labeling tasks, word segmentation and named entity recognition for Chinese, are carried out to check the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results axe quite positive and show that CRFs models are highly redundant, even using carefully selected label set and feature templates.

However, finding topical texts at all appropriate reading level for foreign and second language learners is a challenge for teachers. Existing measures of reading level are not well suited to this task, where students may know some difficult topic-related vocabulary items but not have the same level of sophistication in understanding complex sentence constructions. Recent work in this area has shown the benefit of using statistical language processing techniques. In this paper, we use support vector machines to combine features from n-gram language models, parses, and traditional reading level measures to produce a better method of assessing reading level. We explore the use of negative training data to handle the problem of rejecting data from classes not seen ill training, and compare the use of detection vs. regression models oil this task. As in many language processing problems, we find substantial variability ill human annotation of reading level, and explore ways that multiple human annotations call be used in comparative assessments of system performance.

Therefore, clinicians seek to improve diagnostic procedures, especially those that allow them to reach reliable early diagnoses. In the clinical setting, coronary artery disease diagnostics is typically performed in a stepwise manner. The four diagnostic levels consist of evaluation of (1) signs and symptoms of the disease and ECG (electrocardiogram) at rest, (2) sequential ECG testing during the controlled exercise, (3) myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, and finally (4) coronary angiography, that is considered as the "gold standard" reference method. Our study focuses on improving diagnostic performance of the third diagnostic level. Myocardial scintigraphy is non invasive; it results in a series of medical images that are relatively inexpensively obtained. In clinical practice, these images are manually described (parameterized) by expert physicians. In the paper we present an innovative alternative to manual image evaluation - an automatic image parameterization in multiple resolutions, based on texture description with specialized association rules. Extracted image parameters are combined into more informative composite parameters by means of principle component analysis, and finally used to build automatic classifiers with machine learning methods. Our experiments with synthetic datasets show that association-rule-based multi-resolution image parameterization equals or surpasses other state-of-the-art methods for finding multiple informative resolutions. Experimental results in coronary artery disease diagnostics confirm these results as our approach significantly improves the clinical results in terms of quality of image parameters as well as diagnostic performance.

The traditional approaches do not consider that the instance size can significantly reduce the efficiency of the solution process. We propose a new approach that includes compression methods to transform the original instance into a new one using data mining techniques. The goal of the transformation is to condense the operation access pattern of the original instance to reduce the amount of resources needed to solve the original instance, without significantly reducing the quality of its solution. In order to validate the approach, we tested it proposing two instance compression methods on a new model of the replicated version of the distribution design problem that incorporates generalized database objects. The experimental results show that our approach permits to reduce the computational resources needed for solving large instances by at least 65%, without significantly reducing the quality of its solution. Given the encouraging results, at the moment we are working on the design and implementation or efficient instance compression methods using other data mining techniques.

J	Wojtusiak, J				Wojtusiak, Janusz			THE LEM3 SYSTEM FOR MULTITYPE EVOLUTIONARY OPTIMIZATION	COMPUTING AND INFORMATICS			English	Article						Evolutionary computation; learnable evolution model; machine learning; multitype optimization; representation space		LEM3 is the newest version of the learnable evolution model (LEM), a non-Darwinian evolutionary computation methodology that employs machine learning to guide evolutionary processes. Due to the deep integration of different modes of operation, several novel elements in its algorithm, and the use of the advanced machine learning system AQ21, the LEM3 system is a highly efficient and effective implementation of the methodology. LEM3 is particularly attractive for multitype optimization because it supports, and treats accordingly, different attribute types for describing candidate solutions in the population. These attribute types are nominal, ordinal, structured, cyclic, interval, and ratio. Application to optimization of parameters of a complex system illustrates multitype optimization problem.

Semantic metadata can be created manually or using automated annotation of tagging tools Automated semantic annotation tools with best results are built on various machine learning algorithms which require training sets. Other approach is to use pattern based semantic annotation solutions built on natural language processing, information retrieval or information extraction methods. The paper presents Ontea platform for automated semantic annotation or semantic tagging Implementation based on regular expression patterns is presented with evaluation of results. Extensible architecture for integrating pattern based approaches is presented. Most of existing semi-automatic annotation solutions can not prove it real usage on large scale data such as web or email communication, but semantic web can be exploited only when computer understandable metadata will reach critical mass Thus we also present approach to large scale pattern based annotation.

Covering machine learning, statistics, and operations research (OR), the technology of knowledge discovery now represents a new indispensable tool to assist in intelligent decision making in the highly complex business environment. Recently, OR techniques, e.g., quadratic programming, have extensively applied to data mining problems, such as Vapnik's Support Vector Machine (SVM). In order to deal with complex data analyses, however, knowledge modeling methodology known as Nonaka's SECT Model may help yield a basis for the development of knowledge-rich data mining technology. Since 1998, the author and colleagues extended such a research idea into complex data classification problems via boosting or ensemble learning techniques. The methods differ from single SVM, artificial neural network, and decision tree. The purpose of this paper is to promote the research interests in the connection of OR, knowledge modeling, and data mining as well as real-life applications among the growing computing and informatics communities.

However, most machine learning techniques produce a large number of rules. The consequence is with large number of rules generated, processing time is much longer. This study examines rules of different lengths of attributes in terms of performance based on percentage of accuracy. The research adopts the Knowledge Discovery in Databases "KDD" methodology for analysis and applies various data mining techniques in the experiments. Data of 50 hardware dataset companies which, contains 31 attributes and 400 records have been used. In summary, results show that in terms of performance of rules, Genetic Algorithm has produced the highest number of rules followed by Johnson's Algorithm and Holte's 1R. The best classifier for extracting rules in this study is VOT (Voting of Object Tracking). In terms of performance of rules, best results comes from rules with 30 attributes, followed by rules with 1 intersection attribute and lastly rules with 3 intersection attributes. Among the three sets of attributes, the 3 intersection attributes are considered as the attributes that can be used as predictor attributes.

Recently, there are many research efforts that provide guidelines for protein contact map prediction; these efforts used machine learning approaches such as neural network and distance geometric. One of the approaches to help biologists is applying a software technique. As the consequence there are many categories of tools that have been developed to incorporate this technique. This paper analyses several predicting protein 3D structure tools. These tools are built to help to understand and predict a protein 3D structure. The paper briefly discusses the advantages of these tools; it also, gives the disadvantages of the existing tools, and, finally, talks about the proposed reconstructing a protein 3D tool.

This is proportional to the tremendous increases of its bit/inch(2) storage capacity. With the significantly difficult lithography process will be involved and drastically increase in number of product total output volume that will be required in near future, conventional maintenance type is no longer feasible. This paper proposes a novel framework for the implementation of predictive maintenance in hard disk media production. A novel technique to visualize the temporal data into pattern that can be trained with machine learning algorithm is introduced. Predictive models were produced after dealing with imbalance datasets issue, ensemble datasets and data cleaning. Experimental results have indicated that the proposed framework is successful.

The two forms of analysis are both contrasted and used to complement each other, and a new technique employing the GLM as a pre-processing step for the SVM is presented. The SVM is given the task of classifying the stimulus conditions (tonal or atonal) on the basis of the blood oxygen level-dependent signal of novel data, and the prediction performance is evaluated. In addition, a more detailed assessment of the SVM performance is given in a comparison of the similarity in the identification of voxels relevant to the classification of the SVM and a GLM. A high level of similarity between SVM weight and GLM t-maps demonstrate that the SVM is successfully identifying relevant voxels, and it is this that allows it to perform well in the classification task in spite of very noisy data and stimuli that involve higher-order cognitive functions and considerably inter-subject variation in neural response.

This problem occurs when considering music data. In this paper, we introduce predictive models for melodies. We decompose melodic modelling into two subtasks. We first propose a rhythm model based on the distributions of distances between subsequences. Then, we define a generative model for melodies given chords and rhythms based on modelling sequences of Narmour features. The rhythm model consistently outperforms a standard hidden markov model (HMM) in terms of conditional prediction accuracy on two different music databases. Using a similar evaluation procedure, the proposed melodic model consistently outperforms an input/output HMM. Furthermore, these models are able to generate realistic melodies given appropriate musical contexts.

They have been applied to solve a wide range of machine learning and optimization problems. In this chapter the main AIS-based proposals for solving constrained numerical optimization problems are shown. Although the first works were hybrid solutions partially based on Genetic Algorithms, the most recent proposals are algorithms completely based on immune features. We show that these algorithms represent viable alternatives to the penalty functions and other similar mechanisms to handle constraints in numerical optimization problems.

Even if an accurate solution is found the resulting model may be too complex for a given data and will not generalize well. New types of learning algorithms are needed to extend capabilities of machine learning systems to handle such data. Projection pursuit methods can avoid "curse of dimensionality" by discovering interesting structures in low-dimensional subspace. This paper introduces constructive neural architectures based on projection pursuit techniques that are able to discover simplest models of data with inherent highly complex logical structures. The key principle is to look for transformations that discover interesting structures, going beyond error functions and separability.

Several approaches viz. Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Artificial Intelligence (AI) based machine learning and Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques have extensively and independently been used by various researchers to cater this challenging task. In this work, we propose a Support Vector Machine based kernel learning approach for detection of splice sites (the exon-intron boundary) in a gene. Electron-Ion Interaction Potential (EIIP) values of nucleotides have been used for mapping character sequences to correspending numeric sequences. Radial Basis Function (RBF) SVM kernel is trained using EIIP numeric sequences. Furthermore this wits tested on test gene dataset for detection of splice site by window (of 12 residues) shifting. Optimum values of window size, various important parameters of SVM kernel have been optimized for a better accuracy. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves have been utilized for displaying the sensitivity rate of the classifier and results showed 94.82% accuracy for splice site detection on test dataset.

Classification of Phylogenetic Profiles for Protein Function Prediction: An SVM Approach	CONTEMPORARY COMPUTING, PROCEEDINGS	Communications in Computer and Information Science		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Contemporary Computing	AUG 17-19, 2009	Nioda, INDIA			Protein function prediction; support vector machine; phylogenetic profiles	DATABASE	Predicting the function of an uncharacterized protein is a major challenge in post-genomic era due to problems complexity and scale. Having knowledge of protein function is a crucial link in the development. of new drugs, better crops, and even the development of biochemicals such as biofuels. Recently numerous high-throughput experimental procedures have been invented to investigate the mechanisms leading to the accomplishment of a protein's function and Phylogenetic profile is one of them. Phylogenetic profile is a way of representing a protein which encodes evolutionary history of proteins. Ill this paper we proposed a method for classification of phylogenetic profiles using supervised machine learning method, support vector machine classification along with radial basis function as kernel for identifying functionally linked proteins. We experimentally evaluated the performance of the classifier with the linear kernel, polynomial kernel and compared the results with the existing tree kernel. In our study we have used proteins of the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. We generated the phylogenetic profiles of 2465 yeast genes and for our study we used the functional annotations that; are available in the MIPS database. Our experiments show that the performance of the radial basis kernel is similar to polynomial kernel is some functional classes together are better than linear, tree kernel and over all radial basis kernel outperformed the polynomial kernel, lillear kernel and tree kernel. In analyzing these results we show that it will I)e feasible to make use of SVM classifier with radial basis function as kernel to predict the gene functionality using phylogenetic profiles.

B	Liu, L		Dargie, W		Liu, Lei			Autonomous Machine Learning Networks	CONTEXT-AWARE COMPUTING AND SELF-MANAGING SYSTEMS	Chapman & Hall CRC Studies in Informatics Series		English	Article; Book Chapter								The next generation of internet and wireless networks demand pervasive storage graphs. Storage Intrusion Prevention Systems (SIDSs) are known techniques for identifying attacks. In pervasive un-directional graphs or intensive algebraic operations, victim states in final stages tend to be easily identified within a finite-time horizon by sensing abrupt transitions in system and network state spaces. However, in the early stages of such attacks, these changes are hard to prevent and difficult to distinguish from the usual state fluctuations. Most of the traditional prevention techniques employ parametric model approaches. Recently proposed model-free approximation techniques result in intensive computation. In order to provide autonomy to various large, or hi-h dimensional state spaces, we divide the problem of attack classification into two parts: class prediction problems and cluster prediction problems. We propose a formal model-free prevention technique. Also, we propose using an autonomous utility frame-work in combination with a programable architecture, a set of algorithms and optimization methods which are grounded from Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Dynamic Programming (DP) techniques to tune prevention networks. We propose an autonomous learning network adjusted by the RL algorithms for stochastic intrusion environments in order to derive optimization procedures. Such procedures optimize policies and reduce time and space complexity within large prevention spaces. Moreover, we use attribute and instance selection for data reduction of pervasive learning samples. In numeric and information evaluation, we present convergency analysis and error estimation. Finally, experimental results with autonomic tuning learning methods for large datasets show the effectiveness of proposed approach.

In this view, decision making, control, and planning are all considered as an inference or (alternately) an information processing problem, i.e., a problem of computing a posterior distribution over unknown variables conditioned on the available information (targets, goals, constraints). Further, problems of adaptation and learning are formulated as statistical learning problems to model the dependencies between variables. This approach naturally extends to cases when information is missing, e.g., when the context or load needs to be inferred from interaction; or to the case of apprentice learning where, crucially, latent properties of the observed behavior are learnt rather than the motion copied directly. With this account, we hope to address the long-standing problem of designing adaptive control and planning systems that can flexibly be coupled to multiple sources of information (be they of purely sensory nature of higher-level modulations such as task and constraint information) and equally formulated on any level of abstraction (motor control variables or symbolic representations). Recent advances in Machine Learning provide a coherent framework for these problems.

The algorithm determines if the payload of a network packet that is about to be processed by a control system is normal or abnormal based on the effect that the packet will have on a variable stored in control system memory. The estimation part of the algorithm uses logistic regression integrated with maximum likelihood estimation in an inductive machine learning process to estimate a series of statistical parameters; these parameters are used in conjunction with logistic regression formulas to form a probability mass function for each variable stored in control system memory. The inspection part of the algorithm uses the probability mass functions to estimate the normalcy probability of a specific value that a network packet writes to a variable. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm is very effective at detecting anomalies in process control networks.								Cardenas A.

This gives rise to different granularities of proofs, depending on the intended audience and the context in which the proof is presented. We have developed a mechanism to classify whether proof steps of different sizes are appropriate in a tutoring context. The necessary knowledge is learnt from expert tutors via standard machine learning techniques from annotated examples. We discuss the ongoing evaluation of our approach via empirical studies.

In this context in silico was chosen as designation to emphasize the relationship to in vitro and in vivo testing. Nowadays, virtual screening covers much more than estimation of solubility and oral bioavailability of compounds. Along with the challenge of parsing virtual compound libraries, the necessity to model more specific metabolic and toxicological aspects has emerged. Here, recent developments in prediction models are summarized, covering optimization problems in the fields of cytochrome P450 metabolism, blood-brain-barrier permeability, central nervous system activity, and blockade of the hERG-potassium channel. Aspects arising from the use of homology models and quantum chemical calculations are considered with respect to the biological functions. Furthermore, approaches to distinguish drug-like substances from nondrugs by the means of machine learning algorithms are compared in order to derive guidelines for the design of new agents with appropriate properties.

Whereas, in traditional machine learning area, data sets are classified only by prior knowledge. Some works combine the above two classification principle to overcome the defaults of each approach. In this paper, we propose a model to incorporate the nonlinear knowledge into KMCLP in order to solve the problem when input consists of not only training example, but also nonlinear prior knowledge. In dealing with real world case breast cancer diagnosis, the model shows its better performance than the model solely based on training data.

The distance range between interface residues in protein complex is one of interface features. Three machine learning approaches, known as Multiple Criteria Quadratic Programming (MCQP), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) (SPSS 2004) and Decision Tree based See5 (Quinlan 2003), are used to predict the distance range between interface residues in antigen-antibody complex. It is explored that how different Surface patch size affects the accuracy of different distance range. The results of three approaches are compared with each other.

Typical image compression algorithms first transform the image from its spatial domain representation to frequency domain representation using some transform technique, such as Discrete Cosine Transform and Discrete Wavelet Transform, and then code the transformed values. Recently, instead of performing a frequency transformation, machine learning based approach has been proposed which uses the color information from a few representative pixels to learn a model which predicts color on the rest of the pixels. Selecting the most representative pixels is essentially an active learning problem, while colorization is a semi-supervised learning problem. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning algorithm, called Graph Regularized Experimental Design (GRED), which shares the same principle of the semi-supervised learning algorithm used for colorization. This way, active and semi-supervised learning is unified into a single framework for pixel selection and colorization. Our experimental results suggest that the proposed approach achieves higher compression ratio and image quality while the compression time is significantly reduced.

Their extension to the multi-class problem is usually obtained by repeatedly solving a set of binary problems. Additionally many of these methods do not scale very well with respect to a large number of unlabeled samples, which limits their applications to large-scale problems with many classes and unlabeled samples. In this paper, we directly address the multi-class semi-supervised learning problem by an efficient boosting method. In particular we introduce a new multi-class margin-maximizing loss function for the unlabeled data and use the generalized expectation regularization for incorporating cluster priors into the model. Our approach enables efficient usage of very large data sets. The performance and efficiency of our method is demonstrated on both standard machine learning data sets as well as on challenging object categorization tasks.

In cases where there is a degree of conditional independence between such views, a class of semi-supervised learning techniques that are based on maximizing view agreement over unlabeled data has been proven successful in a wide range of machine learning domains. However, these 'co-training' or 'multi-view' learning methods have had relatively limited application in vision, due in part to the assumption of constant per-channel noise models. In this paper we propose a probabilistic heteroscedastic approach to co-training that simultaneously discovers the amount of noise on a per-sample basis, while solving the classification task. This results in high performance in the presence of occlusion or other complex observation noise processes. We demonstrate our approach in two domains, multi-view object recognition from low-fidelity sensor networks and audio-visual classification.	[Christoudias, C.

Applying this learning to cooperative multi-agent systems not only allows each individual agent to learn from its own experience, but also offers the opportunity for the individual agents to learn from the other agents in the system so the speed of learning can be accelerated. In the proposed learning algorithm, an agent adapts to comply with its peers by learning carefully when it obtains a positive reinforcement feedback signal, but should learn more aggressively if a negative reward follows the action just taken. These two properties are applied to develop the proposed cooperative learning method. This research presents the novel use of the fastest policy hill-climbing methods of Win or Lose Fast (WoLF) with policy-sharing. Results from the multi-agent cooperative domain illustrate that the proposed algorithms perform better than Q-learning alone in a piano mover environment. It also demonstrates that agents can learn to accomplish a task together efficiently through repetitive trials.

Traditionally, complex convolution based lithography simulations are used to estimate areas of high variability. These methods are slow and infeasible for large scale full chip analysis. This work proposes a solution to this problem by using machine learning techniques to identify layout areas that are more prone to variability. A novel target layout representation is proposed, and the latest support vector machine (SVM) algorithms are used to detect variability within standard cells and between cells in a simulated full chip layout.

This allows the application of a well-understood parametric reduction technique to generate compact mask model. Since this model is based on the first principle, it naturally includes diffraction and couplings, important effects that are poorly handled by the existing heuristic mask models. Further more, the new mask model offers the capability to make a smooth trade-off between accuracy and speed.

J	Wong, TL; Lam, W				Wong, Tak-Lam; Lam, Wai			An unsupervised method for joint information extraction and feature mining across different Web sites	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Text mining; Web mining; Machine learning; Graphical models	SYSTEMS	We develop an unsupervised learning framework which can jointly extract information and conduct feature mining from a set of Web pages across different sites. One characteristic of our model is that it allows tight interactions between the tasks of information extraction and feature mining. Decisions for both tasks can be made in a coherent manner leading to solutions which satisfy both tasks and eliminate potential conflicts at the same time. Our approach is based on an undirected graphical model which can model the interdependence between the text fragments within the same Web page, as well as text fragments in different Web pages. Web pages across different sites are considered simultaneously and hence information from different sources can be effectively leveraged. An approximate learning algorithm is developed to conduct inference over the graphical model to tackle the information extraction and feature mining tasks. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework by applying it to two applications, namely, important product feature mining from vendor sites, and hot item feature mining from auction sites. Extensive experiments on real-world data have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Privacy-Preserving Clustering with High Accuracy and Low Time Complexity	DATABASE SYSTEMS FOR ADVANCED APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	14th International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications	APR 21-23, 2009	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA	Australian Res Council, Res Network Enterprise Informat Infrastruct, Australian Res Council, Res Network Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks & Informat Proc, Australia Informat & Commun Technol Ctr Excellence, Res Network Secure Australia, Univ Melbourne Australia, Univ New S Wales, Univ Sydney, Univ Queensland				This paper proposes an efficient solution with high accuracy to the problem of privacy-preserving clustering. This problem has been studied mainly using two approaches: data perturbation and secure multiparty computation. In our research, we focus on the data perturbation approach, and propose an algorithm of linear time complexity based on 1-d clustering to perturb the data. Performance study on real datasets from the UCI machine learning repository shows that our approach reaches better accuracy and hence lowers the distortion of clustering result than previous approaches.

As a novel contribution, we consider explicitly the information about the user experience into a design flow which aims at minimizing the workload variance; this allows the system to better adapt to different types of user needs and workload variations. More specifically, we first collect various user traces from various applications and generate specific clusters using machine learning techniques. For each cluster of such user traces, depending on the architectural parameters extracted from high-level specifications, we propose an optimization method to generate the NoC system architecture. Finally, we validate the user-centric design space exploration using realistic traces and compare it to the traditional NoC design methodology.

The proposed technique uses machine learning techniques instead of traditional cause-effect and/or effect-cause analysis. The proposed technique has several advantages over traditional diagnosis methods, especially for volume diagnosis. In the proposed method, since the time consuming diagnosis process is reduced to merely evaluating several decision functions, run time complexity is much lower than traditional diagnosis methods. The proposed technique can provide not only high resolution diagnosis but also statistical data by classifying defective chips according to locations of their defects. Even with highly compressed output responses, the proposed diagnosis technique can correctly locate defect locations for most defective chips. The proposed technique correctly located defects for more than 90% (86%) defective chips at 50x (100x) output compaction. Run time for diagnosing a single simulated defect chip was only tens of milli-seconds.

This is achieved by sampling a non-parametric estimate of the joint probability density function of measurements and performances. Our case study is an ultra-high frequency receiver front-end and the focus of the paper is to learn the mapping between a low-cost test measurement pattern and a single pass/fail test decision which reflects compliance to all performances. The small fraction of devices for which such a test decision is prone to error Are identified and retested through standard specification-based test. The mapping can be set to explore thoroughly the trade-off between test escapes, yield loss, and percentage of retested devices.

The domain knowledge we consider is that the input space lies inside of a specified convex polytope. First, we consider prior knowledge about the domain by incorporating upper and lower bounds of attributes. We then consider a more general framework that allows us to encode prior knowledge in the form of linear constraints formed by attributes. By using the ellipsoid method from optimization literature, we show that, this can be exploited to upper bound the radius of the hyper-sphere that contains the input space, and enables us to tighten generalization error bounds. We provide a comparative numerical analysis and show the effectiveness of our approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

S	Hoppe, F; Sommer, G		Liu, D; Wang, L; Tan, KC		Hoppe, Florian; Sommer, Gerald			Learning of Hierarchical Perception-Action Cycles	DESIGN AND CONTROL OF INTELLIGENT ROBOTIC SYSTEMS	Studies in Computational Intelligence		English	Article; Book Chapter							IMITATION; ROBOTS	To ease the development of artificial cognitive systems, a new software architecture is proposed in this chapter. It makes extensive use of machine learning techniques that handle data of different degrees of abstraction. The architecture is a hierarchical structure of multiple modules that realize nested feedback cycles. Data that represents the perceptions of the system is sent from the lower to the higher levels. In the other direction action commands are fed back. These perception-action cycles run at different speed and with different types of data. This allows that the lowest levels can control the actuators in a reactive manner based on frequently acquired continuous sensor data. On the other hand the higher levels can handle long-term goals represented with abstract data types. Applying incremental learning techniques makes it possible to realize a visual guided robotic system that can adapt its abilities to changes of the environment. This chapter presents the overview of a robotic system that is programmed according to the above outlined principles. Its task is to learn to solve a shape-sorter puzzle which contains blocks of different shapes and colors and a plate with appropriately shaped holes. The system comprises a 6 DOF robot arm and two video cameras. Two learning tasks of the system are explained in detail. One is solved by a module from the lower level that has to drive the robot arm guided by visual feedback. It demonstrates that variations of the camera position can robustly be compensated by the system. The other module that is presented works on the highest level and is responsible to generate a correct sequence of basic actions to solve the puzzle. It uses a new machine learning technique and a special coding scheme that allows to learn an equivalent of a finite state automaton. This automaton represents the strategy to solve the puzzle game. The performance of both modules is demonstrated with experiments.

Optimal Model Selection of Support Vector Classifiers for Rolling Element Bearings Fault Detection Using Statistical Time-Domain Features	DETC 2008: PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATIONAL IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, VOL 3, PTS A AND B: 28TH COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences/Computers and Information in Engineering Conference	AUG 03-06, 2008	New York, NY	ASME, Design Engn Div, ASME, Comp & Informat Engn Div		SVMs; Feature; Normal; Fault; Kernel Functions; Error estimation	LIFE PREDICTION; SMO ALGORITHM; MACHINES; CLASSIFICATION; DIAGNOSTICS	Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are being used extensively now days in the arena of pattern recognition and regression analysis. It has become a good choice for machine learning both for supervised and unsupervised learning purposes. The SVM is primarily based on the mapping the data to a hyperplane using some kernel function and then increasing the margin between the hype planes so this hyperplane classifies the data in the normal and fault state. Due to large amount of input data, it is computationally cumbersome to yield the desired results in shortest possible time by using SVM. To overcome this difficulty in this work, we have employed statistical Time-Domain Features like Root Mean Square (RMS), Variance, Skewness and Kurtosis as pre-processors to the input raw data. Then various combinations of these time-domains signals and features have been used as inputs and their effects on the optimal model selection have been investigated thoroughly and optimal one has been suggested. The procedure presented here is computational less expensive otherwise to process the input data for model selection we may have to use super computer. The implementation of proposed method for machine teaming is not much complicated and by using this procedure, an impending fault/abnormal behavior of the machine can be detected beforehand.

The distinguishing feature of the mechanism is that it requires very few training cases to extract and generalize knowledge for large classes of problems sharing similar characteristics. The genesis of the mechanism is based on viewing problem (re)-formulation as a statistical pattern extraction problem. SVD is applied as a dimensionality reduction tool to extract semantic patterns from a syntactic formulation of the design problem. We explain and evaluate the mechanism on a model-based decomposition problem, a hydraulic cylinder design problem, and a medium-large scale Aircraft Concept Sizing problem. The results show that the method generalizes quickly and can be used to impute relations between variables, parameters, objective functions, and constraints when training data is provided in symbolic analytical form, and is likely to be extensible to forms when the representation is not in analytical functional form.

We additionally provide two applications of browser identification. First, we show how to extend a network intrusion detection system to detect a broader range of malware. Second, we demonstrate the consequences of web browser identification to the deanonymization of web sites in flow records that have been anonymized.

Containing valuable business information, these systems are highly interesting to attackers and special care needs to be taken to prevent any malicious access to this database layer. In this work we propose a novel approach for modelling SQL statements to apply machine learning techniques, such as clustering or outlier detection, in order to detect malicious behaviour at the database transaction level. The approach incorporates the parse tree structure of SQL queries as characteristic e.g. for correlating SQL queries with applications and distinguishing benign and malicious queries. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach on real-world data.

An Enhanced Statistical Approach to Identifying Photorealistic Images	DIGITAL WATERMARKING	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Workshop on Digital Watermarking	AUG 24-26, 2009	Guildford, ENGLAND	Korea Inst Informat Secur & Cryptog, MarkAny, DataMark Technol, IET, Cyber Secur KTN	Univ Surrey	Moments of Characteristic Functions; Computer graphics classification; boosting		Computer graphics identification has gained importance in digital era as it relates to image forgery detection and enhancement of high photorealistic rendering software. In this paper, statistical moments of I-D and 2-D characteristic functions are employed to derive image features that can well capture the statistical differences between computer graphics and photographic images. YCbCr color system is selected because it; has shown better performance in computer graphics classification than RGB color system and it has been adopted by the most popularly used JPEG images. Furthermore, only Y and Cb color channels are used in feature extraction due to our study showing features derived from Cb and Cr are so highly correlated that no need to use features extracted from both Cb and Cr components, which substantially reduces computational complexity. Concretely, in each selected color component, features are extracted from each image in both image pixel 2-D array and JPEG 2-D array (an 2-D array consisting of the magnitude of JPEG coefficients), their prediction-error 2-D arrays, and all of their three-level wavelet subbands, referred to as various 2-D arrays generated from a given image in this paper. The rationale behind using prediction-error image is to reduce the influence caused by image content. To generate image features from 1-D characteristic functions, the various 2-D arrays of a, given image are the inputs, yielding 156 features in total. For the feature generated from 2-D characteristic functions, only JPEG 2-D array and its prediction-error 2-D array are the inputs, one-unit-apart 2-D histograms of the JPEG 2-D array along the horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions are utilized to generate 2-D characteristic functions, from which the marginal moments are generated to form 234 features. Together, the process then results in 390 features per color channel, and 780 features in total Finally, Boosting Feature Selection (BFS) is used to greatly reduce the dimensionality of features while boosts the machine learning based classification performance to fairly high.

PORTO, LIAADO, sas, CRACS Inescporto LA, YAHOO				Domain adaptation is a fundamental learning problem where one wishes to use labeled data from one or several source domains to learn a hypothesis performing well on a different, yet related, domain for which no labeled data is available. This generalization across domains is a, very significant challenge for many machine learning applications and arises in a variety of natural settings, including NLP tasks (document classification, sentiment analysis, etc.), speech recognition (speakers and noise or environment adaptation) and face recognition (different lighting conditions, different population composition). The learning theory community has only recently started to analyze domain adaptation problems. In the talk, I will overview some recent theoretical models and results regarding domain adaptation. This talk is based on joint works with Mehryar Mohri and Afshin Rostamizadeh.

We present an algorithm which is able to learn regression trees from fast and unbounded data streams in the presence of concept drifts. To our best knowledge there is no other algorithm for incremental learning regression trees equipped with change detection abilities. The FIRT-DD algorithm has mechanisms for drift detection and model adaptation, which enable to maintain accurate and updated regression models at any time. The drift detection mechanism is based on sequential statistical tests that track the evolution of the local error, at each node of the tree, and inform the learning process for the detected changes. As a response to a local drift, the algorithm is able to adapt the model only locally, avoiding the necessity of a global model adaptation. The adaptation strategy consists of building a new tree whenever a change is suspected in the region and replacing the old ones when the new trees become more accurate. This enables smooth and granular adaptation of the global model. The results from the empirical evaluation performed over several different types of drift show that the algorithm has good capability of consistent detection and proper adaptation to concept drifts.

An important ingredient of video games is to challenge players by providing them with tasks of appropriate and increasing difficulty. How this difficulty should be chosen and increase over time strongly depends on the ability, experience, perception and learning curve of each individual player. It is a subjective parameter that is very difficult to set. Wrong choices can easily lead to players stepping to play the game as they get bored (if underburdened) or frustrated (if overburdened). An ideal game should be able to adjust its difficulty dynamically governed by the player's performance. Modern video games utilise a game-testing process to investigate among other factors the perceived difficulty for a multitude of players. In this paper, we investigate how machine learning techniques can be used for automatic difficulty adjustment. Our experiments confirm the potential of machine learning in this application.

This has raised an opportunity for new real life applications of ML methods and also new cutting-edge ML challenges like: tackle with massive databases, Distributed Learning and Privacy-preserving Classification. In this paper a new method capable of dealing with this three problems is presented. The method is based on Artificial Neural Networks with incremental learning and Genetic Algorithms. As Supported by the experimental results, this method is able to fastly obtain an accurate model based on the information of distributed databases without exchanging any data during the training process, without degrading its classification accuracy when compared with other non-distributed classical ML methods. This makes the proposed method very efficient and adequate for Privacy-Preserving Learning applications.

The presence of this failure renders the casting invalid, with the subsequent cost increment. Modelling the foundry process as an expert knowledge cloud allows properly-trained machine learning algorithms to foresee the value of a certain variable, in this case the probability that a microshrinkage appears within a casting. Extending previous research that presented outstanding results with a Bayesian-network-based approach, we have adapted and tested an artificial neural network and the K-nearest neighbour algorithm for the same objective. Finally, we compare the obtained results and show that Bayesian networks are more suitable than the rest of the counterparts for the prediction of microshrinkages.

Indeed, the major thrust of all this research is the perception that escalating costs make the current structure and financing of health care unsustainable. The issue of sustainability is, therefore, the main subject of this paper. As a result, and in order to accomplish this goal, we decided to look to the problem from an user perspective, i.e., the system not only will provide different services, but will be also able to trace the ones more frequently used and to learn about the context in which they happen. As a result, we will have a system that will act and learn according to the preferences and habits of its users, and, simultaneously, will adapt to the environment with the objective of reducing the cost of its practices.

The machine learning paradigm is usually applied to text classification, according to which a general inductive process automatically builds an text classifier from a set of pre-classified documents. In this paper we investigate the application of Bayesian networks to classify MedLine documents, where each document is identified by a set of MeSH ontology terms. Bayesian networks have been selected for their ability to describe conditional independencies between variables and provide clear methodologies for learning from observations. Our experimental evaluation of these ideas is based on the relevance judgments of the 2004 TREC workshop Genomics track.	[Glez-Pena, D.; Lopez, S.; Pavon, R.; Laza, R.; Iglesias, E.

However, different representations and nomenclatures for chemical entities exist, which makes the reference of chemical entities ambiguous. Many systems already exist for gene and protein entity recognition, however very few exist for chemical entities. The main reason for this is the lack of corpus to train named entity recognition systems and perform evaluation. In this paper we present a chemical entity recognizer that uses a machine learning approach based on conditional random fields (CRF) and compare the performance with dictionary-based approaches using several terminological resources. For the training and evaluation, a gold standard of manually curated patent documents was used. While the dictionary-based systems perform well in partial identification of chemical entities, the machine learning approach performs better (10% increase in F-score in comparison to the best dictionary-based system) when identifying complete entities.

Its main problem lies with the burrs. Nowadays, there is a burr elimination task (manual task) subsequent to drilling and previous to riveting that increases manufacturing cost. It is necessary to develop a monitoring system to detect automatically and on-line when the generated burr is Out Of aeronautic limits, and then deburring. This system would reduce holes deburring to the holes which really are out of tolerance limits, focusing in trying to avoid false negatives. The article shows an improvement in buff generation prediction, using Data Mining techniques versus current mathematical model. It gives an overview of the process from data preparation and selection to data analysis (with machine learning algorithms) and evaluation of the models.

Doing so is crucial to ensure the relevance and correctness of the collected data. In this work we unify fault and event detection under a general anomaly detection framework. We use machine learning techniques to classify measurements that resemble a training set as normal and measurements that significantly deviate from that set as anomalies. Furthermore, we aim at an anomaly detection framework that can be implemented on motes, thereby allowing them to continue collecting scientifically-relevant data even in the absence of network connectivity. The general consensus thus far has been that learning-based techniques are too resource intensive to be implemented on mote-class devices. In this paper, we challenge this belief We implement an anomaly detection algorithm using Echo State Networks (ESN), a family of sparse neural networks, on a mote-class device and show that its accuracy is comparable to a PC-based implementation. Furthermore, we show that ESNs detect more faults and have fewer false positives than rule-based fault detection mechanisms. More importantly, while rule-based fault detection algorithms generate false negatives and misclassify events as faults, ESNs are general, correctly identifying a wide variety of anomalies.

However, the implemented techniques differ in their modelling performance, and some consensus methods are needed to reduce the uncertainty of predictions. In this study, we tested the predictive accuracies of five consensus methods, namely Weighted Average (WA), Mean(All), Median(All), Median(PCA), and Best, for 28 threatened plant species. North-eastern Finland, Europe. The spatial distributions of the plant species were forecasted using eight state-of-the-art single-modelling techniques providing an ensemble of predictions. The probability values of occurrence were then combined using five consensus algorithms. The predictive accuracies of the single-model and consensus methods were assessed by computing the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic plot. The mean AUC values varied between 0.697 (classification tree analysis) and 0.813 (random forest) for the single-models, and from 0.757 to 0.850 for the consensus methods. WA and Mean(All) consensus methods provided significantly more robust predictions than all the single-models and the other consensus methods. Consensus methods based on average function algorithms may increase significantly the accuracy of species distribution forecasts, and thus they show considerable promise for different conservation biological and biogeographical applications.

The Web 2.0 (r)evolution has changed the game for personalization, from 'elitary' Web 1.0, written by few and read by many, to web content generated by everyone (user-generated content - UGC), since the role of people has evolved from passive consumers of information to that of active contributors. One of the forms of UGC that has drawn most attention of the research community is folksonomy, a taxonomy generated by users who collaboratively annotate and categorize resources of interests with freely chosen keywords called tags. FIRSt; (Folksonomy-based Item Recommender syStem) is a content-based recommender system developed at, the University of Bari which integrates UGC (through social tagging) in a classic content-based model, letting users express their preferences for items by entering a numerical rating as well as to annotate rated items with free tags. FIRSt is capable of providing recommendations for items in several domains (e.g., movies, music, books), provided that descriptions of items are available as text documents (e.g. plot summaries, reviews, short abstracts). This paper describes the system general architecture and user modeling approach, showing how this recommendation model has been applied to recommend the artworks located at; the Vatican Picture Gallery (Pinacoteca Vaticana), providing users with a personalized museum tour tailored oil their tastes.

Realizing this great need of consumers, several e-commerce web sites such as Amazon.com offer facilities for consumers to review products and exchange their purchase opinions. Unfortunately, reading through the massive amounts of product reviews available online from many e-communities, forums and news groups is not only a tedious task but also an impossible one. Indeed, nowadays Consumers need an effective and reliable method to search through those huge sources of information and sort Out the most appropriate and helpful product reviews. This paper proposes a model to discover the helpfulness of online product reviews. Product reviews can be analyzed and ranked by our scoring system and those reviews that may help consumers better than others will be found. In addition, we compare Our model with a number of machine learning techniques. Our experimental results confirm that our approach is effective in ranking and classifying online product reviews.

In this paper we investigate regularization-based learning strategies to develop suitable algorithms in the domain of image annotation and retrieval, and show how conceptually simple algorithms working on image parts can lead to promising results without any explicit use of domain-specific knowledge. More specifically, as one of the key ingredient of supervised learning is the training set of input-output examples, which we usually lack in real image retrieval scenario, we propose to build automatically the output labels for the image parts by transferring some prior knowledge on the images, such as human-based image tagging. Finally, we focus on a spectral regularization-based learning algorithm which seems to be well suited to cope with the problems related to efficient image retrieval. We discuss its theoretical properties, some implementation issues and show experimental results in the context of content based annotation.

However, if things go wrong, a deeper analysis of process performance becomes necessary. Business analysts want to learn about the factors that influence the performance of business processes and most often contribute to the violation of KPI target values, and how they relate to each other. We provide a framework for performance monitoring and analysis of WS-BPEL processes, which consolidates process events and Quality of Service measurements. The framework uses machine learning techniques in order to construct tree structures, which represent the dependencies of a KPI on process and QoS metrics. These dependency trees allow business analysts to analyze how the process KPIs depend on lower-level process metrics and QoS characterisitics of the IT infrastructure. Deeper knowledge about the structure of dependencies can be gained by drill-down analysis of single factors of influence.

The images were dissected in equal square elements where the features, based on spectral properties of the wavelet transform, were calculated out. The images were discriminated according their features by several machine learning algorithms, based on tree classifiers, function classifiers and lazy classifiers. The results were evaluated and show that tree classifiers allow the best discrimination between CLSM views of benign common nevi and malignant melanoma.

There is a pressing need for music information extraction. To extract useful information from natural language text, we must recognize music named entities first. This paper introduces a hybrid method to identify the Chinese named entities in music domain. Recently, machine learning approaches are frequently used to solve Name Entity Recognition (NER). So our method uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) as the underlying method. Since HMM has innate weaknesses, we incorporate it with rule-based method for pre-processing and post-processing. The combination of machine learning method and rule-based method results in a high precision recognition. And we improve both training and recognizing process of HMM for Music Named Entity Recognition (MNER). In this paper, a novel and convenient Musical Name Entity (MNE) tagging method to generate training data is proposed, which makes HMM method practically usable. In addition, we present an effective method of unknown words tagging in recognition. The experimental results show that our framework brings significant improvements for solving MNER.

The algorithm uses machine learning, and statistical and combinatorial optimization tools to build a tracker that is robust to noise and occlusions. The method is based on a novel energy formulation and its dual use for object localization and segmentation. The energy uses kernel principal component analysis to incorporate shape and appearance constraints of the target object and the background. The energy arising from the procedure is equivalent to an un-normalized density function, thus providing a probabilistic interpretation to the procedure. Mean-shift optimization [4] finds the most probable location of the target object. Graph-cut maximization [3] on the localized object window in the image generates the globally optimal segmentation.

Several sparse representation based classification algorithms have been developed for some applications, for example, face recognition. In this paper, we propose an improved sparse representation based classification algorithm. Firstly, for a discriminative representation, a non-negative constraint of sparse coefficient is added to sparse representation problem. Secondly, Mahalanobis distance is employed instead of Euclidean distance to measure the similarity between original data and reconstructed data. The proposed classification algorithm for face recognition has been evaluated under varying illumination and pose using standard face databases. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of our algorithm is better than that of the up-to-date face recognition algorithm based on sparse representation.

The available data is often noisy and may contain outliers, which requires the application of global optimization. Evolutionary Algorithms (EA's) are one class of possible global optimization methods for solving such problems. Within population based EA's, Differential Evolution (DE) is a widely used and successful algorithm. However, due to its differential update nature, given a current population, the set of possible new populations is finite and a true subset of the cost function domain. Furthermore, the update formula of DE does not use any information about the fitnesses of the population. This paper presents a novel extension of DE called Randomized and Rank based Differential Evolution (R2DE) to improve robustness and global convergence speed on multimodal problems by introducing two multiplicative terms in the DE update formula. The first term is based on a random variate of a Cauchy distribution, which leads to a randomization. The second term is based on ranking of individuals, so that R2DE exploits additional information provided by the fitnesses. In experiments including non-linear dimension reduction by autoencoders, it is shown that R2DE improves robustness and speed of global convergence.

Both fields have their own methods and evaluation procedures. In ML, Support Vector Machines and Parzen Windows are well-known methods that can be used for outlier detection. In KDD, the heuristic local-density estimation methods LOF and LOCI are generally considered to be superior outlier-detection methods. Hitherto, the performances of these ML and KDD methods have not been compared. This paper formalizes LOF and LOCI in the ML framework of one-class classification and performs a comparative evaluation of the ML and KDD outlier-detection methods on real-world datasets. Experimental results show that LOF and SVDD are the two best-performing methods. It is concluded that both fields offer outlier-detection methods that are competitive in performance and that bridging the gap between both fields may facilitate the development of outlier-detection methods.

ECON is a kernelized LARS-like algorithm, by which we mean that ECON uses an l(1) regularization to produce sparse estimators, ECON efficiently rides the regularization path to obtain the estimator associated to any regularization constant values, and ECON represents the data by way of features induced by a feature function. The originality of ECON is that it automatically tunes the parameters of the features while riding the regularization path. So, ECON has the unique ability to produce optimally tuned features for each value of the constant of regularization. We illustrate the remarkable experimental performance of ECON on standard benchmark datasets; we also present a novel application of machine learning in the field of computer graphics, namely the approximation of photometric solids.

However, the choice of propositionalization method may have a significant impact on the performance of the resulting classifier. Six different propositionalization methods are evaluated when used in conjunction with random forests. The empirical evaluation shows that the choice of propositionalization method has a significant impact on the resulting accuracy for structured data sets. The results furthermore show that the maximum frequent itemset approach and a combination of this approach and maximal common substructures turn out to be the most successful propositionalization methods for structured data, each significantly outperforming the four other considered methods.

To address this problem, transfer learning leverages information from (supervised) learning on related tasks to facilitate the current learning task. Self-taught learning uses information extracted from (unsupervised) learning on related data. In this paper, we propose a new method for knowledge extraction, transfer and application in classification. We consider document classification where we mine correlation relationships among the words from a set of documents and compile a collection of correlation relationships as prior knowledge. This knowledge is then applied to generate new features for classifying documents in classes/types different from the ones which we obtain the correlation relationships from. Our experiment results show that the correlation-based knowledge transfer helps to reduce classification errors.

Supervised algorithms based on complex grammatical information achieve state-of-the-art accuracy. However; their generalization on the argument classification task is poorer, as large performance drops in out-of-domain tests showed. In this paper, a robust method based on a minimal set of grammatical features and a distributional model of lexical semantic information is proposed. The achievable generalization ability is studied in several training conditions where negligible performance drops are observed.

Unfortunately, most methods for automating feature selection are designed for supervised learning tasks and are thus either inapplicable or impractical for reinforcement learning. This paper presents a new approach to feature selection specifically designed for the challenges of reinforcement learning. In our method, the agent learns a model, represented as a dynamic Bayesian network, of a factored Markov decision process, deduces a minimal feature set from this network, and efficiently computes a policy on this feature set using dynamic programming methods. Experiments in a stock-trading benchmark task demonstrate that this approach can reliably deduce minimal feature sets and that doing so can substantially improve performance and reduce the computational expense of planning.

These applications include collaborative filtering, information retrieval and ranking components of a system by susceptibility to failure. In this paper, we present an ongoing project to rank the underground primary feeders of New York City's electrical grid according to their susceptibility to outages. We describe our framework and the application of machine learning ranking methods, using scores from Support Vector Machines (SVM), RankBoost and Martingale Boosting. Finally, we present our experimental results and the lessons learned from this challenging real-world application.

Methods and Materials: A large number of plans were generated by varying the DV constraints (input features) on the OARs (multi-plan framework), and the OAR complications in the plans (plan properties) were modeled as a function of the imposed DV constraint settings, which were used as input to machine learning (ML) algorithms. These ML approaches were used to model two OAR complications following head-and-neck and whole pelvis/prostate intensity-modulated radiation therapy, xerostomia and Grade 2 rectal bleeding. Two-fold cross-validation was used for model verification and mean errors were reported. Results: In the head and neck case, the mean absolute prediction error of the saliva flow rate normalized to the pre-treatment saliva flow rate was 0.42% with a 95% confidence interval of [0.41%, 0.43%]. In the whole pelvis/prostate case, an average prediction accuracy of 97.04% with a 95% confidence interval of [96.67%, 97.41%] was achieved for Grade 2 rectal bleeding complications. Conclusion: ML can be used for predicting OAR complications during treatment planning allowing for alternative DV constraint settings to be assessed within the planning framework.

Machine Learning for Intra-Fraction Tumor Motion Modeling with Respiratory Surrogates	EIGHTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING AND APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications	DEC 13-15, 2009	Miami Beach, FL	IEEE SMCS, Cal State Univ, Assoc Machine Learning & Appl, Univ Louisville				Advances in radiation therapy for cancer have made it possible to deliver conformal doses to the tumor while sparing normal healthy tissues. However, one of the difficulties radiation oncologists face is targeting moving tumors, such as those in the lung, which can change position during normal respiration. Tumor motion can be determined by directly monitoring tumor position using continuous x-ray imaging or electromagnetic transponders placed in the tumor that emit a signal. These approaches require potentially unnecessary radiation to the patient or acquisition of expensive technology. Alternatively, one can image the patient intermittently to determine tumor location and external markers placed on the patient's torso. The external surrogates can then be used to determine an inferential model that would determine the tumor position as a function of external surrogates. These external surrogates can be monitored continuously in order to determine the real-time position of the tumor. In this study, we evaluate a machine learning algorithm for inferring intra-fraction tumor motion from external markers using a database of Cyberknife Synchrony (TM) system.

RP is a potentially fatal side effect to treatment. Hence, new methods are needed to guide physicians to prescribe targeted therapy dosage to patients at high risk of RP. Several predictive models based on traditional statistical methods and machine learning techniques have been reported, however, no guidance to variation in performance has not been provided to date. Therefore, in this study, we compare several widely used classification algorithms in the machine learning field are used to distinguish between different risk groups of RP The performance of these classification algorithms is evaluated in conjunction with several feature selection strategy and the impact of the feature selection on performance is further evaluated.

Our previous work has focused on support vector machines (SVM), but we hypothesize that Bayesian networks (BN) can handle missing data better. To test the hypothesis, we trained a BN and SVM model for 2 year survival on 322 lung cancer patients and compared their performance in three separate external datasets (35, 47, 33 patients), each with their own characteristics in terms of missing data. The models used tumor size, clinical T and N stage, involved lymph nodes and WHO performance as prognostic features. We found that the BN model performed better than SVM (AUC 0.77, 0.72. 0.70 vs. 0.71, 0.68, 0.69), especially if tumor size was missing. We conclude that BN models are better suited for the medical domain, as they can handle missing data better.

Support vector machines (SVMs), a statistical machine learning method, have recently been used to build binary-outcome RP prediction models with promising results. In this work, we (1) introduce a feature-ranking selection step to limit complexity in ensemble SVM models (2) show that ensembles of SVMs provide a statistically significant performance improvement in the area under the cross-validated receiver operating curve and (3) apply Platt's tuning to generate probability estimates from the component SVMs in order to augment clinical relevance.

Our approach is based on training expressive singer-specific models and using them to classify new musical fragments interpreted by singers that perform arias from the training set. In this paper we focus on expressive timing variations and build the models by applying machine learning techniques to a body of data consisting of high-level descriptors extracted from audio recordings. The experimental results show evidence that performers can be automatically identified at a rate significantly better than random choice.

Transcribing music audio into chord sequences is essential for harmonic analysis, and would be an important component in content-based retrieval and indexing, but accuracy rates remain fairly low. In this paper, the existing 2008 LabROSA Supervised Chord Recognition System is modified by using different machine learning methods for decoding structural information, thereby achieving significantly superior results. Specifically, the hidden Markov model is replaced by a large margin structured prediction approach (SVMstruct) using an enlarged feature space. Performance is significantly improved by incorporating features from future (but not past) frames. The benefit of SVMstruct increases with the size of the training set, as might be expected when comparing discriminative and generative models. Without yet exploring non-linear kernels, these improvements lead to state-of-the-art performance in chord transcription. The techniques could prove useful in other sequential learning tasks which currently employ HMMs.	[Weller, Adrian; Ellis, Daniel; Jebara, Tony] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA	Weller, A (reprint author), Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.	aw2506@columbia.edu; dpwe@ee.columbia.edu; jebara@cs.columbia.edu					ALTUN Y, ICML 2003; CORTES C, 1995, MACH LEARN, V20, P273, DOI 10.1023/A:1022627411411; Durbin R., 1998, BIOL SEQUENCE ANAL P; ELLIS DPW, P ICASSP 2007; ELLIS DPW, MIREX 2006; Jebara T., 2003, MACHINE LEARNING DIS; KEERTHI SS, CRF VERSUS SVM STRUC; LAFFERTY J, ICML 2001; NG A, NIPS 2001; NGUYEN N, ICML 2007; Rabiner L.R., P IEEE, V77, P257; SHEH A, ISMIR 2003; Tsochantaridis I, 2005, J MACH LEARN RES, V6, P1453; TSOCHANTARIDIS I, ICML 2004; UCHIYAMA Y, AUTOMATED CHORD DETE; Vapnik VN, 1998, STAT LEARNING THEORY	16	0	0	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	LOS ALAMITOS	10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA		978-0-7695-3926-3				2009							590	595		10.1109/ICMLA.2009.132		6	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Computer Science; Engineering	BVC15	WOS:000291011600090

The model produces a ranked list of tens of thousands of manholes in Manhattan, where the ranking criterion is vulnerability to serious events such as fires, explosions and smoking manholes. Con Edison set two goals for the model, namely accuracy and intuitiveness, and this tool made it possible for us to address both of these goals. The tool automatically assembles a "report card or "profile" highlighting data associated with a given manhole. Prior to the processing work that underlies the profiling tool, case studies of a single manhole took several days and resulted in an incomplete study; locating manholes such as those we present in this work would have been extremely difficult. The model is currently assisting Con Edison in determining repair priorities for the secondary electrical grid.

When an electrical feeder is shut down, all network protector switches connected to the feeder should open to isolate the feeder When a switch malfunctions and does not open, electrical current flows into the feeder, which remains energized. This causes the feeder to be "alive" on back-feed current, and maintenance cannot proceed. Our goal is to provide a ranking of network protector switches according to their susceptibility to such malfunction. Such a ranking can assist prioritization of which switches to repair when an ABF event occurs. We compare three methods for computing a ranking: an SVM classification approach, a maximum entropy density estimation approach and an SVM-ranking approach.

Time series data are usually characterized by a high space dimensionality and a very strong correlation among features. This special nature makes the development of effective time series classifiers a challenging task This work proposes and analyzes methods combining spectral decomposition and feature selection for time series classification problems and compares them against methods that work with original time series and time-dependent features. Briefly, our approach first applies discrete cosine transform (DCT) or discrete wavelet transform (DWT) on time series data. Then, it performs supervised feature selection/reduction by selecting only the most discriminative set of coefficients to represent the data. Experimental evaluations, carried out on multiple datasets, demonstrate the benefits of our approach in learning efficient and accurate time series classifiers.

The motivation is to address challenges associated with algorithm scalability, data sparsity and information loss due to the so-called curse of dimensionality. The original high dimensional feature space is randomly projected onto a number of lower-dimensional feature subspaces. Each of these subspaces constitutes the domain of a classification subtask, and is associated with a base learner within an ensemble machine-learner context. Such an ensemble conceptualization is called as random subsample ensemble. Simulation results performed on data sets with up to 20,000 features indicate that the random subsample ensemble classifier performs comparably to other benchmark machine learners based on performance measures of prediction accuracy and cpu time. This finding establishes the feasibility of the ensemble and positions it to tackle classification problems with even much higher dimensional feature spaces.

This article motivates and presents a novel method to learn the reject region on complex data. Observations are replicated and then a single binary classifier determines the decision plane. The proposed method is an extension of a method available in the literature for the classification of ordinal data. Our method is compared with standard techniques on synthetic and real datasets, emphasizing the advantages of the proposed approach.

Plausible Justification Trees are generated for the learning strategies, one of which is correct while the others lead to a mis-learning. The mistake by the student is traced back to either a mistake in the application of the subject knowledge or a mistake in the learnt knowledge. Learnt knowledge mistakes are traced to the inappropriate learning strategy being used. The trace through the wrong choice of learning strategy is 'opened' to the student.

Real-time or even responsiveness requirements cannot be met because it is not possible to perform admission control for new or changing tasks if we cannot tell how their execution affects the other tasks already running. Previously, we proposed a resource-allocation middleware that manages the execution of tasks in a complex distributed system with real-time requirements. The middleware behavior can be modeled depending on the configuration of the tasks running, so that the performance of any given configuration can be calculated. This makes it possible to have admission control in such a system, but the model requires knowledge of run-time parameters. We propose the utilization of machine-learning algorithms to obtain the model parameters, and be able to predict the system performance under any configuration, so that we can provide a full admission control mechanism for complex software systems.

J	Meinshausen, N				Meinshausen, Nicolai			Forest Garrote	ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF STATISTICS			English	Article						Nonnegative Garrote; Random Forests; sparsity; tree ensembles	VARIABLE SELECTION; MODEL SELECTION; REGRESSION; LASSO	Variable selection for high-dimensional linear models has received a lot of attention lately, mostly in the context of l(1)-regularization. Part of the attraction is the variable selection effect: parsimonious models are obtained, which are very suitable for interpretation. In terms of predictive power, however, these regularized linear models are often slightly inferior to machine learning procedures like tree ensembles. Tree ensembles, on the other hand, lack usually a formal way of variable selection and are difficult to visualize. A Garrote-style convex penalty for trees ensembles, in particular Random Forests, is proposed. The penalty selects functional groups of nodes in the trees. These could be as simple as monotone functions of individual predictor variables. This yields a parsimonious function fit, which lends itself easily to visualization and interpretation. The predictive power is maintained at least at the same level as the original tree ensemble. A key feature of the method is that, once a tree ensemble is fitted, no further tuning parameter needs to be selected. The empirical performance is demonstrated on a wide array of datasets.

This definition Sounds quite simple and logical. but when considering the implementation ion of such a service in a real world scenario, it is obvious that it is not possible to evaluate messages. which are generated by thousands of citizens, by hand. Such documents need to be read and analyzed by experts Willi the required in-depth domain knowledge. In order to enable this analysis process and thereby to increase the number of possible e-participation applications, we need to provide these experts with automated analysis tools that cluster, pre-screen and pre-evaluate public opinions and public contributions In this paper we present it framework based on Machine Learning-(ML) and Artificial Intelligence-(Al) techniques that are capable of various analysis mechanisms such as unsupervised clustering of yet unread documents. searching for related concepts within documents and the description of relations between terms. To finish. we show how the proposed framework can be applied to real world data taken front the Austrian e-participation platform mitmache.at.

Statistical Blockade: Estimating Rare Event Statistics for Memories	EMBEDDED MEMORIES FOR NANO-SCALE VLSIS	Integrated Circuits and Systems		English	Article; Book Chapter							GENERALIZED PARETO DISTRIBUTION; FLUCTUATIONS; CIRCUITS	As we move deeper into sub-65 nm technology nodes, uncontrollable random parametric variations have become a critical hurdle for achieving high yield. This problem is particularly crippling for high-replication circuits (HRCs) - circuits like SRAM cells, nonvolatile memory cells, and other memory cells that are replicated millions of times on the same chip - because of aggressive cell design, the requirement of meeting very high >5 sigma levels of yield and the usual higher sensitivity of such circuits to process variations. However, it has proved difficult to even estimate such high yield values efficiently, making it very difficult for designers to adopt an accurate, variation-aware design methodology. This chapter develops a general statistical methodology to estimate parametric memory yields. The keystone of the methodology is a technique is called statistical blockade, which combines Monte Carlo simulation, machine learning, and extreme value theory to simulate very rare failure events and to compute analytical models for the tail distributions of the circuit performance metrics. Several circuit examples are analyzed in detail to enable a deep understanding of the theory and its practical use in a real-world setting. The treatment is directed toward both the memory designer and the EDA engineer.

A linear subspace classifier was generalized to a nonlinear kernel subspace classifier by using a kernel principle component analysis method to constitute nonlinear feature subspaces. Because DNA microarray data have characteristics of high dimension, few samples and strong nonlinearity, three types of classifiers based on kernel machine learning method were designed, i.e., support vector machine (SVM), kernel subspace classifier (KSUB-C) and kernel partial least-squares discriminant analysis (KPLS-DA). But the performances of these classifiers lie on the optimum setting of kernel functions and parameters. Therefore, to avoid the difficulty of selecting optimal kernel functions and parameters and to further improve the accuracy and generalization property of the classifiers, an ensemble classifier based on kernel method for multi-situation DNA microarray data was proposed by adopting the idea of ensemble learning. The ensemble classifier combines the classification results of the SVM, KSUB-C and KPLS-DA classifiers. Experimental results involving three public DNA microarray datasets indicate that the proposed ensemble classifier has high classification accuracy and perfect generalization property.

Different from traditional methods, we focus on a few significant samples rather than all of them. Firstly, three mean-shift procedures are used to seek the local clustering modes corresponding to the regions of nuclei, mature erythrocytes and background respectively. And then a SVM is trained by uniform sampling from three modes in order to find more nuclei pixels. So we could dilate the nuclei regions only in high gradient pixels to get the part pixels of cytoplasm. Finally, we train a new SVM by a training set sampling from cytoplasm and three modes to extract the whole leukocytes. SVM with fixed parameters is used here to yield two classification models via learning by sampling on-line. The segmentation results of the new method are closer to the human visual perception. It can achieve higher accuracy of segmentation in complex scenes and more robust to color confusion and changes. Experiments have demonstrated the validity of the new method compared with the thresholding and the watershed algorithm.

In this paper a Fuzzy-GA wrapper-based constructive induction system is represented. In this model an understandable real-coded GA is employed to construct new features and a fuzzy system is designed to evaluate new constructed features and select more relevant features. This model is applied on a PNN classifier as a learning algorithm and results show that integrating PNN classifier with Fuzzy-GA wrapper-based constructive induction module will improve the effectiveness of the classifier.

When used incrementally, conflict between the concepts already learned and the new events to be learned need be eliminated. This paper presents a new incremental learning scheme that divides induction into two phases: incrementally accurate learning and generalization. The new learning scheme is conflict-free thus it is suitable for incremental induction.

ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL INSTABILITY BY MEANS OF DECISION TREES AND LISTS	EMERGING TOPICS IN MACROECONOMICS			English	Article; Book Chapter						financial stability; Machine Learning; C4.5; PART	BANKING; POLICY	This paper tries to further investigate the factors behind a financial crisis using a large sample of countries in the period 1981 to 1999. Most methods applied in other researches to analyse financial instability are techniques of statistical nature and the variables employed in these models do not usually satisfy statistical assumptions, what complicates the analysis. In order to avoid these inconveniences, we have approached this problem by applying two algorithms coming from the Machine Learning field, the C4.5 and PART algorithms. By means of theses algorithms we will try to analyse the role of a set of macroeconomic and financial variables, both quantitative and qualitative, in explaining banking crises. Results indicate a high performance of the machine learning techniques, what shows that these methods can be a useful tool to evaluate financial instability and a competitive alternative or complement to existing models related with this kind of problems.

We show that the so-called Delaunay refinement technique allows to mesh surfaces and volumes bounded by surfaces, with theoretical guarantees on the quality of the approximation, from a geometrical and a topological point of view. Moreover, it offers extensive control over the size and shape of mesh elements, for instance through a (possibly non-uniform) sizing field. We show how this general paradigm can be adapted to produce anisotropic meshes, i.e. meshes elongated along prescribed directions. Lastly, we discuss extensions to higher dimensions, and especially to space-time for producing time-varying 3D models. This is also of interest when input images are transformed into data points in some higher dimensional space as is common practice in machine learning.

These investigations were done in the USA over three decades from 1978 to 2008. All patients are classified using the global deterioration scale (GDS). The data have been analyzed statistically; we have developed a statistical model for the expected duration of each GDS period. Additionally, we also used several machine learning techniques in order to identify mathematical models that can be used as estimators for the GDS classification.

After a presentation of the "cevenol flash floods", which caused 1.2 billion Euros of economical damages and 22 fatalities in 2002, the difficulties incurred in the forecasting of such events are analyzed, with emphasis on the nature of the database and the origins of measurement noise. The high level of noise in water level measurements raises a real challenge. For this reason, two regularization methods have been investigated and compared: early stopping and weight decay. It appears that regularization by early stopping provides networks with lower complexity and more accurate predicted hydrographs than regularization by weight decay. Satisfactory results can thus be obtained up to a forecasting horizon of three hours, thereby allowing an early warning of the populations.

Error detection and correction must take place at: high speed, and be extremely accurate. Also, different communication channels have different characteristics, and those characteristics may change over time. We show the feasibility of using simple artificial neural Networks to address these problems; and examine tine effect of using different representations of signal waveforms on the accuracy of error correction. The results we have obtained lead us to the conclusion that a machine learning system based oil these principles cart improve on the performance of existing error correction Hardware at the speed required, whilst being able to adapt to suit; the characteristics of different communication channels.

Reducing user fatigue within an interactive evolutionary design system using clustering and case-based reasoning	ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION			English	Article						Machine learning; evolutionary algorithms; conceptual design; software agents	GENETIC ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION; COMPUTATION	User fatigue is a limiting factor in interactive evolutionary design and optimization systems. This work illustrates how user fatigue arising from repetitive evaluations can be reduced by incorporating a case-based machine learning system and by clustering the population. An interactive evolutionary design system for urban furniture design is introduced and used as a test-bed for the implementation. The role of clustering within the system is described and initial results are presented. Results obtained from previous work supporting the choice of a case-based approach to machine learning are then presented and, finally, the results from a multi-user study of the performance of the case-based learning system when applied to the design of urban furniture are included.

More accurately, depending oil the kind of attack it targets, ail NIDS can be oriented to detect misuses (by defining all possible attacks) or anomalies (by modelling legitimate behaviour and detecting those that do not fit on that model). Still, since their problem knowledge is restricted to possible attacks, misuse detection fails to notice anomalies and vice versa. Against this, we present here ESIDE-Depian, the first unified misuse and anomaly prevention system based on Bayesian Networks to analyse completely network packets, and the strategy to create a consistent knowledge model that integrates misuse and anomaly-based knowledge. The training process of the Bayesian network may become intractable very fast in some extreme situations; we present also a method to cope with this problem. Finally, we evaluate ESIDE-Depian against well-known and new attacks showing how it outperforms a well-established industrial NIDS.

Diversity indices provide more information about community composition than simply species richness (i.e., the number of species present); they also take the relative abundances of different species into account. This paper presents DI models obtained from the diatoms abundance in Lake Prespa and correlated with physical-chemical parameters of the environment. Diversity indices have been widely used in ecology to gain better understanding of the biodiversity of an ecosystem. These indices intend to assess the diversity of any population in which each member in a part of unique spices, in our case the diatoms. For modelling of the DIs models we use the raw; as measured, values of the concentrations for the physical-chemical parameters and the diversity indices of the diatoms. The DIs are divided along two dimensions: time and space. The well known machine learning techniques are used to express this relationship: regression trees (RTs). The results from the models express high correlation between the two diversity indices and the temperature. Because these species depends on the temperature, which is expected to rise in the next decades according the climate change models, important decision policy should be implement. More strongly correlation is made with the nutrient loading and this is quite vital, because pressure from the human activities could jeopardize diatoms environmental conditions. This conclusion is important because the diatoms are spices which are known to live in water with low temperature and low level of nutrients. The models have captured this information with correlation between 0.6 and 0.7 for lake measurements, while the models from river stations didn't show any correlation. In future we plan to investigate the relationship between all DIs and physical-chemical parameters together with multi-objective regression trees.

However, the characterization of disease-related antigen-antibody interactions is of enormous complexity. Here, we present a method comprising binding Studies of serum antibody pools to synthetic random peptide libraries, and data analysis of the resulting binding patterns. The analysis can be applied to classic, and predict different groups of individuals and to detect the peptides which best discriminate the investigated groups. As an example, the analysis of antibody repertoire binding patterns of different mice strains and of mice infected with helminth parasites is shown. Due to the design of the library and the sophisticated analysis, the method is able to classify and predict the different mice strains and the infection with very high accuracy and with a very small number of peptides, illustrating the potential of random library screenings in determining molecular markers for diagnosis.

J	Still, S				Still, S.			Information-theoretic approach to interactive learning	EPL			English	Article							STATISTICAL-MECHANICS; COMPLEXITY	The principles of statistical mechanics and information theory play an important role in learning and have inspired both theory and the design of numerous machine learning algorithms. The new aspect in this paper is a focus on integrating feedback from the learner. A quantitative approach to interactive learning and adaptive behavior is proposed, integrating model- and decision-making into one theoretical framework. This paper follows simple principles by requiring that the observer's world model and action policy should result in maximal predictive power at minimal complexity. Classes of optimal action policies and of optimal models are derived from an objective function that reflects this trade-off between prediction and complexity. The resulting optimal models then summarize, at different levels of abstraction, the process's causal organization in the presence of the learner's actions. A fundamental consequence of the proposed principle is that the learner's optimal action policies balance exploration and control as an emerging property. Interestingly, the explorative component is present in the absence of policy randomness, i.e. in the optimal deterministic behavior. This is a direct result of requiring maximal predictive power in the presence of feedback.

One of the reasons is a deficit in understanding where the suggestions come from and how they come. This essentially is not a technical problem, but a technology adoption problem. This situation was also analyzed as a result of former empirical studies conducted on Release Planner (TM), a decision support tool for planning product releases. To overcome this situation, three machine learning techniques have been applied to mine the tool's solutions, and the mining results are presented to the tool users as explanations. This paper presents the evaluation on the generated explanations as a means to improve the user acceptance of the tool. Method. A three-stage controlled experiment was designed and carried out with a group of ten graduate students at the University of Calgary and another group of five project managers from the IT industry. Two research goals were addressed to (i) evaluate the impact of the explanations generated from these three applied techniques, and (ii) compare some of the findings from this study with the ones from our previous experiments. Results: Our findings for the first research goal indicated that the explanations generated from the three techniques contributed to the improvement of the subjects' confidence in the tool solutions and trust Of the tool, and therefore an overall better user acceptance of the tool. Meanwhile, no significant differences were found among the impacts of the three techniques.

Applying Support Vector Regression for Web Effort Estimation using a Cross-Company Dataset	ESEM: 2009 3RD INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND MEASUREMENT	International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement	OCT 15-16, 2009	Lake Buena Vista, FL	Univ SE Calif, Ctr Syst & Software Engn, ABB, Microsoft Res, IEEE, ACMSIGSOFT, N Carolina State Univ Comp Sci			COST ESTIMATION; SOFTWARE; MODELS	Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a new generation of Machine Learning algorithms, suitable for predictive data modeling problems. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of SVR for Web effort estimation, in particular when dealing with a cross-company dataset. To gain a deeper insight on the method, we carried out an empirical study using four kernels for SVR, namely linear, polynomial, Gaussian, and sigmoid. Moreover, we used two variables' preprocessing strategies (normalization and logarithmic), and two different dependent variables (effort and inverse effort). As a result, SVR was applied using six different configurations for each kernel. As for the dataset, we employed the Tukutuku database, which is widely adopted in Web effort estimation studies. A hold-out approach was adopted to evaluate the prediction accuracy for all the configurations, using two training sets, each containing data on 130 projects randomly selected, and two test sets, each containing the remaining 65 projects. As benchmark, SVR-based predictions were also compared to predictions obtained using Manual StepWise Regression, Case-Based Reasoning, and Bayesian Networks. Our results suggest that SVR performed well, since on the first hold-out, the linear kernel with a logarithmic transformation of variables provided significantly superior prediction accuracy than all the other techniques, while for the second hold-out, the Gaussian kernel achieved significantly superior predictions than all other techniques, except for Manual Step Wise Regression.

It proposes an original back-and-forth methodology involving an automatic classification system as well as knowledge of the human experts ( machine learning experts, phoneticians, and pathologists). The goal of this methodology is to bring a better understanding of acoustic phenomena related to dysphonia. The automatic system was validated on a dysphonic corpus ( 80 female voices), rated according to the GRBAS perceptual scale by an expert jury. Firstly, focused on the frequency domain, the classification system showed the interest of 0-3000 Hz frequency band for the classification task based on the GRBAS scale. Later, an automatic phonemic analysis underlined the significance of consonants and more surprisingly of unvoiced consonants for the same classification task. Submitted to the human experts, these observations led to a manual analysis of unvoiced plosives, which highlighted a lengthening of VOT according to the dysphonia severity validated by a preliminary statistical analysis.

This kernel function is itself a support vector machine classifier that is learned statistically from data. We show that the new kernel manages to change the classical methodology of defining a feature vector for each pattern. One will only need to define features representing the similarity between two patterns allowing many details to be captured in a concise way. The new proposed kernel shows very promising results. It opens the door for new feature definitions that could be created in various machine learning problems where similarity between patterns can be formulated more suitably.

Yet, these two disciplines have very different approaches to analyzing these problems. Data mining research incorporates methodologies from various research disciplines such as statistics, machine learning, database technology, optimization and pattern recognition, and hence has a richer pool of knowledge/model representation. On the other hand marketing research urges more theory-based analysis and its theories are often built upon statistics, economics, econometrics and other social sciences. In this paper we propose an approach to integrate and use a data mining methods for solving marketing problems specifically, the area of email marketing.

Its main innovation is the use of logic for simultaneously extracting answer bindings and validating the corresponding answers. In this way the inefficiency of the classical answer extraction/answer validation pipeline is avoided. The prototype of the system, which can be tested on the web, demonstrates response times suitable for real-time querying. Robustness to gaps in the background knowledge and errors of linguistic analysis is achieved by combining the optimized deductive subsystem with shallow techniques by machine learning.

Instead of proving a hypothesis for each answer, RAVE uses logic only for checking if a considered passage supports a correct answer at all. In this way parsing of the answers is avoided, yielding low validation/selection times. Machine learning is used for assigning local validation scores based on logical and shallow features. The subsequent aggregation of these local scores strives to be robust to duplicated information in the support; passages. To achieve this, the effect of aggregation is controlled by the lexical diversity of the support passages for a given answer.

During the last year, our own image analysis system was developed, based on MATLAB. This system extracts a variety of global and local features including histogram, image statistics, Gabor features, fractal dimension, DCT and DWT coefficients, Tamura features and co-occurrence matrix statistics. A classifier based on the k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm is trained on the extracted image feature vectors to determine the IRMA code associated to a given image. The focus of our participation was mainly to test and evaluate this system in-depth and to compare among diverse configuration parameters such as number of images for the relevance feedback to use in the classification module.

Our web-based retrieval system was built using a Ruby on Rails frame, work. Ferret, a Ruby port of Lucene was used to create the full-text based index and search engine. In addition to the textual index of annotations, supervised machine learning techniques using visual features were used to classify the images based on image acquisition modality. Our system provides the user with a number of search options including the ability to limit their search by modality, UMLS-based query expansion, and Natural Language Processing-based techniques. Purely textual runs as well as mixed runs using the purported modality were submitted. We also submitted interactive runs using user specified search options. Although the use of the UMLS metathesaurus increased our recall, our system is geared towards early precision. Consequently, many of our multimodal automatic runs using the custom parser as, well as interactive runs had high early precision including the highest P10 and P30 among the official runs. Our runs also performed well using the bpref metric, a measure that is more robust in the case of incomplete judgments.

The goal of the challenge was to evaluate unsupervised algorithms that; provide morpheme analyses for words in different languages. For morphologically complex languages, such as Finnish, Turkish and Arabic, morpheme analysis is particularly important for lexical modeling of words in speech recognition, information retrieval and machine translation. The evaluation in Morpho Challenge competitions consisted of both a linguistic and an application oriented performance analysis. In addition to the Finnish, Turkish, German and English evaluations performed in Morpho Challenge 2007, the competition this year had an additional evaluation for Arabic. The results in linguistic evaluation in 2008 show that although the level of precision and recall varies substantially between the tasks in different languages; the best methods seem to deal quite well with all languages involved. The results in information retrieval evaluation indicate that the morpheme analysis has a significant effect in all the tested languages (Finnish, English and German). The best unsupervised and language-independent morpheme analysis methods can also rival the best language-dependent word normalization methods. The Morpho Challenge was part of the EU Network of Excellence PASCAL Challenge Program and organized in collaboration with CLEF.

Ideally, these are basic vocabulary units suitable for different tasks, such as text understanding, machine translation, information retrieval (IR), and statistical language modeling. In this paper, we propose to evaluate the morpheme analyses by performing IR, experiments, where the words in the documents and queries are replaced by their proposed morpheme representations and the search is based on morphemes instead of words. In this paper, the evaluations are run for three languages: Finnish, German, and English using the queries, texts, and relevance judgments available in CLEF forum. The results show that the morpheme analysis has a significant; effect in IR performance in all languages, and that the performance of the best unsupervised methods call be superior to the supervised reference methods.

Using an evolutionary algorithm to perform variable selection while searching for non-linear interactions is akin to searching for a needle in a haystack. There is, however, a considerable amount of correlation among variables in biological datasets, such as in microarray or genetic studies. Using the XOR problem, we show that correlation between non-functional and functional variables alters the variable selection fitness landscape by broadening the fitness peak over a wider range of potential input variables. Furthermore, when sub-optimal weights are used, local optima in the variable selection fitness landscape appear centered on each of the two functional variables. These attributes of the fitness landscape may supply building blocks for evolutionary search procedures, and may provide a rationale for conducting a local search for variable selection.

This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of a set of diverse machine learning schemes on a number of biomedical datasets. To this end, we follow a four step evaluation methodology: (1) pre-proccssing the datasets to remove any redundancy, (2) classification of the datasets using six different machine learning algorithms; Naive Bayes (probabilistic), multi-layer perceptron (neural network), SMO (support vector machine), lBk (instance based learner), J48 (decision tree) and RIPPER (rule-based induction), (3) bagging and boosting each algorithm, and (4) combining the best version of each of the base classifiers to make a team of classifiers with stacking and voting techniques. Using this methodology, we have performed experiments on 31 different biomedical datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which such a diverse set of machine learning algorithms are evaluated on so many biomedical datasets. The important outcome of our extensive study is a set of promising guidelines which will help researchers in choosing the best classification scheme for a particular nature of biomedical dataset.

The concept of QSAR has typically been used for drug discovery and development and has gained wide applicability for correlating molecular information with not only biological activities but also with other physicochemical properties, which has therefore been termed quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR). Typical molecular parameters that are used to account for electronic properties, hydrophobicity, steric effects, and topology can be determined empirically through experimentation or theoretically via computational chemistry. A given compilation of data sets is then subjected to data pre-processing and data modeling through the use of statistical and/or machine learning techniques. This review aims to cover the essential concepts and techniques that are relevant for performing QSAR/QSPR studies through the use of selected examples from our previous work.

Our research seeks to identify simple, natural, and prevalent human teaching cues that are useful for directing the attention of robot learners so that robots can learn efficiently and effectively from these interactions. This research goal is significant for several reasons. First, most people do not have expertise in robotics or machine learning techniques. Second, personal robots will have to learn new tasks and skills within the bounds of human attention and patience. Third, people bring a lifetime of experience in learning from and teaching others and naturally do quite a lot to socially structure appropriate learning environment's and interactions so that others can learn efficiently and effectively. Personal robots should be able to leverage theses social interactions to also learn efficiently and effectively from people. The hypothesis that we investigate in this paper concerns the structure of social behavior and embodied interaction that we term "social filters:" dynamic, embodied cues through which the teacher can guide the behavior of the robot by emphasizing and de-emphasizing objects in the environment. Specifically, we con, lecture that action timing and "spatial scaffolding" are two important kinds of social filters - simple, natural, and prevalent non-verbal cues in which teachers time their actions and use their bodies to structure the learning environment to direct the attention of the learner. The challenge is to identify when and how these cues are employed in natural learning settings, and how they can be used by a robot to efficiently guide its internal attention and learning processes.

Metabolically unstable compounds or potential inhibitors of important enzymes should be detected as early as possible. As more compounds are synthesized than can be investigated experimentally, powerful computational methods are needed. Objective: We give an overview of state-of-the-art in-silico methods to predict experimental metabolic endpoints with a focus on the applicability in pharmaceutical industry. A macroscopic as well as a microscopic view of the metabolic fate and the interaction with metabolizing enzymes are given. Methods: Ligand-, protein- and rule-based approaches are presented. Conclusion: Although considerable progress has been made, the results of the calculations still need careful inspection. The domain of applicability of the models as well as methodological limitations have to be taken into account.

The characteristic asymmetric distribution of seismic events and sampling limitations make it difficult to apply the conventional statistical predictive techniques. The paper shows that inductive machine learning techniques such as rough set theory and decision tree (C4.5 algorithm) allows developing knowledge representation structure of seismic activity in term of meaningful decision rules involving premonitory descriptors such as space-time distribution of radon concentration and environmental variables. The both techniques identify significant premonitory variables and rank attributes using information theoretic measures, e. g., entropy and frequency of occurrence in reducts. The cross-validation based on "leave-one-out'' method shows that although the overall predictive and discriminatory performance of decision tree is to some extent better than rough set, the difference is not statistically significant.

Two key problems in. financial time series forecasting are noise and non-stationarity. Here, we assign a higher membership value to data samples that contain more relevant information, where relevance is related to recency in time. The approach requires only a single matrix inversion. For the linear case, the matrix order depends only on the dimension in which the data samples lie, and is independent of the number of samples. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on. financial datasets available in the public domain. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper compares different data processing strategies for NNs for prediction of Boolean function complexity (BFC). We compare NNs' predictive capabilities with (1) no preprocessing (2) scaling the values in different curves based on every curve's own peak and then normalizing to [0,1] range (3) applying z-score to values in all curves and then normalizing to [0,1] range, and (4) logarithmically scaling all curves and then normalizing to [0,1] range. The efficiency of these methods was measured by comparing RMS errors in NN-made BFC predictions for numerous ISCAS benchmark circuits. Logarithmic preprocessing method resulted in the best prediction statistics as compared to other techniques. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Shukla, SK; Tiwari, MK				Shukla, Sanjay Kumar; Tiwari, M. K.			Soft decision trees: A genetically optimized cluster oriented approach	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Decision trees; Fuzzy clustering; Inconsistency index; Genetic algorithm		When descriptions of data values are too detailed, the computational complexities involved in mining useful knowledge from the database generally increases. This gives rise to the need of tools techniques which can reduce these complexities and mine the valuable information hidden behind the database. There exists number of such techniques viz. decision trees, neural networks, rough-set theory, rule induction, and case-based reasoning which are able to meet the aforesaid objective up to some extent. Each of these techniques has its advantages and limitations that motivate researchers to develop new tools for the mining tasks. In this paper, we have developed a novel methodology, genetically optimized cluster oriented soft decision trees (GCSDT), to glean vital information imbedded in the large databases. In contrast to the standard C-fuzzy decision trees, where granules are developed through fuzzy (soft) clustering, in the proposed architecture granules are developed by means of genetically optimized soft clustering. In the GCSDT architecture, GA ameliorates the difficulty of choosing an initialization for the fuzzy clustering algorithm and always avoids degenerate partitions. This provides an effective means for the optimization of clustering criterion, where an objective function can be illustrated in terms of cluster's center. Growth of the GCSDT is realized by expanding nodes of the tree, characterized by the highest inconsistency index of the information granules. In order to validate the proposed tree structure it has been deployed on synthetic and machine learning data sets. Moreover, Results are compared with those produced by standard C4.5 decision trees and C-fuzzy decision trees; further student t-test is applied to show that these differences in results are statistically significant.

J	Li, H; Sun, J; Sun, BL				Li, Hui; Sun, Jie; Sun, Bo-Liang			Financial distress prediction based on OR-CBR in the principle of k-nearest neighbors	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Financial distress prediction; Case-based reasoning; Outranking relations; k-nearest neighbors	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; BANKRUPTCY PREDICTION; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; NEURAL-NETWORK; BUSINESS FAILURE; SIMILARITY; METHODOLOGY; INTEGRATION; PARAMETERS; RATIOS	Financial distress prediction including bankruptcy prediction has called broad attention since 1960s. Various techniques have been employed in this area, ranging from statistical ones such as multiple discriminate analysis (MDA), Logit, etc. to machine learning ones like neural networks (NN), support vector machine (SVM), etc. Case-based reasoning (CBR), which is one of the key methodologies for problem-solving, has not won enough focus in financial distress prediction since 1996. In this study, outranking relations (OR), including strict difference, weak difference, and indifference, between cases on each feature are introduced to build up a new feature-based similarity measure mechanism in the principle of k-nearest neighbors. It is different from traditional distance-based similarity mechanisms and those based on NN, fuzzy set theory, decision tree (DT), etc. Accuracy of the CBR prediction method based on OR, which is called as OR-CBR, is determined directly by such four types of parameters as difference parameter, indifference parameter, veto parameter, and neighbor parameter. It is described in detail that what the model of OR-CBR is from various aspects such as its developed background, formalization of the specific model, and implementation of corresponding algorithm. With three year's real-world data from Chinese listed companies, experimental results indicate that OR-CBR outperforms MDA, Logit, NN, SVM, DT, Basic CBR, and Grey CBR in financial distress prediction, under the assessment of leave-one-out cross-validation and the process of Max normalization. It means that OR-CBR may be a preferred model dealing with financial distress prediction in China. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Li, DC; Fang, YH				Li, Der-Chiang; Fang, Yao-Hwei			A non-linearly virtual sample generation technique using group discovery and parametric equations of hypersphere	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Classification; Parametric equation; Small sample; Virtual sample	SCHEDULING KNOWLEDGE; CLASSIFICATION	In manufacturing systems, only a small training dataset can be obtained in the early stages. A small training dataset usually leads to low learning accuracy with regard to classification of machine learning, and the knowledge derived is often fragile, and this is called the small sample problem. This research mainly aims at overcoming this problem using a special nonlinear classification technique to generate virtual samples to enlarge the training dataset for learning improvement. This research proposes a new sample generation method, named non-linear virtual sample generation (NVSG), which combines a unique group discovery technique and a virtual sample generation method using parametric equations of hypersphere. By applying a back-propagation neural network (BPN) as the learning tool, the computational experiments obtained from the simulated dataset and the real dataset quoted from the Iris Plant Database show that the learning accuracy can be significantly improved using NVSG method for very small training datasets.

The involved SNMP MIB variables are selected by all effective feature selection mechanism and gathered effectively by the MIB update time prediction mechanism. Using MIB and SVM, it achieved fast detection with high accuracy, the minimization of the system burden, and extendibility for system deployment. The intrusion detection mechanism with hierarchical structure setup has two phases, which first distinguishes attack traffic from normal traffic and then determines the type of attacks in detail. Results of the experiment using MIB datasets collected from real experiments involving a DDoS attack demonstrate that it can be an an effective way for intrusion detection.

Besides, when confronted with multiple fault signals, fusion parameters can be dynamically adapted based on principles of fuzzy soft clustering so as to promote immune ability in artificially mechanical systems. The key point in this new approach lies in its power on faults detection, which requires no prior information on the state vectors of the sensors and system behavior, and no supplemental machine learning operation is required. The proposed algorithm combines principles of artificial immune system and the classical technique in fuzzy theory, which will consist of two main portions. In the first part a traditional data fuse structure is constructed, the sensor signals will be fed into it to implement the fuzzy aggregating algorithm.

Evaluation of Different Stages of Dementia Employing Neuropsychological and Machine Learning Techniques	FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED COMPUTING 2009 (ICAC 2009)			English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Advanced Computing	DEC 13-15, 2009	Chennai, INDIA			Dementia; Data Mining; Classification; MMSE; Machine Learning; Neural Networks	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MEMORY; IMPAIRMENT; ACCURACY; BEHAVIOR	Data mining in medicine is an emerging field of high importance for providing prognosis and a deeper understanding of the classification of disease. The proposed system concentrates on the two different cognitive tests for the diagnosis of different stages of dementia. Dementia is considered as the fourth most common disorder among the elderly. Early detection of dementia and correct staging of the severity of dementia is very much required for the further treatment. Machine Learning (ML) and Neural Networks (NN) approaches in data mining finds its applications in various fields, in the present study the applications of ML as well as NN methods used for classifying dementia states to improve accuracy over current dementia screening tools. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) are recommended tools for screening of patients by the Agency for Health Care Policy Research (AHCPR).Both ML and NN methods improve the classification accuracy for MMSE and FAQ. When compared to the accuracy obtained from AHCPR. By combining both the tests along with ML and NN it is observed that the accuracy can be optimized.

Implementation of Incremental Linear Discriminant Analysis using Singular Value Decomposition for Face Recognition	FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED COMPUTING 2009 (ICAC 2009)			English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Advanced Computing	DEC 13-15, 2009	Chennai, INDIA			Face recognition; Incremental Linear Discriminant Analysis (ILDA); Singular value Decomposition (SVD)	LDA	Dimensionality reduction methods have been successfully employed for face recognition. Among the various dimensionality reduction algorithms, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is one of the popular supervised dimensionality reduction methods, and many LDA-based face recognition algorithms/ systems have been reported in the last decade. However, the LDA based face recognition systems suffer from the scalability problem. To overcome this limitation, an incremental approach is usually adopted. Incremental LDA (ILDA) methods have been studied for many years in the statistical and machine-learning community. The major limitation of existing ILDA method is to handle the inverse of the within-class scatter matrix. In view of this limitation, this paper proposes a new ILDA method based on the idea of singular value decomposition (SVD) updating algorithm, namely an SVD updating-based ILDA (ILDA-SVD) algorithm. In the proposed ILDA-SVD algorithm, it is proved that the approximation error is mathematically bounded. The proposed method has been evaluated using available public databases, namely Yale, Yale B and ORL are applied to existing face-recognition algorithms. The proposed methods are successfully applied to face-recognition, and the simulation results on Yale database show that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform other well-known systems in terms of recognition rate.

In practice, many applications require a dimensionality reduction method to deal with the partially labeled problem. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised clustering framework, which is based on feature projection and semi-supervised fuzzy clustering. High dimensional data is mapped into a low dimensional space with feature projection. A mapping of learning data is generalized to a new datum which is classified in the low dimensional space with constrained fuzzy clustering. With the experiment on different datasets, the results show the method has good clustering performance for handling data of high dimensionality.

Ayaka provides a general monitoring method for detecting anomalies using only resource usage information on systems independent of its domain, target application and programming languages. Ayaka modifies the kernel to detect faults and uses a completely application black-box approach based on machine learning methods. It uses the clustering method to quantize the resource usage vector data and learn the normal patterns with Hidden Markov Model. In the running phase, Ayaka finds anomalies by comparing the application resource usage with learned model. The evaluation experiment indicates that our prototype system is able to detect anomalies, such as SQL injection and buffer overrun, without significant overheads.

In such scenario, the input is represented by automatically transcribed spoken requests, possibly affected by transcription errors. Our objective is to demonstrate that, when dealing with sub-optimal (i.e. noisy) inputs, good performance can be easily achieved with a Machine Learning approach based on simple features extracted from unprocessed questions. In contrast to traditional approaches dealing with questions pre-processed at different levels (including lemmatization, part of speech (POS) tagging, and multiword recognition), the advantage of our light weight approach is that extra errors often derived from processing noisy data are avoided.

A semi-automatic approach was conducted for corpus expansion in order to help annotating the dataset with less human effort. This paper shows that our method can achieve good results (more than 80% in term of F1-measure) despite the heterogeneity of our corpus.

There is a need to perceive and recognize the question at a level that permits to detect some constraints that the question imposes on possible answers. The question classification task is used in Question Answering systems. This deduces the type of expected answer, to perform a semantic classification to the target answer. The purpose is to provide additional information to reduce the gap between answer and question to match them. An approach to ameliorate the effectiveness of classifiers focusing on the linguistic analysis (semantic, syntactic and morphological) and statistical approaches guided by a layered semantic hierarchy of fine grained questions types. This work also proposes two methods of questions expansion. The first finds for each word synonyms matching its contextual sense. The second one adds a high representation "hypernym" for the noun. Various representation features of documents, term weighting and diverse machine learning algorithms are studied. Experiments conducted on actual data are presented. Of interest is the improvement in the precision of the classification of questions.

Although Machine learning techniques have been used earlier in many semantic integration approaches, dependence on precision recall curves to preset the weights and thresholds of the learning systems has been a serious bottleneck. By recasting the mapping problem to a classification problem we try to automate this step and develop a robust and extendable meta learning algorithm. The implication is that we can now extend the same method to map the ontology pairs with different similarity measures which might not be specialized for the specific domain, yet obtain results comparable to the state of the art mapping algorithms that exploit machine learning methods. Interestingly we see that as the similarity measures are diluted, our approach performs significantly better for unbalanced classes. We have tested our approach using several similarity measures and two real world ontologies, and the test results we discuss validate our claim. We also present a discussion on the benefits of the proposed meta learning algorithm.

Using Context to Identify Difficult Driving Situations in Unstructured Environments	FOUNDATIONS OF AUGMENTED COGNITION, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Foundation of Augmented Cognition	JUL 19-24, 2009	San Diego, CA					We present a context-based machine-learning approach for identifying difficult driving situations using sensor data that is readily available in commercial vehicles. The goal of this system is improve vehicle safety by alerting drivers to potentially dangerous situations. The context-based approach is a two-step learning process by first performing unsupervised learning to discover meaningful regularities, or "contexts," in the vehicle data and then performing C supervised learning, mapping the current context to a measure of driving difficulty. To validate the benefit of this approach, we collected driving data from a set of experiments involving both on-road and off-road driving tasks in unstructured environments. We demonstrate that context recognition greatly improves the performance of identifying difficult driving situations and show that the driving-difficulty system achieves a human level of performance on cross-validation data.

Experimental Assessment of Accuracy of Automated Knowledge Capture	FOUNDATIONS OF AUGMENTED COGNITION, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Foundation of Augmented Cognition	JUL 19-24, 2009	San Diego, CA			Automated assessment; Naval training systems; simulation-based training; intelligent tutoring systems		The U.S. armed services are widely adopting simulation-based training, largely to reduce costs associated with live training. However simulation-based training still requires a high instructor-to-student ratio which is expensive. Intelligent tutoring systems target this need, but they are often associated with high costs for knowledge engineering and implementation. To reduce these costs, we are investigating the use of machine learning to produce models of expert behavior for automated student assessment. A key concern about the expert modeling approach is whether it can provide accurate assessments on complex tasks of real-world interest. This study evaluates of the accuracy of model-based assessments on a complex task. We trained employees at Sandia National Laboratories on a Navy simulator and then compared their simulation performance to the performance of experts using both automated and manual assessment. Results show that automated assessments were comparable to the manual assessments on three metrics.	[Stevens, Susan M.; Forsythe, J.

Utilizing Secondary Input from Passive Brain-Computer Interfaces for Enhancing Human-Machine Interaction	FOUNDATIONS OF AUGMENTED COGNITION, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Foundation of Augmented Cognition	JUL 19-24, 2009	San Diego, CA				SINGLE-TRIAL EEG; CLASSIFICATION; COMMUNICATION; BCI	A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) directly translates patterns of brain activity to input for controlling a machine. The introduction of methods from statistical machine learning [1] to the field of brain-computer interfacing (BCI) had a deep impact on classification accuracy. It also minimized the effort needed to build up the skill of controlling a BCI system [2]. This enabled other fields of research to adapt methods from BCI research for their own purposes [3, 4]. Team PhyPA, the research group for physiological parameters of the chair for Human-Machine Systems (HMS) of the Technical University of Berlin, focuses on enabling new communication channels for HMS. Especially the use of passive BCIs (pBCI) [3, 4], not dependent on any intended action of the user, show a high potential for enhancing the interaction in HMS (5]. Additionally, as actual classification rates are still below the threshold for efficient primary control [6, 7] in HMS, we focus oil establishing a secondary, BCI-based communication channel. This kind of interaction does not necessarily disturb the primary mode of interaction, providing a low usage cost and hence an efficient way of enhancement. We have designed several applications following this approach. Here we are going to present briefly the results from two studies, which show the capabilities arising from the use of passive and secondary BCI interaction. First, we show that a pBCI call be utilized to gain valuable information about HMSs, which are hard to detect by exogeneous factors. By mimicking a typical BCI interaction, we have been able to identify and isolate a factor inducing non-stationarities with a deep impact on the feature dynamics. The retained information can be utilized for automatically triggered classifier adaptation. And second, we show that pBCIs are indeed capable to enhance common HMS interaction outside the laboratory. With this, we would like to feed back our experiences made with the use of BCIs for HMS. We hope to povide new and useful information about brain dynamics which might be helpful for ongoing research in augmented cognition.	[Zander, T.

For estimating the value of the correlation dimension in a particular case, a polynomial approximation of correlation integral is often used and then linear regression for logarithms of variables is applied. In this Chapter, we show that the correlation integral can be decomposed into functions each related to a particular point of data space. For these functions, one can use similar polynomial approximations such as the correlation integral. The essential difference is that the value of the exponent, which Would correspond to the correlation dimension, differs in accordance to the position of the point in question. Moreover, we show that the multiplicative constant represents the probability density estimation at that point. This finding is used to construct a classifier. Tests with some data sets from the Machine Learning Repository show that this classifier can be very effective.

The selection procedure finds parents for a new neuron among already existing neurons according to the fitness and also with some probability from the network inputs. The essence of cloning is slight modifying the parameters of the copies of the best neuron, i.e. the neuron with the largest fitness. The genetically modified GMDH network with cloning (GMC GMDH) can outperform other powerful methods. It is demonstrated on some tasks from the Machine Learning Repository.

Now we can utilize an improved expression of this classification rule discovery system as an Ant-Colony-Miner. Further modifications are connected with the simplicity of the heuristic function used in the standard Ant-Miner. We propose to employing a new heuristic function based on quantitative, not qualitative parameters used during the classification process. The main transition rule will be changed dynamically as a result of the simple frequency analysis of the number of cases from the point of view characteristic partitions. This simplified heuristic function will be compensated by the pheromone update in different degrees, which helps ants to collaborate and is a good stimulant on ants' behavior during the rule construction. The comparative study will be conducted rising 5 data sets from the UCI Machine Learning repository.

This paper compares the performance of two distributed clustering algorithms namely, Improved Distributed Combining Algorithm and Distributed K-Means algorithm against traditional Centralized Clustering Algorithm. Both algorithms use cluster centroid to form a cluster ensemble, which is required to perform global clustering. The centroid based partitioned clustering algorithms K-Means, Fuzzy K-Means and Rough K-Means are used with each distributed clustering algorithm, in order to analyze the performance of both hard and soft clusters in distributed environment. The experiments are carried out for an artificial dataset and four benchmark datasets of UCI machine learning data repository.	[Visalakshi, N.

Their inference is a central problem in bioinformatics. Because of the paucity of available data and high levels of associated noise, machine learning is essential to performing good and tractable inference of the underlying causal structure. This chapter serves as a review of the GRN field as a whole, as well as a roadmap for researchers new to the field. It describes the relevant theoretical and empirical biochemistry and the different types of GRN inference. It also describes the data that can be used to perform GRN inference. With this biologically-centred material as background, the chapter surveys previous applications of machine learning techniques and computational intelligence to GRN inference. It describes clustering, logical and mathematical formalisms, Bayesian approaches and some combinations. Each of these is shortly explained theoretically, and important examples of previous research using each are highlighted. Finally, the chapter analyses wider statistical problems in the field, and concludes with a summary of the main achievements of previous research as well as some open research questions in the field.

The process of obtaining a properly trained Artificial Neural Network usually requires a great effort in determining the parameters that will make it to learn. Currently there are a variety of algorithms for Artificial Neural Networks's training working, simply, in order to minimize the sum of mean square error. However, even if the network reaches the global minimum error, it does not imply that the model response is optimal. Basically, a network with large number of weights but with small amplitudes behaves as an underfitted model that gradually overfits data during training. Solutions that have been overfitting are unnecessary complexity solutions. Moreover, solutions with low norm of the weights are those that present underfitting, with low complexity. The Multi-Objective Algorithm controls the weights amplitude by optimizing two objective functions: the error function and norm function. The high generalization capability of the Multi-Objective Algorithm and an automatic weight selection is aggregated by the LASSO approach, which generates networks with reduced number of weights when compared with Multi-Objective Algorithm solutions. Four data sets were chosen in order to compare and evaluate MOBJ, LASSO and Early-Stopping solutions. One generated from a function and tree available from a Machine Learning Repository. Additionally, the MOBJ and LASSO algorithms are applied to a microarray data set, which samples correspond to a genetic expression profile from DNA microarray technology of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (treatment given prior to surgery) for patients with breast cancer. Originally, the dataset is composed of 133 samples with 22283 attributes. By applying a probe section method described in the literature, 30 attributes were selected and used to train the Artificial Neural Networks. In average, the MOBJ and LASSO solutions were the same, the main difference is the simplified topology achieve by LASSO training method.

An Evolutionary Approximation for the Coefficients of Decision Functions within a Support Vector Machine Learning Strategy	FOUNDATIONS OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE VOLUME 1: LEARNING APPROXIMATION	Studies in Computational Intelligence		English	Article; Book Chapter								Support vector machines represent a state-of-the-art paradigm, which has nevertheless been tackled by a number of other approaches in view of the development of a superior hybridized technique. It is also the proposal of present chapter to bring support vector machines together with evolutionary computation, with the aim to offer a simplified solving version for the central optimization problem of determining the equation of the hyperplane deriving from support vector learning. The evolutionary approach suggested in this chapter resolves the complexity of the optimizer, opens the 'black-box' of support vector training and breaks the limits of the canonical solving component.

ETL generalizes Transformation Based Learning (TBL) by automatically solving the TBL bottleneck: the construction of good template sets. ETL uses the information gain in order to select the feature combinations that provide good template sets. We describe the application of ETL to two language independent Text Mining preprocessing tasks: part-of-speech tagging and phrase chunking. We also report our findings on one language independent Information Extraction task: named entity recognition. Overall, we successfully apply it to six different languages: Dutch, English, German, Hindi, Portuguese and Spanish. For each one of the tasks, the ETL modeling phase is quick and simple. ETL only requires the training set and no handcrafted templates. Furthermore, our extensive experimental results demonstrate that ETL is an effective way to learn accurate transformation rules. We believe that by avoiding the use of handcrafted templates, ETL enables the use of transformation rules to a greater range of Text Mining applications.

Here we present an application of graphical model methods in order to model the behavior of an ant colony. Ants are tagged with RFID so that their paths through the environment can be constantly recorded. A Structured Hidden Markov Model has been used to build the model of single individual activities. the global profile of the colony has been traced during the migration front one nest to another. The method provided significant information concerning the social dynamics of ant colonies.

One of the most; promising models is Markov Logic (ML) which combines Markov networks (MNs) and first-order logic by attaching weights to first-order formulas and using these as templates for features of MNs. MAP inference in ML, is the task of finding the most likely state of a set of output variables given the state of the input variables and this problem is NP-hard. In this paper we present all algorithm for this inference task based oil the Iterated Local Search (ILS) and Robust Tabu Search (RoTS) metaheuristics. The algorithm performs a biased sampling of the set of local optima by using RoTS as a local search procedure and repetitively jumping in the search space through a perturbation operator, focusing the search not on the full space of solutions but oil a smaller subspace defined by the solutions that are locally optimal for the optimization engine. We show through extensive experiments in real-world domains that; it improves over the state-of-the-art algorithm in terms of solution quality and inference time.

However, future research in applications of DBNs is hampered by the considerable computation that training requires. In this paper, we describe a novel architecture and FPGA implementation that accelerates the training of general RBMs in a scalable manner, with the goal of producing a system that machine learning researchers can use to investigate ever-larger networks. Our design uses a highly efficient, fully-pipelined architecture based on 16-bit arithmetic for performing RBM training on an FPGA. We show that only 16-bit arithmetic precision is necessary, and we consequently use embedded hardware multiply-and-add (MADD) units. We present performance results to show that a speedup of 25-30X can be achieved over an optimized software implementation on a high-end CPU.

The major tasks of the project were: compilation of a multilingual parallel corpus for the concerned languages, the XML mark-up of the corpus (tokenization, lemmatization, tagging). the sentence and word alignment of the corpus and the building of the statistical translation models. Additionally, based on the created resources and models, we conducted preliminary experiments on building prototype MT systems for Romanian <-> English, Greek <-> English and Slovene <-> English. We argue that by investing efforts in building accurate language resources, larger the better, as well as in fine-tuning of the statistical parameters, the current machine-learning technologies can be successfully used for a quick development of acceptable MT prototypes, valuable starting points in implementing working systems. We substantiate this claim with recent results from a follow-up national project, aiming at the development of a Romanian <-> English translation system.

We show that effective on-line policies can be learned from the observed performances of deduction and search oil representative sets of formulas. Such policies can be leveraged to switch between deduction and search during the solving process. We provide empirical evidence that learned policies perform better than either deduction and search, even when the latter are combined using hand-made policies based oil previous works. The fact that even with a proof-of-concept implementation, our approach is competitive with sophisticated state-of-the-art QBF solvers shows the potential of machine learning techniques ill the integration of different reasoning methods.

Distinguishing between myocardial and non-myocardial tissue is, however, difficult due to low signal-to-noise ratio as well as the efficiency constraints imposed on any algorithmic solution by the large size of the data under consideration. In this paper, we take a machine learning approach treating this problem as a two-class 3D patch classification task. We demonstrate that solving such task using random, forests, which are the discriminative classifiers developed recently in the machine learning community, allows to obtain accurate delineations in a matter of seconds (on a CPU) or even in real-time (on a GPU) for the entire 3D volume.

Rather than imposing a single weak learner to handle data that could come from different sources (e. g., images and texts and sounds), we suggest the decomposition of the learning task into several dependent sub-problems of boosting, treated by different weak learners, that will optimally collaborate during the weight update stage. To achieve this task, we introduce a new weighting scheme for which we provide theoretical results. Experiments are carried out and show that our method works significantly better than any combination of independent boosting procedures.

There are many different approaches to Automatic Image Annotation. In many of these approaches a key problem is determining correct word distributions in the generated annotations. Incorrect word distributions (word frequencies) results in large reduction of annotation quality. The paper presents a generic approach to find correct word frequencies. The approach may be used with many automatic image annotators, based on various machine learning paradigms. Proposed method is an improved version of our already presented method, called Greedy Resulted Word Counts Optimization. The key differences and novelties in the paper are: the concept of border support values and a method of optimal step selection in the optimization routine. Optimal step selection allows to reduce the number of computations during the optimization procedure, comparing to old Greedy Resulted Word Counts Optimization method.

J	Halder, A; Ghosh, A; Ghosh, S				Halder, Anindya; Ghosh, Ashish; Ghosh, Susmita			Aggregation Pheromone Density Based Pattern Classification	FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE			English	Article						Swarm intelligence; Ant colony optimization; Aggregation pheromone; Pattern classification	ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION; RECOGNITION	The study of ant colonies behavior and their self-organizing capabilities is of interest to machine learning community, because it provides models of distributed adaptive organization which are useful to solve difficult optimization and classification problems among others. Social insects like ants, bees deposit pheromone (a type of chemical) in order to communicate between the members of their community. Pheromone, that causes clumping behavior in a species and brings individuals into a closer proximity, is called aggregation pheromone. This article presents a new algorithm (called, APC) for pattern classification based on this property of aggregation pheromone found in natural behavior of real ants. Here each data pattern is considered as an ant, and the training patterns (ants) form several groups or colonies depending on the number of classes present in the data set. A new test pattern (ant) will move along the direction where average aggregation pheromone density (at the location of the new ant) formed due to each colony of ants is higher and hence eventually it will join that colony. Thus each individual test pattern (ant) will finally join a particular colony. The proposed algorithm is evaluated with a number of benchmark data sets as well as various kinds of artificially generated data sets using three evaluation measures. Results are compared with four other well known conventional classification techniques. Experimental results show the potentiality of the proposed algorithm in terms of all the evaluation measures compared to other algorithms.

Two types of Raman spectra estimation algorithms exist: supervised and unsupervised. In this paper, we perform a comparative analysis of five supervised algorithms for estimating Raman spectra. We describe a realistic measurement model for a dispersive Raman measurement device and observe that the measurement error variances vary significantly with bin index. Monte Carlo analyses with simulated measurements are used to calculate the bias, root mean square error, and computational time for each algorithm. Our analyses show that it is important to use correct measurement weights and enforce the nonnegative constraint in parameter estimation.

The ITS dataset consists of nuclear ribosomal DNA sequences, where rather sophisticated alignment scores have to be used as a measure of distance. These scores do not form a Minkowski metric and the sequences cannot be regarded as points in a finite dimensional space. This is why it is necessary to develop novel machine learning approaches to the analysis of datasets of this sort. This paper introduces a k-committees classifier and compares it with the discrete k-means and Nearest Neighbour classifiers. It turns out that all three machine learning algorithms are efficient and can be used to automate future biologically significant classifications for datasets of this kind. A simplified version of a synthetic dataset, where the k-committees classifier outperforms k-means and Nearest Neighbour classifiers, is also presented.	[Yearwood, J. L.; Kelarev, A.

Fuzzy Patterns and GCS Networks to Clustering Gene Expression Data	FUZZY SYSTEMS IN BIOINFORMATICS AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY	Studies in Fuzziness and Soft Computing		English	Article; Book Chapter							ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; ACUTE MYELOID-LEUKEMIA; CANCER CLASSIFICATION; MICROARRAY DATA; PREDICTION; SELECTION; SETS; LOGIC	The advent of DNA microarray technology has supplied a large volume of data to many fields like machine learning and data mining. Gene expression profiles are composed of thousands of genes at the same time, representing complex relationships between them. In this context, intelligent support is essential for managing and interpreting this great amount of information. One of the well-known constraints specifically related to microarray data is the large number of genes in comparison with the small number of available experiments. In this situation, the ability of design methods capable of overcoming current limitations of state-of-the-art algorithms is crucial to the development of successful applications. In this chapter we present a flexible framework for the task of feature selection and classification of microarray data. Dimensionality reduction is achieved by the application of a supervised fuzzy pattern algorithm able to reduce and discretize existing gene expression profiles. An informed growing cell structures network is proposed for clustering biological homogeneous experiments starting from the previous simplified microarray data. Experimental results over different data sets containing acute myeloid leukemia profiles show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The Genetic Analysis Workshop 16 Group 9 participants evaluated a wide variety of classical and novel analytical methods for detecting epistasis, in both the statistical and machine learning paradigms, applied to both real and simulated data. Because the magnitude of epistasis is clearly relative to scale of penetrance, and therefore to some extent, to the choice of model framework, it is not surprising that strong interactions under one model might be minimized or even disappear entirely under a different modeling framework.

Although standard statistical tests for each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) separately are able to capture main genetic effects, different approaches are necessary to identify SNPs that influence disease risk jointly or in complex interactions. Experimental and simulated genome-wide SNP data provided by the Genetic Analysis Workshop 16 afforded an opportunity to analyze the applicability and benefit of several machine learning methods. Penalized regression, ensemble methods, and network analyses resulted in several new findings while known and simulated genetic risk variants were also identified. In conclusion, machine learning approaches are promising complements to standard single-and multi-SNP analysis methods for understanding the overall genetic architecture of complex human diseases. However, because they are not optimized for genome-wide SNP data, improved implementations and new variable selection procedures are required. Genet. Epidemiol. 33 (Suppl. 1):S51-S57, 2009.

By computing the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of the family of programs that can he inferred by a specific setting of GP, it is proved that a parsimonious ensures universal consistency. This means that the empirical error minimization allows convergence to the best possible error when the number of test, Cases goes to infinity. However, it is also proved that the standard method consisting in putting a hard limit. oil the program size still results in programs of infinitely increasing size in function of their accuracy. It is also shown that cross-validation or hold-out, for Choosing the Complexity level that optimizes the error rate in generalization also leads to bloat. So a more complicated modification of the fitness is proposed in order to avoid unnecessary bloat, while nevertheless preserving universal Consistency.

Genetic Programming (GP), even in its simplest form, exhibits complex evolutionary dynamics. This makes the task of determining the relationship of control parameter to the evolved population in a genetic programming system decidedly non-trivial. This chapter describes an investigation into the dynamics of GR We present several different observations made on the relationship of parameters to evolution in a GP system with the help of a method for visualizing a GP population's fitness, structure and content simultaneously.			aalmal@umich.edu; dmaclean@acm.org; billw@genetics2.com					ALMAL AA, 2007, GENETIC PROGRAMMING, V5, P145; Angeline P.

ARTIFICIAL EVOLUTION, COMPUTATIONAL EVOLUTION AND THE GENETIC ANALYSIS OF EPISTASIS IN COMMON HUMAN DISEASES	GENETIC PROGRAMMING THEORY AND PRACTICE VI	Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Series		English	Proceedings Paper	6th Workshop on Genetic Programming, Theory and Practice	FEB 15-MAY 17, 2008	Ann Arbor, MI		Univ Michigan	genetic epidemiology; symbolic discriminant analysis	MULTIFACTOR-DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; EXPERT KNOWLEDGE; SUSCEPTIBILITY	Common human diseases are complex and likely the result of nonlinear interactions between multiple different. DNA sequence variations. One goal of human genetics is to use data mining and machine learning methods to identify sets of discrete genetic attributes that are predictive of discrete measures of health in human population data. A variety of different computational intelligence methods based on artificial evolution have been developed and applied in this domain. While artificial evolution approaches such as genetic programming show promise, they are only loosely based on real biological and evolutionary processes. It has recently been suggested that a new paradigm is needed where "artificial evolution" is transformed to "computational evolution" by incorporating more biological and evolutionary complexity into existing algorithms. Computational evolution systems have been proposed as more likely to solve problems of interest to biologists and biomedical researchers. To test this hypothesis, we developed a prototype computational evolution system for the analysis of human genetics data capable of evolving operators of arbitrary complexity. Preliminary results suggest that more complex operators result in better solutions. Here we introduce modifications including a simpler stack-based solution representation, the ability to maintain and use an archive of solution building blocks, and a simpler set of solution operator building blocks capable of learning to use pre-processed expert knowledge. A parameter sweep suggests that operators that can use expert knowledge or archival information outperform those that cannot. This study supports the idea that complexity matters and thus the consieration of computational evolution for bioinformatics problem-solving in the domain of human genetics.

Although researchers have identified many microRNA genes, relatively few microRNA targets have been identified by experimental methods. Computational programs designed for predicting potential microRNA targets provide numerous targets for experimental validation. We used a Markov model to examine base-pairing binding patterns of known microRNA targets. Using this model, potential microRNA targets in human species predicted by four well-known computational programs were assessed. Each potential target was assigned a score reflecting consistency with known target binding patterns. Targets with scores higher than the cutoff value would be identified by our model. The predicted targets identified by our model have base-pairing binding patterns consistent with known targets. This model was efficient for evaluating the extent to which a potential target was accurately predicted.

This paper presents a three-level schema integration architecture which consists of local schemas, mapped schemas, and a global schema, for global heterogeneous geospatial systems. we describe a machine-learning based approach for GIS schema matching. Our approach extends existing machine-learning approaches for (traditional) data mapping but departs from them due to the nature of geographic data. Our solution reduces the complex mappings by identifying different values of a determining property.

Accurate quantification of overall and subtype Cerrado distributions is essential for regional monitoring. In this research, unsupervised fuzzy ARTMAP was compared against conventional k-means classification of Cerrado and agriculture, based on Hyperion satellite data. We systematically tested a range of fuzzy ARTMAP parameters, determining the best parameter combinations. The effect of an additional surface liquid-water input vector was also tested. Similar results were obtained when only Hyperion apparent surface reflectance data were used; fuzzy ARTMAP, however, was generally markedly more accurate than k-mcans when the additional surface liquid-water input was included.

This expected shortage problem is reported to be primarily due to the inefficient, static nature of current spectrum allotment methods. As an initial step towards solving this shortage problem, FCC(1) opens up for the so-called opportunistic spectrum access (OSA), which allows unlicensed users to exploit unused licensed spectrum, but in a manner that limits interference to licensed users. Fortunately, technological advances enabled cognitive radios, which are viewed as intelligent communication systems that can learn from their surrounding environment by themselves, and adapt their internal operating parameters in real-time also by themselves to improve spectrum efficiency. Cognitive radios have recently been recognized as the key enabling technology for realizing OSA. In this work, we propose a machine learning-based scheme that will exploit the cognitive radios' capabilities to enable effective OSA, thus improving the efficiency of spectrum utilization. Our proposed learning technique does not require prior knowledge of the environment's characteristics and dynamics, yet can still achieve high performances by learning from interaction with the environment.

Recognizing the individual movements within an activity can help improve the activity recognition on the whole by using the extra information from the movement granularity. Also, for many applications such as rehabilitation, sports medicine, geriatric care, and health/fitness monitoring the importance of movement recognition cannot be overlooked. Hence, in this paper a novel machine learning algorithm using body area networks is proposed that can on the fly, jointly classify the type of movements, and starting and finishing instant of each movement within an activity. A case study on the best set of features and minimum number of accelerometers needed to correctly classify movements within a smoking activity is also presented.

Maximizing the perceived network performance towards applications by selecting appropriate protocols and carrying out cross-layer optimization on the resulting stack is a key functionality of any CWN. We take a "black box" approach to the problem and study the use of simulated annealing for solving it. To improve the convergence rate of the basic algorithm we apply machine learning techniques to construct graphical models on the perceived relations between network stack parameters and application-specific network utilities. We test our optimizer design both in a simulation environment as well as on a network testbed with low-power radios. Our results show that even basic simulated annealing works well, but simple graphical models can further increase the convergence rate. However, use of sophisticated models such as Bayesian networks does not always lead to substantially better performance. The results indicate that enhanced simulated annealing indeed appears to be a promising foundation for future cognitive engine designs.

In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach for the network flow classification, in which we first apply the payload signature based classifier to identify the flow applications and unknown flows are then identified by a decision tree based classifier in parallel. We evaluate our approach with over 100 million flows collected over three consecutive days on a large-scale WiFi ISP network and results show the proposed approach successfully classifies all the flows with an accuracy approaching 93%.

B	Soler, V; Prim, M		Jelinek, D; Dvorak, G		Soler, Vicenc; Prim, Marta			Machine Learning Applied to Second-Trimester Down's Syndrome Screening	HANDBOOK OF DOWN SYNDROME RESEARCH	Neurodevelopmental Diseases Laboratory and Clinical Research Series		English	Article; Book Chapter								This chapter presents a new methodology to detect Down's syndrome during the second-trimester of gestation. We propose a Fuzzy Logic based classification method that is able of both improving the classification accuracy of the existing screening methods and extracting a set of intelligible rules that explain the system found. The accuracy is improved by reducing the False Positive rate up to 3%-4%, with a 60% of True Positive rate. Never before a screening method could reduce the FP rate below 5%, with a 60% of TP. The intelligibility is obtained by getting a reduced set of rules, expressed in a fuzzy way, which helps to explain the knowledge contained in the classification system found. Finally, conclude that the medical staff was able to understand the system expressed in the Fuzzy rules found, where its number of rules is just 10.

In particular we discuss two different algorithmic settings, binary classification and multi-task learning, and analyze the two closely related problems of feature selection and feature learning. In the binary case the theoretical and algorithmic advances to feature selection are applied to solve face detection and face authentication problems. In the multi-task case we show how the data structure described by a group of features common to the various tasks can be effectively learned, and then we discuss how this approach could be used to address face recognition.

Typically, verification engineers with deep domain knowledge manually prepare a set of stimuli generation directives for that purpose. Bayesian networks based CDC (coverage directed generation) systems have been successfully used to assist the process by automatically closing this feedback loop. However, constructing these CDC systems requires manual effort and a certain amount of domain knowledge from a machine learning specialist. We propose a new method that boosts coverage at early stages of the verification process with minimal effort, namely a fully automatic construction of a CDC system that requires no domain knowledge. Experimental results on a real-life cross-product coverage model demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

Querying the hospital data warehouse with a set of relevant features and applying a classification algorithm on the results can reduce the amount of cases to be evaluated by the infection control practitioners. The objective of this work is to provide a framework to build a nosocomial infection model with a set of pre-selected features with Fisher's linear discriminant algorithm. Application of the methodology to two datasets provides promising results. It permits to predict respectively an average of 41.5% and 43.54% positive cases including respectively 65.37% and 82.56% true positive cases. The proposed framework can be applied to other classification algorithms, which are planned as future work.

This paper examines application of hybrid algorithms to segment data models to enable a higher level of accuracy. Our process begins with the reduction of our input parameter sets through the derivation of dominant characteristics. Using these characteristics, ranges are determined in which to segment our model. Each set is then used to train a predictive model using Machine Learning techniques. One major attribute of our application framework is to support an interchangeable set of algorithms for each stage. This process is demonstrated by estimating stated incomes from an automotive financing application for purpose of predictive modeling. We conclude that by applying our segmented hybrid framework we can achieve substantial improvements in accuracy over pure Machine Learning applications.

Two learning signals that are derived from this algorithm, the predictive value and the prediction error, have been shown to explain changes in neural activity and behavior during learning across species. Here, the predictive value signal is used to explain the time course of learning-related changes in the activity of hippocampal neurons in monkeys performing an associative learning task. The TD algorithm serves as the centerpiece of a joint probability model for the learning-related neural activity and the behavioral responses recorded during the task. The neural component of the model consists of. spiking neurons that compete and learn the reward-predictive value of task-relevant input signals. The predictive-value signaled by these neurons influences the behavioral response generated by a stochastic decision stage, which constitutes the behavioral component of the-model. It is shown that the time course of the changes in neural activity and behavioral performance generated by the model exhibits key features of the experimental data. The results suggest that information about correct associations may be expressed in the hippocampus before it is detected in the behavior of a subject. In this way, the hippocampus may be among the earliest brain areas to express learning and drive the behavioral changes associated with learning. Correlates of reward-predictive value may be expressed in the hippocampus through rate remapping within spatial memory representations, they may represent reward-related aspects of a declarative or explicit relational memory representation of task contingencies, or they may correspond to reward-related components of episodic memory representations. These potential functions are discussed in connection with hippocampal cell assembly sequences and their reverse reactivation during the awake state.

Students are usually confused when learning the expressive performance because of teachers' subjective intention difference on the same performance. In this paper, teacher models will be built by analyzing teachers' classification rules. By replaying their performances and read teachers' suggestions in graphical and textual modes which are generated automatically by teacher model, students could understand the nuance of performance features on each expression. Three teachers and ten students joined this experiment. Sixty piano performances were recorded for constructing the teacher models. The average accuracy of teacher models for classifying performance expression is 70.8%. Questionnaires reflect both teachers and students are satisfied with the user interface, generated suggestions, and classification rules.			kloutw@gmail.com					Canazza S., 1997, Music, Gestalt, and Computing.

To discover suitable genes as experiment samples for distinguishing the status of gene regulation, we utilized Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) method to eliminate non-significant genes of unapparent variation between normal tissues and tumors. Subsequently, these selected genes are clustered through an unsupervised learning algorithm to reduce overall training samples under the same condition. In addition, the resulting samples have been verified by means of experimenting with the SVM and KNN methods. The experimental results show that our approach has potentials to effectively reduce samples for microarray analysis.

This paper puts forward the AdaBoost algorithm with prior probabilities. Each classifier which is used for the combination is usually obtained through the sample collection by certain training. Using the sample to centralize the ratio of different kinds of goals can reflect various classifiers' prior probability. Using this parameter, we can make good use of AdaBoost algorithm to predict hazard quickly and will not cause the phenomenon of overstudying. Based on the classification problem of two-classes, experiments with UCI datasets show the validity of the AdaBoost algorithm with prior probabilities. The performance of the AdaBoost algorithm with prior probabilities is better than the traditional AdaBoost algorithm. The AdaBoost algorithm with prior probabilities is confirmed to give better prediction in Geo-hazard risk modeling through the visualization demonstrated in GIS.

It consists of two types learning, i.e., direct learning which learns multiple weak learners from a training dataset via some homogeneous or heterogenous algorithms, and indirect learning that constructs a committee from the knowledge of the combined filters or other committees. This paper studies empirically the performance of MPCSL on spam filtering tasks. In the occasions of combining homogeneous and heterogenous, how the performance of MPCSL changes is surveyed. The results shows that MPCSL is a compellent ensemble learning method for cost-sensitive tasks such as spam filtering.

From the analysis of objects' durations (of stay) we not only get how long they stay in the scene, but also precisely where the objects spend time. The video frame is therefore segmented into clusters, and objects which go through or stay there are assigned to that cluster. If we observe all objects in a time period we should get a model of object behavior with respect to duration for each cluster. Using the built model we try to find abnormal object behavior. To build a model of object's spatial duration from the video data we utilize Gaussians and fast learning algorithm for real time surveillance applications on embedded systems.

However, learning process requires much time for exploration and computation. In this paper, we propose a method of sensorimotor learning which explores the learning domain actively. Our approach discovers that the embodied learning system can design its own learning process actively, which is different from the conventional passive data-access machine learning. The proposed model is characterized by a function we call the "confidence", and is a measure of the reliability of state control. The confidence for the state can be a good measure to bias the exploration strategy of data sampling, and to direct its attention to areas of learning interest. We consider the confidence function to be a first step toward an active behavior design for autonomous environment adaptation. The approach was experimentally validated in typical sensorimotor coordination such as arm reaching and object fixation, using the humanoid robot James and the iCub simulator.

Machine learning and sentiment analysis provide powerful tools to collect a great deal of data from the website and retrieve useful information for effectively forecasting financial risk of associated companies. This article studies trading volume and asset price risk when sentimental financial information data are available using both sentiment analysis and popular machine learning approaches: artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). Nonlinear GARCH-based mining models are developed by integrating GARCH (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity) theory and ANN and SVM. Empirical studies in the U.S. stock market show that the proposed approach achieves favorable forecast performances. GARCH-based SVM outperforms GARCH-based ANN for volatility forecast, whereas GARCH-based ANN achieves a better forecast result for the volatility trend. Results also indicate a strong correlation between information sentiment and both trading volume and asset price volatility.

Discrete Dynamic Bayesian Network Analysis of fMRI Data	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						Bayesian networks; dementia; nonlinear analysis; functional connectivity; Talairach atlas; amygdala	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; STRUCTURAL EQUATION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; BRAIN; AMYGDALA; MODELS; SOFTWARE	We examine the efficacy of using discrete Dynamic Bayesian Networks (dDBNs), a data-driven modeling technique employed in machine learning, to identify functional correlations among neuroanatomical regions of interest. Unlike many neuroimaging analysis techniques, this method is not limited by linear and/or Gaussian noise assumptions. It achieves this by modeling the time series of neuroanatomical regions as discrete, as opposed to continuous, random variables with multinomial distributions. We demonstrated this method using an fMRI dataset collected from healthy and demented elderly subjects (Buckner, et al., [2000]: J Cogn Neurosci 12:24-34) and identify correlates based on a diagnosis of dementia. The results are validated in three ways. First, the elicited correlates are shown to be robust over leave-one-out cross-validation and, via a Fourier bootstrapping method, that they were not likely due to random chance. Second, the dDBNs identified correlates that would be expected given the experimental paradigm. Third, the dDBN's ability to predict dementia is competitive with two commonly employed machine-learning classifiers: the support vector machine and the Gaussian naive Bayesian network. We also verify that the dDBN selects correlates based on non-linear criteria. Finally, we provide a brief analysis of the correlates elicited from Buckner et al.'s data that suggests that demented elderly subjects have reduced involvement of entorhinal and occipital cortex and greater involvement of the parietal lobe and amygdala in brain activity compared with healthy elderly (as measured via functional correlations among BOLD measurements). Limitations and extensions to the dDBN method are discussed. Hurry Brain Mapp 30:122-137, 2009. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Distinguishing Difficulty Levels with Non-invasive Brain Activity Measurements	HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION - INTERACT 2009, PT I	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	12th IFIP International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction	AUG 24-28, 2009	Uppsala, SWEDEN	IFIP TC13, Swedish Interdisciplinary Interest Grp Human Comp Interact, Uppsala Univ, Dept Informat Technol		Brain-computer interface; human cognition; functional near-infrared spectroscopy; fNIRS; task classification; game; difficulty level	NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; VIDEO GAMES; NIRS	Passive brain-computer interfaces are designed to use brain activity as an additional input, allowing the adaptation of the interface in real time according to the user's mental state. The goal of the present study is to distinguish between different levels of game difficulty using non-invasive brain activity measurement with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The study is designed to lead to adaptive interfaces that respond to the user's brain activity in real time. Nine subjects played two levels of the game Pacman while their brain activity was measured using fNIRS. Statistical analysis and machine learning classification results show that we can discriminate well between subjects playing or resting, and distinguish between the two levels of difficulty with some success. In contrast to most previous fNIRS studies which only distinguish brain activity from rest, we attempt to tell apart two levels of brain activity, and our results show potential for using fNIRS in an adaptive game or user interface.

This is an instinct for a baby to live, build strength and interact with the world. The interaction seems very similar to Our users choosing a product for self-empowerment and productivity. However, most users are not babies, neither the majority of man-made products embody perfect affordances. How could user experience designers help to create an easy-to-learn product for specific user goals? This paper explores the answer via a balanced view on user-learning and machine-learning, and proposes designers' early engagement in conceptual design together with full awareness Of users' learning constrains, so as to make users happier and thankful since initial contact with the product the designers created.

Regarding the face tracking, we develop an effective particle filter to locate faces in image sequences. Since we have considered the hair color information of a human head, the particle filter will keep tracking even if the person is back to the line of sight of a camera. We further adopt both the motion and color cues as the features to make the influence of the back.-round its low as possible. A new fashion of classification architecture trained with an AdaBoost algorithm is also proposed to achieve face recognition rapidly. Compared to other machine learning schemes, the AdaBoost algorithm can update training samples to deal with comprehensive circumstances. but it need not spend much computational cost. Experimental results reveal that the face tracking rate is more than 97% in general situations and 89% when the face suffering from temporal occlusion. As for the face recognition. the accuracy rate is more than 90%; besides this, the efficiency of system execution is very satisfactory. which reaches 20 frames per second at least.

In [3], an independent adaptation platform to support competences development through personalization is presented. Three user characteristics (competences profile, learning style, and accessing context) are modeled by means of analyzing user interaction data in a LMS. This process is supported by the assigment of independent adaptation tasks to different JADE intelligent agents. In this paper we introduce some negotiation strategies among those intelligent agents in order to: 1) select the best types of adaptation through collaborative tasks, and 2) generate standards and exchangeable user profiles based on the inferred user characteristics, describing the mechanisms to mobilize these profiles between different LMSs. These profiles support the generation of specifics learning designs for each particular user.

We take advantage of natural induction methods based on the attributional calculus (AQ21) and MLP and SVM supervised methods to discover patterns in the melanocytic skin lesion images. This methodology can be treated as a non-invasive approach to early diagnosis of melanoma. Our feature set is composed of wavelet-based multi-resolution filters of the dermatoscopic images. Our classifiers show good efficiency and may potentially be important diagnostic aids.

Rocchio is the classic method for text classification ill information retrieval. Our approach is a supervised method, meaning that the list of categories should be defined and a set of training data should be provided for training the system. In this approach, documents are represented as vectors where each component is associated with a particular word. We propose voting method and OWA operator and Decision Template method for combining classifiers. In these we use an effective and efficient new method called variance-mean based feature filtering method of feature selection. Best feature selection method and combination of methods are used to do feature reduction in the representation phase of text classification is proposed. Using this efficient feature selection method and best classifier combination method we improve the text classification performance.	[Srinivas, M.; Kumari, S.

With the ever increasing popularity of emails, email over-load and prioritization becomes a major problem for many email users. Users spend a lot of time reading, replying and organizing their emails. To help users organize and prioritize their email messages, we propose a new framework; email reply prediction with unsupervised learning. The goal is to provide concise, highly structured and prioritized emails, thus saving the user from browsing through each email one by one and help to save time. In this paper, we discuss the features used to differentiate emails, show promising initial results with unsupervised machine learning model, and outline future directions for this work.

This opens a number of associated issues covered by this chapter, such as heterogeneous data types fusion, architectures for real-time processing, dialog management, machine learning for multimodal interaction, modeling languages, frameworks, etc. This chapter does not intend to cover exhaustively all the issues related to multimodal interfaces creation and some hot topics, Such as error handling, have been left aside. The chapter starts with the features and advantages associated with multimodal interaction, with a focus on particular Findings and guidelines, as well as cognitive foundations underlying multimodal interaction. The chapter then focuses on the driving theoretical principles, time-sensitive software architectures and multimodal fusion and fission issues. Modeling of multimodal interaction as well as tools allowing rapid creation of multimodal interfaces are then presented. The article concludes with an outline of the Current state of multimodal interaction research in Switzerland, and also Summarizes the major future challenges in the field.

When support vector machines (SVMs) are associated with the right kernels, this machine learning technique can build state-of-the-art classifiers. However, traditional implementations work in a batch fashion, limiting the application to very large and high dimensional data sets, typical in biology. Incremental SVMs introduce all alternative to batch algorithms, and a good candidate to solve these problems. In this work several experiments arc conducted to evaluate the performance of the incremental SVM on remote homology detection using a benchmark data set. The main advantages are shown, opening the possibility to further improve the algorithm in order to achieve even better classifiers.

Use of Classification Algorithms in Noise Detection and Elimination	HYBRID ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Workshop on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems	JUN 10-12, 2009	Salamanca, SPAIN			Noise; Machine Learning; Gene Expression and Classification	ATTRIBUTE NOISE; DISCOVERY	Data sets in Bioinformatics usually present a high level of noise. Various processes involved in biological data collection and preparation may be responsible for the introduction of this noise, such as the imprecision inherent to laboratory experiments generating these data. Using noisy data in the induction of classifiers through Machine Learning techniques may harm the classifiers prediction performance. Therefore, the predictions of these classifiers may be used for guiding noise detection and removal. This work compares three approaches for the elimination of noisy data from Bioinformatics data sets using Machine Learning classifiers: the first is based in the removal of the detected noisy examples, the second tries to reclassify these data and the third technique, named hybrid, Unifies the previous approaches.

The proposed algorithm is a two phase algorithm which combines a new algorithm called Bumble Bees Mating Optimization algorithm for the solution of the feature selection problem and a GRASP algorithm for the solution of the clustering problem. The performance of the algorithm is compared with other popular metaheuristic and nature inspired methods using datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The high performance of the proposed algorithm is achieved as the algorithm gives very good results and in some instances the percentage of the correct. clustered samples is very high and is larger than 98%.

In this framework, the class distribution is not uniform and the separability between the classes is often difficult. From the available techniques in the Machine Learning field, we focus on the use of Fuzzy Rule Based Classification Systems, as they provide an interpret-able model For the end user by means of linguistic variables. The aim of this work is to increase the performance of fuzzy modeling by adding a higher degree of knowledge by means of the use of Interval-valued Fuzzy Sets. Furthermore, we will contextualize the Interval-valued Fuzzy Sets with a post-processing genetic tuning of the amplitude of their upper bounds in order to enhance the global behaviour of this methodology.

Up to now, we have relied on measures obtained by running the methods on a wide test bed composed of real-world problems. Nevertheless, the unknown inherent characteristics of these problems and the bias of learners may lead to inconclusive results. This paper discusses the need to work under a controlled scenario and bets on artificial data set generation. A list of ingredients and some ideas about how to guide such generation are provided, and promising results of an evolutionary multi-objective approach which incorporates the use of data complexity estimates are presented.

S	Kordik, P		Onwubolu, GC		Kordik, Pavel			GAME - Hybrid Self-Organizing Modeling System Based on GMDH	HYBRID SELF-ORGANIZING MODELING SYSTEMS	Studies in Computational Intelligence		English	Article; Book Chapter							POLYNOMIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; ALGORITHM; BACKPROPAGATION; OPTIMIZATION; PREDICTION; ENSEMBLES; EVOLUTION; DESIGN	In this chapter, an algorithm to construct hybrid self-organizing neural network is proposed. It combines niching evolutionary strategies, nature inspired and gradient based optimization algorithms (Quasi-Newton, Conjugate Gradient, GA, PSO, ACO, etc.) to evolve neural network with optimal topology adapted to a data set. The GAME algorithm is something in between the GMDH algorithm and the NEAT algorithm. It is capable to handle irrelevant inputs, short and noisy data samples, but also complex data such as "two intertwined spirals" problem. The self-organization of the topology allows it to produce accurate models for various tasks (classification, prediction, regression, etc.). Bencharking with machine learning algorithms implemented in the Weka software showed that the accuracy of GAME models was superior for both regression and classification problems. The most successful configuration of the GAME algorithm is not changing with problem character, natural evolution selects all important parameters of the algorithm. This is a significant step towards the automated data mining.

A large number of plot-like data structures of various dimensions are periodically generated for the combinations of given data streams and searched for regularities. Controllable variables are manipulated in some random or systematic way until the observed regularities allow for more intelligent behavior (if required). Information about interesting (as defined by the task at hand) relationships is extracted from the data structures, and human-readable control rules for the system are formed. For most nontrivial applications the method can be computationally very expensive, but the potential for parallelizability and for smart optimizations together with the continual increase of capabilities of the off-the-shelf computers suggest that the method will be feasible already in the nearest future.

As a response to this alarming problem, the World Health Organisation (W.H.O) recommends that all countries experiencing resistance to conventional monotherapies, such as chloroquine, amodiaquine or sulfacloxine-pyrimethamine, should use combination therapies [1]. Therefore there is a need to discover new drug targets that are able to target the malarial parasite at distinct pathways for an efficient malaria drug. In this paper, we presented a machine-learning toot which is able to identify novel drug targets from the metabolic network of Plasmodium falciparum. With our tool we identified among others 19 drug targets confirmed from literature which we analyzed further with a sophisticated gene expression analysis tool. Our data was clustered using common distance similarity measurements and hierarchical clustering to propose a profound combination of drug targets. Our result suggests that two or more enzymatic reactions from the list of our drug targets which span across about ten pathways (Table 2) could be combined to target at distinct time points in the parasite's intraerythrocytic developmental cycle to detect efficient malaria drug target combinations.

In this work, we have analyzed the contacts between amino acid residues in different folding types of globular proteins and various ranges of folding rates. Based on amino acid contacts a novel parameter, multiple contact index has been developed for understanding protein folding rates. We have computed short, medium and long-range contacts in proteins of different folding types and rates from their sequences and structures. Utilizing the information, we have developed models for recognizing protein folds and predicting their folding rates, using machine learning techniques. Our methods showed an accuracy of 55% for discriminating 1612 globular proteins belonging to 30 different folds and an accuracy of 96% to distinguish the fast and slow folding proteins using 5-fold cross-validation method.

Data mining has the greatest attention of research over the past decade. The Machine Learning field evolved from the broad field of Artificial Intelligence, in which the machine (computers) can be enabled to think or act as intelligent as humans. Classification is the machine learning problem in which the given dataset can be classified upon known classes. Social network has great impact in product marketing. In this paper we consider the classification as a social network problem. To prove this, we have taken a dataset and classify it using ID3 implementation. The dataset contains multivariate and multi classes. The results obtained by classification are considered as social networks.	[Sathik, M.

We conducted an experimentation in which we exposed a group of 17 learners to a series of pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) while their electrical brain activity was recorded. We got 33.106 recordings. In an exploratory study we examined the influence of 24 picture categories from the IAPS on the amplitude variations of the 4 brainwaves frequency bands: delta, phi, alpha and beta. We used machine learning techniques to track the amplitudes in order to predict the dominant frequency band which inform about the learner mental and emotional states. Correlation and regression analyses show a significant impact of the emotional stimuli on the amplitudes of the brainwave frequency bands. Standard classification techniques were used to assess the reliability of the automatic prediction of the dominant frequency band. The reached accuracy was 90%.

RL-SANE is an innovative combination of the neuroevolutionary algorithm NEAT(Stanley, 2004) and the RL algorithm Sarsa(lambda)(Sutton and Barto, 1998). It uses the special ability of NEAT to generate and train customized neural networks that provide a means for reducing the size of the state space through state aggregation. Reducing the size of the state space through aggregation enables Sarsa(lambda) to be applied to much more difficult problems than standard tabular based approaches. Previous similar work in this area, such as in Whiteson and Stone (Whiteson and Stone, 2006) and Stanley and Miikkulainen (Stanley and Miikkulainen, 2001), have shown positive and promising results. This paper gives a brief overview of neuroevolutionary methods, introduces the RL-SANE algorithm, presents a comparative analysis of RL-SANE to other neuroevolutionary algorithms, and concludes with a discussion of enhancements that need to be made to RL-SANE.

DataZapper is a tool for uncreating data: given a dataset containing joint samples over variables, DataZapper will make a specified percentage of observed values disappear, replaced by an indication that the measurement failed. Since the causal mechanisms of measurement that result in failed measurements may depend in arbitrary ways upon the system under study, it is important to be able to produce incomplete data sets which allow for such arbitrary dependencies. DataZapper is the only tool that allows any kind of dependence, and any degree of dependence, in its generation of missing data. We illustrate its use in a machine learning experiment and offer it to the data mining and machine learning communities.

Further, they require domain-specific heuristics before they can function efficiently. The problem of formulating domain models containing dynamic knowledge regarding actions is a barrier to the widespread uptake of AI planning, because of the difficulty in acquiring and maintaining them. Here we postulate a method which inputs a partial domain model (one without knowledge of domain actions) and training solution sequences to planning tasks, and outputs the full domain model, including heuristics that can be used to make plan generation more efficient. To do this we extend GIPO's Opmaker system (Simpson et al., 2007) so that it can induce representations of actions from training sequences without intermediate state information and without requiring large numbers of examples. This method shows the potential for considerably reducing the burden of knowledge engineering, in that it would be possible to embed the method into an autonomous program (agent) which is required to do planning. We illustrate the algorithm as part of an overall method to acquire a planning domain model, and detail results that show the efficacy of the induced model.	[McCluskey, T. L.; Cresswell, S.

The application domain is gossip about celebrities in the music world. The agent can inform herself and update the acquired knowledge by observing the web. Fans of musicians can ask for gossip information about stars, bands or people and groups related to them. This agent is built on top of information extraction, web mining, question answering and dialogue system technologies. The minimally supervised machine learning method for relation extraction gives the agent the capability to learn and update knowledge constantly from the web. The extracted relations are structured and linked with each other. Data mining is applied to the learned data to induce the social network among the artists and related people. The knowledge-intensive question answering technology enhanced by domain-specific inference and active memory allows the agent to have vivid and interactive conversations with users by utilizing natural language processing. Users can freely formulate their questions within the gossip data domain and access the answers in different ways: textual response, graph-based visualization of the related concepts and speech output.

The approach makes use of the LAGRAMGE equation discovery tool to define a potentially very wide range of equations to be considered for the model. Importantly, the equations can vary in the number of terms and types of functors linking the variables. The parameters of each competing equation are automatically fitted to allow the tool to compare the models. The analysts using the tool can exercise their judgement twice, once when defining the equation syntax, restricting in such a way the search to a space known to contain several types of models that are based on theoretical arguments. In addition, one can use the same theoretical arguments to choose among the list of best fitting models, as these can be structurally very different while providing similar fits on the data. Here we describe experiments with macroeconomic data from the Euro area for the period 1971-2007 in which the parameters of hundreds of thousands of structurally different equations are fitted and the equations compared to produce the best models for the individual cases considered. The results show the approach is able to produce complex non-linear models with several equations showing high fidelity.

Recently, AdaBoost has become popular among machine learning community thanks to its promising results across a variety of applications. However, training AdaBoost on large datasets is a major problem, especially when the dimensionality of the data is very high. This paper discusses the effect of high dimensionality on the training process of AdaBoost. Two preprocessing options to reduce dimensionality, namely the principal component analysis and random projection are briefly examined. Random projection subject to a probabilistic length preserving transformation is explored further as a computationally light preprocessing step. The experimental results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed training process for handling high dimensional large datasets.

CLASSIFICATION BY LINEARITY ASSUMPTION	ICAPR 2009: SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN PATTERN RECOGNITION, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Advances in Pattern Recognition	FEB 04-06, 2009	Kolkata, INDIA	TATA Consultancy Serv	Indian Statist Inst	classification		Recently a classifier was proposed that was based on the assumption: the training samples for a particular class form a linear basis for any new test sample. This assumption is a generalization of the Nearest Neighbour classifier. In the previous work, the classifier was built upon this assumption required solving a complex optimisation problem. The optimisation method was time consuming and restrictive in application. In this work our proposed algorithm takes care of the previous problems keeping the basic assumption intact. We also offer generalisations of the basic assumption. Comparative experimental results on some UCI machine learning databases show that our proposed generalised classifier is performs as good as other well known techniques like Nearest Neighbour and Support Vector Machine.

However, engineering of an autonomous robot still is a challenging and time consuming task even with these learning libraries. With the open source Teaching-Box presented here, the "training" of a robot becomes easier due to the following features. The Java library of the Teaching-Box provides algorithms for reinforcement learning as well as for learning by demonstration (utilizing supervised learning algorithms) and data structures for exchanging policies between the different ways of learning. As an initial policy one can even take a manually coded behaviour and then improve it for example with reinforcement learning. A human trainer feedback (e.g. via the speech interface) can be used to increase the learning speed. The Eclipse based GUI facilitates the design of the robot learning projects and visualizes the learning process. For connecting the various modules of a project, open interface standards such as RL-Glue are used and an easy integration of the Teaching-Box into standard robot middleware is possible.

In this paper we present a new distributed learning based method to choose nodes transmitting range, in this method we run a range adjustment mechanism periodically to choose a near optimal transmitting range, we don't need any information about location of nodes or distance between nodes or received signal strength, the communication overhead of this method is very low, performance evaluation results show that this method decrease the energy consumption and overcome other existing methods in some scenarios.

Machine learning techniques have been applied to the field of intrusion detection. They can learn normal and anomalous patterns from training data and via Feature selection improving classification by searching for the subset of features which best classifies the training data to detect attacks on computer system. The quality of features directly affects the performance of classification. Many feature selection methods introduced to remove redundant and irrelevant features, because raw features may reduce accuracy or robustness of classification. In this paper we compared three methods for feature selection based on Decision trees (DT), Flexible Neural Tree (FNT) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The results based on comparison of three methods on DARPA KDD99 benchmark dataset indicate that DT has almost better accuracy.

This paper proposed to annotate Chinese subcategorization as a classification task by means of sequence kernel methods, which exploited the potential relations among the respective sentential constituents. Our final classification with word sequence kernel congregation and POS sequence kernel C-SVM achieved a very promising accuracy ratio of 92.36% on the testing set, which is 13.51% higher than the baseline performance of the existing Chinese SCF hypothesis generator.

The participants in Project GBODSS (Grid-based Open DSS) are in the process of developing a new open decision support system framework based on grid technologies. Automated text categorization has been extensively studied and various techniques for document categorization based on machine learning approaches have been proposed. However, most of these experimental prototypes, for the purpose of evaluating different techniques, have been restricted to the heterogeneous, autonomic, dynamic and distributed internet environment. In this study, an approach based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for web text mining of large-scale systems on GBODSS is developed to support enterprise decision making. The experiments were conducted on different configurations of grid network and computation time was recorded for each operation. We analyzed our result with various grid configurations and it shows speed up of computation time is almost super linear.

Collaborative attacks may cause more devastating impacts on wireless environments than single and uncoordinated groups of attacks, as they combine efforts of more than one attacker against the target victim. In this paper, we present the most important forms of attacks, discuss possible collaborations among attackers, show how machine learning techniques and signal processing techniques can be used to detect and defend against collaborative attacks in such environments, and discuss implementation issues.

Yet knowing their performance characteristics - their runtimes and resource usage - can solve two important problems. First, every database vendor struggles with managing unexpectedly long-running queries. When these long-running queries can be identified before they start, they can be rejected or scheduled when they will not cause extreme resource contention for the other queries in the system. Second, deciding whether a system can complete a given workload in a given time period (or a bigger system is necessary) depends on knowing the resource requirements of the queries in that workload. We have developed a system that uses machine learning to accurately predict the performance metries of database queries whose execution times range from milliseconds to hours. For training and testing our system, we used both real customer queries and queries generated from an extended set of TPC-DS templates. The extensions mimic queries that caused customer problems. We used these queries to compare how accurately different techniques predict metrics such as elapsed time, records used, disk I/Os, and message bytes. The most promising technique was not only the most accurate, but also predicted these metrics simultaneously and using only information available prior to query execution. We validated the accuracy of this machine learning technique on a number of HP Neoview configurations. We were able to predict individual query elapsed time within 20% of its actual time for 85% of the test queries. Most importantly, we were able to correctly identify both the short and long-running (up to two hour) queries to inform workload management and capacity planning.

Therefore, a key element of design is an understanding of human preferences for products and features. In this work, a human appraisal experiment is conducted to understand preferences for automobile occupant package design. The experiment is conducted to build predictive parametric models of consumer preferences. An issue with this class of experiment is that the heterogeneity of the experimental respondents contributes to the response, and this heterogeneity must be understood to separate the influence of design factors from that of human factors. Latent class analysis is used to combine multiple responses of the human appraisal respondents to an appropriate set of measures. Cluster analysis and smoothing spline regression are used to gain an understanding of respondent rating styles and preference heterogeneity. These analyses allow estimation of ordered logit models for prediction of consumer occupant package preferences. Methods from machine learning are also investigated as an alternative to parametric modeling.

The ACO is a metaheuristic inspired by the behavior of real ants, where they search optimal solutions by considering both local heuristic and previous knowledge, observed by pheromone changes. In our approach we want to ensure the good performance of Ant-Miner by applying the new versions of heuristic functions in a main rule. We want to emphasize the role of the heuristic function by analyzing the influence of different propositions of these functions to the performance of Ant-Miner. The comparative study will be done using the 5 data sets from the UCI Machine Learning repository.

Existing strategies for preprocessing the available data usually focus on a single aspect, such as incompleteness, or dimensionality, or filtering out "harmful" attributes, etc. In this paper we propose a unified methodology for data preprocessing, which considers several aspects at the same time. The novelty of the approach consists in enhancing the data imputation step with information from the feature selection step, and performing both operations jointly, as two phases in the same activity. The methodology performs data imputation only on the attributes which are optimal for the class (from the feature selection point of view). Imputation is performed using machine learning methods. When imputing values for a given attribute, the optimal subset (of features) for that attribute is considered. The methodology is not restricted to the use of a particular technique, but can be applied using any existing data imputation and feature selection methods.

The amount of malware is increasing faster every year and poses a serious security threat. Thus, malware detection is a critical topic in computer security. Currently, signature-based detection is the most extended method for detecting malware. Although this method is still used on most popular commercial computer antivirus software, it can only achieve detection once the virus has already caused damage and it is registered. Therefore, it fails to detect new malware. Applying a methodology proven successful in similar problem-domains, we propose the use of n-grams (every substring of a larger string, of a fixed lenght n) as file signatures in order to detect unknown malware whilst keeping low false positive ratio. We show that n-grams signatures provide an effective way to detect unknown malware.

This is due to high cost of the manual construction of individuals. In order to tackle this problem, this paper proposes an automatic method for ontology population. The knowledge source for ontology population used in this paper is the web tables of which structure is relatively well organized. Since a web table can be analyzed into a parse tree, the most appropriate concept within the ontology for a given web table is determined by a kernel method, so-called a parse tree kernel. Then, the table is populated as an individual of the concept. According to the experimental results on a large ontology with a great number of concepts, the proposed method achieves 62.35% of accuracy for a number of web tables.

The engine performance referred to as output torque is significantly affected by the setup of control parameters in the ECU. Traditional ECU tune-up is done by trial-and-error method through repeated dynamometer tests. LS-SVM (Least Squares Support Vector Machines) is a powerful machine learning technique which can handle complex and nonlinear function estimation problems. It was employed to estimate the above engine performance function. However, current LS-SVM is an offline algorithm, i.e., the estimated torque functions built from LS-SVM can not be updated with the subsequent expensive dynamometer tests for verification. In the paper, online LS-SVM is presented and used for estimating the engine torque functions for precision prediction so that the number of dynamometer tests can be significantly reduced.	[Vong, C.

Different from existing methods, present system avoids users' feedback to the browser and doesn't collect the information which may produce privacy issues, e.g. users' browsing history, bookmarks, and so on. Because the information recorded by server in access logs will be utilized to evaluate the page interest, a referer-based data preprocessing method is carried out to improve the reliability of the access data and extract the necessary information for interest estimation. An interest estimation model which mainly considers the reference length, the size, the visiting time and the visiting times of each accessed page is then used to determine the page interest. The proposed method is tested by analyzing the practical web access logs for validation. The page interest estimation can be efficiently accomplished and the data set is well prepared for further machine learning algorithms to construct user profiles.

This framework is very important since in many domains the labeled data are very expensive while a large number of unlabeled data may he freely available. We present a regularization method, so-called the regularized weighting factor to adjust contribution of the unlabeled data during learning process in order to reduce the size of labeled data. Some experiments were performed using benchmark datasets to study this method using the generative classifiers based on Gaussian mixture models. The experiment results have shown that the proposed method can regularize contribution of labeled/unlabeled data during learning process and reduce the labeled data.

As the number of ontologies are made publicly available and accessible on the web increases steadily, a single ontology is no longer enough to support the tasks envisaged by a distributed environment like the semantic web. Multiple ontologies need to be accessed for several applications. A critical issue is ontology integration, which can largely improve the efficiency to enrich such a domain ontology with less time and lower cost for obtaining related knowledge. This paper has deeply studied the principles of ontology integration, then proposes a procedure model for ontology construction and a new framework for ontology integration based on machine learning through analyzing the characteristics and problems in the process of ontology integration.

If the robot maneuvers too close to an obstacle, it increases the probability of an accident. Preventing this is crucial in dynamic environments, where the obstacles, such as other UAVs, are moving. This kind of safe navigation is needed in any autonomous movement application but it is of a vital importance in applications such as automated transportation of nuclear or chemical waste. This paper presents the Maximum Margin Search using a Convex Hull construction (MMS-CH), an algorithm for a fast construction of a maximum margin between sets of obstacles and its maintenance as the input data are dynamically altered. This calculation of the safest path is inspired by the Support Vector Machines (SVM). It utilizes the convex hull construction to preprocess the input data and uses the boundaries of the hulls to search for the optimal margin. The MMS-CH algorithm takes advantage of the elementary geometrical properties of the 2-dimensional Euclidean space resulting in 1) significant reduction of the problem complexity by eliminating irrelevant data; 2) computationally less expensive approach to maximum margin calculation than standard SVM-based techniques; and 3) inexpensive recomputation of the solution suitable for real time dynamic applications.

The new approach uses a weighted Euclidean distance based dissimilarity measure during all affinity evaluations. With the help of FCM clustering, the initial antibodies that image features of data set are extracted effectively, and then a clonal selection algorithm named CLONALG is adopted for each training instance to constitute the memory cells. Finally, classification is performed in a K-Nearest Neighbor approach with the developed set of memory cells. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets from UCI machine learning repository demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm as a classification technique. Compared with generic CLOALG artificial immune classifiers, the hybrid classifier not only can decrease the computational time, but also can achieve higher classification accuracy.

As for multi-label classification, our approach incorporates contextual information about action not only temporal information but hierarchical information of actions. Inference tends to be complex so as to achieve such complex recognition scheme, however, we propose an efficient Viterbi-like decoding algorithm which integrates forward algorithm and loopy message passing algorithm. As for the learning process, the algorithm optimizes the parameters so as to maximize log likelihood of the model. Boosting, ensemble approach of machine learning, is leveraged to provide efficient feature selection framework in the training process. The experimental results show that the proposed method successfully exploits the impact of contextual information then significantly outperforms the traditional approaches in dynamic gait motion classification.

Our system uses a composite short-term and long-term learning approach to learn the semantics of an image. Specifically, the short-term learning technique applies fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) learning on user labeled and additional chosen image blocks to learn a more accurate boundary for separating the relevant and irrelevant blocks at each feedback iteration. The long-term learning technique applies a novel semantic clustering technique to adaptively learn and update the semantic concepts at each query session.

Specifically, we present findings that address the two primary challenges for this prediction task: (1) extracting meaningful features from the gaze information, and (2) casting the prediction task as a machine learning (ML) problem. The results show that our approach based on profile hidden Markov models are up to 96% accurate and can make the determination as fast as one minute into the collaboration, with only 5% of gaze observations registered. We also provide a qualitative analysis of gaze patterns that reveal the relative expertise level of the paired users in a collaborative learning user study.

These semantic features are group action, person action and person speaking. For this purpose low level acoustic and visual features are combined with high level semantic ones. After the feature fusion, a segmentation and classification are performed by Hidden Markov Models. The evaluation shows that an absolute improvement of 6.5% can be achieved. The frame error rate is reduced to 38.1% by using acoustic and all semantic features. The best model using only low level features achieves a frame error rate of 44.6%, which is the best one reported on this data set.

Building upon our findings, we propose a new, simpler pedestrian detecting framework based on the covariance features. We conduct feature selection and weak classifier training in the Euclidean space for faster computation. To this end, two machine learning algorithms have been designed: AdaBoost with weighted Fisher linear discriminant analysis (WLDA) based weak classifiers and Greedy Sparse Linear Discriminant Analysis (GSLDA). To further accelerate the detection, we employ a faster strategy, multiple cascade layers with heterogeneous features, to exploit the efficiency of the Haar-like features and the discriminative power of the covariance features. Experimental results shown on different datasets prove that the new pedestrian detection is not only comparable to the performance of the state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors but it also performs at a faster speed.

Automatic Classification of Large Changes into Maintenance Categories	ICPC: 2009 IEEE 17TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PROGRAM COMPREHENSION	International Conference on Program Comprehension		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 17th International Conference on Program Comprehension	MAY 17-19, 2009	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc			SOFTWARE REPOSITORIES	Large software systems undergo significant evolution during their lifespan, yet often individual changes are not well documented. In this work, we seek to automatically classify large changes into various categories of maintenance tasks - corrective, adaptive, perfective, feature addition, and non-functional improvement using machine learning techniques. In a previous paper, we found that many commits could be classified easily and reliably based solely on the manual analysis of the commit metadata and commit messages (i.e., without reference to the source code). Our extension is the automation of classification by training Machine Learners on features extracted from the commit metadata, such as the word distribution of a commit message, commit author, and modules modified. We validated the results of the learners via 10-fold cross validation, which achieved accuracies consistently above 50%, indicating good to fair results. We found that the identity of the author of a commit provided much information about the maintenance class of a commit, almost as much as the words of the commit message. This implies that for most large commits, the Source Control System (SCS) commit messages plus the commit author identity is enough information to accurately and automatically categorize the nature of the maintenance task.

Our tool automatically analyzes the debugging situation at a statement and reports a prioritized list of relevant bug fix suggestions that are likely to guide the developer to an appropriate fix at that statement. BugFix incorporates ideas from machine learning to automatically learn from new debugging situations and bug fixes over time. This enables more effective prediction of the most relevant bug-fix suggestions for newly-encountered debugging situations. The tool takes into account the static structure of a statement, the dynamic values used at that statement by both passing and failing runs, and the interesting value mapping pairs [17] associated with that statement. We present a case study illustrating the efficacy of BugFix in helping developers to fix bugs.

In particular, we investigate an approach based on the use of Boosting for robust visual tracking of color objects in an underwater environment. To this end, we use AdaBoost, the most common variant of the Boosting algorithm, to select a number of low-complexity but moderately accurate color feature trackers and we combine their outputs. The novelty of our approach lies in the design of this family of weak trackers, which enhances a straightforward color segmentation tracker in multiple ways. From a large and diverse family of possible filters, we select a small subset that optimizes the performance of our trackers. The tracking process applies these trackers on the input video frames, and the final tracker output is chosen based on the weights of the final array of trackers. By using computationally inexpensive, but somewhat accurate trackers as members of the ensemble, the system is able to run at quasi real-time, and thus, is deployable on-board our underwater robot. We present quantitative cross-validation results of our spatio-chromatic visual tracker, and conclude by pointing out some difficulties faced and subsequent shortcomings in the experiments we performed, along with directions of future research in the area of ensemble tracking in real-time.

The main control interface is represented by surface electromyography (EMG): the activation potentials of the remnants of large muscles of the stump are used in a non-natural way to control one or, at best, two degrees-of-freedom. This has two drawbacks: first, the dexterity of the prosthesis is limited, leading to poor interaction with the environment; second, the patient undergoes a long training time. As more dexterous hand prostheses are put on the market, the need for a finer and more natural control arises. Machine learning can be employed to this end. A desired feature is that of providing a pre-trained model to the patient, so that a quicker and better interaction can be obtained. To this end we propose model adaptation with least-squares SVMs, a technique that allows the automatic tuning of the degree of adaptation. We test the effectiveness of the approach on a database of EMG signals gathered from human subjects. We show that, when pre-trained models are used, the number of training samples needed to reach a certain performance is reduced, and the overall performance is increased, compared to what would be achieved by starting from scratch.

The method operates on targets consisting of kinematic chains with known geometry. The tracked target is divided into one or more areas of consistent appearance. The appearance of each area is represented by a classifier trained to assign a class-conditional probability to image feature vectors. A search is then performed on the configuration space of the target to find the maximum likelihood configuration. In the search, candidate hypotheses are evaluated by rendering a 3D model of the target object and measuring its consistency with the class probability map. The method is demonstrated for tool tracking on videos from two surgical domains, as well as in a human hand-tracking task.

Current solutions rely on heuristics that lack generalisation properties, in particular when range sensors are the only source of information about the robot's surrounding environment. This paper presents a machine learning approach for the loop closure detection problem using range sensors. A binary classifier based on boosting is used to detect loop closures. The algorithm performs robustly, even under potential occlusions and significant changes in rotation and translation. We developed a number of features, extracted from range data, that are invariant to rotation. Additionally, we present a general framework for scan-matching SLAM in outdoor environments. Experimental results in large scale urban environments show the robustness of the approach, with a detection rate of 85% and a false alarm rate of only 1%. The proposed algorithm can be computed in real-time and achieves competitive performance with no manual specification of thresholds given the features.

Motor primitives offer one of the most promising frameworks for the application of machine learning techniques in this context. Employing an improved form of the dynamic systems motor primitives originally introduced by Ijspeert et al. [2], we show how both discrete and rhythmic tasks can be learned using a concerted approach of both imitation and reinforcement learning. For doing so, we present both learning algorithms and representations targeted for the practical application in robotics. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to include a start-up phase in rhythmic primitives.

The head motion adversely affects visual sensors embedded in the robot's head. Mammals stabilize the head using a vestibulocollie reflex that detects linear and rotational acceleration. In this paper we describe the use of a machine learning algorithm that utilizes signals from an artificial vestibular system that has been embedded in the robot's head. Our approach can rapidly learn to compensate for the head movements that appear when no stabilization mechanism is present. The stabilization using a Sony Aibo robot occurs in only a few gait cycles.

The ability to perform monaural (single-ear) localization is important to many animals; indeed, monaural cues are also the primary method by which humans decide if a sound comes from the front or back, as well as estimate its elevation. Such monaural localization is made possible by the structure of the pinna (outer ear), which modifies sound in a way that is dependent on its incident angle. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to monaural localization, using only a single microphone and an "artificial pinna" (that distorts sound in a direction-dependent way). Our approach models the typical distribution of natural and artificial sounds, as well as the direction-dependent changes to sounds induced by the pinna. Our experimental results also show that the algorithm is able to fairly accurately localize a wide range of sounds, such as human speech, dog barking, waterfall, thunder, and so on. In contrast to microphone arrays, this approach also offers the potential of significantly more compact, as well as lower cost and power, devices for sounds localization.

In image space these paths correspond to continuous segments that can be thought of as clusters embedded in image feature space. These segments very often translate directly to traversable ground plane. In this paper we build the intuition for semi-supervised methods in path identification and present a Markov random walk based approach that requires very few labeled points. The method creates a nearest neighbor graph representation of the current image frame using features deemed suitable for the task and propagates labels based on the concept of absorbing Markov chains. We extend this formalism to the task of dynamically identifying traversable and non-traversable regions in the incoming image frames. We present results on actual terrains corresponding to test courses used by the LAGR test team. The results demonstrate that with minimal initial supervision the robot can navigate to the goal. We also conduct comparisons of our path labeling technique against other machine learning techniques including nonlinear support vector machines on hand labeled data. The results demonstrate that our semi-supervised approach is proficient in the domain of path traversal in unstructured domains.

Even a single-digit performance improvement can significantly reduce the cost and power consumption of a data center. Unfortunately, achieving sustained improvement, even if modest, is difficult. Data centers are dynamic environments where applications are frequently released and servers are continually upgraded. For maintainability and fault tolerance, the physical capabilities and configuration of the servers are abstracted from the application programmer. We study application performance tinder different processor prefetch configurations. These configurations are largely transparent to the programmer, yet we observe a wide range of performance when comparing the worst and best configurations, with relative performance improvement ranging from 1.4% to 75.1%. Alarmingly, one application that consumes many processor cycles has a 23.6% improvement. Default prefetch configurations favor aggressively prefetching memory, which benefits most applications, but some data center applications have highly tuned memory behavior and aggressive prefetching severely decreases performance. We develop a tuning framework which attempts to predict the optimal configuration based on hardware performance counters. It applies to a large number of performance-critical data center applications without modifying the source code or binaries. The framework achieves performance within 1% of the best performance of a suite of important data center applications.

While some studies investigate a handful of such metrics in a comparative fashion, an evaluation of specific relationships among a large set of commonly-used performance metrics is much needed in the data mining and machine learning community. This study provides a unique insight into the underlying relationships among classifier performance metrics. We do so with a large case study involving 35 datasets from various domains and the C4.5 decision tree algorithm. A common property of the 35 datasets is that they suffer from the class imbalance problem. Our approach is based on applying factor analysis to the classifier performance space which is characterized by 22 performance metrics. It is shown that such a large number of performance metrics can be grouped into two-to-four relationship-based groups extracted by factor analysis. This work is a step in the direction of providing the analyst with an improved understanding about the different relationships and groupings among the performance metrics, thus facilitating the selection of performance metrics that capture relatively independent aspects of a classifier's performance.

We propose a statistical approach using efficient learning features for the natural prediction of the Korean prosodic phrase boundary. These new features reflect factors that affect the generation of the prosodic phrase boundary better than existing learning features. Notably, moreover, learning features that are extracted according to the hand-crafted prosodic phrase prediction rule impart higher accuracy. We evaluated the new learning features in terms of their efficiency in predicting the prosodic phrase boundary, using CRFs (Conditional Random Fields). The results were 84.63% accuracy for three levels and 80.14% accuracy for six levels.

Focused crawling is proposed to selectively seek out pages that are relevant to a predefined set of topics without downloading all of the Web. We present a novel approach for building an intelligent focused crawler which deals with evaluating the page's content relevance to the E-commerce topic by the domain ontology and the hyperlinks connection to the commercial web pages by link analysis. In the process of crawling, the domain ontology can evolve automatically by machine learning based on the statistics and rules. Experiments have been performed, and the results show that our approach is more effective than the other traditional crawling algorithms, and prevents the topic-drift with higher harvest rate.

SVM is often chosen as the learning machine because of its good generalization ability in small sample decision problem. However, in practical applications, because the fault samples are hard to acquire, the number of fault sample is far less than that for normal samples, which makes fault diagnosis a typical imbalanced problem. And it is found that traditional SVM can not ensure good performance in this situation. So in this paper, we propose an improved SVM-mu SVM. In the new method, a parameter mu was introduced into the decision function, so that weight for fault class can be adjusted, and consequently the influence of fault class in decision function can be enlarged. Simulation experiments show that this method is effective in solving the problem of analog circuit fault diagnosis.

While popular systems like Snort are used in many network locations, comprehensive deployment across Tier-1 service provider networks is costly due to the need for high-speed monitors at many network ingress points. Since ISPs already collect flow statistics ubiquitously, can we use it for detecting the same anomalies as the packet based rules in spite of aggregation and absence of payload information? We exploit correlations between packet and flow level information via a machine learning (ML) approach to associate packet level alarms with a feature vector derived from flow records on the same traffic. We describe a system architecture for network-wide flow-alarming and describe the steps required to establish a proof-of-concept. We evaluate prediction accuracy of candidate ML algorithms on actual packet traces. The duration of prediction effectiveness is an issue for ML approaches and more so in resource intensive network applications. Initial results show little impairment of performance over periods of one or two weeks.

For a cognitive radio network to achieve this goal, spectrum policies and the ability to enforce them are necessary. Detection of an unauthorized (anomalous) usage is one of the critical issues in spectrum etiquette enforcement. In this paper, we present a network structure for dynamic spectrum access and formulate the anomalous usage detection problem using statistical significance testing. The detection problem is classified into two subproblems. For the case where no authorized signal is present, we describe the existing cooperative sensing schemes and investigate the impact of signal path loss on their performance. For the case where an authorized signal is present, we propose three methods that detect anomalous transmissions by making use of the characteristics of radio propagation. Analytical models are formulated for two special cases and, due to the intractability of the general problem, we present an algorithm using machine learning techniques to solve the general case. Our simulation results show that our approaches can effectively detect unauthorized spectrum usage with high detection rate and low false positive rate.

However, for industrial production these systems have to be set up and calibrated manually with much effort. Our objective is to apply intelligent data processing that results in a cognitive technical system that can learn how to weld, speed up the configuring process, and reduce costs. While monitoring laser welding with cameras and optical sensors has already been demonstrated elsewhere, this paper emphasizes the benefits of monitoring with acoustic sensors and feature extraction. Using acoustic sensors, the cognitive system is more sensitive to strong optical radiation. Several combined methods such as wavelet analysis, fast Fourier transformation, and linear dimensionality reduction are evaluated with sensor data from real experiments.

Only when gene and gene product mentions are correctly identified could other more complex tasks, such as, gene normalization and gene-gene interaction extraction, be performed effectively. In this paper, six divergent models are implemented with different machine learning algorithms and dissimilar feature sets. We integrate these models to further improve the tagging performance. Experiments conducted on the datasets of BioCreative II GM task show that our best performing integration model can achieve an F-score of 87.70%, which outperforms most of the state-of-the-art systems. We also apply CRF++ to see if Kuo et al.'s integration algorithm based on likelihood scores and dictionary-filtering is portable to another CRF package.

Most of previous studies adopted machine learning techniques taking it as a multi-class text classification task. However, since building labeled training data is often expensive, some researchers put more interest in unsupervised techniques. With the subject of online restaurant reviews, this paper presents a new multi-class bootstrapping algorithm to learn aspect-related terms to be used for aspect identification. Experimental results demonstrate that our method without requiring labeled training data achieves good performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art supervised learning techniques.

It enjoys a special status in linguistic theories especially in dependency grammars, which require the exceptional treatment. This paper proposes three schemes to analyse coordinating structure and builds dependency treebanks for automatic parsing. We find that different schemes to annotate and parse the coordinating structure bring some distinctions in precision and other aspects. The factors, such as the part-of-speech categories matching with their syntactic functions, may play an important role in dependency parsing. We also calculate the mean dependency distance of three schemes, and the result shows that single-directional and smaller mean dependency distance is helpful for better machine learning and higher precision.

In this study we propose a method of emotion recognition at sentence level based on a relative large emotion annotation corpus (Ren-CECps). From this corpus, we get the emotion lexicons for the eight basic emotions (expect, joy, love, surprise, anxiety, sorrow, angry and hate). Statistics show that the emotion lexicons derived from Ren-CECps are used more often in real use of language for emotional expressions than HOWNET sentimental lexicons. Kernel methods are state-of-the-art for solving machine learning problems. Polynomial kernel (PK) method is used to compute the similarities between sentences and the eight emotion lexicons. Then the experiential knowledge derived from Ren-CECps is used to recognize whether the eight emotion categories are present in a sentence. This method obtain 62.7% F-measure.

It advocates using a small amount of seed information and a large collection of easily-obtained unlabeled data. Hierarchy bootstrapping makes use of seed words and seed patterns to build a learning program, which extracts more characteristic words using Scalar Clusters. These characteristic words have semantic similarity with seed words. Then more extraction patterns could be learned automatically and added to the knowledge Base, moreover, we also pay attention to semantic and pragmatic knowledge for entity relation extraction.

The purpose of this work is to study the applicability of mentioned three trainable models for cross-language text summarization. For model training, we use several training features such as sentence position, sentence centrality, number of Name Entity and so on. For model testing, Chinese on-line news and Japanese news are used as test data which are extracted from web pages. We evaluate each model by measuring the precision at the compression rate 10%, 20% and 30%. MMS is a baseline method. The results show that HMM, CRF and GMM have remarkable increases than MMS on both Chinese and Japanese text summarization by using the same training features. Especially, GMM model make a best performance in all tests.

J	Lim, J; Pyun, K				Lim, Johan; Pyun, Kyungsuk (Peter)			Cost-Effective Hidden Markov Model-Based Image Segmentation	IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						Convex hull; hidden Markov models; image segmentation; iso-cost line; ROC convex analysis; ROC curve	GAUSS MIXTURE-MODELS; CLASSIFICATION	Image segmentation is an important preprocessing step in a sophisticated and complex image processing algorithm. In segmenting real-world images, the cost of misclassification could depend on the true class. For example, in a two-class (negative or positive class) problem, the cost of misclassifying positive to negative class could not be equal to that of misclassifying negative to positive class. However, existing algorithms do not take into account the unequal misclassification cost. In this letter, motivated by recent advances in machine learning theory, we introduce a procedure to minimize the misclassification cost with class-dependent cost. The procedure assumes the hidden Markov model (HMM) which has been popularly used for image segmentation in recent years. We represent all feasible HMM-based segmenters (or classifiers) as a set of points in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space. Then, the optimal segmenter (or classifier) is found by computing the tangential point between the iso-cost line with given slope and the convex hull of the feasible set in the ROC space. We illustrate the procedure by segmenting aerial images with different selection of misclassification costs.

It can be used to detect a variety of malicious codes which can only be executed with the administrator's authority. Therefore, much research is being done on detection methods using the characteristics of the Native API. Most of these researches are being done by using supervised learning methods of machine learning. However, the classification standards of Anti-Virus companies do not reflect the characteristics of the Native API Call. As a result the population data used in the supervised learning methods is not accurate. Therefore, more research is needed on the topic of classification standards using the Native API for detection. This paper proposes a method for classifying malicious codes using a fuzzy clustering method with the Native API Call standard. The accuracy of the proposed method uses machine learning to compare detection rates with previous classifying methods for evaluation.

J	Siu, MH; Yang, X; Gish, H				Siu, Man-Hung; Yang, Xi; Gish, Herbert			Discriminatively Trained GMMs for Language Classification Using Boosting Methods	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						Boosting; discriminative training; language identification	SPEECH RECOGNITION	In language identification and other speech applications, discriminatively trained models often outperform nondiscriminative models trained with the maximum-likelihood criterion. For instance, discriminative Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are typically trained by optimizing some discriminative criteria that can be computationally expensive and complex to implement. In this paper, we explore a novel approach to discriminative GMM training by using a variant the boosting framework (R. Schapire, "The boosting approach to machine learning, an overview," Proc. MSRI Workshop on Nonlinear Estimation and Classification, 2002) from machine learning, in which an ensemble of GMMs is trained sequentially. We have extended the purview of boosting to class conditional models (as opposed to discriminative models such as classification trees). The effectiveness of our boosting variation comes from the emphasis on working with the misclassified data to achieve discriminatively trained models. Our variant of boosting also includes utilizing low confidence data classifications as well as misclassified examples in classifier generation. We further apply our boosting approach to anti-models to achieve additional performance gains. We have applied our discriminative training approach to a variety of language identification experiments using the 12-language NIST 2003 language identification task. We show the significant performance improvements that can be obtained. The experiments include both acoustic as well as token-based speech models. Our best performing boosted GMM-based system on the 12-language verification task has a 2.3% EER.

Support Vector Machines for Automated Recognition of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome From ECG Recordings	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						ECG-derived respiration (EDR); heart rate variability (HRV); obstructive sleep apnea; support vector machines (SVMs); wavelet	HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; WAVELET TRANSFORM; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; ELECTROCARDIOGRAM; CLASSIFICATION; FREQUENCY; ADULTS; IDENTIFICATION; HYPERTENSION	Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is associated with cardiovascular morbidity as well as excessive daytime sleepiness and poor quality of life. In this study, we apply a machine learning technique [support vector machines (SVMs)] for automated recognition of OSAS types from their nocturnal ECG recordings. A total of 125 sets of nocturnal ECG recordings acquired from normal subjects (OSAS-) and subjects with OSAS (OSAS+), each of approximately 8 It in duration, were analyzed. Features extracted from successive wavelet coefficient levels after wavelet decomposition of signals due to heart rate variability (HRV) from RR intervals and ECG-derived respiration (EDR) from R waves of QRS amplitudes were used as inputs to the SVMs to recognize OSAS+/- subjects. Using leave-one-out technique, the maximum accuracy of classification for 83 training sets was found to be 100% for SVMs using a subset of selected combination of HRV and EDR features. Independent test results oil 42 subjects showed that it correctly recognized 24 out of 26 OSAS+ subjects and 15 out of 16 OSAS- subjects (accuracy = 92.8%; Cohen's kappa. value of 0.85). For estimating the relative severity of OSAS, the posterior probabilities of SVM outputs were calculated and compared with respective apnea/hypopnea index. These results suggest superior performance of SVMs in OSAS recognition supported by wavelet-based features of ECG. The results demonstrate considerable potential in applying SVMs in an ECG-based screening device that can aid a sleep specialist in the initial assessment of patients with suspected OSAS.

Previous approaches that have been used for this concept mapping have mainly relied on term-level matching, whereby the medical terms in the raw text and their synonyms are matched with concepts in a terminology database. These previous approaches, however, have shortcomings that limit their efficacy in CC concept mapping, where the concepts for CC data are often represented by associative terms rather than by synonyms. Therefore, herein we propose a concept mapping scheme based on a two-phase matching approach, especially for application to Korean CCs, which uses term-level complete matching in the first phase and concept-level matching based on concept learning in the second phase. The proposed concept-level matching suggests the method to learn all the terms (associative terms as well as synonyms) that represent the concept and predict the most probable concept for a CC based on the learned terms. Experiments on 1204 CCs extracted from 15 618 discharge summaries of Korean EMRs showed that the proposed method gave significantly improved F-measure values compared to the baseline system, with improvements of up to 73.57%.

J	Zhang, Y; Bhargava, B				Zhang, Yu; Bhargava, Bharat			Self-Learning Disk Scheduling	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Machine learning; application-transparent adaptation; I/O; operating system		The performance of disk I/O schedulers is affected by many factors such as workloads, file systems, and disk systems. Disk scheduling performance can be improved by tuning scheduler parameters such as the length of read timers. Scheduler performance tuning is mostly done manually. To automate this process, we propose four self-learning disk scheduling schemes: Change-sensing Round-Robin, Feedback Learning, Per-request Learning, and Two-layer Learning. Experiments show that the novel Two-layer Learning Scheme performs best. It integrates the workload-level and request-level learning algorithms. It employs feedback learning techniques to analyze workloads, change scheduling policy, and tune scheduling parameters automatically. We discuss schemes to choose features for workload learning, divide and recognize workloads, generate training data, and integrate machine learning algorithms into the Two-layer Learning Scheme. We conducted experiments to compare the accuracy, performance, and overhead of five machine learning algorithms: decision tree, logistic regression, naive Bayes, neural network, and support vector machine algorithms. Experiments with real-world and synthetic workloads show that self-learning disk scheduling can adapt to a wide variety of workloads, file systems, disk systems, and user preferences. It outperforms existing disk schedulers by as much as 15.8 percent while consuming less than 3 percent -5 percent of CPU time.

Different with the existing approaches which align hierarchical structures like sub-trees, our method conducts alignment on chunks. The alignment is finished through a simultaneous bilingual chunking algorithm. Using the constrains of chunk correspondence between source language (SL) and target language (TL), our algorithm can dramatically reduce search space, support time synchronous DP algorithm, and lead to highly consistent chunking. Furthermore, by unifying the POS tagging and chunking in the search process, our algorithm alleviates effectively the influence of POS tagging deficiency to the chunking result.

In this paper, two baselines are used to validate the results of our experiments. A set of features of individual feed is firstly constructed by decision tree to represent the similarity distribution of every feed against certain interest. Features are then selected by computing their centroid distances to standard centroids of relevant feeds and irrelevant feeds. Later, SVM classifier is used to predict and re-rank the top 250 results of two baselines. The result shows that our algorithm can effectively present the feeds' similarity distribution and re-rank them into a new order which has much better MAP.

The architecture is composed of two steps: in the first one, a separating borderline between the two classes is piecewise constructed by a set of centroids calculated by a modified clustering algorithm, based on information theory; each of these centroids define a region where, in the second step of the proposed architecture, a hyperplane is constructed and adjusted by means of one-layer neural networks. This new method allows for binary classification while maintaining adequate use of computational resources, a common problem for machine learning methods. The proposed architecture is applied over classical benchmark classification problems and data sets, and its results are compared with those obtained by other well-known statistical and machine learning classifiers.

The paper shows an efficient, iterative procedure to evaluate Maximal-Discrepancy bounds for this kind of classifiers. Empirical results on UCI datasets show that this approach can attain tighter bounds to the run-time classification error.

However, their development usually requires a manual effort from the human expert in which several parameter configurations (architectures, training parameters, etc) are tried. This paper proposes a new evolutionary method that evolves ANNs without any participation from the human expert. This system can be used to evolve feed-forward and recurrent ANNs. A real-world problem has been used to test the behaviour of this system: detection of epileptic seizures in EEG signals. A comparison of the results obtained using recurrent and feed-forward ANNs to solve this problem is presented in this paper. This comparison shows the good accuracies obtained by this method (almost 100%). Moreover, these results show an important feature: the system tries to evolve simple ANNs, with a low number of neurons and connections (in many cases, the networks have only 1 hidden neuron).

Due to the problematic of this dataset, several sophisticated machine learning algorithms have been tried by different authors. In this paper a new approach is proposed that consists in a combination of a discretizator, a filter method and a very simple classical classifier. The results obtained show the adequacy of the method, that achieves comparable or even better performances than those of other more complicated algorithms, but with a considerable reduction in the number of input features. The proposed method has also been tried over another two large datasets maintaining the same behavior as in the KDD Cup 99 dataset.

This is due to the unprecedented size of streaming data being collected by information technology. Incremental learning is considered one of the key concepts for learning from streaming data where a learned model is updated when new data becomes available in time. In this paper, we study RBF-SVM local incremental learning. The RBF-SVM decision function has been shown in the literature to have local properties which can be beneficial if they hold during learning as well. A learning machine that has local properties during learning is very desirable for incremental learning; this is because the machine will need to be updated only locally to accommodate the newly collected training data. We show via mathematical formalization and experimental verification that RBF-SVM preserves the local properties during learning. We also propose an estimate of the size of the regions in the learned model that need to be updated during the learning increments.

The key technique in the REV is adopting the optimal control strategy for the best performance. As the premise, a correct driving condition discrimination has an extremely important significance. This paper proposes an intelligent multi-feature statistical approach to discriminate the driving conditions of the HEV automatically. First of all, this approach samples the driving cycle periodically. Then it extracts multiple statistical features and tests their significance by statistical analysis. After that, it applies SVM and other machine learning methods to discriminate the driving conditions intelligently and automatically. Compared to the others, the proposed approach can compute fast and discriminate in real time during the whole HEV running. In our experiments, it reaches an accuracy of 97%. As a result, our approach can mine the valid information in the data completely and extract multiple features which have clear meanings and significance. Finally, according to the prediction experiment by a neural network and the fitting experiment by the ARMA model, it turns out that our proposed approach raises the efficiency of controlling the HEV considerably.

In many supervised-learning applications, training data can be naturally separated into several groups, and incorporating this group information into learning may improve generalization. Recently, Vapnik 191 proposed general approach to formalizing such problems, known as Learning With Structured Data (LWSD) and its SVM-based optimization formulation called SVM+. Liang and Cherkassky [5,6] showed empirical validation of SVM+ for classification, and its connections to Multi-Task Learning (MTL) approaches in machine learning. This paper builds upon this recent work [5,6,9] and describes a new methodology for regression problems, combining Vapnik's SVM+ regression [9] and the MTL classification setting [6], for regression problems. We also show empirical comparisons between standard SVM regression, SVM+, and proposed SVM+MTL regression method. Practical implementation of new learning technologies, such as SVM+, is often hindered by their complexity, i.e. large number of tuning parameters (vs standard inductive SVM regression). To this end, we provide a practical scheme for model selection that combines analytic selection of parameters for SVM regression [3] and resampling-based methods for selecting model parameters specific to SVM+ and SVM+MTL.

The process for obtaining the coefficients is carried out in several steps. First, an Evolutionary Programming (EP) algorithm is applied, aimed to produce a RBF Neural Network (RBFNN) with a reduced number of RBF transformations and the simplest structure possible. Then, the input space is transformed by adding the nonlinear transformations of the input variables given by the RBFs of the best individual in the last generation. Finally, a maximum likelihood optimization method determines the coefficients associated with a multilogistic regression model built on this transformed input space. In this final step, two different multilogistic regression algorithms are applied, one that considers all initial and RBF covariates (MLRIRBF) and another one that incrementally constructs the model and applies cross-validation, resulting in an automatic covariate selection (MLRIRBF*). The methodology proposed is tested using six benchmark classification problems from well-known machine learning problems. The results are compared with the corresponding multilogistic regression methodologies applied over the initial input space, to the RBFNNs obtained by the EP algorithm (RBFEP) and to other competitive machine learning techniques. The MLRIRBF* models are found to be better than the corresponding multilogistic regression methodologies and the RBFEP method for almost all datasets, and obtain the highest mean accuracy rank when compared to the rest of methods in all datasets.

Ensembles are efficiently constructed with the random subspace method (RSM) performed in the instance or in the principal components (PCs) spaces. In this paper, we extend RSM to explore the synergy in the characteristics of these two spaces, with a method referred to as RSM-IPCS. Using 24 datasets from the UCI machine learning repository, we show an enhanced performance of RSM-IPCS in comparison to the original RSM and RSM in PCs space, in terms of higher accuracy and smaller variances. Since RSM-IPCS exhibited at least a similar performance to the best method in a separate space, it opens the way for optimization of ensembles based on the combination of multiple spaces.

GP has intrinsic advantages in data modeling, given its construction in the framework of Bayesian hieratical modeling and no requirement for a priori information of function forms in Bayesian reference. In light of its success in various applications, utilizing GP for time-series forecasting has gained increasing interest in recent years. This paper is concerned with using GP for multiple-step-ahead time-series forecasting, an important type of time-series analysis. Utilizing a large number of real-world time series, this paper evaluates two different GP modeling strategies (direct and recursive) for performing multiple-step-ahead forecasting.

Compared with single model fully connected neural networks, NNTrees are more suitable for structural learning, and faster for decision making. Recently, we proposed an efficient algorithm for inducing the NNTrees based on a heuristic grouping strategy. In this paper, we try to induce smaller NNTrees based on dimensionality reduction. The goal is to induce NNTrees that are compact enough to be implemented in a VLSI chip. Two methods are investigated for dimensionality reduction. One is the principal component analysis (PCA), and another is linear discriminant analysis (LDA). We conducted experiments on several public databases, and found that the NNTree obtained after dimensionality reduction usually has less nodes and much less parameters, while the performance is comparable with the NNTree obtained without dimensionality reduction.

Spatial Pyramids and Two-layer Stacking SVM Classifiers for Image Categorization: A Comparative Study	IJCNN: 2009 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS, VOLS 1- 6	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks	JUN 14-19, 2009	Atlanta, GA	Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc				Recent research in image recognition has shown that combining multiple descriptors is a very useful way to improve classification performance. Furthermore, the use of spatial pyramids that compute descriptors at multiple spatial resolution levels generally increases the discriminative power of the descriptors. In this paper we focus on combination methods that combine multiple descriptors at multiple spatial resolution levels. A possible problem of the naive solution to create one large input vector for a machine learning classifier such as a support vector machine, is that the input vector becomes of very large dimensionality, which can increase problems of overfitting and hinder generalization performance. Therefore we propose the use of stacking support vector machines where at the first layer each support vector machine receives the input constructed by each single descriptor and is trained to compute the right output class. A second layer support vector machine is then used to combine the class probabilities of all trained first layer support vector models to learn the right output class given these reduced input vectors. We have performed experiments on 20 classes from the Caltech object database with 10 different single descriptors at 3 different resolutions. The results show that our 2-layer stacking approach outperforms the naive approach that combines all descriptors directly in a very large single input vector.

This unbalanced class distribution causes performance degradation. Some ensemble solutions have been proposed for the class imbalance problem. Diversity has been proved to be an influential aspect in ensemble learning, which describes the degree of different decisions made by classifiers. However, none of those proposed solutions explore the impact of diversity on imbalanced data sets. In addition, most of them are based on re-sampling techniques to rebalance class distribution, and over-sampling usually causes overfitting (high generalisation error). This paper investigates if diversity can relieve this problem by using negative correlation learning (NCL) model, which encourages diversity explicitly by adding a penalty term in the error function of neural networks. A variation model of NCL is also proposed - NCLCost. Our study shows that diversity has a direct impact on the measure of recall. It is also a factor that causes the reduction of F-measure. In addition, although NCL-based models with extreme settings do not produce better recall values of minority class than SMOTEBoost [1], they have slightly better performance of F-measure and G-mean than both independent ANNs and SMOTEBoost and better recall than independent ANNs.

Identification of potential CGIs has contributed not only to the prediction of promoters of most house-keeping genes and many tissue-specific genes but also to the understanding of the epigenetic causes of cancer. The most current methods for identifying CGIs suffered from various limitations and involved a lot of human intervention for search purpose. In this paper, we implement a HMM-based CGIs identification system, namely CpG-Discover. Experiments have been conducted on the EMBL human DNA database and in comparison with other widely-used tools. The controlled experimental results indicate that our system is a promising tool and has the capability of locating CGIs accurately. In addition, our system has significant differences from other tools in that it avoids the disadvantages of using sliding windows and it reduces the large amount of human intervention needed to search for or to combine potential CGIs (such as, the thresholds of initial density or distance seed). Therefore, given annotated training data set, our system has the adaptability to find other specific nucleotides sequences in DNA.

Based on these forecastings, we choose two out of the three currencies listed above and build a portfolio by adopting multi-objective portfolio optimization techniques by maximizing the return and minimizing the risk. Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) theorem guarantees that the optimal portfolio is reachable. Simulation results show that the optimal portforlio investment can achieve superior return performance compared with three single currency investment benchmarks.

ALH algorithm has recently shown extremely good results in classification, and it is adopted for solving regression tasks here. It is a local margin maximizing algorithm in the original, weighted, input space blending a Nearest Neighbors (NN) based approaches and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) ideas about the maximal margin. In performing such a task it uses only K closest points to the query data point. Results for four benchmarking regression data sets show superior performance to SVMs as well as to the other established regression methods.

The artifacts may contain eye-blinking, muscle noise, heart signal, line noise, and environmental effect. Such noises often make the raw EEG signals not very useful for extraction/identification of physiological phenomena from EEG. The independent component analysis (ICA) is a popular technique for artifact removal in brain research and some reports demonstrate that ICA can remove the artifacts with lower (acceptable) loss of information. But, these reports select useful independent components manually, primarily by looking at the scalp-plots. This is of great inconvenience and is a barrier for BCI or real-time applications of EEG. In this paper, we demonstrate that machine learning methods could be quite effective to discriminate useful independent components from artifacts and our findings suggests the possibility of developing a 'universal" machine for artifact removal in EEG.

This paper reports an improved machine learning approach based on the wavelet neural network (AWN), which associates a feature selection method, namely, the conditional T-test. It is used in the development of cancer classification by using benchmark microarray data. The experimental results showed that the proposed classifiers achieved a superior accuracy, which ranges from 92% to 100%. Performance comparisons are also made with other classifiers which show that this proposed approach outperforms most of them.

Social Computing is a novel and emerging computing paradigm that involves a multi-disciplinary approach in analyzing and modeling social behaviors on different media and platforms to produce intelligent and interactive applications and results. In this paper, we give a brief survey of the various machine learning and computational techniques used in Social Computing by first examining the social platforms, e.g., social network sites, social media, social games, social bookmarking, and social knowledge sites, where computational methodology is required to collect, extract, process, mine, and visualize the data. We then present surveys on more specific instances of computation tasks and techniques, e.g., social network analysis, link modeling and mining, ranking, sentiment analysis, etc., that are being used on these social platforms to obtain desirable results. Lastly, we present a small subset of an extensive reference list, which contains over 140 highly relevant references relating to the recent development in the computational aspects of Social Computing.

However, when images consist of combination of patterns, a preprocessing step of segmentation is required to avoid combinatorial explosion of the training phase. In practical applications, segmentation is a context dependent task which itself requires recognition. In this paper we propose and develop a biologically inspired neural architecture that can recognize and count an arbitrary collection of objects even if trained with individual objects, without making use of additional segmentation algorithms. The two essential features that govern the neurons in this algorithm are 1. dynamical feedback and 2. competition for activation. We show analytically that while the equations governing the output neurons are highly nonlinear in individual feature amplitudes, they are linear in groups of feature amplitudes. We further demonstrate through simulations, that our architecture can precisely count and recognize scenes in which three and four non-overlapping patterns are presented simultaneously. The ability to generalize numerosity outside the training distribution with a simple learning scheme, lack of connection weights and segmentation algorithms prove regulatory feedback networks not only beneficial for machine learning tasks but also for biological modeling of animal vision.

To deal with high-dimensional data efficiently, learning core properties of given data set is important. The manifold learning methods such as ISOMap try to identify a low-dimensional manifold from a set of unorganized samples. ISOMap method is an extension of the classical multidimensional scaling method for dimension reduction, which find a linear subspace in which dissimilarity between data points is preserved. In order to measure dissimilarity, ISOMap uses the geodesic distances on the manifold instead of Euclidean distance. In this paper, we propose a modification of ISOMap using class information, which is often given in company with input data in many applications such as pattern classification. Since the conventional ISOMap does not use class information in approximating true geodesic distance between each pair of data points, it is difficult to construct a data structure related to class-membership that may give important information for given task such as data visualization and classification. The proposed method utilizes class-membership for measuring distance of data pair so as to find a low-dimensional manifold preserving the distance between classes as well as the distance between data points. Through computational experiments on artificial data sets and real facial data sets, we confirm that the proposed method gives better performance than the conventional ISOMap.

By filling the information gap in the system, this classifier can improve the analysis of better known components. We applied this approach to study the parameters of a proposed activity sensor of a biological neuronal network model by replacing the unknown sensor readout mechanism with an artificial neural network classifier. The classifier derives an error signal for homeostatic regulation of the pattern-generating neuronal network from the lobster stomatogastric ganglion. Using this approach, we predict optimal biological activity sensor parameters for homeostatic regulation and also provide insights into the biological architecture of the replaced sensor readout mechanism itself.

The logic based classifiers, such as the decision tree and the rule-based classifier, feature the advantage of presenting a good summary about the distinctive characteristics of different classes of data. On the other hand, the kernel based classifiers, such as the neural network and the support vector machine (SVM), typically can deliver higher prediction accuracy than the logic based classifiers. However, the user of a kernel based classifier normally cannot get an overall picture about the distribution of the data set. For some applications, the overall picture of the distribution of the data set can provide valuable insights about the distinctive characteristics of different classes of data and therefore is highly desirable. In this article, aiming to close the gap between the logic based classifiers and the kernel based classifiers, we propose a novel approach to carry out density estimation based on a mixture model composed of a limited number of generalized Gaussian components. One favorite feature of the classifier constructed with the proposed approach is that a user can easily obtain an overall picture of the distributions of the data set by examining the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrices associated with the generalized Gaussian components. Experimental results show that the classifier constructed with the proposed approach is capable of delivering superior prediction accuracy in comparison with the conventional logic based classifiers and the EM (Expectation Maximization) based classifier. On the other hand, though it cannot match the prediction accuracy delivered by the SVM, the proposed classifier enjoys one major advantage due to providing the user with an overall picture of the underlying distributions.

For example, estimation of predictive (diagnostic) models using patients' data from clinical studies requires effective integration of genetic, clinical and demographic data. Typically all heterogeneous inputs are properly encoded and mapped onto a single feature vector, used for estimating (training) a predictive model. This approach, known as standard inductive learning, is used in most application studies. More recently, several new learning methodologies have emerged. In particular, when training data can be naturally separated into several groups (or structured), we can view learning (estimation) for each group as a separate task, leading to Multi-Task Learning framework. Similarly, a setting where training data is structured, but the objective is to estimate a single predictive model (for all groups), leads to Learning with Structured Data and SVM+ methodology recently proposed by Vapnik. This paper demonstrates advantages and limitations of these new data modeling approaches for modeling heterogeneous data (relative to standard inductive SVM) via empirical comparisons using several publicly available medical data sets.

SVM are based on the Vapnik's Statistical Learning Theory, and successively extended by a number of researchers. On the order hand, the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal captures the electrical activity of the brain and is an important source of information for studying neurological disorders. In order to extract relevant information of EEG signal, a variety of computerized-analysis methods have been developed. Recent studies indicate that methods based on the nonlinear dynamics theory can extract valuable information from neuronal dynamics. However, many these of methods need large amount of data and are computationally expensive. From chaos theory, a global value that is relatively simple to compute is the fractal dimension (FD), it can be used to measure the geometrical complexity of a time series. The FD of a waveform represents a powerful tool for transient detection. In analysis of EEG this feature can been used to identify and distinguish specific states of physiologic function. A variety of algorithms are available for the computation of FD. In this work, we employ SVM to classify the EEG signals from healthy subjects and epileptic subjects using as the features vector the FD. From the experimental results, we can see that classification based on SVM with FD perform well in EEG signals classification, which indicates this classification method is valid and has promising application.

However, their kernels, which measure similarity of inputs, are required to be symmetric, constraining certain applications in practice. Furthermore, the celebrated representer theorem only applies to regularizers induced by the norm of an RKHS. To remove these limitations, we introduce the notion of reproducing kernel Banach spaces (RKBS) for pairs of reflexive Banach spaces of functions by making use of semi-inner-products and the duality mapping. As applications, we develop the framework of RKBS standard learning schemes including minimal norm interpolation, regularization network, and support vector machines. In particular, existence, uniqueness and representer theorems are established.

Random forest (RF) classifier has been extensively used as a generative model for classification and regression applications. We extend this technique for the task of building incremental component-based detector. First we employ object descriptor model based on bag of covariance matrices, to represent an object region then run our on-line RF learner to select object descriptors and to learn an object classifier. Experiments of the object recognition are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results demonstrate that the propose model yields in object recognition performance comparable to the benchmark standard RF, AdaBoost, and SVM classifiers.

Indeed, traditional machine learning algorithms are hi sod towards the majority class, thus producing poor predictive accuracy Over the minority One. To overcome this limitation: many approaches have been proposed up to now to build artificially balanced training sets. Further to their specific drawbacks, they achieve more balanced accuracies on each class harming the global accuracy. This paper first reviews the more recent method coping with Unbalanced datasets and then proposes a strategy overcoming the main drawbacks of existing approaches. It is based on an ensemble of classifiers trained on balanced subsets of the original Unbalanced training set working in conjunction with the classifier trained on the original Unbalanced dataset. The performance of the method has been estimated on six public datasets, proving its effectiveness also in comparison with other approaches. It also gives the chance to modify the system behaviour according to the operating scenario.

The idea is based on relating the response of the classifier with the response obtained by a random guessing. The measure of competence reflects this relation and rates the classifier with respect to the random guessing in a continuous manner. multiclassifier systems representing fusion and selection strategies were developed using proposed measure of competence. The performance of multiclassifiers was evaluated using five benchmark databases from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and Ludmila Kuncheva Collection. Classification results obtained for three simple fusion methods and one multiclassifier system with selection strategy were used for a comparison. The experimental results showed that, regardless of the strategy used by the multiclassifier system. the classification accuracy has increased when the measure of competence was employed. The improvement was most significant for simple fusion methods (sum, product and majority vote). For all databases, two developed multiclassifier systems produced the best classification scores.

In context of document categorization, we have to separate large number of classes. SVM becomes an important machine learning tool to handle categorization document problem. Usually, SVM classifier is implemented to treat binary classification problem. In order to handle multi-class problems, we present a new method to build dynamically a fuzzy hierarchical structure from the training data. Our method consists in gathering the similar documents in the same class from the root until leaves, based on its textual content. The original problem is divided into sub-problems. The proposed method consists of three steps : (i) Preprocessing step to reduce the large number of features (ii) Fuzzy hierarchical classification (iii) and introducing SVM classifier at each node of the hierarchy. The fuzzy hierarchical structure extracts the fuzzy relationships between deferent classes. Our experimental results improve high accuracy in the Reuters corpus face standard document categorization techniques.

A contour is implicitly represented by the zero level of a. signed distance function; and evolved according to a motion equation in order to minimize a. cost function. This function definers the objective of the segmentation problem and also includes regularization constraints. Gradient descent: search is tire de facto method used to solve this optimization problem. Basic gradient descent methods, However, are sensitive for local optima and often display slow convergence. Traditionally, the cost functions have been modified to avoid these problems. In this work, we instead propose using a modified gradient. descent search based oil resilient propagation (Rprop), a method commonly used in the machine learning community. Our results stow faster convergence and less sensitivity to local optima; compared to traditional gradient descent.

The motivation is to provide a tool for biomedical researchers to rapidly find the events of interest within large quantities of video data. Our system identifies potential sequences containing anomalies, and reduces the amount of data that needs to be searched by a human. We compute two sets of features from a video of a person descending a stairwell. The first set of features are the foot positions and velocities. We track both feet using a mixed state particle filter with an appearance model based on histograms of oriented gradients. We compute expected (most likely) foot positions given the state of the filter at each frame. The second set of features are the parameters of the mean optical flow over a foreground region. Our final classification system inputs these two sets of features into a hidden Markov model (HMM) to analyse the spatio-temporal progression of the stair descent. A single HMM is trained on sequences of normal stair use, and a threshold on sequence likelihoods is used to detect unusual events in new data. We demonstrate our system on a data set with five people descending a set of stairs in a laboratory environment. We show how our system can successfully detect nearly all anomalous events, with a low false positive rate. We discuss limitations and suggest improvements to the system. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

ANTIDOTE: Understanding and Defending against Poisoning of Anomaly Detectors	IMC'09: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2009 ACM SIGCOMM INTERNET MEASUREMENT CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	9th ACM SIGCOMM Internet Measurement Conference	NOV 04-06, 2009	Chicago, IL	ACM SIGCOMM, ACM SIGMETR, USENIX		Network Traffic Analysis; Principal Components Analysis; Adversarial Learning; Robust Statistics		Statistical machine learning techniques have recently garnered increased popularity as a means to Improve network design and security. For intrusion detection, such methods build a model for normal behavior from training data and detect attacks as deviations from that model. This process invites adversaries to manipulate the training data so that the learned model falls to detect subsequent attacks. We evaluate poisoning techniques and develop a defense, in the context of a particular anomaly detector-namely the PCA-subspace method for detecting anomalies in backbone networks For three poisoning schemes, we show how attackers can substantially increase their chance of successfully evading detection by only adding moderate amounts of poisoned data Moreover such poisoning throws off the balance between false positives and false negatives thereby dramatically reducing the efficacy of the detector. To combat these poisoning activities, we propose an antidote based on techniques from robust statistics and present a new robust PCA-based detector. Poisoning has little effect on the rcbust model, whereas it significantly distorts the model produced by the original PCA method. Our technique substantially reduces the effectiveness of poisoning for a variety of scenarios and indeed maintains a significantly better balance between false positives and false negatives than the original method when under attack.

For example, some companies might want to ban p2p traffic from their network while some ISPs might want to offer additional services based on the application. To classify applications on the fly, most companies rely on deep packet inspection (DPI) solutions While DPI tools can be accurate, they require constant updates of their signatures database Recently, several statistical traffic classification methods have been proposed In this paper, we investigate the use of these methods for an ADSL provider managing many Points of Presence (PoPs) We demonstrate that statistical methods can offer performance similar to the ones of DPI tools when the classifier is trained for a specific site It can also complement existing DPI techniques to mine traffic that the DPI solution failed to identify However, we also demonstrate that, even if a statistical classifier is very accurate on one site, the resulting model cannot be applied directly to other locations. We show that this problem stems front the statistical classifier learning site specific information			marcin.pietrzyk@orange-ftgroup.com; jean-laurent.costeux@orange-ftgroup.com; urvoy@eurecom.fr; ennajjar@eurecom.fr					Armitage G, 2008, COMMUNICATIONS SURVE, V10, P56; Bernaille L., 2007, PASS ACT MEAS C PAM; BERNAILLE L, 2006, P 2006 ACM CONEXT C; Bonfiglio D, 2007, COMPUT COMMUN REV, V37, P37, DOI 10.1145/1282427.1282386; ERMAN J, 2006, MINENET 06 P 2006 SI; KARAGIANNIS T, 2005, SIGCOMM COMPUT COMMU, V35; KARAGIANNIS T, 2004, IMC 04; KARASARIDIS A, 2007, HOTBOTS 07; Kim H., 2008, P 2008 ACM CONEXT C; Li W, 2009, COMPUT NETW, V53, P790, DOI 10.1016/j.comnet.2008.11.016; MALOMSOKY S, 2008, PASS ACT MEAS C PAM; MEO M, 2009, LECT NOTES COMPUTER, V5537; Moore AW, 2005, P 2005 ACM SIGMETRIC; NGUYEN TTT, 2006, P 31 IEEE C LOC COMP; Pietrzyk Marcin, 2009, LECT NOTES COMPUTER, V5537; Quinlan J., 1992, C4 5 PROGRAMS MACHIN; SEN S, 2004, WWW 04; TRESTIAN I, 2008, SIGCOMM COMPUT COMMU, V38; WILLIAMS N, 2006, SIGCOMM COMPUT COMMU, V36, P5; XIE H, 2008, SIGCOMM COMPUT COMMU, V38; WEKA DATA MINING; FAST FLUX	22	8	8	ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY	NEW YORK	1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA		978-1-60558-770-7				2009							122	135				14	Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BQR47	WOS:000281630800011

Information propagation through a cascade hierarchy of Linguistic Decision Trees (LDTs) based on label semantics forms a process of cascade decision making. In order to examine how a cascade hierarchy of LDTs works compared with a single LDT for multiple attribute decision making, we developed genetic algorithm with linguistic ID3 in wrapper to find optimal cascade hierarchies. Experiments have been carried out on the two benchmark databases, Pima Diabetes and Wisconsin Breast Cancer databases from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It is shown that an optimal cascade hierarchy of LDTs has better performance than a single LDT. The use of attribute hierarchies also greatly reduces the number of rules when the relationship between a goal variable and input attributes is highly uncertain and nonlinear.

There are many computational requirements for a motif discovery algorithm such as computer memory space requirement and computational complexity. To overcome the complexity of motif discovery, an alternative solution is proposed by integrating genetic algorithm and Fuzzy Art machine learning approaches for eliminating multiple sequence alignment process. Problem statetment: More than hundred methods have been proposed for motif discovery in recent years, representing very large variation with respect to both algorithmic approaches as well as the underlying models of regulatory regions. The aim of this study is to develop an alternative solution for motif discovery, which benefits from both data mining and genetic algorithm, and which at the same time eliminates the cost caused by use of multiple sequence alignment. Approach: Genetic algorithm based probabilistic Motif discovery model is designed to solve the problem. The proposed algorithm is implemented using Matlab and also tested with large DNA sequence data sets and synthetic data sets. Results: Results obtained by the proposed model to find the motif in terms of speed and length are compared with the existing method. This proposed method finds length of 11 in 18 sec and length of 15 in 24 sec but the existing methods finds length of 11 in 34 sec. When compared with other techniques the proposed method outperforms the popular existing method. Conclusion: In this study, a model is proposed to discover motif in large set of unaligned sequences in considerably minimum time. Length of motif in this study is also long when compared with existing methods. The proposed algorithm is implemented using Matlab and is tested with large DNA sequence data sets and synthetic data sets.

On commercial blogs, bloggers' negative comments or evaluations of products spread quickly in the cyber space. These negative comments are often harmful to enterprises and might result in great damage. Recently, researchers have paid much attention on sentiment classification to efficiently identify customers' negative emotions for helping companies to carefully response customers' comments. Following this trend, this study proposed a Neural Network (NN) based index which combines the advantages of machine learning techniques and information retrieval (semantic orientation indexes) to help companies detecting harmfully negative bloggers' comments quickly and effectively. Experimental results indicated that our proposed NN based index outperforms traditional approaches, including Back-Propagation neural network (BPN) and several semantic orientation indexes.

However, investors usually get loss because of unclear investment objective and blind investment. Therefore, to create a good investment decision support system to assist investors in making good decisions has become an important research problem. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) can provide relatively good performances in forecasting stock price but it cannot explain the forecasting rules clearly. On the other hand, a decision tree (DT) model can generate some rules to describe the forecasting decisions. This paper focuses on combining ANN and decision trees to create a stock price forecasting model. The experimental result shows that the combined DT+ANN model has 77% accuracy, which is higher than the single ANN and DT models over the electronic industry.

Previous approaches to drowsiness detection primarily make pre-assumptions about the relevant behavior, focusing on blink rate, eye closure, and yawning. Here we employ machine learning to datamine actual human behavior during drowsiness episodes. Automatic classifiers for 30 facial actions from the Facial action coding system were developed using machine learning on a separate database of spontaneous expressions. These facial actions include blinking and yawn motions, as well as a number of other facial movements. These measures were passed to learning-based classifiers such as Adaboost and multinomial ridge regression. Head motion information was collected through automatic eye tracking and an accelerometer. The system was able to predict sleep and crash episodes on a simulator with 98% accuracy across subjects. It is the highest prediction rate reported to date for detecting drowsiness. Moreover, the analysis revealed new information about human facial behavior for drowsy drivers.

The approach itself is based oil sampling component estimates from multiple runs of ICA using boot-strapping. The toolbox is fully integrated to a recently developed processing pipeline environment;, capable of running oil a single machine or in a cluster of servers.

In this paper, it is shown that the MASC problem formulated in a fixed dimension space within n > 1 is intractable even if sets defining an instance of the problem are in general position. A new polynomial-time approximation algorithm for this modification of the MASC problem is presented. An approximation ratio and complexity bounds of the algorithm are obtained.

We apply this paradigm to microphone forensics, determining the microphone model used to record a given audio sample. Our approach is to extract a Fourier coefficient histogram of near-silence segments of the recording as the feature vector and to use machine learning techniques for the classification. Our test goals are to determine whether attempting microphone forensics is indeed a sensible approach and which one of the six different classification techniques tested is the Most Suitable one for that task. The experimental results, achieved using two different FFT window sizes (256 and 2048 frequency coefficients) and nine different thresholds for near-silence detection, show a high accuracy of up to 93.5% correct classifications for the case of 2048 frequency coefficients in a test set of seven microphones classified with linear logistic regression models. This positive tendency motivates further experiments with larger test sets and further studies for microphone identification.

Feature extraction is often an ad hoc and case-specific task. Herein, we formulate it as a problem of sparse decomposition of images into a, basis that; is desired to possess several properties: 1) Sparsity and local spatial support, which usually provides good generalization ability on new samples, and lends itself to anatomically intuitive interpretations; 2) good discrimination ability, so that projection of images onto the optimal basis yields discriminant features to be used in a machine learning paradigm; 3) spatial smoothness and contiguity of the estimated basis functions. Our method yields a parts-based representation, which warranties that the image is decomposed into a number of positive regional projections. A non-negative matrix factorization scheme is used, and a numerical solution with proven convergence is used for solution. Results in classification of Alzheimers patients from the ADNI study are presented.

J	Ko, Y; Seo, J				Ko, Youngjoong; Seo, Jungyun			Text classification from unlabeled documents with bootstrapping and feature projection techniques	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Text classification; Bootstrapping; Feature projection; Unlabeled data; Text classifier		Many machine learning algorithms have been applied to text classification tasks. In the machine learning paradigm, a general inductive process automatically builds a text classifier by learning, generally known as supervised learning. However, the supervised learning approaches have some problems. The most notable problem is that they require a large number of labeled training documents for accurate learning. While unlabeled documents are easily collected and plentiful, labeled documents are difficulty generated because a labeling task must be done by human developers. In this paper, we propose a new text classification method based on unsupervised or semi-supervised learning. The proposed method launches text classification tasks with only unlabeled documents and the title word of each category for learning, and then it automatically learns text classifier by using bootstrapping and feature projection techniques. The results of experiments showed that the proposed method achieved reasonably useful performance compared to a supervised method. If the proposed method is used in a text classification task, building text classification systems will become significantly faster and less expensive. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It combines the relevance judgment information with the approaches of both in information retrieval and machine learning, so as to learn a more accurate ranking function for retrieval. Most previous approaches only rely on the labeled relevance information provided, thus suffering from the lintited training data size available. In this paper, we try to use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to utilize the unlabeled data set to extract new feature vectors, which are then embedded in a RankBoost leaning framework. We experimentally compare the performance of our approach against that without incorporating new features generated by SVD. The experimental results show that our approach can consistently improve retrieval performance across several LETOR data sets, thus indicating effectiveness of new SVD generated features for learning ranking function.

The ranking of nodes in an attack graph is an important step towards analyzing network security. This paper proposes an alternative attack graph ranking scheme based on a recent approach to machine learning in a structured graph domain, namely, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Evidence is presented in this paper that the GNN is suitable for the task of ranking attack graphs by learning a ranking function from examples and generalizes the function to unseen possibly noisy data, thus showing that the GNN provides an effective alternative ranking method for attack graphs.

Normally, a user takes several months of learning in order to become highly productive in using a specific object-oriented application framework. Without proper documentation, frameworks are not very usable to framework users. Currently available framework documentation approaches are not very effective for new framework users, and this scenario tends to discourage new users in using frameworks. The main objective of this paper is to propose and implement an intelligent framework documentation approach that integrates case-based learning (CBL) with genetic algorithm (GA) and Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) pattern matching algorithm with the intention of making learning a framework more effective. GA assists in optimizing the search process and performs machine learning. Within the GA, nearest neighbor algorithm is used in determining the most similar recorded case that can be used in solving the new case. A new case is retained in the case base for future retrievals. A framework user is allowed to select from a list of features provided by the framework that he or she is interested in learning, and the system will give an example of application related to the selected features. This paper concludes with a prototype that implements the intelligent framework documentation approach.

The challenge of meeting tight project schedules with quality software requires that the field of software engineering be automated to large extent and human intervention be minimized to optimum level. To achieve this goal the researchers have explored the potential of machine learning approaches as they are adaptable, have learning capabilities and non-parametric. In this paper, we take a look at how Neural Network (NN) can be used to build tools for software development and maintenance tasks.

Reproducing human decisions in reservoir management: the case of lake Lugano	INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES IN ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING	Environmental Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	4th International ICSC Symposium on Information Technologies in Environmental Engineering	MAY 28-29, 2009	Thessaloniki, GREECE	ICSC				The objective of this study is to identify a model able to represent the behavior of the historical decision maker (DM) in the management of lake Lugano, during the period 1982-2002. The DM decides every day how much water to release from the lake. We combine hydrological knowledge and machine learning techniques to property develop the model. As a predictive tool we use lazy learning, namely local linear regression. We setup a daily predictor, which achieves good accuracy, with a mean absolute percentage error around 8.5%. Yet, the behavior of the model is not fully satisfactory during the floods. In fact, from an interview with a domain expert, it appears that the DM can even update the release decision every 6 hours during emergencies. We have therefore developed a refined version of the model, which works with a variable time step: it updates the release decision once a day in normal conditions, and every 6 hours during emergencies. This turns out to be a sensible choice, as the error during emergencies (which represent about 5% of the data set) decreases from 9 to 3 m(3)/sec.	[Corani, G.; Rizzoli, A.

Chemical status of the water (or water quality class) is defined by the values of measured physic-chemical parameters. Traditional approach to model these data is to learn a separate model for each parameter and then derive a global overview with some kind of summarization over the multiple models. Another approach is to learn a single model that describes all parameters (multi target approach). We explore these approaches and apply them on data from Lake Prespa and its tributary rivers. The obtained models revealed interesting connections between the diatom taxa and the water quality (i.e. the values of the chemical parameters).
