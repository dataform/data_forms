However, more and more spam messages are also emerging on Sina Weibo. How to detect these spam is essential for the social network security. While most previous studies attempt to detect the microblogging spam by identifying spammers, in this paper, we want to exam whether we can detect the spam by each single Weibo message, because we notice that more and more spam Weibos are posted by normal users or even popular verified users. We propose a Weibo spam detection method based on machine learning algorithm. In addition, different from most existing microblogging spam detection methods which are based on English microblogs, our method is designed to deal with the features of Chinese microblogs. Our extensive empirical study shows the effectiveness of our approach.

A reliable identification of appliances that require disproportionate amounts of energy for their operation is generally unsupported by these systems, or at least requires significant manual configuration efforts. We address this challenge by placing low-cost measurement and actuation units into the mains connection of appliances. The distributed sensors capture the current flow of individual appliances at a sampling rate of 1.6kHz and apply local signal processing to the readings in order to extract characteristic fingerprints. These fingerprints are communicated wirelessly to the evaluation server, thus keeping the required airtime and energy demand of the transmission low. The evaluation server employs machine learning techniques and caters for the actual classification of attached electric appliances based on their fingerprints, enabling the correlation of consumption data and the appliance identity. Our evaluation is based on more than 3,000 current consumption fingerprints, which we have captured for a range of household appliances. The results indicate that a high accuracy is achieved when locally extracted current consumption fingerprints are used to classify appliances.

A novel approach for network traffic online classification is proposed in this paper. A strategy of converting the C4.5 decision tree data structure to parallel data structure called encoded data structure is proposed. The encoded data structure is very easy for hardware realization, based on FPGA parallel and pipeline technology. It only needs two clock cycles to complete C4.5 decision tree search process without extra write and read controls. Experimental results show that the throughput of the classification system can reach to 1Gbit/s on the NetFPGA2.1.3 platform, and we expect that this design can be expanded to the NetFPGA-10G platform and the throughput can reach to 10Gbit/s. The classification accuracy can reach to more than 97% if we choose the appropriate evaluation algorithm and search algorithm to obtain the effective features set.

The goal of the present study was to develop and evaluate machine learning algorithms for the prediction of material rupture with creep test by traction method. This study aimed to predict if a tensile specimen will break in 30 seconds or not. Multilayer Perceptrons were trained retrospectively in a group of 80 samples moments and tested prospectively in a group of 16 tensile specimens. During the 5-cross validations we reached a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 88% in the prospective group. The mean area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Curves) was equal to 0.86. Those results are very interesting because they are a first important step in the lifetime prediction of material rupture before significant damages can occur.

In order to undertake the new approach, average relative bin frequency coefficients will be extracted from speech. In a noisy environment, audio data are not strictly aligned, thus getting proper noiseless signal is a challenge. Consequently, this affects the performance of emotion detection system. Due to these reasons, a newly proposed approach of Average Relative Bin Frequency technique in frequency domain will be implemented through audio data. Support vector machine with radial basis kernel will be used for the classification. Preliminary results showed an average of 86% accuracy for average relative frequency bin coefficients.

This is to help academicians organize their research papers into predefined categories based on the documents' content similarity. This paper presents the Document Categorizer Agent based on ACM CCS (Association for Computing Machinery Computing Classification System). First, we studied the ACM categories hierarchy. Next, based on these categories, we retrieved our corpus from ACM DL (ACM Digital Library) to train our Categorizer Agent using a popular machine learning technique called Naive Bayes Classifier. We used two types of training data for the corpus namely, negative training data and positive training data. Next, these papers are categorized according to their content based on the same training data. We tested our Document Categorizer Agent on a number of academic papers to test its accuracy. The result we obtained showed promising results.

This technique has been established and well-explored by many researchers. However, some decision tree algorithms may produce a large structure of tree size and it is difficult to understand. Furthermore, misclassification of data often occurs in learning process. Therefore, a decision tree algorithm that can produce a simple tree structure with high accuracy in term of classification rate is a need to work with huge volume of data. Pruning methods have been introduced to reduce the complexity of tree structure without decrease the accuracy of classification. One of pruning methods is the Reduced Error Pruning (REP). To better understand pruning methods, an experiment was conducted using Weka application to compare the performance in term of complexity of tree structure and accuracy of classification for J48, REPTree, PART, JRip, and Ridor algorithms using seven standard datasets from UCI machine learning repository. In data modeling, J48 and REPTree generate tree structure as an output while PART, Ridor and JRip generate rules. In additional J48, REPTree and PART using REP method for pruning while Ridor and JRip using improvement of REP method, namely IREP and RIPPER methods. The experiment result shown performance of J48 and REPTree are competitive in producing better result. Between J48 and REPTree, average differences performance of accuracy of classification is 7.1006% and 6.2857% for complexity of tree structure. For classification rules algorithms, Ridor is the best algorithms compare to PART and JRip due to highest percentage of accuracy of classification in five dataset from seven datasets. An algorithm that produces high accuracy with simple tree structure or simple rules can be awarded as the best algorithm in decision tree.	[Omar, W.

Industrial control system networks should be far more restricted in what types of traffic diversity is present. This enables the usage of approaches that are currently not as feasible in open environments, such as machine learning based anomaly detection. Without proper customization for the special requirements of industrial control system network environment many existing anomaly or misuse detection systems will perform sub-optimally. Machine learning based approach would reduce the amount of manual customization required for different restricted network environments of which an industrial control system network is an good example of.

Meanwhile, machine learning is a promising AI technology which can enhance the performance of traditional algorithm. Therefore, aiming at solving service discovery problem, this paper imports Bayesian classifier to web service discovery framework, which can improve service querying speed. In this framework, services in service library become training set of Bayesian classifier, service query becomes a testing sample. Service matchmaking process can be executed in related service class, which has fewer services, thus can save time. Due to don't know the class of service in training set, EM algorithm is used to estimate prior probability and likelihood functions. Experiment results show that the EM algorithm and Bayesian classifier supported method outperforms other methods in time complexity. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Effective identifications of the binding interfaces can help understand the interactions. In this paper, we take statistical information into account, mainly the singlet propensity and doublet propensity, and add the two propensities with the sequence information, to predict the interfaces using machine learning method. Results show that adding statistical characters can improve the prediction precision, especially the doublet propensity. Besides, we constructed three data sets based on the protein-RNA complex function, and find out that different complex function data sets show significant differences in prediction precision.

However, accuracy for such products varies with the condition of forest ecosystem. In this paper, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier combined with autonomous endmember extraction technique was performed to improve the performance of machine learning in satellite land cover classification and percent tree cover mapping. For the study area, Pingnan County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, that featured as a complex and fragmented subtropical forest habitat, the TM imagery was first processed with SMACC endmember extraction to find spectral endmembers of expected land cover classes. Secondly, the refined endmembers were input into SVM instead of conventional visual selection of training ROIs. The percent tree cover for the county is 53.6%, underestimated by 1.3% when compared with the National Continuous Forest Inventory 2004 statistics, suggesting a fair agreement with ground truth. The approach also shows a robust performance with an overall RMSE of 10.1. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B. V. Selection and/or peer review under responsibility of ICMPBE International Committee.

The basic idea is to investigate and compare several machine learning techniques to perform such a classification. For this paper, three machine learning tools that recognize syntactically correct English language sentences were used. The performances of the three tools - the C4.5 algorithm, Artificial Neural Network and the Lazy Clustering algorithm - are investigated with regard to a basic training set. The Lazy Clustering algorithm and the trained Artificial Neural Network were found to give a significantly higher result compared with C4.5 algorithm. Results also indicate that these two tools complement each other. This is an encouragement for further investigation to develop a hybrid solution to the problem.

In this decision forest, each individual base decision tree classifiers are incorporated with an additional classifier model, the Logitboosted decision stump. In the first randomization, the resamples to train the decision trees are extracted; in the second randomization, second set of resamples are generated from the out-of-bag samples of the first set of resamples. The boosted decision stumps are constructed on the second resamples. These extra resamples along with the resamples on which the base tree classifiers are trained, approximates the original training set. In this way we are utilizing the full training set to construct a hybrid decision forest with larger feature space. We have applied this hybrid decision forest in two real world applications; a) classifying credit scores, and b) short term extreme rainfall forecast. The performance of the hybrid decision forest in these two problems are compared with some well known machine learning methods. Overall results suggest that the new hybrid decision forest is capable of yielding commendable predictive performance.

It is widely used to get a 3-D map of brain activity, with a spatial resolution of few milliseconds. We try to employ various machine learning techniques to decode the cognitive states of a person, based on his brain fMRIs. This is particularly challenging because of the complex nature of brain and numerous interdependencies in the brain activity. We trained multiple classifiers for decoding cognitive states and analyzed the results. We also introduced a technique for considerably reducing the large dimensions of the fMRI data, thereby increasing the classification accuracy. We have compared our results with current state-of-the-art implementations, and a significant improvement in the performance was observed. We got 90% accuracy, which is significantly better than the state-of-the-art implementation. We ran our algorithm on a heterogeneous dataset containing fMRI scans from multiple persons, and still got an accuracy of 83%, which is significant since it shows our classifiers were able to identify some basic abstract underlying neural activity, which are subject-independent, corresponding to the each cognitive states.

The paper proposes how to adapt a single classifier system to the new model without the knowledge of correct classes. The proposed simulated concept recurrence is implemented in the non-recurring concept shift scenario without the drift detection mechanism. We assume that the model could change slightly, what allows us to predict a set of possible models. Quality of the proposed algorithm was estimated on the basis of computer experiment which was carried out on the benchmark dataset.

J	Kolesnikova, O; Gelbukh, A				Kolesnikova, Olga; Gelbukh, Alexander			Semantic relations between collocations: A Spanish case study	REVISTA SIGNOS			English	Article						Collocations; lexical functions; machine learning		Linguistics as a scientific study of human language intends to describe and explain it. However, validity of a linguistic theory is difficult to prove due to volatile nature of language as a human convention and impossibility to cover all real-life linguistic data. In spite of these problems, computational techniques and modeling can provide evidence to verify or falsify linguistic theories. As a case study, we conducted a series of computer experiments on a corpus of Spanish verb-noun collocations using machine learning methods, in order to test a linguistic point that collocations in the language do not form an unstructured collection but are language items related via what we call collocational isomorphism, represented by lexical functions of the Meaning-Text Theory. Our experiments allowed us to verify this linguistic statement. Moreover, they suggested that semantic considerations are more important in the definition of the notion of collocation than statistical ones.

In this paper we present a machine learning approach to analyzing driving maneuver skills of a driver that covers both longitudinal and lateral controls. The concept is to learn a driver model from sensor data that are related to driving environment, driving behavior and vehicle response. Once the model is built, driving skills of an unknown run can be classified automatically. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method for driving skill analysis based on a driving simulator experiment in a curve driving scene for both the full curve and curve segmented cases.

With a camera mounted to a human body, the moving subject won't appear in the video when the person is in some motions. But we can estimate the activity from the changes of scenes in videos. Optical flow method is a common method to calculate motion vectors of objects in two adjacent images. For higher precision, in this paper, we use Lucas-Kanade optical flow method with pyramid structure to calculate the optical flow of scenes which can reflect people's motion to some extents. When key information is extracted from the optical flow field, we design a feature descriptor to describe the motion in frames in a video. The feature descriptor contains angels, bounce information and other important information which can distinguish different motion. After getting feature descriptors, we use support vector machine to classify different motions with a machine learning method. Experimental results show that our method successfully identifies motion such as walking, running, going upstairs and going downstairs. Compared with methods based on blocking-matching, this method has fewer costs and has higher precision.

The success of using boosting for training a face detector [28] has paved the way of using boosting for training object detectors and made it widely used in computer vision. In this work we present a new framework for fast and automatic detection of vehicle license plate based on boosting learning algorithm. Beside the traditional Haar-like features, we propose to use local binary pattern (LBP) feature for its robust and discriminative power. The boosting classifiers are trained on these features and then combined in an efficient way to achieve high performance. An intensive set of experiments have been conducted. The results show that the classifier with LBP outperform that of Haar-like in the same scenario for the license plate detection problem. By combining them in an reasonable way, our proposed system can perform in real time for detection of license plates with the accuracy up to 100%, outperform state-of-the-art approaches.

They can solve small-sample learning problems better by using Structural Risk Minimization in place of Experiential Risk Minimization. It can solve the problem of small sample sets learning and avoid the problem of over-learning with limited swatch amount at the same time. A fuzzy SVM multi-category classifier system model based on "one-against-all" is designed and established, which improves the performance of SVM and classification precision by reducing the blind area with fuzzy theory. It has good learning ability and generalization performance by the experiment with RBF-NN, Common-SVM and Fuzzy-SVM. At last, this model is applied in engine fault diagnosis, which improves classification accuracy and satisfies with the request of fault diagnosis for the engine.

Recent non-parametric machine learning approaches to system identification have shown good promise, outperforming parameterized mathematical models when applied to complex robot system identification problems. Unfortunately, non-parametric methods perform poorly when applied to regions of the state space that are not densely covered by the training dataset. This problem becomes particularly critical as the state space grows. Parametric methods use the available data very efficiently but, on the flip side, they only provide crude approximations to the actual system dynamics. In practice the systematic deviations between the parametric mathematical model and its physical realization results in control laws that do not take advantage of the compliance and complex dynamics of the robot. Here we present an approach to robot system identification, named Semi-Parametric Gaussian Processes (SGP), that elegantly combines the advantages of parametric and non-parametric approaches. Computer simulations and a physical implementation of an underactuated robot system identification problem show very promising results. We also demonstrate the applicability of SGP to articulated tree-structured robots of arbitrary complexity. In all experiments, SGP significantly outperformed previous parametric and non-parametric approaches as well as previous methods for combining the two approaches.

A cooperative behavior can be planned if players are previously committed to its execution prior to its start or unplanned otherwise. The ability to reproduce some of these behaviors can be useful to help a team achieve better performances. This work presents an approach to identify and extract cooperative behaviors that start from set-pieces and lead to a goal while ball possession is kept. The representation of these behaviors is abstracted using a set-play definition language to promote their reusability. A set of game log files generated with the FC Portugal team and collected from the RoboCup 2010 2D simulated soccer competition were analyzed. The results achieved showed that 25% of the total goals scored originated from set-pieces which attests to the importance of performing this analysis. Several guidelines for the definition of future set-plays were also inferred. In the future, these behaviors shall be tested to infer which are capable of neutralizing an opponent's team strategy and maximize the creation of goal opportunities.

Our method works by first reducing the problem of obstacle avoidance to a continuous state, action, and time control problem, and then uses efficient collocation methods to solve for an optimal feedback control policy. This formulation of the obstacle avoidance problem improves over standard approaches, such as potential field methods, by being resistant to local minima, allowing for moving obstacles, handling stochastic systems, and computing feedback control strategies that take into account the robot's (possibly non-linear) dynamics. In addition to contributing a new method for obstacle avoidance, our work contributes to the state-of-the-art in collocation methods for non-linear stochastic optimal control problems in two important ways: (1) we show that taking into account local gradient and second-order derivative information of the optimal value function at the collocation points allows us to exploit knowledge of the derivative information about the system dynamics, and (2) we show that computational savings can be achieved by directly fitting the gradient of the optimal value function rather than the optimal value function itself. We validate our approach on three problems: non-convex obstacle avoidance of a point-mass robot, obstacle avoidance for a 2 degree of freedom robotic manipulator, and optimal control of a non-linear dynamical system.

Form, size, position, orientation and constellation of the objects are unknown. Additional challenges are to localize the basket and treat it as an obstacle, and to cope with incomplete point cloud data. There are three key contributions. First, we introduce Height Accumulated Features (HAF) which provide an efficient way of calculating grasp related feature values. The second contribution is an extensible machine learning system for binary classification of grasp hypotheses based on raw point cloud data. Finally, a practical heuristic for selection of the most robust grasp hypothesis is introduced. We evaluate our system in experiments where a robot was required to autonomously empty a basket with unknown objects on a pile. Despite the challenging scenarios, our system succeeded each time.

We map and localize in an unknown environment, where the access points' locations are unspecified and for which training data is a priori unavailable. Our approach is based on an heterogeneous method combining robots with different sensor payloads. The algorithmic design assumes the ability of producing a map in real-time from a sensor-full robot that can quickly be shared by sensor-deprived robot team members. More specifically, we cast WiFi localization as classification and regression problems that we subsequently solve using machine learning techniques. In order to produce a robust system, we take advantage of the spatial and temporal information inherent in robot motion by running Monte Carlo Localization on top of our regression algorithm, greatly improving its effectiveness.

This algorithm relies upon a representation based on projective geometry that uses a special set of polynomial functions borrowed from the field of Computer Aided Geometric Design (CAGD). So far, it has only been possible to learn a model of the forward kinematics function. In this paper, we show how the KBM algorithm can be modified to learn the robot's equation of motion and, hence, its inverse dynamic model. Results from experiments with a simulated serial robot manipulator are presented that clearly show the advantages of our approach compared to general function approximation methods.

We have developed a human-imitated system for robotic fingertip to sense object's texture via sliding action. Design of the sensory skin was inspired by the localized displacement phenomenon of a sliding soft fingertip ([1]) to capture stick-slip events on the contact surface that mainly represent texture characteristics. The soft skin is knitted by electro-conductive tension-sensitive yarns, then covered over a hemispherical fingertip. The pile-shaped surface of the fabric sensor enhances tangential traction detection ability of the sensor, even though the normal load is also sensible. Our aim is to exploit this sensor in applications regarding relative sliding between the touched object and the surface of the sensor, such as slip detection ([2]), and surface identification in this paper. In surface encoding, we have experimentally investigated ability of the fabric sensor in recognition touched objects via multiple machine learning algorithms, such as naive Bayes, Multi-Layer Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with input extracted from autoregressive models, and ANN with input extracted from Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT), have been trained to distinguish three typical textures. As a result, we have found that the last method outperforms the remains with an average successful rate of 90%.

In this study, we propose an integrated system which has ability to track multiple people at the same time, to recognize their facial expressions, and to identify social atmosphere. Consequently, robots can easily recognize facial expression, emotion variations of different people, and can respond properly. In our facial expression recognition scheme, we fuse Feature Vectors based Approach (FVA) and Differential-Active Appearance Model Features based Approach (DAFA) to obtain not only apposite positions of feature points, but also more information about texture and appearance. With the obtained useful information, FVA can classify the emotions according to comparison with the distances and ratios of feature points, and DAFA can distinguish emotions from classical machine learning on a low dimensional manifold space. Furthermore, emotion recognition of multiple people at the same time is extended. Based on the proposed algorithm, multiple person emotion analysis and social atmosphere identification can be achieved, which makes the relationship between people and robots much closer. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can recognize facial expressions accurately and robustly. The ambient atmosphere identification system is implemented with a young Einstein robot head in our laboratory.

A Hybrid Heuristics-Statistical Peer-to-peer Traffic Classifier	2012 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS (ICCSII)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Computer Systems and Industrial Informatics (ICCSII)	DEC 18-20, 2012	Sharjah, U ARAB EMIRATES	EMARATECH, IEEE Comp Soc Local Chapter, IEEE, SAMSUNG, BCS, Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Comp Sci & Engn	Amer Univ Sharjah	Peer-to-peer; Hybrid Classifier; Heuristics Classification; Machine Learning		Peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic consumes a significant chunk of Internet bandwidth that requires effective control. This work proposes a novel hybrid heuristics-statistical approach to classify P2P traffic. Heuristics approach provides highly accurate P2P detection, although it involves measuring and analyzing of many correlations between packets and flows for certain duration of time, which make it inapplicable for online P2P traffic classification. On the other hand, statistical classification can classify traffic in an online manner although it needs periodical, often manual, retraining. The proposed hybrid solution merges these two approaches: offline heuristics learning corpus generation and online statistical classification. In the first part, heuristics are used to classify traffic flows into three classes, two which are later used for training the online statistical classifier. This work presents an enhancement on the existing heuristics P2P classification by adding a new class for unknown traffic. Analyses on the offline traces using the improved heuristics show that the addition of the third class reduces the class noise from 7 % to 2 %, hence, providing quality examples to retrain the online statistical classifier. For the second part, machine learning (ML) algorithms are used to classify traffic on the fly based on the flows and packets statistics. Using examples generated by the heuristics classifier, the overall statistical classification accuracy is 99 % based on analysis on downloaded and captured traces.

The method is based on the use of pattern recognition and machine learning techniques to combine the outputs of multiple edge detection algorithms. In this way, the limitations of the individual edge detectors can be overcome and performance enhancement is achieved. Two widely used classification algorithms, the Naive Bayes Classifier and the Multi-layer Perceptron, were selected for the learning task. The proposed system was evaluated on artificial and real images. A simple class labeling system based on the output of all edge detectors is suggested to provide controllability between detection sensitivity and noise resistance. Principal Component Analysis was performed to reduce computational burden and improve detection accuracy. The method is shown to achieve a practical compromise between detection sensitivity, computational complexity, and noise immunity.

As a result, anomaly or learning based intrusion detection mechanisms have been developed to cope with such attacks. Among variety of anomaly detection approaches, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) are known to be two of the best machine learning algorithms to classify normal from abnormal behaviors. In this paper a hybrid anomaly-based intrusion detection method is proposed that is based on these two methods. These methods are trained in supervised way. We use the following additional techniques to improve the performance of proposed approach: First, a feature selection technique using the entropy of features is used for extracting optimized information from KDD data set and second, a novel method is proposed to combine the results of these two learning based methods. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed hybrid approach by using the KDD dataset. The simulation results show that which features of KDD are better to distinguish the normal from abnormal traffics. Also these results show the detection precision of the DoS, Probe, U2R and R2L attacks by using our method are 99%, 100%, 100% and 100% respectively.

OPTIMIZATION OF FUZZY ANALOGY IN SOFTWARE COST ESTIMATION USING LINGUISTIC VARIABLES	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODELLING OPTIMIZATION AND COMPUTING	Procedia Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Modelling Optimisation and Computing (ICMOC)	APR 10-11, 2012	Kumarakoil, INDIA	Dept Mech Engn, Noorul Islam Ctr Higher Educ		Cost estimation; categorical variables; project attributes; linguistic values; fuzzy logic; analogy; dataset		One of the most important objectives of software engineering community has been the increase of useful models that beneficially explain the development of life cycle and precisely calculate the effort of software cost estimation. In analogy concept, there is deficiency in handling the datasets containing categorical variables though there are innumerable methods to estimate the cost. Due to the nature of software engineering domain, generally project attributes are often measured in terms of linguistic values such as very low, low, high and very high. The imprecise nature of such value represents the uncertainty and vagueness in their elucidation. However, there is no efficient method that can directly deal with the categorical variables and tolerate such imprecision and uncertainty without taking the classical intervals and numeric value approaches. In this paper, a new approach for optimization based on fuzzy logic, linguistic quantifiers and analogy based reasoning is proposed to improve the performance of the effort in software project when they are described in either numerical or categorical data. The performance of this proposed method exemplifies a pragmatic validation based on the historical NASA dataset. The results were analyzed using the prediction criterion and indicates that the proposed method can produce more explainable results than other machine learning methods.

The accuracy of classifier is generally compromised by the missing value in the data set, due to incorrect collection of data values. Those missing data in the microarray data set may contain some relevance information. These missing values can lead to the incorrect analysis of data. Lots of research is carried out to minimize the impact of these missing values. In this paper; a new method has been proposed to elucidate the missing value for different microarray data sets. The proposed method has been compared with the traditional methods like mean method and median method. The proposed model has used principal component analysis (PCA) to deal with curse of dimensionality. To validate the proposed method Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classification technique has been used to achieve the accuracy. The results show that proposed missing value imputation technique gives more accuracy as compared to other missing value methods. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In web information content is simply a resource with some specific hyper-link path. In this paper we propose an idea of giving semantic to a web page so a system can understand the semantic behind the web page which automatically increases the efficiency of information search. So we represent a way of converting an ordinary Syntactic page into a Semantic web page with corresponding Ontology which would pave the way of advancement in Semantic Web Learning technology.

The attitude may be his or her judgment or evaluation, affective state or the intended emotional communication. It is a common practice that merchants selling products on the Web ask their customers to review the products and associated services. As e-commerce is becoming more and more popular, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. For a popular product, the number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands. This paper describes the concepts of sentiment analysis from unstructured text, looking at why they is useful and what tools and techniques are available. We will describe a variety of general rule-based and machine learning techniques, which provides some background information on the key underlying NLP processes required, and focus specifically on some of the major problems and solutions, such as detection of sarcasm, use of informal language, spam opinion detection, trustworthiness of opinion holders, and so on. We will also discuss problems associated with opinion detection in social media such as blogs, forum posts, twitter, etc. The techniques will be demonstrated with key open-source tools and applications.

In most of the cases, the computational resources and time required per simulation are large. In certain cases like sensitivity analysis, design optimisation etc. where thousands and millions of simulations have to be carried out, it leads to have a life time of difficulty for designers. Nowadays approximation models, otherwise called as Surrogate Models (SM), me more widely employed in order to reduce the requirement of computational resources and time in analysing various engineering, systems. Various approaches such as Kriging, Neural Networks, Polynomials, Gaussian processes etc. are used to construct the approximation models. The primary intention of this work is to employ the k-fold cross validation approach to study and evaluate the influence of various theoretical variogram models on the accuracy of the surrogate model construction. Ordinary Kriging and Design of Experiments (DOE) approaches are used to construct the surrogate models by approximating panel and viscous solution algorithms which are primarily used to solve the flow around airfoils and aircraft wings. The method of coupling the surrogate models with a suitable optimisation scheme to carry-out an aerodynamic design optimisation process for aircraft wings is also discussed.

Hand Gesture Recognition (HGR) is a system for sign language detection which uses computers for enabling communication with sensory impaired people. In this research work, an efficient and effective technique is introduced for the identification of the number of fingers opened or closed in a gesture representing an alphabet of the American Situ Language (ASL) Finger Detection is accomplished with the use of Contour Hull and Convexity Defects. Contour Hull helps to form the boundary of the hand gestures whereas the Convexity Defects helps to find tip of the fingers captured by the web camera. This proposed system applies image processing techniques to store the pre-processed data, Machine learning technique is used in supervised clustering and computer vision techniques is used to recognize the hand gestures. Hence this intelligent system does not require the hand to be perfectly aligned to the camera for detecting the signs. In addition to this, to detect the signs, this system does not need any colored markers or gloves to be wearied on the hands. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Numerical simulations of mc-Si lifetime based on drift-diffusion model involve many simplifying assumptions, leading to non-practical results for optimizing gettering process. To overcome this deficiency, the proposed model has a completely different approach to estimate carrier lifetime enhancement for various mc-Si wafers processed under different diffusion conditions. SVM regression, which is a machine learning-based procedure, has been employed to foretell the efficiency of gettering through predicting the average lifetime after diffusion. Experimental data from processed wafers have been used to train the model. Examining test data using mean square error (MSE) confirms that Gaussian model has the best accuracy.

The sequential nature of the task is one of the reasons why generative classifiers, based on combining hidden Markov model (HMM) acoustic models and N-gram language models using Bayes' rule, have become the dominant technology used in ASR. Conversely, the machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) research areas are increasingly dominated by discriminative approaches, where the class posteriors are directly modeled. This talk describes recent work in applying discriminative models to ASR. To handle continuous, variable length, observation sequences, the approaches applied to ML and NLP tasks must be modified. This talk discusses the issues in applying discriminative models to ASR and possible solutions. The nature of the models, possible sets of features, and options for optimizing the parameters of the models, will all be described. Examples of applying these approaches to continuous ASR tasks will also be given.

First, heterogeneous architectures that integrate a CPU and a GPU on the same chip are emerging, and hold much promise for supporting power-efficient and scalable high performance computing. Second, MapReduce has emerged as a suitable framework for simplified parallel application development for many classes of applications, including data mining and machine learning applications that benefit from accelerators. This paper focuses on the challenge of scaling a MapReduce application using the CPU and GPU together in an integrated architecture. We develop different methods for dividing the work, which are the map-dividing scheme, where map tasks are divided between both devices, and the pipelining scheme, which pipelines the map and the reduce stages on different devices. We develop dynamic work distribution schemes for both the approaches. To achieve high load balance while keeping scheduling costs low, we use a runtime tuning method to adjust task block sizes for the map-dividing scheme. Our implementation of MapReduce is based on a continuous reduction method, which avoids the memory overheads of storing key-value pairs. We have evaluated the different design decisions using 5 popular MapReduce applications. For 4 of the applications, our system achieves 1.21 to 2.1 speedup over the better of the CPU-only and GPU-only versions. The speedups over a single CPU core execution range from 3.25 to 28.68. The runtime tuning method we have developed achieves very low load imbalance, while keeping scheduling overheads low. Though our current work is specific to MapReduce, many underlying ideas are also applicable towards intra-node acceleration of other applications on integrated CPU-GPU nodes.

We design and evaluate a new machine learning model that estimates this degradation online, on previously unseen workloads, and without perturbing the execution. Our motivation is to help data center and HPC cluster operators effectively use workload consolidation. Data center consolidation is about placing many applications on the same server to maximize hardware utilization. In HPC clusters, processes of the same distributed applications run on the same machine. Consolidation improves hardware utilization, but may sacrifice performance as processes compete for resources. Our model helps determine when consolidation is overly harmful to performance. Our work is the first to apply machine learning to this problem domain, and we report on our experience reaping the advantages of machine learning while navigating around its limitations. We demonstrate how the model can be used to improve performance fidelity and save energy for HPC workloads.

Based on that, a model where traffic infrastructure is represented by a dynamic network of Hotspots is suggested. Besides the location of Hotspots, information about travel times between these Hotspot-Nodes also comes along with the extracted significant places. This information can be used to improve or enrich traffic management and/or navigation systems by consequently achieving a more precise estimation of travel times compared to current systems.

Defect prediction promises to indicate the defect-prone components of a software system. In this paper we investigate the viability of predicting defect-prone components in upcoming releases of a large industrial software system. Prediction models constructed with heuristic machine learning are used to classify the components of future versions of the software system as defective or defect-free. It could be shown that the accuracy of the predictions made for the next version is significantly higher (around 74%) than guessing even when taking only new or modified components into account. Furthermore, the results reveal that, depending on the specific prediction model, acceptable accuracy can be achieved for up to three versions in the future.

Faults are due to internal and external influences, such as calibration, low battery, environmental interference and sensor aging. However, only few solutions exist to deal with faulty sensory data in WSN. We develop a statistical approach to detect and identify faults in a WSN. In particular, we focus on the identification and classification of data and system fault types as it is essential to perform accurate recovery actions. Our method uses Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to capture the fault-free dynamics of an environment and dynamics of faulty data. It then performs a structural analysis of these HMMs to determine the type of data and system faults affecting sensor measurements. The approach is validated using real data obtained from over one month of samples from motes deployed in an actual living lab.

A number of foundational works both in machine learning [17] and in theory [30] have suggested a probabilistic model for documents, whereby documents arise as a convex combination of (i.e. distribution on) a small number of topic vectors, each topic vector being a distribution on words (i.e. a vector of word-frequencies). Similar models have since been used in a variety of application areas; the Latent Dirichlet Allocation or LDA model of Blei et al. is especially popular. Theoretical studies of topic modeling focus on learning the model's parameters assuming the data is actually generated from it. Existing approaches for the most part rely on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and consequently have one of two limitations: these works need to either assume that each document contains only one topic, or else can only recover the span of the topic vectors instead of the topic vectors themselves. This paper formally justifies Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) as a main tool in this context, which is an analog of SVD where all vectors are nonnegative. Using this tool we give the first polynomial-time algorithm for learning topic models without the above two limitations. The algorithm uses a fairly mild assumption about the underlying topic matrix called separability, which is usually found to hold in real-life data. Perhaps the most attractive feature of our algorithm is that it generalizes to yet more realistic models that incorporate topic-topic correlations, such as the Correlated Topic Model (CTM) and the Pachinko Allocation Model (PAM). We hope that this paper will motivate further theoretical results that use NMF as a replacement for SVD - just as NMF has come to replace SVD in many applications.

However, in most machine learning applications, it is not possible to request for labels of arbitrary examples constructed by an algorithm. Instead, the dominant query paradigm in applied machine learning, called active learning, is one where the algorithm may query for labels, but only on points in a given (polynomial-sized) unlabeled sample, drawn from some underlying distribution D. In this work, we bring this well-studied model to the domain of testing. We develop both general results for this active testing model as well as efficient testing algorithms for several important properties for learning, demonstrating that testing can still yield substantial benefits in this restricted setting. For example, we show that testing unions of d intervals can be done with O(1) label requests in our setting, whereas it is known to require Omega(d) labeled examples for learning (and Omega(root d) for passive testing [22] where the algorithm must pay for every example drawn from D). In fact, our results for testing unions of intervals also yield improvements on prior work in both the classic query model (where any point in the domain can be queried) and the passive testing model as well. For the problem of testing linear separators in R-n over the Gaussian distribution, we show that both active and passive testing can be done with O(root n) queries, substantially less than the Omega(n) needed for learning, with near-matching lower bounds. We also present a general combination result in this model for building testable properties out of others, which we then use to provide testers for a number of assumptions used in semi-supervised learning. In addition to the above results, we also develop a general notion of the testing dimension of a given property with respect to a given distribution, that we show characterizes (up to constant factors) the intrinsic number of label requests needed to test that property. We develop such notions for both the active and passive testing models. We then use these dimensions to prove a number of lower bounds, including for linear separators and the class of dictator functions.

To overcome this problem, this paper presents a new method based on a two steps of sample reduction to reduce training samples. This algorithm includes cluster detection by Fuzzy C-Means Clustering (FCM) Cluster and sample reduction by Multivariate Gaussian Distribution (MGD). In its implementation, the FCM algorithm is used to cluster the original training samples, and then the MGD is used to reduce the training samples by choosing the only boundary samples for the next training. Experiments show that the algorithm accelerates the training speed without the decrease of classification accuracy.

Recognizing the activity of a person and measuring his/her energy expenditure is important for the management of several diseases. In the CHIRON project we aim to monitor congestive heart failure patients using wearable sensors and a smartphone. Our method uses a classifier for activity recognition constructed with machine learning. Attention was paid to the complexity of the attributes for machine learning, resulting in the omission of the most complex attributes in order to prolong the battery life. The recognized activity serves as an input to a classifier for energy expenditure estimation, which was also constructed with machine learning. The best-performing classifier turned out to be a composite of two activity-specific classifiers and a general classifier. Its mean absolute error was 0.91 metabolic equivalents of task (MET).

They can be used to provide automated QoS management for interactive traffic, such as fast-paced multiplayer games or VoIP. As with other ML classification approaches, previous sub-flow techniques have assumed all packets in all flows are being observed and evaluated. This limits scalability and poses a problem for practical deployment in network core or edge routers. In this paper we propose and evaluate sub-flow packet sampling (SPS) to reduce an ML sub-flow classifier's resource requirements with minimal compromise of accuracy. While random packet sampling increases classification time from <1 second to over 30 seconds and can reduce accuracy from 98% to <90%, our tailored SPS technique retains classification times of <1 second while providing 98% accuracy.

In this context, machine learning techniques have also been extensively applied to this task. Since manual labeling is very expensive, several works attempt to handle intrusion detection with traditional clustering algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a new pattern recognition technique called Optimum-Path Forest (OPF) clustering to this task. Experiments on three public datasets have showed that OPF classifier may be a suitable tool to detect intrusions on computer networks, since it outperformed some state-of-the-art unsupervised techniques.

T he ability to identify BitTorrent traffic in real-time could allow network operators to manage network traffic more effectively. In this paper we demonstrate that erroneous output of a Machine Learning based classifier is randomly distributed within a flow, allowing the application of temporal feedback to improve the overall classifier performance. We propose and evaluate a number of feedback algorithms. Our results show that we are able to improve classification outcomes (Recall by 2.4% and Precision by 0.1%) whilst both improving classification timeliness from three to two minutes, and improving robustness against future changes to the BitTorrent protocol.

It first calculates the minimum circum circle of samples for each class. Then the distributions of the samples can be described by these circles. The linear separating hyperplane will intersect the connecting line of the centers of circles. Consequently, the perpendicular to the connecting line of each two centers is defined as the classifier of these two classes. Moreover, some improved classifiers are proposed when the separating hyperplane is not perpendicular to the connecting line or when there are outliers in the samples. The combined classifier based on subclasses is also discussed. In the experiments, the CMCC and its improved algorithms are compared with some other classifiers such as support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, etc. The experimental results show that the CMCC gives a relatively good performance on both classification accuracy and time cost.

The most authoritative birds of the pigeons' flock take the lead, and followers follow the leaders' directions. Pigeon leaders' roles vary over time. Following this unprecedented discovery made by zoologists at the University of Oxford and Eotvos University, we extend in this paper the flocking model largely used in computer science. We define a new biologically inspired clustering algorithm entitled "FlockbyLeader" that detects hierarchical leaders, discovers their followers, and enables them to flock based on local proximity in an artificial virtual space to create clusters. We offer empirical evidence that the algorithm outperforms both the existing flocking algorithm and the K-means algorithm. We analyze the performance of the algorithm based on widely used datasets in the literature.

The tools are developed in connection with the Norwegian Newspaper Corpus (NNC) project. The study presents a survey of the types of phenomena that an Anglicism detection tool should aim at identifying and the problems associated with the orthographic and morphological variability of Anglicisms. It also describes the development of an Anglicism detection tool and accounts for a set of experiments using lexicon-based, n-gram-based and combinatory methods. Finally it describes recently developed machine learning techniques that have been developed by the NNC team, arguing that the computational approach to Anglicism identification is a fruitful one.

Although there are a lot of works on small infrared target detection methods, we cannot apply them in real field due to high false alarm rate caused by clutters. This paper presents a novel target attribute extraction and machine learning-based target discrimination method. Eight kinds of target features are extracted and analyzed statistically. Learning-based classifiers such as SVM and Adaboost are developed and compared with conventional classifiers for real infrared images. In addition, the generalization capability is also inspected for various infrared clutters.

Rule-based classifiers often contain too many rules to be easily interpreted by humans, and methods for post-classification analysis of the rules are needed. Here we present a strategy for circular visualization of sets of classification rules. The Circos software was used to generate graphs showing all pairs of conditions that were present in the rules as edges inside a circle. We showed using simulated data that all two-way interactions in the data were found by the classifier and displayed in the graph, although the single attributes were constructed to have no correlation to the decision class. For all examples we used rules trained using the rough set theory, but the visualization would by applicable to any sort of classification rules. This method for rule visualization may be useful for applications where interaction terms are expected, and the size of the model limits the interpretability.

Different from classical diagnostic and prognostic system, like Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) / Prognostic Health Management (PHM), this system can be used on aircraft not only off-line for maintenance, but also at on-line during its flight mission. Machine learning of the system will be done with more powerful computer at Aircraft Ground Center or Maintenance Center. According to the different situations requirement and different equipment's conditions, two monitoring terminals are built: one is on operation at the aircraft on-line, which only needs to make 2 judgments of the health of aircraft - normal (contains the small faults which fault tolerant system can resolve) and dangerous (- back to airport) for pilot; another one is for the maintenance office, which needs detailed diagnosis results and to forecast the aircraft health. In comparison with some other methods, Support Vector Machines (SVM) is more convenient and stable. Unlike expect system or others methods, it can easily add new faults and new rules into database. In addition, with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), it can also make a visualization of evaluation of flux data with haut dimension and of their boundary, which is used to realize prognosis and useful for engineers to study faults. This system should not be a black box.

There are currently ways to discover problems using both noninvasive and invasive techniques. The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) has recently developed a noninvasive system called the Squid Array for Reproductive Assessment (SARA) that can be used to gather fetal heartbeat data. This raw data, however, must then be analyzed by a human being to determine if there is a problem with a given fetus. In this paper, we propose a method to enable a computer to determine if a fetus is in a healthy or unhealthy state by the employment of a technique that will allow for rapid analysis using data mining.

These systems undergo a learning process to achieve this capability. Case-based reasoning (CBR) is one of the promising learning paradigms for autonomic managers. Autonomic managers monitor the pulse of the monitored system on periodic basis and analyze the captured state of the system. In case of a problematic state, autonomic managers use their CBR based decision support system to rectify the problem. One of the critical problems in such systems is recovery from failures. The problem of identifying the factors affecting the performance of CBR system is a key element to build successful and accurate decision support systems. For this purpose, a hybrid CBR based self-healing system supported by attribute selection methods has been proposed. An empirical investigation has been conducted in this paper using different similarity measures, solution adaptation methods and attribute selection techniques. To address the performance problem of CBR in self-healing systems, we have conducted experiments on an emulator of self-healing systems called RUIBiS using different machine learning techniques to determine the significance of weights for these similarity distances.

Synthesizing such artifacts from example based specifications has various applications in the domains of enduser programming and intelligent tutoring systems. Synthesis from examples involves addressing two key technical challenges: (i) design of a user interaction model to deal with the inherent ambiguity in the example based specification. (ii) design of an efficient search algorithm -these algorithms have been based on paradigms from various communities including use of SAT/ SMT solvers (formal methods community), version space algebras (machine learning community), and A*-style goal-directed heuristics (AI community). This paper describes some effective user interaction models and algorithmic methodologies for synthesis from examples while discussing synthesizers for a variety of artifacts ranging from tricky bitvector algorithms, spreadsheet macros for automating repetitive data manipulation tasks, ruler/ compass based geometry constructions, algebraic identities, and predictive intellisense for repetitive drawings and mathematical terms.

The high transaction volume of these sites calls for the use of machine learning techniques in fraud prediction systems, at least for the identification of suspect sellers which deserve further expert analysis. In our work we identified a set of features related to listings, sellers and product categories, and built a system for fraud prediction taking into account the high class imbalance of real data, since fraud is a relatively rare event. The identified features are all based on publically accessible data, opening the possibility of developing fraud prediction systems independent of site operators. We tested the proposed system with data collected from a major online auction site, obtaining encouraging results on identification of fraudsters before they strike, while keeping the number of false positives low.

This approach to create the detection model requires, however, a lot of time with a continually growing data-set. Often changes in malware families and the increasing training time makes the model less efficient and increases the probability of false alarms. This paper approaches this matter by reducing the time needed to create a detection model on very large databases and suggests three different optimization techniques. First, the perceptron algorithm was adjusted to use the map-reduce paradigm in order to make it run in a distribute manner. Second, hardware specific optimizations were applied for faster mathematical computations. Finally, a cache system was used to reduce the quantity of data processed by the algorithm. Even if these methods were designed and tested for malware databases they can easily be adjusted for other databases as well.

But because of the large size of the dataset and the need of having a high detection rate, the resulted models have often produced many false positives. This paper proposes a modified version of the perceptron algorithm able to detect malware samples while training at a low rate (even zero) of false positives. A very low number of false positives is crucial because in a real life situation detecting a clean file as malware can destroy the operating system or render other programs unusable. We also provide a method of optimizing the training speed for the algorithm while maintaining the same accuracy. The resulted algorithm can be used in an ensemble or voting system to increase detection and eliminate false positives.

Clustering as the most common form of unsupervised learning enables automatic grouping of unlabeled documents into subsets called clusters. In this paper, the authors are concerned with results of clustering of very large electronic real-world data collections containing customers' reviews written freely, in English as a natural language. The reviews are automatically clustered into two groups that should contain either positive or negative reviews. The paper focuses on the analysis why certain reviews are assigned wrongly to a group containing mostly reviews of a different class. The assignment of a review into a certain cluster is based on its properties, i.e., on the words that appeared in the review. Thus, words appearing in incorrectly categorized reviews were analyzed. It was found that words that are important from the correct classification viewpoint (and thus bearing some sentiment) are often similarly important as the words in a different set than expected, therefore do not take effect as misleading information unlike words that are much more or quite insignificant.

Much progress has been achieved in the last two decades; however, researchers in the field also meet bafflement and challenges on the comprehensive and unbiased evaluation of the related technologies, which may prevent them from discovering the actual state of the art. BeFIT - Benchmarking Facial Image Analysis Technologies- is an international collaborative effort on standardizing the evaluation of facial image analysis technologies. The objective is to bring together different face analysis evaluations and provide a medium for researchers to discuss about different aspects of face analysis. This interaction would also lead to new datasets or combination of existing datasets. The BeFIT webpage (URL: http://face.cs.kit.edu/befit) is planned to serve as a repository of facial image analysis technologies benchmarks and the regular workshops are intended to serve as a medium where the researchers can discuss about different aspects of face analysis. In this talk, the Benchmarking Facial Image Analysis Technologies -BeFIT initiative will be introduced and an overview of the proposed challenges, benchmarks, and the provided data sets within the BeFIT framework will be presented.

Because hydrological models usually lack explanatory power, direct visualization of flow paths in dye tracer infiltration studies has become a standard tool in soil hydrology. These experiments provide images of dye-stained paths in soils and help evaluating the vulnerability or understanding the general hydrological functioning of a given site. Extracting relevant information demands expertise in hydrology as well as in image analysis and statistics. To our knowledge, no agreed and effective method to analyze large collections of such images exists in the soil hydrology community. In this paper we propose a general framework consisting of index functions and visual tools to support the expert in his/her evaluation of dye tracer infiltration images.

This paper proposes a novel methodology for improving the fuel economy of vehicle fleets via learning fuel-efficient driving behaviors. Vehicle fleets composed of large number of heavy vehicles routinely perform runs with different drivers over a set of fixed routes. While all drivers might achieve on-time and safe driving performance their actual driving behaviors and the subsequent fuel economy can vary substantially. The proposed Intelligent Driver System (IDS) utilizes vehicle performance data combined with GPS information on fixed routes to incrementally build a model of the historically most fuel efficient driving behavior. During driving, the calculated optimal velocity for specific location is compared to the current vehicle state and a fuzzy logic PD controller is used to compute the optimal control action. The control action can be projected to the drivers via a specialized HMI or used directly as a predictive cruise control to achieve overall fuel economy improvements. The method has been validated on a simulated heavy vehicle model, showing potential for substantial fuel economy improvements.

Therefore, other proposed schemes which aim at ether LIPA at H(e) NB or SIPTO at macro network could not get high accuracy and high speed at the same time, and traffic classification methodologies in wired IP network are not applicable. This paper proposes a fast fourier transform(FFT) based IP traffic classification system for SIPTO at H(e) NB, which focuses on classifying each packet at H(e) NB by extracting the application layer payload pattern using FFT. Pattern extraction and classification using machine learning algorithms are simulated, and results show that our system outperforms existing methods by offering about 3%-6% improvement in classification accuracy with about 7% time. Simulation of SIPTO shows good reduction of press to the core network and low false rates.

Thus the acquired data scale and software scale became more and more huge that active fault diagnosis treats with the data hardly. After decades of Artificial Intelligence development, AI technology has achieved significant results. Machine learning methods in AI have been widely used and developed in the field of fault diagnosis and prognosis. This paper discusses and demonstrates a complete machine learning fault diagnosis structure based on support vector regression, neural gas clustering, multiple-classes support vector machine, and Bayesian fuzzy fault tree, which are semi-supervised to isolate and predict faults from a component to a system/subsystem when there are partly uncertainty faults and finally provide a decision for the maintenance. It is crucial that machine learning methods are applied in the fault detection and prediction. Furthermore, the diagnostic intelligence can be found in multi-dimension empirical data and from granularity partition of avionics system based on the knowledge found and representation. Therefore the symptom-knowledge-information is suitable for representing the faults or failures in a system. The presented structure is generic and can be extended to the verification and validation of other diagnosis and prognostic algorithms on different platforms. It has been successfully preventing aircraft system/subsystem failures, identifying and predicting failures that will occur, which provides real application on making health management information and decisions.

In this research, we extend the classic two-dimensional scatter plot visualization algorithm into the third dimension by permitting competition to occur within a three-dimensional search space. This approach takes advantage of spatial memory and increases the intrinsic dimensionality of a widely used visualization technique. We also present a method of parallelizing this novel algorithm as a method of overcoming the runtime complexity associated with it using MPI.

This novel perimeter solution is designed to be sufficiently flexible for implementation at a wide range of facility types, from high security military or government installations to commercial power plants, to industrial facilities of various kinds. A prototype section of barrier has been produced and installed at the Sandia Exterior Intrusion Sensor Testing Facility in Albuquerque, NM. The prototype was implemented with a robust vehicle barrier and coupled with a variety of detection and assessment solutions to demonstrate both the effectiveness of such a solution, as well as the flexibility of the system. In this implementation, infrared sensors and fence disturbance sensors are coupled with a video motion detection sensor and ground sensors. The ability of the system to properly detect pedestrian or vehicle attempts to bypass, breach, or otherwise defeat the system will be characterized, as well as the Nuisance Alarm Rate.

That is, the fitness of rules should rightly score their quality and effectively guide GILP algorithm to be close to the target rule. In this paper, a new fitness function is proposed. By adopting the concept of binding, the new fitness function can adequately utilize the information hidden in background knowledge and training examples. By considering recall rate of rules, the new fitness function can avoid generating over-specific rules. Experiments on benchmark data set show that comparing with the common fitness function based on amount of examples covered by rules, the new fitness function can measure quality of first-order rules more precisely and enhance predictive accuracy of GILP.

This manufacturing process also generates an immense amount of data, from raw silicon to final packaged product. The centralized collection of this data in industry information warehouses presents a promising and heretofore untapped opportunity for integrated analysis. With a machine learning-based methodology, latent correlations in the joint process-test space could be identified, enabling dramatic cost reductions throughout the manufacturing process. To realize such a solution, this work addresses three distinct problems within semiconductor manufacturing: (1) Reduce test cost for analog and RF devices, as testing can account for up to 50% of the overall production cost of an IC; (2) Develop algorithms for post-production performance calibration, enabling higher yields and optimal power-performance; and, (3) Develop algorithms for spatial modeling of sparsely sampled wafer test parameters. Herein these problems are addressed via the introduction of a model-view-controller (MVC) architecture, designed to support the application of machine learning methods to problems in semiconductor manufacturing. Results are demonstrated on a variety of semiconductor manufacturing data from TI and IBM.

We optimize learning parameters and select the feature set with the smallest predictive error. We also explore the development of errors for predictions with larger time skips. We've applied the method for the prediction of CISS (Composite Indicator of Systemic Stress), a stability indicator created by the European Central Bank. We've chosen this indicator among other state-of-the-art indicators because of its high frequency, which indicates a quick response to distinctive changes on the market. The results show that CISS can be partially explained just by its past values up to six to eight weeks ahead, but large behaviour shifts are still surprising for the model. We've also discovered that including data over three months of age into the prediction context won't improve the results.

Particularly, we first unify those problems into a general ambiguous problem in which we simultaneously learn a robust classifier as well as find the optimal training labels from a finite label candidate set. To effectively utilize multiple views of data, we then develop our co-labeling approach for the general multi-view ambiguous problem. In our work, classifiers trained on different views can teach each other by iteratively passing the predictions of training samples from one classifier to the others. The predictions from one classifier are considered as label candidates for the other classifiers. To train a classifier with a label candidate set for each view, we adopt the Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) technique by constructing the base kernel through associating the input kernel calculated from input features with one label candidate. Compared with the traditional co-training method which was specifically designed for SSL, the advantages of our co-labeling are two-fold: 1) it can be applied to other ambiguous problems such as MIL and MMC; 2) it is more robust by using the MKL method to integrate multiple labeling candidates obtained from different iterations and biases. Promising results on several real-world multi-view data sets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed co-labeling for both MIL and SSL.

However, the sheer quantity of video makes it difficult to discover promising musicians. We present a novel algorithm to automatically identify talented musicians using machine learning and acoustic analysis on a large set of "home singing" videos. We describe how candidate musician videos are identified and ranked by singing quality. To this end, we present new audio features specifically designed to directly capture singing quality. We evaluate these vis-a-vis a large set of generic audio features and demonstrate that the proposed features have good predictive performance. We also show that this algorithm performs well when videos are normalized for production quality.

The standard low-rank matrix completion methods relax the rank minimization problem by the trace norm minimization. However, this relaxation may make the solution seriously deviate from the original solution. Meanwhile, most completion methods minimize the squared prediction errors on the observed entries, which is sensitive to outliers. In this paper, we propose a new robust matrix completion method to address these two problems. The joint Schatten p-norm and l(p)-norm are used to better approximate the rank minimization problem and enhance the robustness to outliers. The extensive experiments are performed on both synthetic data and real world applications in collaborative filtering and social network link prediction. All empirical results show our new method outperforms the standard matrix completion methods.

For instance, it is generally beneficial to utilize the ambiguous unlabeled documents to learn a more robust classifier for text categorization under the semi-supervised learning setting. To handle general data ambiguities, we present a unified kernel learning framework named Input-Output Kernel Learning (IOKL). Based on our framework, we further propose a novel soft margin group sparse Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) formulation by introducing a group kernel slack variable to each group of base input-output kernels. Moreover, an efficient block-wise coordinate descent algorithm with an analytical solution for the kernel combination coefficients is developed to solve the proposed formulation. We conduct comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets for both semi-supervised learning and multiple instance learning tasks, and also apply our IOKL framework to a computer vision application called text-based image retrieval on the NUS-WIDE dataset. Promising results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed IOKL framework.

Self-training algorithms are among the earliest attempts of using unlabeled data to enhance learning. Traditional self-training algorithms label unlabeled data on which classifiers trained on limited training data have the highest confidence. In this paper, a self-training algorithm that decreases the disagreement region of hypotheses is presented. The algorithm supplements the training set with self-labeled instances. Only instances that greatly reduce the disagreement region of hypotheses are labeled and added to the training set. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed self-training algorithm can effectively improve classification performance.

A predictive model can perform satisfactorily only if the training data is an appropriate representative of the test data. This is usually reflected in the assumption that the training data and the test data are drawn from the same underlying probability distribution. However, the assumption may not be correct in many applications for various reasons. We propose a method based on kernel distribution embedding and Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to address this problem. The proposed method explores a new representation of the data in a new feature space with two properties: (i) the distributions of the training and the test data sets are as close as possible in the new feature space, and (ii) the important structural information of the data is preserved. The algorithm can reduce the dimensionality of the data while it preserves the aforementioned properties and therefore it can be seen as a dimensionality reduction method as well. Our method has a closed-form solution and the experimental results show that it works well in practice.

However, the ability to analyze and exploit these unorganized multimedia data remains inadequate, even with state-of-the-art media processing techniques. Our finding in this paper is that the emerging social curation service is a promising information source for the automatic understanding and mining of images distributed and exchanged via social media. One remarkable virtue of social curation service datasets is that they are weakly supervised: the content in the service is manually collected, selected and maintained by users. This is very different from other social information sources, and we can utilize this characteristics for media content mining without expensive media processing techniques. In this paper we present a machine learning system for predicting view counts of images in social curation data as the first step to automatic image content evaluation. Our experiments confirm that the simple features extracted from a social curation corpus are much superior in terms of count prediction than the gold-standard image features of computer vision research.

In clinical applications traditional static feature selection methods that flatten the temporal data cannot be directly applied since the patient's observed clinical condition is a temporal multivariate time series where different variables can capture various stages of temporal change in the patient's health status. In this study, in order to identify informative genes in temporal microarray data, a margin based feature selection filter is proposed. The proposed method is based on well-established machine learning techniques without any assumptions about the data distribution. The objective function of temporal margin-based feature selection is defined to maximize each subject's temporal margin in its own relevant subspace. In the objective function, the uncertainty in calculating nearest neighbors is taken into account by considering the change in feature weights in each iteration. A fixed-point gradient descent method is proposed to solve the formulated objective function. The experimental results on both synthetic and real data provide evidence that the proposed method can identify more informative features than the alternatives that flatten the temporal data in advance.

However, understanding the multiple 'aspects' that contribute to users' ratings may help us to better understand their individual preferences. For example, a user's impression of an audiobook presumably depends on aspects such as the story and the narrator, and knowing their opinions on these aspects may help us to recommend better products. In this paper, we build models for rating systems in which such dimensions are explicit, in the sense that users leave separate ratings for each aspect of a product. By introducing new corpora consisting of five million reviews, rated with between three and six aspects, we evaluate our models on three prediction tasks: First, we uncover which parts of a review discuss which of the rated aspects. Second, we summarize reviews by finding the sentences that best explain a user's rating. Finally, since aspect ratings are optional in many of the datasets we consider, we recover ratings that are missing from a user's evaluation. Our model matches state-of-the-art approaches on existing small-scale datasets, while scaling to the real-world datasets we introduce. Moreover, our model is able to 'disentangle' content and sentiment words: we automatically learn content words that are indicative of a particular aspect as well as the aspect-specific sentiment words that are indicative of a particular rating.

Frequently, this type of data sets are incomplete in the sense that not all geographical coordinates have measured values of the variable(s) of interest. This incompleteness may be caused by poor data collection, measurement errors, costs management and many other factors. These missing values may cause several difficulties in many applications. Spatial imputation/interpolation methods try to fill in these unknown values in geo-referenced data sets. In this paper we propose a new spatial imputation method based on machine learning algorithms and a series of data preprocessing steps. The key distinguishing factor of this method is allowing the use of data from faraway regions, contrary to the state of the art on spatial data mining. Images (e. g. from a satellite or video surveillance cameras) may also suffer from this incompleteness where some pixels are missing, which again may be caused by many factors. An image can be seen as a spatial data set in a Cartesian coordinates system, where each pixel (location) registers some value (e. g. degree of gray on a black and white image). Being able to recover the original image from a partial or incomplete version of the reality is a key application in many domains (e. g. surveillance, security, etc.). In this paper we evaluate our general methodology for spatial interpolation on this type of problems. Namely, we check the ability of our method to fill in unknown pixels on several images. We compare it to state of the art methods and provide strong experimental evidence of the advantages of our proposal.

However, there is an important case when there are sufficient training data coming from other domains (source). Transfer learning aims at finding ways to transfer knowledge learned from a source domain to a target domain by handling the subtle differences between the source and target. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to solve the aforementioned knowledge transfer problem via low-rank representation constraints. This is achieved by finding an optimal subspace where each datum in the target domain can be linearly represented by the corresponding subspace in the source domain. Extensive experiments on several databases, i.e., Yale B, CMU PIE, UB KinFace databases validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show the superiority to the existing, well-established methods.

In this paper, we formally study this problem, and propose a new framework for cost-sensitive online classification by exploiting the idea of online gradient descent techniques. Based on the framework, we propose a family of cost-sensitive online classification algorithms, which are designed to directly optimize two well-known cost-sensitive measures: (i) maximization of weighted sum of sensitivity and specificity, and (ii) minimization of weighted misclassification cost. We analyze the theoretical bounds of the cost-sensitive measures made by the proposed algorithms, and extensively examine their empirical performance on a variety of cost-sensitive online classification tasks.

There are a large number of campaigns containing coordinated spam or promoting accounts in Twitter, which are more harmful than the traditional methods, such as email spamming. Since traditional solutions mainly check individual accounts or messages, it is an urgent task to detect spam and promoting campaigns in Twitter. In this paper, we propose a scalable framework to detect both spam and promoting campaigns. Our framework consists of three steps: firstly linking accounts who post URLs for similar purposes, secondly extracting candidate campaigns which may exist for spam or promoting purpose and finally distinguishing their intents. One salient aspect of the framework is introducing a URL-driven estimation method to measure the similarity between accounts' purposes of posting URLs, the other one is proposing multiple features to distinguish the candidate campaigns based on a machine learning method. Over a large-scale dataset from Twitter, we can extract the actual campaigns with high precision and recall and distinguish the majority of the candidate campaigns correctly.

A typical example of this situation is the prediction of plasma disruptions in Tokamak devices. This paper shows the implementation of a real time disruption predictor. The predictor is based on a support vector machine (SVM). The implementation was done under the MARTe framework on a six core x86 architecture. The system is connected in JET's Real time Data Network (RTDN). Online results show a high degree of successful predictions and a low rate of false alarms thus, confirming its usefulness in a disruption mitigation scheme. The implementation shows a low computational load, which in an immediate future will be exploited to increase the prediction's temporal resolution.	[Lopez, J.

However, with the current communication systems mainly optimized for human to human communications, there are important capabilities that need to be developed in M2M systems in order to fully realize the new smart services enabled by M2M. In this paper, we provide an overview of M2M and its applications to smart grid. In particular, we discuss technical areas where data mining and machine learning can play an important role in realizing various smart functionalities in the future power grid. As a case study, we also present a novel phase identification technique in smart grid based on smart meter data. Preliminary results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Mask-assignment conflicts represent the biggest challenge for MP and limiting them through design rules is crucial for the adoption of MP technology. In this paper, we offer a methodology for the early evaluation and exploration of layout and MP rules intended for speeding up the rules-development cycle. Using a novel wiring-estimation method, we create layout estimates with fine-grained congestion prediction. MP-conflicts are then predicted using a machine-learning approach. In this work, we demonstrate the use of the method for double-patterning lithography in litho-etch-litho-etch process; the methodology is more general, however, and can be applied for other multiple-patterning technologies including tripe/multiple-patterning with multiple litho-etch steps, self-aligned double patterning (SADP), and directed self-assembly. Results of testing the methodology on standard-cell layouts show an 81% accuracy in DP-conflicts prediction. The methodology was then used to explore DP and layout rules and investigate their effects on DP-compatibility and layout area. The methodology allows for rules optimization; for example, pushing the minimum tip-to-side same-color spacing rule value from 1.7x to 1.5x the minimum side-to-side spacing design rule (i.e., from 110nm down to 90nm) would more than double the number of DP-compatible cells in the library.

We demonstrate a novel active learning guided machine learning approach for characterizing circuit performance. When employed under the context of support vector machines, the proposed probabilistically weighted active learning approach is able to dramatically reduce the size of the training data, leading to significant reduction of the overall training cost. The proposed active learning approach is extended to the training of asymmetric support vector machine classifiers, which is further sped up by a global acceleration scheme. We demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed techniques using three case studies: PLL lock-time verification, SRAM yield analysis and prediction of chip peak temperature using a limited number of on-chip temperature sensors.

These bit level assertions are numerous, making them unreadable and frequently unusable. We propose a methodology to discover word level features using static and dynamic analysis of the RTL source code. We use discovered word level features for the underlying learning algorithms to generate word level assertions. A post processing of assertions is employed to remove redundant propositions. Experimental results on Ethernet MAC, I C-2, and OpenRISC designs show that the generated word level assertions have higher expressiveness and readability than their corresponding bit level assertions.

Localized error detection seeks to identify which particular words in a user's utterance have been misrecognized. Identifying misrecognized words permits one to create targeted clarification strategies for spoken dialogue systems, allowing the system to ask clarification questions targeting the particular type of misrecognition, in contrast to the "please repeat/rephrase" strategies used in most current dialogue systems. We present results of machine learning experiments using ASR confidence scores together with prosodic and syntactic features to predict whether 1) an utterance contains an error, and 2) whether a word in a misrecognized utterance is misrecognized. We show that by adding syntactic features to the ASR features when predicting misrecognized utterances the F-measure improves by 13.3% compared to using ASR features alone. By adding syntactic and prosodic features when predicting misrecognized words F-measure improves by 40%.

This paper introduces an automatic method for the classification of strong-weak (SW) and weak-strong (WS) stress patterns in children speech with American English accent, for use in the assessment of the speech dysprosody. We investigate the ability of two sets of features used to train classifiers to identify the variation in lexical stress between two consecutive syllables. The first set consists of traditional features derived from measurements of pitch, intensity and duration, whereas the second set consists of energies of different filter banks. Three different classifiers were used in the experiments: an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier with a single hidden layer, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with both linear and Gaussian kernels and the Maximum Entropy modeling (MaxEnt). these features. Best results were obtained using an ANN classifier and a combination of the two sets of features. The system correctly classified 94% of the SW stress patterns and 76% of the WS stress patterns.

J	Dawidowicz, J				Dawidowicz, Jacek			Expert System for Evaluation of Water Distribution System Created with an Inductive Inference	ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA			Polish	Article								At present often in computer programs the methods of computational intelligence are used, in this expert systems. In building of expert systems the process of knowledge acquisition is one of the principle problem. The improvement of knowledge acquisition is received by use of the machine learning methods. The most popular strategy of knowledge acquisition in the machine learning methods is the inductive inference, in this induction of decision trees. Inductive inference is the process of reaching a general conclusion from specific examples. This paper presents results of the induction of the decision tree intended to evaluation of water distribution system. Rules kept in the decision tree make possible to estimate the new project variants of the water supply network. Applying the induction of decision trees entails the preparation of a set of examples learners. Collection of examples should be representative and sufficiently describe the specific features of the problem. Using information on the eight water supply systems and the parameters of their work, the computations were performed water distribution system. The calculation results were the basis for the calculation defined in this study the variables that characterize the solution of the water distribution system. Five classes are defined to describe the water supply problems due to improper water distribution system and one associated with the correct solution. Each class will be selected on the basis of defined variables. Therefore, the decision tree should lead to the assignment of variables describing the system of water distribution to the appropriate class, characterized by the solution of the system. Using inductive inference obtained decision rules that can be used in expert system that can work with the program for the simulation of hydraulic water distribution systems.

Otherwise, we cannot analyze and handle them in real time. By classifying them, we can analyze only some unknown malwares intensively. In this paper, we propose a framework for malware classification using static and dynamic analysis. We focus on techniques that extract malware features. We name the framework GATTACA(Genome-based ATTACk geneAlogy) from the movie that covers genome of human. We define features of Malware as Mal-DNA(Malware DNA). Mal-DNA includes static, hybrid and dynamic characteristics. In short, GATTACA is the framework for extracting Mal-DNA from malwares and classifying them. GATTACA consists of three components: (1) START(STatic Analyzer using vaRious Techniques) extracts static Mal-DNA of malware. (2) DeBON(Debugging-based Behavior mOnitor and aNalyzer) extracts hybrid and dynamic Mal-DNA of them. (3) CLAM(CLassifier using Mal-DNA) classifies malwares based on Mal-DNA using machine learning. START and DeBON extract Mal-DNA, and CLAM classifies malwares based on Mal-DNA. In this paper, we target on START and DeBON extracting Mal-DAN from malwares.

For practical applications, WSN deployments can be time-consuming and error-prone, since they have the utmost challenge of guaranteeing connectivity and proper area coverage upon deployment. This creates an unmet demand for decision-support systems that help manage this complex process. This paper presents research-in-progress to develop an advanced decision-support system for predicting the optimal deployment of wireless sensor nodes within an area of interest. The proposed research will have significant impact on the future application of WSN technology, specifically in the emergency response, environmental quality, national security, and engineering education domains.

Meanwhile, location sensing applications have become increasingly popular on smartphones, since many, if not all, smartphones are equipped with a powerful sensor set, which includes GPS, WiFi, accelerometer, orientation, etc. Unfortunately, as the core enabler of most location sensing applications, GPS incurs an unacceptable energy cost that can cause complete battery drain within a few hours. In this paper we introduce SensTrack, a location tracking service which leverages sensor hints on the smartphone to reduce the usage of GPS. SensTrack selectively executes a GPS sampling by utilizing the information from accelerometer and orientation sensor, and switches to alternate location sensing method based on WiFi when users go indoors. A machine learning technique, Gaussian Process Regression, is then employed to reconstruct the track from recorded location samples. Evaluation on traces from real users demonstrates that SensTrack can significantly reduce the usage of GPS and still achieve good tracking accuracy.

The Rough set classifier and SVM classifier are used to classify nodes as trust nodes, strange nodes and malicious nodes. We use the Rough set classifier to replace the method by settings of the threshold. The innovation of the article is to improve the computation accuracy and the efficiency of the classification computation by using Rough set combined with SVM classifier. In the cases where according to the value of an attribute or the values of two attributes the corresponding classification result can be determined, we use the Rough set classifier. In other cases, we use SVM classifier. Compared with existing security models, experiment results indicate that the model can obtain the higher examination rate of malicious nodes and the higher transaction success rate.

Previous research was focussed on extracting only binary relations, but in recent times the focus is shifted towards extracting more complex relations in the form of bio-molecular events that may include several entities or other relations. In this paper we propose a machine learning approach based on Conditional Random Field (CRF) to extract the arguments of bio-molecular events. The overall task involves identification of event triggers from texts, classification of them into some predefined categories and determining the arguments of these events. We identify and implement a set of features in the forms of statistical and linguistic features that represent various morphological, syntactic and contextual information. Experiments on the benchmark setup of BioNLP 2009 shared task show the recall, precision and F-measure values of 45.75%, 78.93% and 57.91%, respectively.

Clustering ensemble solves the problem in two steps:firstly,generating a large set of clustering partitions based on the clustering algorithms;secondly,combining them using a consensus function to get the final clustering result. The key technology of clustering ensemble is the proper consensus function. Recent research proposed using the matrix factorization to solve clustering ensemble. In this paper, we firstly analyze some traditional matrix factorization algorithms; secondly, we propose a new consensus function using binary nonnegative matrix factorization (BMF) and give the optimization algorithm of BMF; lastly, we propose the new framework of clustering ensemble algorithm and give some experiments on UCI Machine Learning Repository. The experiments show that the new algorithm is effective and clustering performance could be significantly improved.

However some of the data mining techniques like classification and clustering cannot deal with numeric attributes though most real dataset contains some numeric attributes. Continuous attributes should be divided into a small distinct range of nominal attributes in order to apply data mining techniques. Correct discretization makes the dataset succinct and contributes to the high performance of classification algorithms. Meanwhile, several methods are presented and applied, but it is often dependent on the area. In this paper, we propose a weighted hybrid discretization technique based on entropy and contingency coefficient. Also we analyze performance evaluation with well-known techniques of discretization such as Equal-width binning, 1R, MDLP and ChiMerge.

Recently, kernel-based methods have attracted more and more attention and have shown excellent performance in pattern recognition, machine learning and image classification etc. The common weakness of the kernel-based learning algorithms is that they cannot deal with a large dataset. In this paper, a novel classification method for large datasets named Sub-KFDA (Subspace classification based on Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis) is presented. A subspace mining approach based on frequent patterns and kernel-based fisher discriminant analysis is designed to decompose the initial large dataset classification problem into many small dataset classification problems. Experiment results on UCI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has advantages in accuracy in comparison to other classification approaches.

Pawlak rough set theory provides a solid theoretical basis for processing incomplete or inconsistent data described by nominal attributes. However, it fails to deal with real classification tasks, in which most of the sample sets are numerical data Recently, neighborhood covering methods based on rough sets demonstrate promising views in classification rule learning. These methods apply to numerical or complex data. In this paper, we put forward new neighborhood covering rule learning algorithms. We redefine the neighborhood radius to generalize the model, experiments produce good results in reducing the rule number, and more powerful generalization ability is expected. In terms of rule learning strategy, we combine kernel covering method, create an optimization classification hyperplane, and solve quadratic programming problem to train support coverings, like support vectors in SVM. Experiments show good classification performance of our improved algorithm.

As a part of the system, Police Performance Appraisal Early Warning can accelerate feedback speed and improve the efficiency of the performance appraisal. This paper aims at proposing an improved decision tree classification algorithm based on ID3 algorithm to raise the accuracy of early warning. The attribute selection measure of the improved ID3 algorithm is determined by information gain, the attribute significance and the number of attribute values, which not only overcomes the disadvantage of the gain criterion tends to favor attributes with many values of lD3 algorithm, but also considers the dependence between the attributes. The datasets used by experiments come from the Police Performance Appraisal Early Warning System and the UCI Machine Learning Repository respectively. The comparative analysis of the experimental results shows that the improved ID3 algorithm is more accurate and stable.

Spam Filtering through Anomaly Detection	E-BUSINESS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS	Communications in Computer and Information Science		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Joint Conference on e-Business and Telecommunications (ICETE)	JUL 18-21, 2011	Seville, SPAIN			Computer security; Spam filtering; Anomaly detection; Text classification	SELECTION; CATEGORIZATION; MODELS	More than 85% of received e-mails are spam. Spam is an important issue for computer security because it is used to spread other threats such as computer viruses, worms or phishing. Classic techniques to fight spam, including simple techniques such as sender blacklisting or the use of e-mail signatures, are no longer completely reliable. Machine-learning techniques trained using statistical representations of the terms that usually appear in the e-mails are widely used in the literature. However, these methods demand a time-consuming training step with labelled data. Dealing with the situation where the availability of labelled training instances is limited slows down the progress of filtering systems and offers advantages to spammers. In this paper, we present the first spam filtering method based on anomaly detection that reduces the necessity of labelling spam messages and only uses the representation of legitimate e-mails. This approach represents legitimate e-mails as word frequency vectors. Thereby, an email is classified as spam or legitimate by measuring its deviation to the representation of these legitimate e-mails. This method achieves high accuracy rates detecting spam and maintains a low false positive rate, reducing the effort produced by labelling spam.

By doing so, we restrict computationally-expensive compatibility checking to systems within the same domain category. In this paper we show that this classification can be carried out by leveraging techniques derived from automatic document classification. In particular, we devise an approach that exploit the characteristics of web service interface descriptions to extract the features necessary for inferring the categorisation function. We further reports the results of experiments in categorising various web service interface descriptions using different classification algorithms.

We compare our results with principal components analysis (PCA) and tree structured vector quantization (TSVQ) based tracking. This work is significant since PCA is commonly used in the Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning and Computer Vision communities. On the other hand, TSVQ is commonly used in the Signal Processing and data compression communities. RVQ with more than two stages has not received much attention due to the difficulty in producing stable designs. In this work, we bring together these different approaches into an integrated tracking framework and show that RVQ tracking performs best according to multiple criteria over a variety of publicly available datasets. Moreover, an advantage of our approach is a learning-based tracker that builds the target model while it tracks, thus avoiding the costly step of building target models prior to tracking.

Detection of artery voxels in dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI is the key challenge in estimating the AIF. In the presence of tumour tissue, automatic detection of arteries becomes as even more challenging task. In this paper we propose a supervised machine-learning based method for the detection of artery voxels in DCE-MRI of the brain. The method utilises a set of kinetic and local structural features with a logistic regression classifier in order to detect arterial voxels in the image. The performance of the method is evaluated on 11 DCE-MRI datasets, of patients with diagnosed brain cancer, in terms of area under the ROC curve and in terms of correlation with an ideal AIF. The results of the evaluation suggest that the proposed method has the potential to be used as a tool for accurate estimation of AIF in DCE-MRI of the brain.

The traditional approach involves two steps: (a) analyzing the application in order to create models and tools for exploration of the parameter space, and (b) exploring the parameter space using such tools. The proposed approach, called the Machine Learning Optimizer (MLO), involves a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm with an underlying surrogate fitness function model based on Gaussian Process (GP) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We present a case study of a quadrature based financial application with varied precision. We evaluate our approach by comparing the amount of benchmark evaluations and bit-stream generations when using MLO and when using the traditional approach.

So, as one of the most important fields in machine learning, dimensionality reduction has been paid more and more attention and has achieved a prodigious progress in the theory and algorithm research. Linear Graph embedding (LGE) model is an efficient tool for dimensionality reduction. According to the problems of supervised dimensionality reduction with Non-Gaussian data distributions and at the same time consider neighborhood preserving relations among samples, a novel subspace learning method, neighborhood preserving and marginal discriminant embedding (NP-MDE), is proposed based on LGE and marginal Fisher analysis in this paper. NP-MDE could minimize the within-class scatter and meanwhile maximize the margin among different classes. Moreover, the neighborhood structure with each class is preserved. Experiments on Yale face image data sets show that after dimensionality reduction using NP-MDE, the average classification accuracy is very good. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In order to evaluate the performance of wireless channel spectrum sensing strategy effectively, the statistical mean value is put forward as evaluation criteria for the cognitive user with fixed rate service. Study shows that, for the objective license channel vacancy and occupancy state time with exponentially distribution as well as the same distribution parameter, vacancy state probability follows uniform distribution. Then, the paper analyses how the channel time detection threshold have an influence on throughput. With the increasing of sample size, the estimate of throughput converges in probability to its statistical mean value. Simulation indicates that the spectrum sensing throughput performance of the cognitive user with fixed rate service based on machine learning achieves better performance compared with random spectrum sensing. Ultimately, the channel time detection threshold is achieved when maximizing the statistical mean throughput. (c) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Investigation of hidden parameters influencing the automated object detection in images from the deep seafloor of the HAUSGARTEN observatory	2012 OCEANS			English	Proceedings Paper	MTS/IEEE Oceans Conference	OCT 14-19, 2012	Virginia Beach, VA	IEEE, Marine Technol Soc (MTS), IEEE OES (IEEE/OES)				Detecting objects in underwater image sequences and video frames automatically, requires the application of selected algorithms in consecutive steps. Most of these algorithms are controlled by a set of parameters, which need to be calibrated for an optimal detection result. Those parameters determine the effectivity and efficiency of an algorithm and their impact is usually well known. There are however further non-algorithmic impact factors (or hidden parameters), which bias the training of a machine learning system as well as the subsequent detection process and thus need to be well understood and taken into account. In the context of megafauna detection in benthic images, we investigate the effects of some of these parameters on our machine learning based detection system iSIS. The images to be analyzed were taken at the deep-sea, long-term observatory HAUSGARTEN in which five experts labeled seven distinct object classes as an annotation gold standard. We found, that the hidden parameters from imaging as well as the fusion of expert knowledge could partly be compensated and were able to achieve detection performances of 0.67 precision and 0.87 recall. Despite the efforts to compensate the hidden parameters, the detection performance was still varying across the image transect. This poses the potential occurrence of further hidden parameters not taken into account so far.

The automatic detection of hot rolled steel surface defects in a real process is challenging due to the localization of it on a large surface and its rare occurrences. In this work an effort has been made to extract a set of features that can effectively address the problem of defect detection on hot rolled steel surface by using machine learning algorithm. It is intended to extract two types of features, namely wavelet and contourlet features with two and three resolution levels separately, and then make a comparison of performance of classification accuracy using these features. Here it is proposed to use state-of-the art support vector machine (SVM) classifier as the machine learning algorithm for detecting the defect surface and normal (defects free) surface. Experimental results on 14 different types of steel surface defects show that 'haar' wavelet features with three decomposition levels performs better than two levels 'haar' feature set or two and three decomposition levels contourlet feature set.

With evolving social dynamics of millions across the globe, it provides opportunity to make use of patterns in investor sentiment comprising of large scale microblog discussions to understand market movements and make an effective application in making hedging decisions. We apply sentiment analysis and machine learning principles to study causation between public collective sentiment and market movements. In this work we have used 0.6 million tweets for a period of November 2010 to June 2011, to run a practical simulation of hedging model for Dow Jones Industrial Average-DJIA Index. We have elaborated on how a simple hedging strategy like married-put can exercise use of weekly directional forecasts for DJIA to make portfolio adjustments from risky to high market conditions and vice versa.

It makes more efficient use of the learner's time by asking them to label only instances that are most useful for the trainer. We propose a novel method for solving this problem and show that it favorably results in the increased performance. Our proposed framework is based on an ensemble approach, where Support Vector Machine and Conditional Random Field are used as the base learners. The intuition is that both learning approaches are somewhat orthogonal in their advantages, so a combination of them can yield superior results. The proposed approach is applied for solving the problem of named entity recognition (NER) in two Indian language, namely Hindi and Bengali. Results show that the proposed technique indeed improves the performance of the system.

The inherent complex structures of chemical names and the existence of several representations and nomenclatures (like SMILES, InChI, IUPAC) pose a big challenge to their automatic identification and classification. In this paper we present a supervised machine learning approach based on Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to find mentions of IUPAC and IUPAC-like names in scientific text. We identify and implement a very rich feature set for the task without using any domain specific knowledge and/or resources. Experiments are carried out on the benchmark MEDLINE datasets. Evaluation shows encouraging performance with the overall recall, precision and F-measure values of 90.96%, 91.52% and 91.23%, respectively. We also present the scope of comparison to the existing state-of-the-art system(s).

Case-Based Reasoners fall under the category of Lazy Learners. CBRs treat every freshly encountered unclassified object as a case, and endeavours to place it in a storage area called Case-Base, after supplementing the object with its correct class. This process of insertion is preceded by a search amongst the old cases in the Base. If an exact match is found there is no need to insert. Otherwise, some near matches are found whose class information help to provide the new case with a suitable class and insert it in the Case-Base. Search and insertion techniques are optimized by first generating keys for each data tuple or case and then using universal hashing functions to map these onto the base while searching for matches. Collisions are next resolved by open addressing strategies such as linear and quadratic probing, and double hashing. Performance of the Classifiers are analysed with the help of some standard datasets provided by the UCI machine learning repository.

However, the consulting required to configure an ERP to meet the specific needs of an organization remains a major financial and organizational burden for SMEs. Automatic ERP package configuration based on knowledge engineering, machine learning and data mining could be a solution to lessen the burden of the implementation process. This chapter presents two approaches to an automation of selected configuration options of the FOS-ERP package ERP5. These approaches are based on knowledge engineering with decision trees and machine learning with classifiers. The design of the ERP5 Artificial intelligence Toolkit (EAT) aims at the integration of these approaches into ERP5. The chapter also shows how FOS-ERP can boost Information System (IS) research. The investigation of the automation approaches was only possible because the free source code and technical documentation of ERP5 was accessible for TU Dresden researchers.

For automatic extraction of interaction information, the machine learning approach is useful. Generally, linguistic features obtained directly from the literature are used for learning, but a non-linguistic feature such as the atomic distance calculated from the protein structure data is often very effective for learning and classification. We call this type of feature a "key feature" in this study. In the machine learning approach, preparing enough training instances to train the classifier is important, but this often requires great cost. In such a situation, transfer learning is one of the better approaches. However, it is difficult to apply a simple transfer learning algorithm to a task in which the key feature cannot be prepared in the source domain. In this study, we propose a new transfer learning method called STEK (Selective Transfer learning based on Effectiveness of a Key feature). In this method, we focus on the effectiveness of the key feature, and divide a set of instances into two categories. One is a set of instances applying transfer learning and the other is a set of instances avoiding the use of transfer learning. The proposed method with the InstPrune algorithm showed stably high precision, recall and F-measure on average.

Performance comparison with previous studies is presented in order to demonstrate the proposed algorithm's advantages over various classification methods. The goal of the paper is to provide the grasp of a methodology that can be efficiently used to raise classification success rates obtained by the use of conventional approaches such as Neural Networks, RBF networks and K-nearest neighbors. The suggested algorithm divides the training set into two subsets: one that arises from the joining of coherent data regions and one that comprises of the data portion that is difficult to be clustered. Consequently, the first subset is used to train a Support Vector Machine with a RBF kernel and the second subset is used to train another Support Vector Machine with a polynomial kernel. During classification the algorithm is capable of identifying which of the two Support Vector Machine models to use. The intuition behind the suggested algorithm relies on the expectation that the RBF Support Vector Machine model is more appropriate to use on data sets of different characteristics than the polynomial kernel. In the specific study case the suggested algorithm raised average classification success rate to 82.2% while the best performance obtained by previous studies was 81% given by a fine tuned highly complex ARTMAP-IC model.

Unlike other probabilistic methods, the VP framework guarantees validity under the assumption that the data are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Well-calibrated probabilistic outputs are of great importance, especially in biomedical applications. In this work, we develop a new Venn Predictor based on the Sequential Minimal Optimisation (SMO) algorithm and we examine its application to two real-world biomedical problems. We demonstrate in our results that our method can provide calibrated probabilistic outputs for predictions without any loss of accuracy. Moreover, we compare the outputs of our method with the probability outputs of SMO with logistic regression.

Exploration of Instantaneous Amplitude and Frequency Features for Epileptic Seizure Prediction	IEEE 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS & BIOENGINEERING			English	Proceedings Paper	12th IEEE International Conference on BioInformatics and BioEngineering (BIBE)	NOV 11-13, 2012	Larnaca, CYPRUS	IEEE, Cyprus Presidency Council European Union, IEEE Comp Soc, Univ Cyprus, Biol & AI Fdn (BAIF), Frederick Univ, Hellen Soc Computat Biol & Bioinformat (HSCBB), Tech Univ Cyprus, IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc (IEEE EMBS), Int Federat Med & Biol Engn (IFMBE)		Epileptic seizure prediction; electroencephalogram signal representation; instantaneous amplitude and frequency modulation features	INTRACRANIAL EEG; SYMPTOMS; SIGNAL	For the purpose of effective epileptic seizure prediction, this paper presents a new representation for the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal by recurring to their primary amplitude and frequency components. This formulation is then applied on an epoch-by-epoch basis to the preictal and interictal states of EEG signals in order to extract the most dominant amplitude and frequency characteristics. Through inspecting and identifying the distinctive EEG signal changes and stage transitions revealed by these extracted feature vectors, upcoming epileptic seizures could be predicted in due course. Machine learning approaches have been employed to construct patient-specific classifiers that can divide the extracted feature vectors into preictal and interictal groups. In this context, our work is distinguished from most currently adopted feature extraction process which employs time-consuming high-dimensional parameter sets. We have made special efforts to derive discriminative and comprehensive features for the front-end of the epileptic seizure prediction algorithm. To reduce false alarms due to trivial signal fluctuation, a simple yet effective post-processing step is incorporated thereafter. Performance of the prediction algorithm is assessed through out-of-sample evaluation on the intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings provided by the publicly available Freiburg data set. It has been shown by simulation results that the proposed feature estimation method leads to promising prediction results in terms of sensitivity and specificity. In particular, only four out of the 83 seizures across all the patients included in our experiment were missed by the prediction, which means that a sensitivity as high as 95.2% has been achieved.

In this paper it is investigated whether Self Organizing Maps (SOMs) can generate clusters associated with a disease based on the genetic patterns of subjects. A batch categorical SOM that can handle missing data was used on Genome Wide Association (GWA) data on Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The association of the clusters generated with the disease were initially tested using the Pearson's chi square test and then the weights of the top clusters were used for investigating for SNP patterns. The results of the analyses reveal statistically significant associations between the generated clusters and the disease, indicating that SOMs can be used for multi-loci associations.

This work includes the use of Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) in classifying neural network and k-nearest neighborhood source code programs. Functional descriptors of each program are identified by extracting terms contained in the source code.Inaddition, information on where the terms are extracted from is also incorporated in the LSI. Based on the undertaken experiment, the LSI classifier is noted to generate a higher precision and recall compared to the C4.5 algorithm as provided in the Weka tool.			yuhanis@uum.edu.my; taha.trh@gmail.com; ady@uum.edu.my; anizamdady@uum.edu.my					Black S., 2005, IEEE INT WORKSH SOFT; Cheng Hua L., 2007, INT S INF TECHN CONV; Golub G.

It can assist developers to translate and develop the system based on activities and rules stated in the story card. However, conventional XP story card framework or template is not well defined. It only supports requirements in two or three sentences related to system functionality. This may lead to conflicts, missing, and ambiguous requirements. In order to overcome this problem, Machine Learning is one of the techniques that can be used to extract the content from the list of requirements and produce the story cards based on the priority and rules of requirements. Thus, this study aims to to propose a new technique of designing story cards based on user requirements. The finding from the study is a conceptual model of designing story cards using Machine Learning technique. Future research will investigate how the technique adapt with the iterative changes of the requirements.

Digital cameras have been successfully used as multi-channel imaging sensors, providing measures of leaf color change information (RGB channels), or leafing phenological changes in plants. We monitored leaf-changing patterns of a cerrado-savanna vegetation by taken daily digital images. We extract RGB channels from digital images and correlated with phenological changes. Our first goals were: (1) to test if the color change information is able to characterize the phenological pattern of a group of species; and (2) to test if individuals from the same functional group may be automatically identified using digital images. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to detect phenological patterns in the digital images. Our preliminary results indicate that: (1) extreme hours (morning and afternoon) are the best for identifying plant species; and (2) different plant species present a different behavior with respect to the color change information. Based on those results, we suggest that individuals from the same functional group might be identified using digital images, and introduce a new tool to help phenology experts in the species identification and location on-the-ground.

This presents some unusual challenges: the data are sparse, heterogeneous and incomplete; evolving in time; and most of the relevant information comes not from the data stream itself, but from a variety of archival data and contextual information (spatial, temporal, and multi-wavelength). We are exploring a variety of novel techniques, mostly Bayesian, to respond to these challenges, using the ongoing CRTS sky survey as a testbed. The current surveys are already overwhelming our ability to effectively follow all of the potentially interesting events, and these challenges will grow by orders of magnitude over the next decade as the more ambitious sky surveys get under way. While we focus on an application in a specific domain (astrophysics), these challenges are more broadly relevant for event or anomaly detection and knowledge discovery in massive data streams.

To bridge gaps between varying domain representations, researchers are developing metadata and semantic representations meaningful to broader communities. Through exploiting these representations we propose a logical model and architecture by which cross-domain researchers can more easily discover, use, and eventually archive, data. In this paper we present an architecture, intermediate data model, and methodology for mapping diverse social-ecological data sources stored in relational databases to a common representation, and for classifying textual data using machine learning. The results are visualized through client views that are built against the general logical model, and applied against a longitudinal database from social-ecological research.

However, it is a relatively expensive and labor-intensive process. About 30-50% of the synthesized proteins are not soluble, thereby further reduces the efficacy of gene synthesis as a method for protein function characterization. Solubility prediction from primary protein sequences holds the promise to dramatically reduce the cost of gene synthesis. This work presents a framework that creates models of solubility from sequence information. From the primary protein sequences of the genes to be synthesized, sequence features can be used to build computational models for solubility. This way, biologists can focus the effort on synthesizing genes that are highly likely to generate soluble proteins. We have developed a framework that employs several machine learning algorithms to model protein solubility. The framework is used to predict protein solubility in the Escherichia coli expression system. The analysis is performed on over 1,600 quantified proteins. The approach successfully predicted the solubility with more than 80% accuracy, and enabled in depth analysis of the most important features affecting solubility. The analysis pipeline is general and can be applied to any set of sequence features to predict any binary measure. The framework also provides the biologist with a comprehensive comparison between different learning algorithms, and insightful feature analysis.

However, their execution time makes them unsuitable for online applications. Indeed, identifying similar keypoints requires comparing a large number of high dimensional descriptor vectors. Previous work has shown that matching could be still accurately performed when only considering a few highly significant keypoints. In this paper, we investigate reducing the number of generated SURF features to speed up image matching while maintaining the matching recall at a high level. We propose a machine learning approach that uses a binary classifier to identify keypoints that are useful for the matching process. Furthermore, we compare the proposed approach to another method for keypoint pruning based on saliency maps. The two approaches are evaluated using ground truth datasets. The evaluation shows that the proposed classification-based approach outperforms the adversary in terms of the trade-off between the matching recall and the percentage of reduced keypoints. Additionally, the evaluation demonstrates the ability of the proposed approach of effectively reducing the matching runtime.

We first employ a Natural Language Processing pipeline to extract relevant terms from the source text, and then use a combination of a pattern-based and machine-learning approach to establish semantic relationships among those terms, with some user's feedback required in-between. This methodology for discovering characterizing knowledge from textual sources finds its inception as an extension of PRAISED, our abbreviation discovery framework, in order to enhance its resolution capabilities. By moving from a paper-by-paper, mainly syntactical process to a corpus-based, semantic approach, it was in fact possible to overcome earlier limits of the system related to abbreviations whose explanation could not be found within the same paper they were cited in. At the same time, though, the methodology we present is not tied to this specific task, but is instead of relevance for a variety of contexts, and might therefore be used to build a stand-alone system for advanced knowledge extraction and semantic categorization.

The aim is to restrict the easy access of underage youngsters to such potentially harmful material. Most of the existing techniques are mere extensions of image categorization approaches. In this paper we propose a video genre classification technique tuned specifically for adult content detection by considering cinematographic principles. Spatial and temporal simple features are used with machine learning algorithms to perform the classification into two classes: adult and non-offensive video material. Shot duration and camera motion, are the temporal domain features, and skin detection and color histogram are the spatial domain ones. Using two data sets of 7 and 15 hours of video material, our experiments comparing two different SVM classifiers achieved an accuracy of 94.44%.	[Ochoa, Victor M.

Alternatives, including oxygen saturation measurement, chest ultrasound and chest auscultation, exist but with potential disadvantages. Electronic auscultation has potential for improved detection of paediatric pneumonia but has yet to be standardised. The authors aim to investigate the use of electronic auscultation to improve the specificity of the current WHO algorithm in developing countries. Methods: This study is designed to test the hypothesis that pulmonary pathology can be differentiated from normal using computerised lung sound analysis (CLSA). The authors will record lung sounds from 600 children aged <= 5 years, 100 each with consolidative pneumonia, diffuse interstitial pneumonia, asthma, bronchiolitis, upper respiratory infections and normal lungs at a children's hospital in Lima, Peru. The authors will compare CLSA with the WHO algorithm and other detection approaches, including physical exam findings, chest ultrasound and microbiologic testing to construct an improved algorithm for pneumonia diagnosis. Discussion: This study will develop standardised methods for electronic auscultation and chest ultrasound and compare their utility for detection of pneumonia to standard approaches. Utilising signal processing techniques, the authors aim to characterise lung sounds and through machine learning, develop a classification system to distinguish pathologic sounds. Data will allow a better understanding of the benefits and limitations of novel diagnostic techniques in paediatric pneumonia.

A scoping review of malaria forecasting: past work and future directions	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORKS; TIME-SERIES; PREDICTION; EPIDEMIC; TRANSMISSION; REGRESSION; ETHIOPIA; MODELS	Objectives: There is a growing body of literature on malaria forecasting methods and the objective of our review is to identify and assess methods, including predictors, used to forecast malaria. Design: Scoping review. Two independent reviewers searched information sources, assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data from each study. Information sources: Search strategies were developed and the following databases were searched: CAB Abstracts, EMBASE, Global Health, MEDLINE, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses and Web of Science. Key journals and websites were also manually searched. Eligibility criteria for included studies: We included studies that forecasted incidence, prevalence or epidemics of malaria over time. A description of the forecasting model and an assessment of the forecast accuracy of the model were requirements for inclusion. Studies were restricted to human populations and to autochthonous transmission settings. Results: We identified 29 different studies that met our inclusion criteria for this review. The forecasting approaches included statistical modelling, mathematical modelling and machine learning methods. Climate-related predictors were used consistently in forecasting models, with the most common predictors being rainfall, relative humidity, temperature and the normalised difference vegetation index. Model evaluation was typically based on a reserved portion of data and accuracy was measured in a variety of ways including mean-squared error and correlation coefficients. We could not compare the forecast accuracy of models from the different studies as the evaluation measures differed across the studies. Conclusions: Applying different forecasting methods to the same data, exploring the predictive ability of non-environmental variables, including transmission reducing interventions and using common forecast accuracy measures will allow malaria researchers to compare and improve models and methods, which should improve the quality of malaria forecasting.

The model is formulated as a two-stage classifier according to the concept of machine learning. The first stage is to determine a set of case diagnostic issues, using a modular Artificial Neural Network (mANN), and the second stage is to determine the relevant legal elements which lead to legal charges identification, using SVM-equipped C4.5. The integrated multi-stage model aims at achieving high accuracy of classification while reserving "arguability". Hypothetically, mANN handles well for digesting complexity in case-level issues analysis with acceptable explanatory power and C4.5 addresses the lesser extent of contingency and provides human-interpretable logic concerning the high-level context of legal codes.

It is an important mechanism for autonomous systems due to the ability of exploiting the already acquired information and for exploring the new knowledge in the learning space at the same time. In these cases, the reliability of the labels is a crucial factor, because mislabeled samples may propagate wrong labels to a portion of or even the entire data set. This paper has the objective of addressing the error propagation problem originated by these mislabeled samples by presenting a mechanism embedded in a network-based (graph-based) semi-supervised learning method. Such a procedure is based on a combined random-preferential walk of particles in a network constructed from the input data set. The particles of the same class cooperate among them, while the particles of different classes compete with each other to propagate class labels to the whole network. Computer simulations conducted on synthetic and real-world data sets reveal the effectiveness of the model. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B. V.

The large number of reconstructed attributes as well as the small signal to background ratio in an atmospheric neutrino analysis makes IceCube well suited for a detailed study within the scope of machine learning. A systematic study intended to improve the event selection was carried out including a detailed feature selection using MRMR as well as the training and testing of a Random Forest. Finally, the forest was applied on IceCube data. A good agreement between data and Monte Carlo expectations has been observed.

Prior art teaches that Machine Learning can be used to categorize alertness of volunteers using Brain-Machine Interface Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Also, published research has described how EEG data can be correlated to the ability of participants to remember television commercials. This paper advances this research one step further. The paper examines whether or not Machine Learning can tell whether or not a participant likes a short YouTube video using only EEG data. The research is in the preliminary stage (two subjects thus far), but early results are promising. Also discussed in the paper is information regarding commercialization of the invention which is of interest to many universities. A provisional patent application was filed and a critique was gathered from executives from a famous advertising agency regarding commercialization of the invention for Neuromarketing. These executives provided valuable detailed feedback regarding pros and cons of different commercialization possibilities. Presented in the paper are the results of these discussions including specific areas where the research would and would not likely yield a successful commercial product.

Such organizations are bound by state, federal, and international laws to ensure that the confidentiality of both individuals and sensitive data is not compromised. However, during the privacy preserving process, the utility of such datasets diminishes even while confidentiality is achieved--a problem that has been defined as NP-Hard. In this paper, we investigate a differential privacy machine learning ensemble classifier approach that seeks to preserve data privacy while maintaining an acceptable level of utility. The first step of the methodology applies a strong data privacy granting technique on a dataset using differential privacy. The resulting perturbed data is then passed through a machine learning ensemble classifier, which aims to reduce the classification error, or, equivalently, to increase utility. Then, the association between increasing the number of weak decision tree learners and data utility, which informs us as to whether the ensemble machine learner would classify more correctly is examined. As results, we found that a combined adjustment of the privacy granting noise parameters and an increase in the number of weak learners in the ensemble machine might lead to a lower classification error.

Categories are a set of objects or events that have similar features and are grouped together because of their similarity. Many categories are acquired as a child (e.g., tools, fruit) but we continue to learn and apply new categories throughout life. Categories range from concrete (e.g., a set of physical objects like houses, do) to abstract (e.g., political ideologies,) and narrow (e.g., rifles) to broad (e.g., weapons). People in a variety of knowledge intensive fields (e.g., analysts, commanders, medical doctors) recognize categories in streams of data and make a decision about how to act (or pass the information to a decision maker). Such a categorization system is important now, especially because of the large amount of information that people need to sift through to do their jobs on a regular basis. When decision support systems (DSSs) are applied to support human decision making by automatically recognizing categories, these systems are often not practical in complex dynamic real world environments. Rule based DSSs are limited because it is difficult to develop and maintain large complex rule sets. Current machine learning based DSSs are sometimes limited because they require data that encompasses all of the possible variations as examples to learn from and necessitate significant effort to develop and maintain this training data. This paper describes a cognitive category learning system that uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to categorize unstructured documents or semi-structured objects, such as emails, which we used in this experiment. Our system uses several methods to do this categorization of emails and then arbitrates the best solution based on the individual classifier results. This result provides a more confident answer with less chance of false positive and false negative outcomes. Our system also generates a metadata topic summary for each document or email.

Accurate seasonal predictions of TC frequency and intensity are required, with a lead-time appropriate for preemptive action. Current schemes rely on linear statistics to generate forecasts of the TC activity for an upcoming season. Such techniques employ a suite of intercorrelated predictors; however, the relationships between predictors and TCs violate assumptions of standard prediction techniques. We extend tradition linear approaches, implementing support vector regression (SVR) models. Multiple linear regression (MLR) is used to create a baseline to assess SVR performance. Nine predictors for each calendar month (108 total) were inputs to MLR. MLR equations were unstable, owing to collinearity, requiring variable selection. Stepwise multiple regression was used to select a subset of three attributes adaptive to specific climatological variability. The R-2 for the MLR testing data was 0.182. The SVR model used the same predictors with a radial basis function kernel to extend the traditional linear approach. Results of that model had an R-2 of 0.255 (similar to 40% improvement over linear model). Refinement of the SVR to include the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) improved the SVR predictions dramatically with an R-2 of 0.564 (similar to 121% improvement over SVR without QBO).

The generalization performance of ensemble classification systems has been improved dramatically by training and combining some accurate and diverse classifiers.The model of support vector machine(SVM) ensemble based on artificial fish_swarm algorithm(AFSA) is proposed after analyzing the drawbacks of the known algorithms such as GASEN and CLU_ENN. The AFSA is used to optimize the ensemble weights of base SVMs for SVM ensemble after individual SVM of ensemble is trained. Those SVMs with weights larger than a given threshold value are ensembled. The method of selective ensemble is achieved to obtain better performance than traditional ones that ensemble all of the base SVMs. The simulated experiment results on UCI and StatLog show that the proposed method has better performance and the AFSA has its superiority on optimizing weights of SVM ensembles, and also on operation efficiency.

The accumulation of the determined protein complex structures with high resolution facilitates to realize this ambitious goal. Previous methods on protein-protein interaction affinity (PPIA) prediction have achieved great success. However, there is still a great space to improve prediction accuracy. Here, we develop a support vector regression method to infer highly heterogeneous protein-protein interaction affinities based on interface properties. This method takes full advantage of the labels of the interaction pairs and greatly reduces the dimensionality of the input features. Results show that the supervised machine leaning methods are effective with R=0.80 and SD=1.41 and perform well when applied to the prediction of highly heterogeneous or generic PPIA. Comparison of different types of interface properties shows that the global interface properties have a more stable performance while the smoothed PMF obtains the best prediction accuracy.

Many classification algorithms were introduced and simply validated on benchmark data. And they were not further discussed on under what condition they are assured to be learned successfully, because it is commonly hard to address such PAC learning issues. As one may accept, it would be even crucial to investigate the PAC learnability of the classification models if they are exploited to deal with some special data, such as gene microarray data. Rough hypercuboid classifier (RHC) is a novel classifier introduced for classification based on gene microarray data. After analyzing the VC-dimension and the time complexity of RHC, this paper proved that RHC is a PAC-learning model. The proof gives support to the further RHC applications in classifying cancers based on gene microarray data.

Efficient prediction of phishing websites using supervised learning algorithms	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEM DESIGN 2011	Procedia Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Communication Technology and System Design	DEC 07-09, 2011	Coimbatore, INDIA			Antiphishing; Classification; Machine learning; Phishing; Prediction; Supervised learning		Phishing is one of the luring techniques used by phishing artist in the intention of exploiting the personal details of unsuspected users. Phishing website is a mock website that looks similar in appearance but different in destination. The unsuspected users post their data thinking that these websites come from trusted financial institutions. Several antiphishing techniques emerge continuously but phishers come with new technique by breaking all the antiphishing mechanisms. Hence there is a need for efficient mechanism for the prediction of phishing website. This paper employs Machine-learning technique for modelling the prediction task and supervised learning algorithms namely Multi layer perceptron, Decision tree induction and Naive bayes classification are used for exploring the results. It has been observed that the decision tree classifier predicts the phishing website more accurately when comparing to other learning algorithms. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

They run a great variety of tasks: critical ones such as data taking and secondary ones like web servers. The administration of such a system and making sure it is working properly represents a very important workload for the small expert-operator team. Research has been performed to try to automatize (some) system administration tasks, starting in 2001 when IBM defined the so-called "self objectives" supposed to lead to "autonomic computing". In this context, we present a framework that makes use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to monitor and diagnose at a low level and in a non intrusive way Linux-based systems and their interaction with software. Moreover, the multi agent approach we use, coupled with an "object oriented paradigm" architecture should increase our learning speed a lot and highlight relations between problems.			christophe.haen@cern.ch					Bigus JP, 2002, IBM SYST J, V41, P350; Chan H, 2003, COMPANION ACM OOPSLA, P312; Cheng S.-W., 2006, P 2006 INT WORKSH SE, P2, DOI 10.1145/1137677.1137679; Alves AA, 2008, J INSTRUM, V3, DOI 10.1088/1748-0221/3/08/S08005; Diao Y, 2005, ENG AUTONOMIC SYST, P441; Fisch D, 2009, IA 2009: IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON INTELLIGENT AGENTS, P31; Ginsberg M, 1993, ESSENTIALS ARTIFICIA; Horn P., 2001, IBMS PERSPECTIVE STA; Huebscher MC, 2008, ACM COMPUT SURV, V40, P7; Kaiser G, 2003, ACTIVE MIDDLEWARE SE, P22; Karsai G, 2001, 2 INT WORKSH SELF AD; Kephart JO, 2003, COMPUTER, V36, P41, DOI 10.1109/MC.2003.1160055; LI T, 2010, SYSTEMS MAN CYBERN A, V40, P90, DOI DOI 10.1109/TSMCA.2009.2030161; Martin P, 2007, P ICSE WORKSH SEAMS, P9; Neufeld N, 2003, NUCL PHYS B-PROC SUP, V120, P105, DOI 10.1016/S0920-5632(03)01888-7; POIROT PE, 2008, NUCL SCI IEEE T, V55, P284, DOI DOI 10.1109/TNS.2007.913488; Sadjadi SM, 2005, SIGSOFT SOFTW ENG NO, V30, P1; Solomon B, 2010, P 2010 ICSE WORKSH S, P94, DOI 10.1145/1808984.1808995; Stoilov T, 2010, P 11 INT C COMP SYST, P305, DOI 10.1145/1839379.1839433; Trencansky I, 2006, COMP 21 ACM SIGPLAN, P521, DOI 10.1145/1176617.1176626	20	0	0	IOP PUBLISHING LTD	BRISTOL	DIRAC HOUSE, TEMPLE BACK, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND	1742-6588		J PHYS CONF SER			2012	396								052038	10.1088/1742-6596/396/5/052038		10	Physics, Multidisciplinary; Physics, Nuclear; Physics, Particles & Fields	Physics	BDT23	WOS:000314749803029

However, often these algorithms in isolation cannot accurately detect all kinds of attacks and generate lot of false alarms. In this paper, we intend to show that if the power of each of the algorithms are combined and harnessed using an appropriate ensemble method, a significant improvement in detection rate can be achieved. The performance of our meta ensemble classifier was evaluated over several real life intrusion datasets and the benchmark KDD'99 dataset, and the results have been found excellent in comparison to its other competing algorithms.

FEVs must provide their drivers with the highest possible autonomy, as well as with a high degree of reliability and robustness in terms of energy performance. Thus, appropriate innovative ICT solutions must be adopted, in order to assist the driver in dealing with such energy-related issues, and strengthen FEVs' autonomy and reliability. Such an ICT solution tailored for FEVs is the focus of this paper. In detail, this paper presents a novel implementation of energy-efficient routing based on machine learning engines. It identifies and explains appropriate instance and target attributes, related to road segments and vehicles characteristics. Consequently, it proposes a robust machine learning model, capable of predicting the actual energy that is expected to be consumed by the vehicle on the particular road segment. Scalability aspects are, then, discussed and presented Finally, useful conclusions on the performance of the proposed model are reached. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, the sample size calculation procedure for GPS-based surveys is more complicated compared to well-known and widely applied conventional household one/two-day travel surveys. The higher cost of GPS surveys requires scrutiny at the sample size planning stage to ensure cost effectiveness. The essence of sample size calculations problem is of a trade-off between cost/time taking the precision of the survey into account. Different machine learning-based techniques have been developed to infer the transportation mode based upon speed and acceleration calculated from GPS data. However, none of these studies calculate the sample size required for validating these techniques. Calculating the most effective sample size for this inference mainly depends on the variability of these variables which are normally used. To perform this calculation, we develop an understanding of inter-modal (variation between different transportation modes) and intra-modal variability (variation within each transportation mode). The study demonstrates that the motorised modes reflect the highest variability. We use traffic count data to study this variability across different seasonal divisions. The hourly and daily seasonal divisions are proved to be of the highest variability. Extending the survey length also decreases the sample size significantly. This reduction is applied to the calculated sample sizes defining the survey length to be 2 weeks, taking the weekly-seasonality into account. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

So in this paper, we attempt to study the kNN furthermore, we first propose a parallel algorithm for approximate kNN graph construction and then apply the kNN graph to the application of clustering. Experiments show that our MPI/OpenMP mixed mode codes can make the construction of approximate kNN graph faster and make the parallelization and implementation easier. Finally, we compare the results of agglomerative clustering methods by using our parallel algorithm to illustrate the applicability of this method.

One of the main strategies explored in the last decade to deal with this problem is the use of multi-classifier systems. Several of such approaches are inspired by the Random Subspace Method for the construction of decision forests. Furthermore, other studies rely on estimations of the individual classifiers' competence, to enhance the combination in the multi-classifier and improve the accuracy. We propose a competence estimate which is based on local complexity measurements, to perform a weighted average combination of the decision forest. Experimental results show how this idea significantly outperforms the standard non-weighted average combination and also the renowned Classifier Local Accuracy competence estimate, while consuming significantly less time.

Its results can be extended into an overarching theory of how vision, memory and cognition come to be in the living brain. This article documents a first attempt at testing the model's validity, by applying its principles to the construction of an image template-matching framework, which is then used to solve a Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation problem. It is found that the template-matching application thus implemented can consistently locate required visual controls, even when template and match differ by color palette or (to a slighter degree) feature proportion. The article concludes by discussing the significance of these results and directions for further research.

They are a high-priority target group for viral marketing campaigns. On an average, an opinion leader will tell about his or her experience with a product or company to 14 other people. It is important to identify such opinion leaders from data derived from online activity of users. We present an approach to identification of opinion leaders using the K-means clustering algorithm. This approach does not require knowledge of the user's opinions or membership in other forums.

Predicting the Priority of a Reported Bug using Machine Learning Techniques and Cross Project Validation	2012 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS DESIGN AND APPLICATIONS (ISDA)			English	Proceedings Paper	12th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications (ISDA)	NOV 27-29, 2012	Kochi, INDIA	Machine Intelligence Res Labs (MIR Labs), IEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc, Czechoslovakia Chapter, IEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc, Spanish Chapter, IEEE, Cochin Univ Sci & Technol		Bug repositories; Bug priority; Triager; Classifiers; 10-fald Cross Validation; SVM; KNN; Naive Bares; Neural Net		In bug repositories, we receive a large number of bug reports on daily basis. Managing such a large repository is a challenging job. Priority of a bug tells that how important and urgent it is for us to fix. Priority of a bug can be classified into 5 levels from P1 to PS where P1 is the highest and PS is the lowest priority. Correct prioritization of bugs helps in bug fix scheduling/assignment and resource allocation. Failure of this will result in delay of resolving important bugs. This requires a bug prediction system which can predict the priority of a newly reported bug. Cross project validation is also an important concern in empirical software engineering where we train classifier on one project and test it for prediction on other projects. In the available literature, we found very few papers for bug priority prediction and none of them dealt with cross project validation. In this paper, we have evaluated the performance of different machine learning techniques namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Neural Network (NNet) in predicting the priority of the newly coming reports on the basis of different performance measures. We performed cross project validation for 76 cases of live data sets of open office and eclipse projects. The accuracy of different machine learning techniques in predicting the priority of a reported bug within and across project is found above 70% except Naive Bayes technique.

We have earlier utilized such networks, particularly, the gene regulatory network of E. coli, for constructing smart communication structures in bio-inspired Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) having high packet transmission efficiency. In this paper, we present machine learning approaches to relate the graph topology based characteristics of such bio-inspired WSNs to their network-level robustness in terms of average packet transmission efficiency. In particular, we generate a support vector regression model using the graph metric features as input data. The model predicts the percentage of packets received by the highest degree sink node and a theoretical estimate for the overall network robustness.

In this paper, we study the recently proposed Generic-Feature-Selection (GeFS) measure [18]. Since there is no benchmark dataset of botnet malware, we conduct experiments on the dataset that is generated by using public available tools. We utilize the static and dynamic approaches [24], [29], [12] to extract features from the generated dataset and to produce two separate feature sets. We analyze the statistical properties of these feature sets to provide more insights of their nature and quality. Subsequently we determine appropriate instances of the GeFS measure for feature selection. The GeFS measure was compared experimentally with two different methods regarding the feature selection capabilities in botnet malware detection: the genetic-algorithm-CFS and the best-first-CFS algorithms. We use five different classifiers to test the detection rates and false positive rates. The experiments show that we can remove 99.9% of irrelevant and redundant features from the datasets, while keeping or yielding even better classification performances. Moreover, the GeFS measure outperforms the genetic-algorithm-CFS and the best-first-CFS methods by removing much more redundant features.

A zero-range process (ZRP) is a representative traffic-flow model described as a probabilistic cellular automaton. There is a parameter that controls the behavior of the vehicles in the model, and parameter estimation enables us to determine the unobservable behavior from the observable flow data. There are few studies on estimating the parameter, but the properties of models with a known parameter have been well investigated mathematically. In the present paper, we determine the accuracy of parameter estimation and propose an optimization method to collect the data, which corresponds to active learning.

The method is divided into three stages: image processing, feature extraction and image classification. In the first stage we have used two image processing techniques in order to enhance their features. Then, the second stage reduces the dimensionality of the images and finds features using the statistical method of principal component analysis. Finally, in the third stage the images are classified using machine learning algorithms, particularly, the naive Bayes classifier, neural networks, k-nearest neighbors and support vector machines. In our experimental study we classify two types of retinopathy: non-proliferative and proliferative. Preliminary results show that k-nearest neighbors obtained the best result with 68.7% using f-measure as metric, for a data set of 151 images with different resolutions.

A New Approach for Curvature Estimation of Sampled Data	2012 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DEVELOPMENT AND LEARNING AND EPIGENETIC ROBOTICS (ICDL)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Development and Learning and Epigenetic Robotics (ICDL)	NOV 07-09, 2012	San Diego, CA	IEEE				Despite the high dimensionality of data in machine learning applications, such as facial expression and human activity recognition, the data usually lies in a low dimensional manifold. In order to discover the intrinsic characteristic of the manifold, curvature estimation of the manifold can be helpful. This paper presents a new algorithm for curvature estimation of sampled data by utilizing the local tangent plane and normal vector approximation a teach sample point. The proposed algorithm can estimate the curvature by tracking the variations of normal vector around its neighbor points and quantitatively estimate the relative curvature of every data point. Our approach is successful in estimating the curvature of sampled data of known manifolds such as Swiss roll.	[Mavadati, S.

The new project involves a mobile robot that lives in a room and learns about the room and about itself. The robot is initially set up to have a standard set of facilities (vision, IR, limb, wheels, planners, learning modules, some modest NLP, a reasoner, etc.) but it does not know much about its capabilities or how to properly use them. It has a prime directive: to learn. This paper will focus on one of the first major questions of this project: can we use Growing Neural Gas (GNG) to discover the physical structure of an environment and, if so, what are the limits of its use? To answer this question, we have devised an experiment to test whether our robot can distinguish between two identical objects using only GNG. Preliminary results suggest that passing image data along with robotic control signal data is sufficient to autonomously detect the basic physical structure of a room.

In this paper, we develop a machine learning-based approach for estimating characteristics of a source zone related to the distribution of contaminant mass in highly saturated pool regions and more diffuse ganglia based on observations of down-gradient concentration images. After extracting a set of morphological features from training images, Laplacian Eigenmaps is employed to embed these features with the known source zone metric in a low dimensional manifold. A spectral regression scheme is used to embed the test data into the same manifold after which a Bayesian approach is employed to estimate the associated metric as well as a confidence interval. Results based upon simulated data demonstrate the potential effectiveness of the overall approach.

There are several areas warranting improvement in the current protocol for crevasse detection, which employs a human-operated ground penetrating radar (GPR) on a mid-weight tracked vehicle. In this fashion, a GPR scout team must plan an appropriate crevasse-free route by investigating paths across the glacier. This paper presents methods supporting a completely autonomous robotic system employing GPR probing of the glacier surface. We tested and evaluated three machine learning algorithms on post-processed Antarctic GPR data, collected by our robot and a Pisten Bully in 2009 and 2010 at McMurdo Station. We achieved 82% classification rate for a linear SVM, compared to 82% using logistic regression and 80% using a Bayes network for contrast. We also discuss independent versus sequential classification of GPR scans, and suggest improvements to or combinations of the most successful training models. Our experiment demonstrates the promise and reliability of real-time object detection with GPR.

GPR has recently become a powerful tool for achieving robust subsurface target detection, but novel target types, and large numbers of subsurface objects in rural environments significantly complicate accurate discrimination of explosive threats from harmless false alarms. Significant research in feature extraction from GPR data has previously shown the capability for improved performance. Similarly, many techniques from the computer vision literature have made significant strides in recent years in for improvements in object class recognition. This work studies the relationships between and application of feature descriptor techniques from the computer vision community in application to target detection in GPR data.

However, the retrieval of LST is still underdetermined issue because of the fact that the unknowns are always more than the measurements even the atmospheric condition can be acquired completely. Currently, Support Vector Machine (SVM) as an effective machine learning tool has been used widely in the domain of quantitative remote sensing because its optimization and generalization. This paper used SVM to retrieve LST based on only one thermal band in HJ-1B satellite launched by China. The radiance and water vapor content were selected as the independent variables. The validation result indicates that the errors of the SVM-MOD07 are lower than the Qin's-MOD07. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis indicates that when the errors of the water vapor content increase, the errors for the SVM model change insignificantly. In the end the SVM model was applied in Beijing area.

It offers a GIS-like interface for visually selecting the training region samples and a fast and efficient sample description by histogram of oriented gradients and local binary patterns. To learn a discrimination rule in this feature space, our system relies on the online gradient-boost learning algorithm for which we defined a new family of loss functions.

In the same way, numerous biologically or naturally inspired search and optimization algorithms have been proposed in the literature. This paper proposes a novel solution search algorithm called lion's algorithm. The natural inspiration behind the proposed algorithm is lion's social behavior that aids to keep the mammal be strong in the world. The interpretation of such social behavior to algorithmic perspective helps in searching out highly optimal solutions from a huge solution space. The algorithm solves both single variable and multi-variable cost function problems through the generation of binary structured and integer structured lion, respectively. The algorithm is implemented and tested using De-Jong's Type I function and the results are compared against the evolutionary programming. The test results show the algorithm performance under varying sizes of solution spaces. (C) 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

When standard machine learning techniques are applied for cancer classification, they face the small sample size (SSS) problem of gene expression data. The SSS problem is inherited from large dimensionality of the feature space (due to large number of genes) compared to the small number of samples available. In order to overcome the SSS problem, the dimensionality of the feature space is reduced either through feature selection or through feature extraction. For achieving this objective different feature reduction schemes with a set of simple classifiers have been suggested in this paper. Firstly the dimension have been reduced using Principal Component Analysis(PCA), Factor Analysis(FA), Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT) and Discrete Cosine Transform(DCT). Then the reduced dimensions are used to design intelligent classifiers using different Functional Link Artificial Neural Network (FLANN). The simulation results demonstrate that the reduction based Chebyshev classifier perform the best compared to other alternatives. (C) 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Biomedical named entities (NEs) include mentions of proteins, genes, DNA, RNA etc. which, in general, have complex structures and are difficult to recognize. We have developed a large number of features for identifying NEs from biomedical texts. Two robust diverse classification methods like Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used to build a number of models depending upon the various representations of the set of features and/or feature templates. Finally the outputs of these different classifiers are combined using multiobjective weighted voted approach. We hypothesize that the reliability of predictions of each classifier differs among the various output classes. Thus, in an ensemble system, it is necessary to determine the appropriate weight of vote for each output class in each classifier. Here, a multiobjective genetic algorithm is utilized for determining appropriate weights of votes for combining the outputs of classifiers. The developed technique is evaluated with the benchmark dataset of JNLPBA 2004 that yields the overall recall, precision and F-measure values of 74.10%, 77.58% and 75.80%, respectively.

This is coupled by the problem of performing multi-database queries manually. Requirement arises therefore to automate the integration of biological databases that do much more than just retrieve and modify data. Speeding up the discovery of new medications and the introduction of new drugs in the market are some additional expectations out of such automation. Feature fields of different biological databases have different formats. To bind a meta-feature to the different feature formats under the same integration platform matching qualifiers is required for the different features. Integration requires binding formats with different databases concurrently, but the high dimensionality and redundancy of the qualifiers makes such integration impossible. Evolutionary selection algorithms have already been applied to reduce high dimensionality in microarray gene expression patterns. Given the similar qualifier redundancy and high qualifier dimensionality for biological databases such as EMBL, GENBANK and DDBJ, multi objective Genetic Algorithm applied to find qualifier reducts is not a misnomer. In feature binding initially Rough set theory is applied to find the initial population of qualifier reduct. Multi Objective Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) is run over this population to obtain the exact qualifier reduct. A feature set is categorized with the help of this qualifier reduct. Having done that, the problem of retrieving or manipulating data from a decentralized biological database is addressed in the Search & Retrieve algorithm, where stochastic and machine learning techniques have been used to find high probable warehouses where the data is indexed.

These systems are capable of inferring intelligence from acquired raw sensed data, through the use of data mining and machine learning techniques. However, due to their recent advent, associated issues remain to be solved in a systematized way. Various areas can benefit from these initiatives, with public health systems having a major application gain. There has been interest in the use of social networks as a mean of epidemic prediction. Still, the integration between large-scale sensor networks and these initiatives, required to achieve seamless epidemic detection and prediction, is yet to be achieved. In this context, it is essential to review systems applied to epidemic prediction. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

As a consequence, more and more computer systems have been pushed into dealing with the contradiction detection task. Contradiction Detection (CD) is not a simple task, thus, it is subject to many discussions and approaches in different areas of human knowledge, such as Philosophy, Ethics, Linguistics, Computer Science, etc. and, as such, approached under different perspectives and goals. In this paper we focus on CD in a never-ending learning system called NELL (Never-ending Language Learner). Considering that NELL is intended to be self-supervised, as well as, self-reflective, it takes advantage of every new acquired knowledge (and stored its Knowledge Base - KB) to learn better and better each day. In this sense, NELL uses its own knowledge to achieve better performance in every new learning task. Therefore, the presence of contradictions in the KB of a never-ending learning system, like NELL, can result in the exponential propagation of incorrect knowledge that can lead to concept-drift. Following along these lines, in this work we proposed an approach to detect and eliminate contradictions from NELL's KB. The results obtained from the performed experiments shows that the proposed approach can detect contradictions, as well as, eliminating them by deletion or by extending the KB hierarchy structure.

In fact, in last years the study of drug resistance prediction for HIV mutations has become an open problem for researchers. Several machine learning techniques have been proposed for modelling this sequence classification problem, but most of them are difficult to interpret. This paper presents a modelling of the protease protein as a dynamic system through Fuzzy Cognitive Maps, using the amino acid contact energies for the sequence description. In addition, a Particle Swarm Optimization based learning scheme called PSO-RSVN is used to estimate the causal weight matrix that characterize these structures. Finally, a study with statistical techniques for knowledge discovery is conducted, for determining patterns in the causal influences of each sequence position on the resistance to five well-known inhibitor drugs.

The evaluation of classifiers is often carried out by empirical comparison with classifiers generated by different learning algorithms, allowing the identification of the best algorithm for the problem at hand. Nevertheless, previously to this evaluation, it is important to state if the classifiers have truly learned the domain class concepts, which can be done by comparing the classifiers' predictive measures with the ones from the baseline classifiers. A baseline classifier is the one constructed by a naive learning algorithm which only uses the class distribution of the dataset. However, finding naive classifiers in multi-label learning is not as straightforward as in single-label learning. This work proposes a simple way to find baseline multi-label classifiers. Three specific and one general naive multi-label classifiers are proposed to estimate the baseline values for multi-label predictive evaluation measures. Experimental results show the suitability of our proposal in revealing the learning power of multi-label learning algorithms.	[Metz, Jean; de Abreu, Luis F.

Several diseases often overlap with others in terms of signs and symptoms, thus making this diagnosis a difficult, error-prone process. Machine Learning algorithms possess some useful qualities to tackle this kind of pattern recognition problems. In this paper, a neural-network-based approach to the differential diagnosis of Dengue Fever, Leptospirosis and Malaria, using the Adaptive Resonance Theory Map (ARTMAP) family is discussed. The use of an Artificial Immune System (CLONALG) led to the identification of a subset of symptoms that enhanced the performance of the classifiers considered. Training, validation and testing phases were conducted using a dataset consisting of medical charts from patients treated in the last 10 years at Napoleon Franco Pareja Children Hospital in Cartagena, Colombia. Results obtained on the test set are promising, and support the feasibility of this approach.

The idea of continuously learning from the web brings concerns about reliability and accuracy, mainly when the learning process uses its own knowledge to improve its learning capabilities. Considering that the knowledge base keeps growing forever, such a system requires self-supervision as well as self-reflection. The increased use of the Internet, that allowed NELL creation, also brought a new source of information on-line. The social media becomes more popular everyday and the AI community can now develop research to take advantage of these information, aiming to turn it into knowledge. This work is following this lead and proposes a new machine learning approach, called Conversing Learning, to use collective knowledge from web community users to provide self-supervision and self-reflection to intelligent machines, thus, they can improve their learning task. The Conversing Learning approach explores concepts from Active Learning and Question Answering to achieve the goal of showing what can be done towards autonomous Human Computer Interaction to automatically improve machine learning tasks.

Spoken digit recognition is generally a challenging task since the signals last for short period of time and often some digits are acoustically very similar to each other. The objective of this paper is to investigate the use of machine learning algorithms for digit recognition. We focus on the recognition of digits spoken in Portuguese. However, we note that our techniques are applicable to any language. We believe that the most important task for successfully recognizing spoken digits is the attribute extraction. Audio data is composed by a huge amount of very weak features, and most machine learning algorithms will not be able to build accurate classifiers. We show that Line Spectral Frequencies (LSF) provides a set of highly predictive coefficients for digit recognition. The results are superior than those obtained with state-of-the-art methods using Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC) for digit recognition. In particular, we show that the choice of the right attribute extraction method is more important than the specific classification paradigm, and that the right combination of classifier and attributes can provide almost perfect accuracy.

A tri-axial accelerometer sensor and a Wi-Fi module embeded in the phone are employed to provide needed information. Data from the accelerometer is evaluated with a decision tree model to determine a fall. If a fall is suspected, a notification is raised to require the user's response. If the user is injured hardly and cannot respond in time, the system immediately begin to position the occurence of the fall event by detected surrounding Wi-Fi signals, then automatically send a alarm message to his pre-specified guardian with a message via SMS(Short Message System). Consequently, the victim of fall can be monitored and cared in real time. Tested on a real-world data set, the FallAlarm system can achieve an acceptable accuracy for practical application.

In a mobile wireless sensor network it is a challenge for applications and protocols to deal with connectivity problems, as links might get up and down frequently. In these scenarios, having knowledge of the node remaining connectivity time could both improve the performance of the protocols (e. g. handoff mechanisms) and save possible scarce nodes resources (CPU, bandwidth, and energy) by preventing unfruitful transmissions. The current paper provides a solution called Genetic Machine Learning Algorithm (GMLA) to forecast the remainder connectivity time in mobile environments. It consists in combining Classifier Systems with a Markov chain model of the RF link quality. The main advantage of using an evolutionary approach is that the Markov model parameters can be discovered on-the-fly, making it possible to cope with unknown environments and mobility patterns. Simulation results show that the proposal is a very suitable solution, as it overcomes the performance obtained by similar approaches.

Inference of the protein interactions of M. tuberculosis will provide cues to understand the biological processes in this pathogen. In this paper, we constructed an integrated M. tuberculosis H37Rv protein interaction network by machine learning and ortholog-based methods. Firstly, we developed a support vector machine (SVM) method to infer the protein interactions by gene sequence information. We tested our predictors in Escherichia coli and mapped the genetic codon features underlying protein interactions to M. tuberculosis. Moreover, the documented interactions of other 14 species were mapped to the proteome of M. tuberculosis by the interolog method. The ensemble protein interactions were then validated by various functional linkages i.e., gene coexpression, evolutionary relationship and functional similarity, extracted from heterogeneous data sources.

The authors present Elementary, a prototype KBC system that is able to combine diverse resources and different KBC techniques via machine learning and statistical inference to construct knowledge bases. Using Elementary, they have implemented a solution to the TAC-KBP challenge with quality comparable to the state of the art, as well as an end-to-end online demonstration that automatically and continuously enriches Wikipedia with structured data by reading millions of webpages on a daily basis. The authors describe several challenges and their solutions in designing, implementing, and deploying Elementary. In particular, the authors first describe the conceptual framework and architecture of Elementary to integrate different data resources and KBC techniques in a principled manner. They then discuss how they address scalability challenges to enable Web-scale deployment. The authors empirically show that this decomposition-based inference approach achieves higher performance than prior inference approaches. To validate the effectiveness of Elementary's approach to KBC, they experimentally show that its ability to incorporate diverse signals has positive impacts on KBC quality.

The tracking algorithm uses feature extraction and machine learning to discriminate between a desired target ship and decoys within the seeker's field of view. The algorithm is developed within a high fidelity simulation architecture, used to simulate engagements of infrared missiles against ships, aircraft and land vehicles. The proposed seeker tracking algorithm will be evaluated in a naval engagement scenario, against a ship deploying countermeasures. The tracking algorithm performs the tasks of object detection, feature extraction and target selection. Object detection is achieved via thresholding the image of the seeker's field of view, and thereafter, shape and intensity based features are calculated for each resulting object. These features are then used as inputs to a neural network, which performs the task of target selection, to determine the seeker's aim-point. Object features such as peak and average intensity, intensity moments, eccentricity, roundness, minimum, maximum and average radial perimeter distances are considered, to determine their discriminatory power. A training set of images of different ships and decoys, generated by the front end of a seeker model within the simulation architecture, is used to obtain a comprehensive collection of these features. An analysis is performed to determine which of the features are the most discriminatory and these are then used as inputs to the neural network. The neural network is trained on these features to recognise the difference between ships and decoys. Examples of the performance of the tracking algorithm will also be shown.

Automatic localization of intervertebral discs from lumbar MRI is the first step towards computer-aided diagnosis of lower back ailments. Till date, most of the research has been useful in determining a point within each lumbar disc, hence we go one step further and propose a localization method which outputs a tight bounding box for each disc. We use HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) features along with SVM (Support Vector Machine) as classifier and successfully combine these machine learning techniques with heuristics to achieve 99% disc localization accuracy on 53 clinical cases (318 lumbar discs). We also devise our own metrics to evaluate the accuracy and tightness of our disc bounding box and compare our results with previous research.

Despite tremendous previous research, coronary extraction remains difficult. Two such difficulties are extraction of both normal and abnormal vessels and reconstruction of exact tree structures based on anatomical knowledge. To solve the first difficulty, we propose a method to learn a classifier of a tubular 3D object with a dimension reduction approach using Hessian analysis. This enables detection of vessel candidate points despite variations in their appearances. Regarding the second difficulty, we propose an approach to apply the MRF framework for vascular structure segmentation. A novelty of the approach is incorporating constraints to avoid topological inconsistency. Correspondences between the candidate points and model points are found using a graph matching process during which, tree structures as per the shape model are simultaneously reconstructed. Experimental results show robustness of the method. The proposed method can improve clinical workflow.

In clinical routine, EF is often computed from manually or automatically segmenting the Left Ventricle (LV) in End-dyastole and End-systole frames, which is prohibitively time consuming and needs user interactions. In this paper, we propose a method to minimize user effort and estimate the EF directly from image statistics via machine-learning techniques, without the need for comprehensive segmentations of all the MRI images in a subject dataset. From a user-provided segmentation of a single image, we build a statistic based on the Bhattacharyya coefficient of similarity between image distributions for each of the images in a subject dataset (200 images). We demonstrate that these statistical features are non-linearly related to the LV cavity areas and therefore can be used to estimate the EF. We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the features and areas. Then, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was used to predict the LV cavity areas from the dimension-reduced features. The EF is finally estimated from the obtained areas.

For children older than a year, CoA is increasingly treated by aortic stenting instead of surgical repair. In pediatric cardiology, CMR is accepted as the standard non-invasive imaging modality to assess the aortic arch in it's entire spatial context [1]. Interpreting such 3D datasets are required to assess the underlying anatomy during both diagnosis and therapy planning phases. However this process is time consuming and varies with operator skills. Within this study we propose - for the first time in our knowledge - a method of automatic segmentation of the lumen of thoracic aorta and main branches. The personalized model of the aorta and the supra-aortic arteries, automatically estimated from 3D CMR data, will provide better understanding of the complexity of pathology and assist the cardiologist to choose the best treatment and timing of repair. A hierarchical framework based on robust machine-learning algorithms is proposed to estimate the personalized model parameters. Experiments throughout 212 3D CMR volumes demonstrate model estimation error of 3.24 mm and average computation time of 8 sec. combined with clinical evaluation on 32 patients.

As there is no direct view and access to the affected anatomy advanced imaging techniques such as 3D rotational angiography (C-arm CT) and real-time fluoroscopy are used for intra-operative guidance. However, intra-operative modalities have limited image quality of the soft tissue and a reliable assessment of the cardiac anatomy can only be made by injecting contrast agent, which is harmful to the patient and requires complex acquisition pro-tocols. We propose a novel method to align pre-operative and intra-operative data by using surrogate anatomical structures which are visible in both modalities without adding contrast agent. The trachea bifurcation model is used as a surrogate structure and the model parameters are estimated using robust machine learning algorithms. High quality patient specific models can be extracted from the pre-operative CT and mapped to the intra-operative 3D C-arm CT for guidance. In addition we learn a weighted mapping function for the trachea bifurcation model extracted from the pre-operative and intra-operative images which minimizes the mapping error in respect to the anatomy of interest. Experiments performed on 28 patient pairs of CT and contrasted 3D C-arm CT data sets assure an accuracy of the mapped aortic valve model of 9.08 +/- 7.31deg and 7.57 +/- 3.22mm.

DIRBOOST: AN ALGORITHM FOR BOOSTING DEFORMABLE IMAGE REGISTRATION	2012 9TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON BIOMEDICAL IMAGING (ISBI)			English	Proceedings Paper	9th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) - From Nano to Macro	MAY 02-05, 2012	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE, IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS), IEEE Signal Proc Soc		Deformable image registration; Boosting; Ensemble Learning; Pattern recognition		We introduce a novel boosting algorithm to boost -i.e. improve on - existing methods for deformable image registration. The proposed DIRBoost algorithm is inspired by the theory on hypothesis boosting, well-known in the field of machine learning. DIRBoost involves a classifier for landmark-based Registration Error Detection (RED). Based on these RED predictions a Voronoi tessellation is generated to obtain a dense estimate of local image registration quality. All areas predicted as erroneous registration are subjected to boosting, i.e. undergo iterative registrations by employing boosting masks on both the fixed and moving image. We evaluated the DIRBoost algorithm on five CT pulmonary breathhold inspiration and expiration scan pairs, employing the NiftyReg registration algorithm. DIRBoost could boost about 50% of the wrongly registered areas which in turn also improved the average landmark registration error by 24%.	[Muenzing, Sascha E. A.; Pluim, Josien P.

Thrombus formation results from adhesion of blood platelets to a site of injury, followed by their progressive aggregation and occasional embolization. To observe this in vitro, blood is perfused over a surface of collagen fibres, during video microscopy. This paper proposes three complementary gradient-based features which, if included in a regularized machine learning framework, yield the accurate segmentation of thrombi during such acquisitions. A novel tracking method of thrombi as deformable growing objects under split and merge conditions is also introduced.

However, the assumed possibility of modeling their underlying challenge-response behavior causes uncertainty about their actual applicability. In this work, we apply well-known machine learning techniques on challenge-response pairs (CRPs) from 64-stage Arbiter PUFs realized in 65nm CMOS, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of such modeling attacks on a modern silicon implementation. We show that a 90%-accurate model can be built from a training set of merely 500 CRPs, and that 5000 CRPs are sufficient to perfectly model the PUFs. To study the implications of these attacks, there is need for a new methodology to assess the security of PUFs suffering from modeling. We propose such a methodology and apply it to our machine learning results, yielding strict bounds on the usability of Arbiter PUFs. We conclude that plain 64-stage Arbiter PUFs are not secure for challenge-response authentication, and the number of extractable secret key bits is limited to at most 600.

In this study we used a model based on deep architectures to provide better representations of Input. In order to increase the capacity of recurrent Neural Network, we present a model to share common features across data. Also by using this method the extracted components will be invariant to speaker variations. We compared the performance of this method with our previous research. The results show that the proposed model is more useful in removing noise and unwanted variability. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

NMF problems are usually solved with an alternating minimization of a given cost function, which leads to non-convex optimization. For this approach, an initialization for the factors to be estimated plays an essential role, not only for a fast convergence rate but also for selection of the desired local minima. If the observations are modeled by the exact factorization model (consistent data), NMF can be easily obtained by finding vertices of the convex polytope determined by the observed data projected on the probability simplex. For an inconsistent case, this model can be relaxed by approximating mean localizations of the vertices. In this paper, we discuss these issues and propose the initialization algorithm based on the analysis of a geometrical structure of the observed data. This approach is demonstrated to be robust, even for moderately noisy data.

On the basis of limitations for every oblique decision rules parameters the grid of parameters values is created and then for every node of this grid the oblique condition is generated and its quality is calculated. The best oblique conditions build the oblique decision rule. Conditions are added as long as there are non-covered objects and the limitation of the length of the rule is not exceeded. All rules are generated with the idea of sequential covering.

Our motivation for this result stems from the fact that the reduced-rank estimation by the stochastic MV-PURE estimator, while avoiding the problem of regularization parameter selection appearing in a common regularization technique used in inverse problems and machine learning, presents computational challenge due to nonconvexity induced by the rank constraint. To combat this problem, we propose a recursive scheme for computation of the general form of the stochastic MV-PURE estimator which does not require any matrix inversion and utilize the inherently parallel hybrid steepest descent method. We verify efficiency of the proposed scheme in numerical simulations.

Deriving accurate and meaningful profiles of traffic generated by packet services can greatly improve dimensioning of the infrastructure for packet mobile networks. Traffic profiles are derived by clustering of daily aggregates of the traffic volume. In this work we propose a new definition of distance between the clustered vectors of daily aggregated traffic. This enhancement allows to derive clusters with desired characteristics in terms of both similar shape of the daily traffic profile and similar busy hour characteristics of each profile. The proposed method is used to obtain traffic profiles from several mobile networks in Europe and Asia. We discuss the differences in characteristics of profiles obtained as a function describing BTS in the context of load shape and its busy hour.

These ants have a simple but efficient prey search strategy: when they capture their prey, they return straight to their nest, drop off the prey and systematically return back to their original position. This behavior has already been applied to optimization, as the API meta-heuristic. API is a shortage of api-calis. Here, we combine API with the ability of ants to sort and cluster. We provide a comparison against Ant clustering Algorithm and K-Means using Machine Learning repository datasets. API introduces new concepts to ant-based models and gives us promising results.

It merges random probing, new particle swarm optimization and local search algorithms. The proposed algorithm was implemented according to a new proposal of modular architecture. It allows for flexible mixing different techniques of the optimization in a single optimization. The architecture allows to macro-manage the search process by modifiable set of rules. Thus, a selection of suitable tools for different phases of the optimization depending on current requirements is possible. As a consequence, the modular algorithm achieves good performance acknowledged in performed experiments. The proposed architecture can help in application of machine learning methods for the selection of efficient sequence of tools during the optimization.

Although this problem can be mitigated by manually tracing architectural decisions into the code, the cost and effort required to do this can be prohibitively expensive. In this paper we therefore present a novel approach for automating the construction of traceability links for architectural tactics. Our approach utilizes machine learning methods and lightweight structural analysis to detect tactic-related classes. The detected tactic-related classes are then mapped to a Tactic Traceability Information Model. We train our trace algorithm using code extracted from fifteen performance-centric and safety-critical open source software systems and then evaluate it against the Apache Hadoop framework. Our results show that automatically generated traceability links can support software maintenance activities while helping to preserve architectural qualities.

One potential remedy to this problem is combinatorial interaction testing (CIT), in which typically the developer selects a strength t and then computes a covering array containing all t-way configuration option combinations. However, in a prior study we showed that several programs have important high-strength interactions (combinations of a subset of configuration options) that CIT is highly unlikely to generate in practice. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called interaction tree discovery (iTree) that aims to identify sets of configurations to test that are smaller than those generated by CIT, while also including important high-strength interactions missed by practical applications of CIT. On each iteration of iTree, we first use low-strength CIT to test the program under a set of configurations, and then apply machine learning techniques to discover new interactions that are potentially responsible for any new coverage seen. By repeating this process, iTree builds up a set of configurations likely to contain key high-strength interactions. We evaluated iTree by comparing the coverage it achieves versus covering arrays and randomly generated configuration sets. Our results strongly suggest that iTree can identify high-coverage sets of configurations more effectively than traditional CIT or random sampling.

We present an approach to detect the current activity of software developers and if they are facing a problem. By observing developer actions like changing code or searching the web, we detect whether developers are locating the cause of a problem, searching for a solution, or applying a solution. We model development work as recurring problem solution cycle, detect developer's actions by instrumenting the IDE, translate developer actions to observations using ontologies, and infer developer activities by using Hidden Markov Models. In a preliminary evaluation, our approach was able to correctly detect 72% of all activities. However, a broader more reliable evaluation is still needed.

This issue is due to the inherent problems of natural language such as ambiguity, impreciseness and incompleteness. In order to overcome these shortcomings, experts derive analysis models such as requirements models. However, these models are difficult and costly to create manually. Furthermore, the level of abstraction of the models is too low, thus hindering the automated transformation process. We propose a novel approach which uses high abstraction requirements models in the form of Object System Models (OSMs) as targets for the transformation of natural language specifications in conjunction with appropriate text mining and machine learning techniques. OSMs allow the interpretation of the textual specification based on a small set of facts and provide structural and behavioral information. This approach will allow both (1) the enhancement of minimal specifications, and in the case of comprehensive specifications (2) the determination of the most suitable structure of reusable requirements.

In this work, we examine one prominent example of this problem: amputee switching between the multiple functions of a powered artificial limb. We propose a dynamic switching approach that learns during ongoing interaction to anticipate user behaviour, thereby presenting the most effective control option for a given context or task. Switching predictions are learned in real time using temporal difference methods and reinforcement learning, and demonstrated within the context of a robotic arm and a multi-function myoelectric controller. We find that a learned, dynamic switching order is able to out-perform the best fixed (non-adaptive) switching regime on a standard prosthetic proficiency task, increasing the number of optimal switching suggestions by 23%, and decreasing the expected transition time between degrees of freedom by more than 14%. These preliminary results indicate that real-time machine learning, specifically online prediction and anticipation, may be an important tool for developing more robust and intuitive controllers for assistive biomedical robots. We expect these techniques will transfer well to near-term use by patients. Future work will describe clinical testing of this approach with a population of amputee patients.

But OC methods are generally too expensive to be applied on-line and in real-time as would be required to perform everyday movements. An alternative method consists in obtaining a pre-computed feedback policy that performs optimally while being executed reactively. One way to get such a pre-computed policy consists in tuning a parametrized reactive controller so that it converges to optimal behavior. In this paper, we demonstrate a method to obtain such a reactive controller that (i) adapts the time of movement based on a compromise between the amount of reward and the effort required to get it, (ii) provides an efficient trajectory from any point to any point in the workspace, (iii) learns from demonstrations of optimal trajectories, (iv) is improving its performance over accumulated experience.

We hereby advance the state of the art by describing a multi-subject experiment in which sEMG is successfully used to predict simultaneous forces applied by a human subject at the fingertips, that is, when six voluntary muscle contractions (VMCs) are elicited (flexion of the little, ring, middle and index fingers, thumb rotation and thumb adduction). Using a multi-sensor setup sEMG activity of the forearm of a human subject and the forces exerted at the fingertips are measured; a Support Vector Machine is then used to associate sEMG signals and forces. Our results clearly show that sEMG can be used to predict the required forces with an error as small as 1.5% of the sensor range. Targeted positioning of the electrodes is not required. The prediction is uniformly accurate across all VMCs and all 12 subjects considered, and it is robust against subsampling. This result goes in the direction of enabling natural force / impedance control of a highly dexterous prosthetic hand over a continuous, infinite manifold of force configurations, rather than using posture classification like in the traditional approach.

Systems reliant on these muscle-generated electrical signals require some form of machine learning algorithm for recognition of specific patterns of muscle activity. Those systems vary in terms of the signal detection methods, the feature selection and the classification algorithm used, however, in all those cases, the use of multiple sensors is a constant requirement. In this paper, we present a power wheelchair control system that relies on a single sEMG sensor and a new technique for signature recognition called Guided Under-determined Source Signal Separation (GUSSS). Compared to other approaches in the literature, the proposed technique achieves comparable results even when using a simple distance classifier and a very small number of features.

It is a challenge for many streaming classification algorithms to learn recurring concepts in a data stream environment with unlabeled data, and this challenge has received little attention from the research community. Motivated by this challenge, this article focuses on the problem of recurring contexts in streaming environments with limited labeled data. We propose a semi-supervised classification algorithm for data streams with REcurring concept Drifts and Limited LA-beled data, called REDLLA, in which a decision tree is adopted as the classification model. When growing a tree, a clustering algorithm based on k-means is installed to produce concept clusters and unlabeled data are labeled in the method of majority-class at leaves. In view of deviations between history and new concept clusters, potential concept drifts are distinguished and recurring concepts are maintained. Extensive studies on both synthetic and real-world data confirm the advantages of our REDLLA algorithm over three state-of-the-art online classification algorithms of CVFDT, DWCDS, and CDRDT and several known online semi-supervised algorithms, even in the case with more than 90% unlabeled data.

However, limited by the battery capacity, the energy efficiency of context-sensing is the bottleneck for the success of context-aware applications. Though several previous studies for energy-efficient context-sensing have been reported, none of them can be applied to multiple types of high-energy-consuming sensors. Moreover, applying machine learning technologies to energy-efficient context-sensing is underexplored too. In this article, we propose to leverage machine learning technologies for improving the energy efficiency of multiple high-energy-consuming context sensors by trading off the sensing accuracy. To be specific, we try to infer the status of high-energy-consuming sensors according to the outputs of software-based sensors and the physical sensors that are necessary to work all the time for supporting the basic functions of mobile devices. If the inference indicates the high-energy-consuming sensor is in a stable status, we avoid the unnecessary invocation and instead use the latest invoked value as the estimation. The experimental results on real datasets show that the energy efficiency of GPS sensing and audio-level sensing are significantly improved by the proposed approach while the sensing accuracy is over 90%.

One such feature of astrobiological relevance is the presence of surface sulfur deposits. These deposits have been observed to be associated with microbial activity at the Borup Fiord glacial springs in Canada, a location that may provide an analogue to other icy environments such as Europa. This article evaluates automated classifiers for detecting sulfur in remote sensing observations by the hyperion spectrometer on the EO-1 spacecraft. We determined that a data-driven machine learning solution was needed because the sulfur could not be detected by simply matching observations to sulfur lab spectra. We also evaluated several methods (manual and automated) for identifying the most relevant attributes (spectral wavelengths) needed for successful sulfur detection. Our findings include (1) the Borup Fiord sulfur deposits were best modeled as containing two sub-populations: sulfur on ice and sulfur on rock; (2) as expected, classifiers using Gaussian kernels outperformed those based on linear kernels, and should be adopted when onboard computational constraints permit; and (3) Recursive Feature Elimination selected sensible and effective features for use in the computationally constrained environment onboard EO-1. This study helped guide the selection of algorithm parameters and configuration for the classification system currently operational on EO-1. Finally, we discuss implications for a similar onboard classification system for a future Europa orbiter.

Most of the proposed solutions are centered around supervised, machine learning approaches and review-oriented dalasets. In this article, we focus on the more common informal textual communication on the Web, such as online discussions, tweets and social network comments and propose an intuitive, less domain-specific, unsupervised, lexicon-based approach that estimates the level of emotional intensity contained in text in order to make a prediction. Our approach can be applied to, and is tested in, two different but complementary contexts: subjectivity detection and polarity classification. Extensive experiments were carried on three real-world datasets, extracted from online social Web sites and annotated by human evaluators, against state-of-the-art supervised approaches. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm, even though unsupervised, outperforms machine learning solutions in the majority of cases, overall presenting a very robust and reliable solution for sentiment analysis of informal communication on the Web.

Under this framework, we investigated possible equivalence relations, data dependencies, rule generation, rule stability, question-answering systems, as well as missing and interval values as special cases of non-deterministic values. In this paper, we briefly survey RNIA, and report the state of its underlying software implementation. We also discuss to what extent RNIA can be seen as an example of a new emerging paradigm in machine learning.

Solving Avatar Captchas Automatically	ADVANCED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS	Communications in Computer and Information Science		English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Advanced Machine Learning Technologies and Applications (AMLTA 2012)	DEC 08-10, 2012	Cairo, EGYPT		Ain Sham Univ			Captchas are challenge-response tests used in many online systems to prevent attacks by automated bots. Avatar Captchas are a recently-proposed variant in which users are asked to classify between human faces and computer-generated avatar faces, and have been shown to be secure if bots employ random guessing. We test a variety of modern object recognition and machine learning approaches on the problem of avatar versus human face classification. Our results show that using these techniques, a bot can successfully solve Avatar Captchas as often as humans can. These experiments suggest that this high performance is caused more by biases in the facial datasets used by Avatar Captchas and not by a fundamental flaw in the concept itself, but nevertheless our results highlight the difficulty in creating Captcha tasks that are immune to automatic solution.

Several theoretical models have been proposed for solving this problem, such as probability theory, fuzzy sets, rough sets, cloud model, et al. Unfortunately, human deals with uncertain concepts based on words (concept intension), while computer based on sample set (concept extension). Many data mining and machine learning methods have been developed for extracting knowledge from data sets in recent years. These methods are unidirectional cognitive computing models from extension to intension. In this paper, a bidirectional cognitive computing model, cloud model, will be introduced. In the cloud model, forward cloud generator and backward cloud generator are designed for the bidirectional transformations between concept's intension and extension. Some experiment results will be discussed to show the validity and efficiency of cloud model for bidirectional cognitive computing.

Two relatively modern and robust supervised machine learning algorithms i.e. random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) were also compared. Image segmentation was performed, and ten broad land cover classes were identified. Subsequently, we assessed the performance of an object-based image classification and the selected machine learning algorithms in mapping the land cover classes. The validation of the thematic land cover maps derived from RF and SVM were assessed using an independent test dataset generated from field work data and aerial photography interpretation. Results showed that both the machine learning classifiers in combination with the object-based approach are useful in mapping land cover in heterogeneous coastal areas. However, SVM achieved the best overall accuracy (93.79%) and kappa statistic (0.93) while RF produced an overall accuracy of 86.94% and kappa value of 0.85. Overall, the study underlined the utility of combining an object-based image classification with machine learning classifiers for mapping land-cover in heterogeneous coastal areas - a previously challenging task with broad band satellite sensors and traditional pixel-based image classification approaches.

Golf courses, ornamental, 'Atlantic' gardens and swimming pools are the most striking artefacts of this transformation, threatening the local water supply systems and exacerbating water scarcity. In the face of climate change, urban landscape irrigation is becoming increasingly important from a resource management point of view. This paper adopts urban remote sensing towards a targeted mapping approach using machine learning techniques and high-resolution satellite imagery (WorldView-2) to generate GIS-ready information for urban water consumption studies. Swimming pools, vegetation and - as a subgroup of vegetation - turf grass are extracted as important determinants of water consumption. For image analysis, the complex nature of urban environments suggests spatial-spectral classification, i.e. the complementary use of the spectral signature and spatial descriptors. Multiscale image segmentation provides means to extract the spatial descriptors - namely object feature layers - which can be concatenated at pixel level to the spectral signature. This study assesses the value of object features using different machine learning techniques and amounts of labeled information for learning. The results indicate the benefit of the spatial-spectral approach if combined with appropriate classifiers like tree-based ensembles or support vector machines, which can handle high dimensionality.

Motivated with the presence of this information, in a number of open source projects, an approach to recommend expert developers to assist with a software change request (e. g., a bug fixes or feature) is presented. It employs a combination of an information retrieval technique and processing of the source code authorship information. The relevant source code files to the textual description of a change request are first located. The authors listed in the header comments in these files are then analyzed to arrive at a ranked list of the most suitable developers. The approach fundamentally differs from its previously reported counterparts, as it does not require software repository mining. Neither does it require training from past bugs/issues, which is often done with sophisticated techniques such as machine learning, nor mining of source code repositories, i.e., commits. An empirical study to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach on three open source systems, ArgoUML, JEdit, and MuCommander, is reported. Our approach is compared with two representative approaches: 1) using machine learning on past bug reports, and 2) based on commit logs. The presented approach is found to provide recommendation accuracies that are equivalent or better than the two compared approaches. These findings are encouraging, as it opens up a promising and orthogonal possibility of recommending developers without the need of any historical change information.

Although the unobtrusive or unsupervised nature of such technologies often results in less accurate measures than their invasive or supervised counterparts, this disadvantage is typically outweighed by the ability to monitor larger populations than ever before. The expected consequential benefit will be an improvement in healthcare provision and health outcomes for all. The process of discovering indicators of health in unsupervised or unobtrusive biosignal recordings, or automatically ensuring the validity and quality of such signals, is best realized when following a proven systematic methodology. This paper provides a brief tutorial review of supervised learning, which is a sub-discipline of machine learning, and discusses its application in the development of algorithms to interpret biosignals acquired in unsupervised or semi-supervised environments, with the aim of estimating well-being. Some specific examples in the disparate application areas of telehealth electrocardiogram recording and calculating postoperative systemic vascular resistance are discussed in the context of this systematic approach for information discovery.

In this paper, we aimed at developing an effective machine learning scheme which leverages structural magnetic resonance imaging features in order to identify and discriminate individuals affected by mild AD on a single subject basis. Selected features included one-and two-way combinations of subcortical and cortical volumes as well as cortical thickness and curvature of numerous brain regions which are known to be vulnerable to AD. Additionally, several feature combinations were fed into support vector machines (SVMs) as well as Naive Bayes classifiers in order to compare scheme accuracy. The most efficient combination of features and classification scheme, which employed both subcortical and cortical volumes feature vectors and a SVM classifier, was able to distinguish mild AD patients from healthy controls with 86% accuracy (82% sensitivity and 90% specificity). While this investigation is of preliminary nature, and further efforts are currently underway towards automated feature selection, best classifier determination and parameter optimization, our results appear very promising in terms of automated high-accuracy discrimination of disease stages which cannot easily be distinguished though routine clinical investigation.

The proposed method is an extension of the well-established spectral clustering algorithm to integrate the information from several data views in the partition solution. The algorithm, therefore, resolves a joint cluster structure which could be present in all views, which enables researchers to better resolve data structures in data fusion problems The application of this novel clustering approach covers an extended number of machine learning unsupervised clustering problems including biomedical analysis or machine vision.

Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) represent an emerging technology that can bypass damaged nerves to restore basic motor function and provide more effective rehabilitation. A wireless BCI system was implemented to realize these goals using electroencephalographic brain signals, machine learning techniques, and a custom designed orthosis. The IpsiHand Bravo BCI system is designed to reach a large demographic by using non-traditional brain signals and improving on past BCI system pitfalls.

Early prediction of high-risk of CAC based on progression rate enables people to prevent CAD from developing into severe symptoms and diseases. In this study, we developed various classifiers to identify patients in high risk of CAC using statistical and machine learning methods, and compared them with performance accuracy. For statistical approaches, linear regression based classifier and logistic regression model were developed. For machine learning approaches, we suggested three kinds of ensemble-based classifiers (best, top-k, and voting method) to deal with imbalanced distribution of our data set. Ensemble voting method outperformed all other methods including regression methods as AUC was 0.781.

We would like to not only know if a motion is being performed correctly, but also in what way the motion is incorrect so that we may provide feedback to the user. This paper describes methods for assessing human motion quality using body-worn tri-axial accelerometers and gyroscopes. We use multi-label classifiers to detect subtle errors in exercise performances of eight individuals with knee osteoarthritis, a degenerative disease of the cartilage. We present results obtained using various machine learning methods with decision tree base classifiers. The classifier can detect classes in multi-label data with 75% sensitivity, 90% specificity and 80% accuracy. The methods presented here form the basis for an at-home rehabilitation device that will recognize errors in patient exercise performance, provide appropriate feedback on the performance, and motivate the patient to continue the prescribed regimen.

Our primary goal is to develop a monitoring system capable of being used outside of controlled laboratory settings. Such a system would enable us to track medication cycles at home and provide valuable clinical feedback. Most of the relevant prior works involve supervised learning frameworks (e. g., Support Vector Machines). However, in-home monitoring provides only coarse ground truth information about symptom occurrences, making it very hard to adapt and train supervised learning classifiers for symptom detection. We address this challenge by formulating symptom detection under incomplete ground truth information as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. MIL is a weakly supervised learning framework that does not require exact instances of symptom occurrences for training; rather, it learns from approximate time intervals within which a symptom might or might not have occurred on a given day. Once trained, the MIL detector was able to spot symptom-prone time windows on other days and approximately localize the symptom instances. We monitored two Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, each for four days with a set of five triaxial accelerometers and utilized a MIL algorithm based on axis parallel rectangle (APR) fitting in the feature space. We were able to detect subject specific symptoms (e. g. dyskinesia) that conformed with a daily log maintained by the patients.

The importance of analyzing real-world data collected from MERCI clinical trials is key to providing insights on the effectiveness of MERCI. Most of the existing data analysis on MERCI results has thus far employed conventional statistical analysis techniques. To the best of our knowledge, advanced data analytics and data mining techniques have not yet been systematically applied. To address the issue in this thesis, we conduct a comprehensive study on employing state of the art machine learning algorithms to generate prediction criteria for the outcome of MERCI patients. Specifically, we investigate the issue of how to choose the most significant attributes of a data set with limited instance examples. We propose a few search algorithms to identify the significant attributes, followed by a thorough performance analysis for each algorithm. Finally, we apply our proposed approach to the real-world, de-identified patient data provided by Erlanger Southeast Regional Stroke Center, Chattanooga, TN. Our experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed approach performs well.

Nevertheless, the design of a SMR-based BCI system that provides every user with a reliable BCI control from the first session, i.e., without extensive training, is still a big challenge. Considerable advances in this direction have been made by the machine learning co-adaptive calibration approach, which combines online adaptation techniques with subject learning in order to offer the user a feedback from the beginning of the experiment. Recently, based on offline analyses, we proposed the novel Common Spatial Patterns Patches (CSPP) technique as a good candidate to improve the co-adaptive calibration. CSPP is an ensemble of localized spatial filters, each of them optimized on subject-specific data by CSP analysis. Here, the evaluation of CSPP in online operation is presented for the first time. Results on three BCI-naive participants show indeed promising results. All three users reach the threshold criterion of 70% accuracy within one session, even one candidate for whom the weak SMR at rest predicted deficient BCI control. Concurrent recordings of the SMR during a relax condition as well as the course of BCI performance indicate a clear learning effect.

Given the strict limits on computational power and power consumption typical of wearable electronic components, our aim is to investigate the capability of a Hidden Markov Model machine-learning method, to detect gait phases with different levels of complexity in the processing of the wearable pressure sensors signals. Therefore three different datasets are developed: raw voltage values, calibrated sensor signals and a calibrated estimation of total ground reaction force and position of the plantar center of pressure. The method is tested on a pool of 5 healthy subjects, through a leave-one-out cross validation. The results show high classification performances achieved using estimated biomechanical variables, being on average the 96%. Calibrated signals and raw voltage values show higher delays and dispersions in phase transition detection, suggesting a lower reliability for online applications.	[Crea, S.; De Rossi, S. M.

Nearly 25% of neonates fail their first extubation attempt, requiring re-intubations that are associated with risk factors and financial costs. We identified 179 mechanically ventilated neonatal patients that were intubated within 24 hours of birth in the MIMIC-II intensive care database. We analyzed data from the patients 2 hours prior to their first extubation attempt, and developed a prediction algorithm to distinguish patients whose extubation attempt was successful from those that had EF. From an initial list of 57 candidate features, our machine learning approach narrowed down to six features useful for building an EF prediction model: monocyte cell count, rapid shallow breathing index, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)), heart rate, PaO2/FiO(2) ratio where PaO2 is the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, and work of breathing index. Algorithm performance had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.871 and sensitivity of 70.1% at 90% specificity.

Machine learning based seizure prediction method shows great performance by doing pattern recognition on high-dimensional bivariate synchronization features. However, the computation loading of the machine learning based method may be too high to meet wearable or implantable devices with the power and area constraints. In this work, channel selection is proposed to reduce the channel number from 22 to less than 6 channels and therefore more than 93.73% of the computation loading is saved through the method. The best result shows successful rate of 60.6% in 3-channel cases of ECoG database and successful rate of 70% in 3-channel cases of EEG database.

Despite extensive experimental studies on these proteases, our knowledge of the calpain degradome is still limited. Using a dataset of 341 unique, experimentally verified calpain cleavage sites, we conducted extensive sequence analyses and discovered novel residue propensities in the region flanking the cleavage site which could be modeled for prediction using machine learning algorithms. We have developed a series of computational models incorporating support vector machines and Bayes Feature Extraction for the prediction of calpain cleavage sites. The best models achieved A(ROC) and accuracy scores ranging from 0.79 to 0.93 and 71% to 86% respectively when tested on independent test sets. We predicted calpain cleavage sites on proteins from the receptor tyrosine kinase family and discovered potential sites of cleavage at critical regulatory domains. The results suggest a novel role of calpains as a direct regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase activity in cell survival and cell death pathways.	[Wee, L. J.

In this study, we have investigated the use of free-text and coded data in Marshfield Clinic's EHR, individually and in combination for building machine learning based models to predict the first ever episode of atrial fibrillation and/or atrial flutter (AFF). We trained and evaluated our AFF models on the EHR data across different time intervals (1, 3, 5 and all years) prior to first documented onset of AFF. We applied several machine learning methods, including naive bayes, support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression and random forests for building AFF prediction models and evaluated these using 10-fold cross-validation approach. On text-based datasets, the best model achieved an F-measure of 60.1%, when applied exclusively to coded data. The combination of textual and coded data achieved comparable performance. The study results attest to the relative merit of utilizing textual data to complement the use of coded data for disease onset prediction modeling.

Prediction of Extubation Readiness in Extreme Preterm Infants Based on Measures of Cardiorespiratory Variability	2012 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	34th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 28-SEP 01, 2012	San Diego, CA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS), CAS, SMC, PubMed, MEDLINE			VENTILATION	The majority of extreme preterm infants require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation (ETT-MV) during the first days of life to survive. Unfortunately this therapy is associated with adverse clinical outcomes and consequently, it is desirable to remove ETT-MV as quickly as possible. However, about 25% of extubated infants will fail and require re-intubation which is also associated with a 5-fold increase in mortality and a longer stay in the intensive care unit. Therefore, the ultimate goal is to determine the optimal time for extubation that will minimize the duration of MV and maximize the chances of success. This paper presents a new objective predictor to assist clinicians in making this decision. The predictor uses a modern machine learning method (Support Vector Machines) to determine the combination of measures of cardiorespiratory variability, computed automatically, that best predicts extubation readiness. Our results demonstrate that this predictor accurately classified infants who would fail extubation.

An individual's risk for falls depends on his or her frequency of imbalance episodes, and ability to recover balance following these events. However, there is little direct evidence on the frequency and circumstances of imbalance episodes ( near falls) in older adults. Currently, there is rapid growth in the development of wearable fall monitoring systems based on inertial sensors. The utility of these systems would be enhanced by the ability to detect near-falls. In the current study, we conducted laboratory experiments to determine how the number and location of wearable inertial sensors influences the accuracy of a machine learning algorithm in distinguishing near-falls from activities of daily living (ADLs).

Information regarding its mechanism of action may offer clues to the pathophysiology of the disease and to improved treatment. In this study we employ a machine learning (ML) analysis of P300 evoked potentials obtained from quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) data to identify changes in the brain induced by CLZ treatment. We employ brain source localization (BSL) on the EEG signals to extract source waveforms from specified regions of the brain. A subset of 8 features is selected from a large set of candidate features (consisting of spectral coherences between all identified source waveforms at multiple frequencies) that discriminate (by means of a classifier) between the pre- and post-treatment data for the schizophrenics (SCZ) most responsive to CLZ. We show these same selected features also discriminate between pre-treatment most responsive SCZ and healthy volunteers (HV), but not after treatment. Of note, these same features discriminate the least responsive SCZ from HV both pre- and post-treatment. This analysis suggests that the net beneficial effects of CLZ in SCZ are reflected in a normalization of P300 brain-source generators.

Discovering Shared Dynamics in Physiological Signals: Application to Patient Monitoring in ICU	2012 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	34th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 28-SEP 01, 2012	San Diego, CA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS), CAS, SMC, PubMed, MEDLINE			MORTALITY; SCORE	Modern clinical databases include time series of vital signs, which are often recorded continuously during a hospital stay. Over several days, these recordings may yield many thousands of samples. In this work, we explore the feasibility of characterizing the "state of health" of a patient using the physiological dynamics inferred from these time series. The ultimate objective is to assist clinicians in allocating resources to high-risk patients. We hypothesize that "similar" patients exhibit similar dynamics and the properties and duration of these states are indicative of health and disease. We use Bayesian nonparametric machine learning methods to discover shared dynamics in patients' blood pressure (BP) time series. Each such "dynamic" captures a distinct pattern of evolution of BP and is possibly recurrent within the same time series and shared across multiple patients. Next, we examine the utility of this low-dimensional representation of BP time series for predicting mortality in patients. Our results are based on an intensive care unit (ICU) cohort of 480 patients (with 16% mortality) and indicate that the dynamics of time series of vital signs can be an independent useful predictor of outcome in ICU.

For this problem, automated nerve fiber layer defects (NFLDs) detection method was proposed, but glaucoma risk assessment using this method was not evaluated. In this paper, computerized risk assessment for having glaucoma was attempted by use of the patients' clinical information, and the performances of the NFLDs detection and the glaucoma risk assessment were compared. The clinical data includes the systemic data, ophthalmologic data, and right and left retinal images. Glaucoma risk assessment was built by using machine learning technique, which were artificial neural network, radial basis function (RBF) network, k-nearest neighbor algorithm, and support vector machine. The inputting parameter was ten clinical ones with/without the results of NFLDs detection. As a result, proposed glaucoma risk assessment showed the higher performance than the NFLD detection. The result of the glaucoma risk assessment indicates that the computerized assessment may be useful for the determination of glaucoma risk.

In some nations, such as the UK, manual early warning score (EWS) systems have been mandated for use, in which scores are assigned to the manual observations, and care escalated if the scores exceed some pre-defined threshold. We argue that this manual system is far from ideal, and can be improved using machine learning techniques. We propose a system based on Gaussian process regression for improving the efficacy of existing EWS systems, and then demonstrate the method using manual observation of vital signs from a large-scale clinical study.

Recently proposed particle swarm-based clustering algorithm called the Rapid Centroid Estimation (RCE) is a lightweight alteration to Particle Swarm Clustering (PSC). The RCE in its standard form is shown to be superior to conventional PSC algorithm. We have observed some limitations in RCE including the possibility to stagnate at a local minimum combination and the restriction in swarm size. We propose strategies to optimize RCE further by introducing RCE+ and swarm RCE+. Five benchmark datasets from UCI machine learning database are used to test the performance of these new strategies. In Glass dataset swarm RCE+ is able to achieve highest purity centroid combinations with less iteration (90.3%+/- 1.1% in 9 +/- 5 iterations) followed by RCE+ (89%+/- 3.5% in 65 +/- 62 iterations) and RCE (87%+/- 5.9% in 54 +/- 44). Similar quality is also reflected in other benchmark datasets including Iris, Wine, Breast Cancer, and Diabetes.

Traditional classification methods, seeking to minimize the overall error rate of the whole training set, do not perform well on imbalanced data since they assume a relatively balanced class distribution and put too much strength on the majority class. This is a common scenario when predicting sub-cellular locations of proteins since proteins belonging to certain specific locations are naturally more abundant or have been more extensively studied. In this work, a new method to learn from imbalanced data, called SwarmBoost, is proposed in order to reduce overlapping and noise of imbalanced datasets and improve prediction performances. The method combines over-sampling, subsampling based on particle swarm optimization and ensemble methods. Our results show that SwarmBoost equals and in several cases outperforms other common boosting algorithms like DataBoost-Im and AdaBoost, constituting a useful tool for improving sub-cellular location predictions.

However, such flexibility and dynamic access approach could lead to potential communication resource misuses and security threats. In order to successfully deploy a CR network and realize its benefits, distinguishing/classifying radio terminals and the radio behaviors is an important research issue. This paper explores unique radio characteristics in CR networks, radio access behavior (RAB) characteristics (radio access bandwidth, access time and access response time), in identifying CR terminals in a CR network. Using machine learning algorithms, the proposed RAB based CR classification method can be used for CR network monitoring and CR identification. A GNURadio/Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) test bed is developed to implement and evaluate the performance of the RAB feature extraction and CR identification. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in CR classifications/identifications (differentiating radio types and radio terminals in a CR network).

In CR, an unlicensed network user is enabled to dynamically/adaptively access the frequency channels according to the current state of the radio environment and, therefore, CR refers to a smart radio as defined in an "observe-learn-decision" cognitive cycle. In this paper, we consider the medium access control (MAC) protocols as radio parameters in the cognitive cycle, and propose a new approach called MAC protocol identification to implement smart cognitive MAC. The MAC protocol identification approach enables CR users to sense and identify the network MAC protocol types. The identification results will be used by CR users to adaptively change their transmission parameters in order to improve the spectrum hole utilization efficiency, save energy, minimize the interference to the primary users, as well as facilitate communications among heterogeneous CR networks. To verify that the MAC protocol identification is feasible, we propose a MAC identification process based on machine learning techniques in this paper, and some experimental results are presented.

It is a text-based protocol, which is complex to parse due to the wide variability in representing the information elements. Building a parser for SIP may appear straight-forward; however, writing an efficient, robust, and scalable parser that is immune to low-effort attacks using malformed messages is surprisingly difficult. To mitigate this, self-learning systems based on Euclidean distance classifiers have been proposed to determine whether a message is well-formed or not. The efficacy of such machine learning algorithms must be studied on varied data sets before they can be successfully used. Our previous work has shown that Euclidean distance-based classifiers and standard classifiers used for self-learning problems are unable to detect malformed self-similar SIP messages (i.e., invalid SIP messages that differ by only a few bytes from normal SIP messages). This paper proposes using multiple classifier systems to detect malformed self-similar SIP messages. Our results show that a judiciously constructed multiple classifier system yields classification performance as high as 97.56% of the messages being classified correctly. We further show that for self-similar SIP messages, feature reduction measures based on the first moment are insufficient for improving classification accuracy.

Predicting which content will become popular is of interest to website owners and market analysts. In this paper, we present a novel technique to predict popularity using the connection features of individuals and their community. Our approach is based on the hypothesis that connection plays a dominant role in spreading content on social media. The resulting predictor is more efficient than approaches which estimate popularity by complex graph properties, and more accurate than approaches that use simple visit counts. We evaluated the proposed approach empirically on several real-life data sets. Results indicate that, compared with the conventional methods, our approach is both accurate and computationally efficient.

In order to better address the problem, law enforcement specialists have developed new ideas and methods for retrieving evidence more effectively. In accordance with this trend, our research aims to add new pieces of information to the automated analysis of evidence according to Machine Learning-based "post mortem" triage. The scope consists of some copyright infringement court cases coming from the Italian Cybercrime Police Unit database. We draw our inspiration from this "low level" crime which is normally sat at the bottom of the forensic analyst's queue, behind higher priority cases and dealt with the lowest priority. The present work aims to bring order back in the analyst's queue by providing a method to rank each queued item, e. g. a seized device, before being analyzed in detail. The paper draws the guidelines for drive-under-triage classification (e. g. hard disk drive, thumb drive, solid state drive etc.), according to a list of crime-dependent features such as installed software, file statistics and browser history. The model, inspired by the theory of Data Mining and Machine Learning, is able to classify each exhibit by predicting the problem dependent variable (i.e. the class) according to the aforementioned crime-dependent features. In our research context the "class" variable identifies with the likelihood that a drive image may contain evidence concerning the crime and, thus, the associated item must receive an high (or low) ranking in the list.

Video Human Motion Recognition Using a Knowledge-Based Hybrid Method Based on a Hidden Markov Model	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Algorithms; Performance; Experimentation; Human Factors; 3D motion capture; video human motion recognition; hidden Markov model; human-computer interaction	OPTICAL-FLOW	Human motion recognition in video data has several interesting applications in fields such as gaming, senior/assisted-living environments, and surveillance. In these scenarios, we may have to consider adding new motion classes (i.e., new types of human motions to be recognized), as well as new training data (e.g., for handling different type of subjects). Hence, both the accuracy of classification and training time for the machine learning algorithms become important performance parameters in these cases. In this article, we propose a knowledge-based hybrid. (KBH) method that can compute the probabilities for hidden Markov models (HMMs) associated with different human motion classes. This computation is facilitated by appropriately mixing features from two different media types (3D motion capture and 2D video). We conducted a variety of experiments comparing the proposed KBH for HMMs and the traditional Baum-Welch algorithms. With the advantage of computing the HMM parameter in a noniterative manner, the KBH method outperforms the Baum-Welch algorithm both in terms of accuracy as well as in reduced training time. Moreover, we show in additional experiments that the KBH method also outperforms the linear support vector machine (SVM).

MULTI-TARGET MODELLING OF THE DIATOM DIVERSITY INDICES IN LAKE PRESPA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						diatoms; Multi-target modelling; Lake Prespa; machine learning	TREES	In this paper we present models of relationship between the diatoms community diversity indices (DIs) and the physico-chemical parameters using machine learning techniques. By taking relative abundances into account, a diversity index depends not only on species richness but also on the evenness, or equitability, with which individuals are distributed among the different time and space. Diversity indices provide important information about rarity and commonness of species in a community. Because the physical-chemical conditions of the environmental influence on the several diversity indices of the diatoms community at once, it is more reliably to model all the diversity indices together. For modelling of the DIs models we use the raw; as measured, values of the concentrations for the physical-chemical parameters and the diversity indices of the diatoms abundance. The well known machine learning techniques are used to express this relationship: regression trees (RTs) and multi-target regression trees (MTRT's). The MTRT are more general than the RT, which predictive target is only one variable. The diversity indices are calculated for all diatoms of one measurement for 16 months, monthly and then are placed with the given physico-chemical parameters in one table. The results from the model have captured the ecological information with correlation between 0.9 and 0.92 for unseen (test) data. Diversity indices have proved to be a reliable indicator for the influence of the environment on the diatoms community.

Although semantic annotated corpus should be necessary to do the labeling, unfortunately, Korean language is lack of the corpus data. In this paper, we construct Korean Proposition Bank (PropBank) corpus and Sejong case frame annotated corpus. Semantic annotation means a task which gives a semantic tag to an argument word in consideration of the dependency relationship between a predicate and the argument. And semantic annotated corpus is used in semantic role labeling based on machine learning methods. We annotate the syntactic annotated corpus built by Korea Electronics and Telecommunication Research Institute. We use frame files for Korean PropBank and Sejong case frame dictionary for Sejong case frame annotated corpus.

There are several studies which focus on classifying opinions into positive or negative. Corpora are usually labeled with a star-rating scale. However, most of the studies neglect to consider neutral examples. In this paper we study the effect of using neutral sample reviews found in an opinion corpus in order to improve a sentiment polarity classification system. We have performed different experiments using several machine learning algorithms in order to demonstrate the advantage of taking the neutral examples into account. In addition we propose a model to divide neutral samples into positive and negative ones, in order to incorporate this information into the construction of the final opinion polarity classification system. Moreover, we have generated a corpus from Amazon in order to prove the convenience of the system. The results obtained are very promising and encourage us to continue researching along this line and consider neutral examples as relevant information in opinion mining tasks.

To solve the existing problem of network text formalization in subjective and objective text classification, a machine learning classification method based on network informal language (NIL) is proposed. Firstly, a network informal dictionary is constructed by writing a web crawler to collect informal words which can be divided into two categories: typical type and fuzzy type. Then, different methods are put forward to formalize the informal network text based on the two types of informal words. Finally, we adopt the Native Bayes classifier and Sequential Minimal Optimization classifier to distinguish subjectivity and objectivity of the text. The experimental results reveal that the method we proposed can improve the accuracy of subjective and objective text classification.

First, we use semi-supervised learning to develop strategies for guiding the selective refinement process based on training with the domain expert. Second, we propose to combine several local feature detection algorithm into a single, more robust compound classifier using AdaBoost that produces validated feature detection. The compound classifier would combine the best of all local classifiers as they respond to the underlying physical signal. The specific application of interest is vortex detection in turbulent flows. We applied our algorithms to fluid datasets to illustrate the efficacy of our approach.

Transfer learning omits this assumption and is able to transfer knowledge between different domains. It is a promising method to make machine learning technology become more practical. However, negative transfer can hurt the performance of the model, therefore, it should be avoided. In this paper, we focus on how to select a good knowledge source when there are multiple labelled datasets available. A method to estimate the divergence between two labelled datasets is given. In addition, we also provide a method to decide the mappings between features in different datasets. The experimental results show that the divergence estimated by our method is highly related to the performance of the model.

To build SVM model, firstly the trend in time series must be removed, and the target attribute should be normalized, secondly the size of the time window in which include all the lagged values should be determined, thirdly the machine learning method is used to construct SVM prediction model according to the time series data. Comparing with the traditional time series prediction model, SVM prediction models can reveal non-linear, non-stationary and randomness of the time series, and have higher prediction accuracy.

But it will consume too much time and resource when used in large-scale database such as digital library. How to process data efficiently becomes a vital problem for the further development of digital library. Because Mapreduce model has strong capacity of processing mass data, Mapreduce-based Bayesian classifier can reduce the time that is caused by machine learning and therefore enhance the overall efficiency. The new method can classify documents into different groups according to its subject. In this way, it is helpful for management and storage of information. Thus Mapreduce-based Bayesian text classifier can be used in digital library successfully which will provide better service for people.

We aim to validate a novel machine learning (ML) score incorporating heart rate variability (HRV) for triage of critically ill patients presenting to the emergency department by comparing the area under the curve, sensitivity and specificity with the modified early warning score (MEWS). Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study of critically ill patients (Patient Acuity Category Scale 1 and 2) in an emergency department of a tertiary hospital. At presentation, HRV parameters generated from a 5-minute electrocardiogram recording are incorporated with age and vital signs to generate the ML score for each patient. The patients are then followed up for outcomes of cardiac arrest or death. Results: From June 2006 to June 2008 we enrolled 925 patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for ML scores in predicting cardiac arrest within 72 hours is 0.781, compared with 0.680 for MEWS (difference in AUROC: 0.101, 95% confidence interval: 0.006 to 0.197). As for in-hospital death, the area under the curve for ML score is 0.741, compared with 0.693 for MEWS (difference in AUROC: 0.048, 95% confidence interval: -0.023 to 0.119). A cutoff ML score >= 60 predicted cardiac arrest with a sensitivity of 84.1%, specificity of 72.3% and negative predictive value of 98.8%. A cutoff MEWS >= 3 predicted cardiac arrest with a sensitivity of 74.4%, specificity of 54.2% and negative predictive value of 97.8%. Conclusion: We found ML scores to be more accurate than the MEWS in predicting cardiac arrest within 72 hours. There is potential to develop bedside devices for risk stratification based on cardiac arrest prediction.

Cloud Interconnected Affect Reward based Automation Ambient Comfort Controller	ELEKTRONIKA IR ELEKTROTECHNIKA			English	Article						Ambient intelligence; automatic control; emotion recognition; human computer interaction; machine learning		The paper presents the human Affect Reward Based Automation Ambient Comfort Controller (ACARBC) as the interconnected cloud computing intelligent services that provide intelligent calculus for any instrumented interconnected environment sense and control system. The ACARBC has been modelled and, as the experimental results show, that an environmental state characteristics that create an optimum ambient comfort can be obtained by ACAR index. The ACAR index is dependent on human physiological parameters: the temperature, the ECG- electrocardiogram and the EDA-electro-dermal activity. The fuzzy logic is used to approximate the ACAR index function by defining two fuzzy inference systems: the Arousal-Valence System, and the Ambient Comfort Affect Reward (ACAR) System. The Radial Basis Neural Network is used as the main component of the ACARBC to performing of two roles - the policy structure, known as the Actor, used to select actions, and the estimated value function, known as the Critic that criticizes the actions made by the Actor. The Critic in this paper was used as a value function approximation of the continuous learning tasks of the ACARBC.

The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has recently produced binding data for more than 100 transcription factors from about 500 ChIP-seq experiments in multiple cell types. While this large amount of data creates a valuable resource, it is nonetheless overwhelmingly complex and simultaneously incomplete since it covers only a small fraction of all human transcription factors. Results: As part of the consortium effort in providing a concise abstraction of the data for facilitating various types of downstream analyses, we constructed statistical models that capture the genomic features of three paired types of regions by machine-learning methods: firstly, regions with active or inactive binding; secondly, those with extremely high or low degrees of co-binding, termed HOT and LOT regions; and finally, regulatory modules proximal or distal to genes. From the distal regulatory modules, we developed computational pipelines to identify potential enhancers, many of which were validated experimentally. We further associated the predicted enhancers with potential target transcripts and the transcription factors involved. For HOT regions, we found a significant fraction of transcription factor binding without clear sequence motifs and showed that this observation could be related to strong DNA accessibility of these regions. Conclusions: Overall, the three pairs of regions exhibit intricate differences in chromosomal locations, chromatin features, factors that bind them, and cell-type specificity. Our machine learning approach enables us to identify features potentially general to all transcription factors, including those not included in the data.

Stock price prediction depends on various factors and their complex relationships. Prediction of stock price is an important issue in finance. Stock price prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock. The successful prediction of a stock future price could yield significant profit. Hence an efficient automated prediction system is highly essential for stock forecasting. This paper demonstrates the applicability of support vector regression, a machine learning technique. for predicting the stock price by learning the historic data. The stock data for the period of four years is collected and trained with various parameter settings. The performance of the trained model is evaluated by 10-fold cross validation for its predictive accuracy. It has been observed that the support vector regression model with RBF kernel shows better performance when compared with other models.	[Abirami, R.; Vijaya, M.

J	Yang, H; Fong, S; Sun, GM; Wong, R				Yang, Hang; Fong, Simon; Sun, Guangmin; Wong, Raymond			A Very Fast Decision Tree Algorithm for Real-Time Data Mining of Imperfect Data Streams in a Distributed Wireless Sensor Network	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article							MISSING DATA; IMPUTATION	Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a rapidly emerging technology with a great potential in many ubiquitous applications. Although these sensors can be inexpensive, they are often relatively unreliable when deployed in harsh environments characterized by a vast amount of noisy and uncertain data, such as urban traffic control, earthquake zones, and battlefields. The data gathered by distributed sensors-which serve as the eyes and ears of the system-are delivered to a decision center or a gateway sensor node that interprets situational information from the data streams. Although many other machine learning techniques have been extensively studied, real-time data mining of high-speed and nonstationary data streams represents one of the most promising WSN solutions. This paper proposes a novel stream mining algorithm with a programmable mechanism for handling missing data. Experimental results from both synthetic and real-life data show that the new model is superior to standard algorithms.

Throughout the years, the IDS technology has grown enormously to keep up with the advancement of computer crime. Since the beginning of the technology in mid 80's, researches have been conducted to enhance the capability of detecting attacks without jeopardizing the network performance. In this paper we hope to provide a critical review of the IDS technology, issues that transpire during its implementation and the limitation in the IDS research endeavors. Lastly we will proposed future work while exploring maturity of the topic, the extent of discussion, the value and contribution of each research to the domain discussed. At the end of this paper, readers would be able to clearly distinguish the gap between each sub-area of research and they would appreciate the importance of these research areas to the industry.

This specific type of machine learning approach uses examples only from a single class to derive a decision boundary - hence its is often referred to as learning in the absence of counterexamples. Combining several one-class classifiers is a promising research direction, as it often results in a more precise classification than when using just a single model. Most one-class classifiers base their decision on a distance from an object to the decision boundary, canonically expressed in the Euclidean measure. When combining such predictors it is necessary to map the distance into probability, therefore the measure used has a crucial impact on the classifier fusion. This paper proposes alternative distance measures for one-class classification, which are evaluated through experimental investigations.

This algorithm is applicable to decision tables with many-valued decisions where each row is labeled with a set of decisions. For a given row, we should find a decision from the set attached to this row. The idea of algorithm is connected with so-called boundary subtables. After constructing a test we use algorithm which tries to remove attributes from a test and obtain a reduct.

Particularly, the suggested approach is inspired by the negative selection mechanism of the immune system that can detect foreign patterns in the complement (non-self) space. In our paper, we run a number of experiments on the relatively new NSL-KDD data set which was never tested against this algorithm before our work. We run the test using different values for the involved parameters, to find out which values give the best detection rates, so we can give recommendations for future application of the algorithm. Also, Formal Concept Analysis is applied on the generated rules to visualize the relation among attributes. We will show in the results that the algorithm have very good results through the analysis, compared to other machine learning approaches.

In this paper, a decentralized Q-learning power allocation algorithm is proposed to maximize the Signal on Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) at the secondary receivers while meeting the primary protection constraint. Numerical simulations allow to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with the performance of the optimal centralized power allocation scheme in the scenario of multiple independent secondary cells located on the border of a primary network protection contour. The impact of the definition of the learning algorithm cost function on the secondary user fairness and the system performance is discussed. The optimal execution frequency of the algorithm is obtained and different strategies for the exploration of new solutions are compared.

Semi-supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm which deals with utilizing unlabeled data to build better classifiers. However, unlabeled data with wrong predictions will mislead the classifier. In this paper, we proposed a particle swarm optimization based semi-learning classifier to solve Chinese text categorization problem. This classifier utilizes an iterative strategy, and the result of classifier is determined by a document's previous prediction and its neighbors' information. The new classifier is tested on a Chinese text corpus. The proposed classifier is compared with the k nearest neighbor method, the k weighted nearest neighbor method, and the self-learning classifier.

This paper explores continued efforts to utilize evolutionary computation (EC) methods and machine learning techniques to estimate several helicopter dynamic loads. Estimates for the main rotor normal bending (MRNBX) on the Australian Black Hawk helicopter were generated from an input set that included thirty standard flight state and control system parameters under several flight conditions (full speed forward level flight, rolling left pullout at 1.5g, and steady 45 degrees left turn at full speed). Multi-objective genetic algorithms (MOGA) used in combination with the Gamma test found reduced subsets of predictor variables with modeling potential. These subsets were used to estimate MRNBX using Cartesian genetic programming and neural network models trained by deterministic and evolutionary computation techniques, including particle swarm optimization (PSO), differential evolution (DE), and MOGA. PSO and DE were used alone or in combination with deterministic methods. Different error measures were explored including a fuzzy-based asymmetric error function. EC techniques played an important role in both the exploratory and modeling phase of the investigation. The results of this work show that the addition of EC techniques in the modeling stage generated more accurate and correlated models than could be obtained using only deterministic optimization.

However, when the evaluation for training edge detectors considers the accuracy of each image, the influence on the final detectors has not been investigated. In this study, we employ genetic programming to evolve detectors with new fitness functions containing the accuracy of training images. The experimental results show that fitness functions based on the accuracy of single training images can balance the accuracies across detection results, and the fitness function combining the accuracy of overall pixels with the accuracy of training images together can improve the detection performance.

Of particular interest are enzymes, which process information in highly complex dynamic environments. Exploring the information processing characteristics of an enzyme by selectively altering its environment may lead to the discovery of new modes of computation. The physical experiments required to perform such exploration are combinatorial in nature. Thus resource consumption, both time and money, poses major limiting factors on any exploratory work. New tools are required to mitigate these factors. One such tool is lab-on-chip based autonomous experimentation system, where a microfluidic experimentation platform is driven by machine learning algorithms. The lab-on-chip approach provides an automated platform that can perform complex protocols, which is also capable of reducing the resource cost of experimentation.

B	Knittel, A			IEEE	Knittel, Anthony			Learning Feature Hierarchies under Reinforcement	2012 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION (CEC)	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE) / International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) / IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (IEEE-CEC) / IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (IEEE-WCCI)	JUN 10-15, 2012	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA	IEEE				Learning feature hierarchies, where larger features are composed of smaller re-used features, is an important area of study in object recognition and classification, and relates to processes in the human visual system. Established techniques are able to build deep hierarchies using neural networks, such as deep learning based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines, however approaches using other machine learning techniques involving reinforcement are not well established. An approach is presented that uses a form of Learning Classifier System to build a hierarchical feature network, for classification of images using the MNIST dataset. Larger scale representations of rules are composed of re-used smaller elements, in a network of 4,000 features and 2,000 rules. The feature network is developed autonomously, according to reinforcement of rules the features participate in. An implementation is shown using the ARCS classifier system to perform classification of images, using rules based on image templates. A second implementation uses rules with image templates constructed from a hierarchical feature network. This shows effective classification performance, but not as accurate as the best neural network and kernel methods. The implementation shows the ability to construct a hierarchical feature network under reinforcement, and its application to develop a rule population used by a Learning Classifier System. An alternative method for modifying existing rules is shown to substitute for standard mutation and crossover processes, to allow exploration of the rule space more closely related to gradient descent and cognitively related processes, rather than the genetic analogy commonly used in learning classifier systems.

This paper presents an approach to synthesize the spatio-temporal dynamics of groups in standing conversation: four simple spatial rules form the building-blocks and a framework to automatically evolve rule and the parameter space by bootstrapping a-priori human judgment on the aesthetic quality of the simulations is introduced. The framework consists of a Genetic Algorithm and a scorer (fitness function) developed based on a machine learning system trained using human evaluations. The results of the study suggest that the framework is capable of deriving optimal rule and parameter combinations utilizing only a relatively small set of human scored training data. Further, the relationship between rule-complexity and visual fidelity is explored.

Judging beauty is a highly subjective task, but certain features are considered important in aesthetic judgement. This paper introduces an adaptive learning evaluation model for guiding the evolutionary process. Certain aesthetic features are extracted from internal evolutionary images and external real world paintings, which are then selected by the model. The model is built by selecting learning approach with better accuracy by training these features. Multi-layer perceptron and C4.5 decision tree are compared for machine learning of aesthetic judgements. Our results show that these features play important roles in aesthetic judgements and the adaptive model is efficient at predicting user's preference.

Based on phase transition of the covering test, PT-NFF-GILP randomly generates initial population in phase transition region instead of the whole space of candidate clauses. Moreover, a new fitness function, which not only considers the number of examples covered by rules, but also considers the ratio of the examples covered by rules to the training examples, is defined in PT-NFF-GILP. The new fitness function measures the quality of first-order rules more precisely, and enhances the search performance of algorithm. Experiments on ten learning problems show that: 1) the new method of generating initial population can effectively reduce iteration number and enhance predictive accuracy of GILP algorithm; 2) the new fitness function measures the quality of first-order rules more precisely and avoids generating over-specific hypothesis; 3) The performance of PT-NFF-GILP is better than other algorithms compared with it, such as G-NET, KFOIL and NFOIL.

In subspace methods like PCA, feature selection is fundamental to obtain better face recognition. However, the problem of finding a subset of features from a high dimensional feature set is NP-hard. Therefore, to solve the feature selection problem, heuristic methods such as evolutionary algorithms are gaining importance. In many face recognition applications, due to the small sample size (SSS) problem, it is difficult to construct a single strong classifier. Recently, ensemble learning in face recognition is gaining significance due to its ability to overcome the SSS problem. In this paper, the NP-hard problem of finding the best subset of the extracted PCA features for face recognition is solved by using the differential evolution (DE) algorithm and is referred to as FS-DE. The feature subset is obtained by maximizing the class separation in the training data. We also present an ensemble based approach for face recognition (En-FR), where different subsets of PCA features are obtained by maximizing the distance between a subset of classes of the training data instead of whole classes. The subsets of the classes are obtained by bagging and overlap each other. Each subset of the PCA features selected is used for face recognition and all the outputs are combined by a simple majority voting. The proposed algorithms, FS-DE and En-FR, are evaluated on four well-known face databases and the performance is compared with the PCA and Fisher's LDA algorithms.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques provide a powerful solution for it. An agent used by RL interacts with a dynamic environment and finds a policy through a reward function, without using target labels like Supervised Learning (SL). However, one fundamental assumption of existing RL algorithms is that reward function, the most succinct representation of the designer's intention, needs to be provided beforehand. In practice, the reward function can be very hard to specify and exhaustive to tune for large and complex problems, and this inspires the development of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), an extension of RL, which directly tackles this problem by learning the reward function through expert demonstrations. IRL introduces a new way of learning policies by deriving expert's intentions, in contrast to directly learning policies, which can be redundant and have poor generalization ability. In this paper, the original IRL algorithms and its close variants, as well as their recent advances are reviewed and compared.

However the downside of it is also well known: the evolved solutions are often difficult to understand. This interpretability issue hinders GP to gain acceptance from many application areas. To address this issue in the context of motion detection, GP programs evolved for various detection tasks are analyzed in this study. Previous work has shown the capabilities of these evolved motion detectors such as ignoring uninteresting motions, differentiating fast motions from slow motions, identifying genuine motions from a moving background, and handling noises. This study aims to reveal the behavior of these GP individuals by introducing simplified motion detection tasks. The investigation on these GP motion detectors shows that their good performance is not random. There are contributing characteristics captured by these detectors, of which the behaviors are more or less explainable. This study validates GP as a good approach for motion detection.

The method, called Clonal Selection Classifier with Data Reduction (CSCDR), utilizes a fitness function based on the number of correct and incorrect pattern classifications made by each antibody. The algorithm tries to maximize this value through clonal selection processes such as mutation, affinity maturation and selection of the best individuals, transforming the training phase in an optimization problem. This leads to antibodies with more representativeness and thus decreases the amount of prototypes generated at the end of the algorithm. Experimental results on benchmark datasets of the UCI machine learning repository demonstrated the effectiveness of the CSCDR algorithm as a classification technique, combined with a considerable data reduction when compared to the results obtained by the well known Artificial Immune Recognition System (AIRS) and the original Clonal Selection Classifier Algorithm (CSCA).

The parallel search solution is capable of determining global maxima of the search space using exhaustive search, compared to local optima located by machine learning solutions such as evolutionary computation. The actual solutions from the best machine learning technique, called Probabilistic Adaptive Mapping Developmental Genetic Algorithm, are compared by a fisheries expert to the global maxima solutions returned by parallel search. The time required for parallel search, for both CPU and GPU-based solutions, are compared to those required for machine learning solutions. The GPU parallel computing solution was found to have a speedup of 12x over a multi-threaded CPU solution. An expert found that overall the machine learning solutions produced more interesting results by locating local optima than global optima determined by parallel processing.

A GP methodology is presented to show how to evolve a program which can analyse the difference between scenes and split them accordingly. The evolved video splitting programs achieve reasonable performance even when the videos are not easily recognizable by eyes due to the server artificial noises. Moreover, a few different approaches have been investigated in this study. We compare the performance of GP with J48, NaiiveBayes and one video splitting software, the experimental results show that GP generated splitters are comparable with two conventional machine learning algorithms and more accurate than human written program.

But, many real-world problems are complex and have multitasks, and it is a bit hard to learn them well by one machine learning approach. So, the simultaneous learning of several tasks has been considered, that is, so-called multitask learning. This paper describes a new approach to the autonomous agent problem using the multitask learning scheme based on Genetic Network Programming (GNP), called ML-GNP, where each GNP is used to learn one corresponding task. ML-GNP has some charateristics, such as distribution, interaction and autonomy, which are helpful for learning multitask problems. The experimental results illustrate that ML-GNP can give much better performance than learning all the tasks of the problem by one GNP algorithm.

Android devices have appeared lately and, since then, the number of applications available for this operating system have increased exponentially. Google already has its Android Market where applications are offered and, as happens with every popular media, is prone to misuse. A malware writer may insert a malicious application into this market without being noticed. Indeed, there are already several cases of Android malware within the Android Market. Therefore, an approach that can automatically characterise the different types of applications can be helpful for both organising the Android Market and detecting fraudulent or malicious applications. In this paper, we propose a new method for categorising Android applications through machine-learning techniques. To represent each application, our method extracts different feature sets: (i) the frequency of occurrence of the printable strings, (ii) the different permissions of the application itself and (iii) the permissions of the application extracted from the Android Market. We evaluate this approach of automatically categorisation of Android applications and show that achieves a high performance.

Currently available cardiac monitoring sensors suffer from high level of noise generated from loose physical contact of the sensor node due to the highly mobile and pervasive environment of the BAN (e.g., at-home remote health care applications). Therefore, there is a need to estimate the data quality of individual cardiac sensors as well as the data quality of the overall BAN while particularly considering the resource scarceness of BAN-scale mobile systems. The proposed method successfully estimates the data quality of a BAN without employing computationally expensive machine learning techniques. It also provides a number of resource management options that enable efficient data quality estimation. We present experimental results of four participants with three off-the-shelf cardiac sensors to form a BAN. We also present simulation results to examine if the proposed mechanism can successfully detect health hazardous events such as heart arrhythmia.

Towards Unobtrusive Emotion Recognition for Affective Social Communication	2012 IEEE CONSUMER COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING CONFERENCE (CCNC)	IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC)	JAN 14-17, 2012	Las Vegas, NV	IEEE		Affective computing; Computer mediated communication; Emotion recognition; Machine intelligence; Supervised learning	NETWORK	Awareness of the emotion of those who communicate with others is a fundamental challenge in building affective intelligent systems. Emotion is a complex state of the mind influenced by external events, physiological changes, or relationships with others. Because emotions can represent a user's internal context or intention, researchers suggested various methods to measure the user's emotions from analysis of physiological signals, facial expressions, or voice. However, existing methods have practical limitations to be used with consumer devices, such as smartphones; they may cause inconvenience to users and require special equipment such as a skin conductance sensor. Our approach is to recognize emotions of the user by inconspicuously collecting and analyzing user-generated data from different types of sensors on the smartphone. To achieve this, we adopted a machine learning approach to gather, analyze and classify device usage patterns, and developed a social network service client for Android smartphones which unobtrusively find various behavioral patterns and the current context of users. Also, we conducted a pilot study to gather real-world data which imply various behaviors and situations of a participant in her/his everyday life. From these data, we extracted 10 features and applied them to build a Bayesian Network classifier for emotion recognition. Experimental results show that our system can classify user emotions into 7 classes such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, sadness, fear, and neutral with a surprisingly high accuracy. The proposed system applied to a smartphone demonstrated the feasibility of an unobtrusive emotion recognition approach and a user scenario for emotion-oriented social communication between users.

In order to optimize the radio resource usage and maxmize the throughput and quality of service (QoS), the link aggregation technologies to utilize multiple different available RANs have been studied. However, in such heterogeneous wireless networks, it is difficult to improve the throughput by their aggregation because of the differences among the QoSs of the different RANs. In this paper, we propose an autonomous parameter optimization scheme using a machine learning algorithm, which maximize the throughput of the heterogeneous RAN aggregation system. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme implemented on a cognitive wireless network system called Cognitive Wireless Cloud (CWC) system, connected to real wireless network services, such as HSDPA, WiMAX and W-CDMA. Our experimental results of the proposed system show that the aggregation throughput can be improved with increase of the training samples, which are collected autonomously.

In this framework, the association of a tag to a song is characterized in a "hard" fashion: the tag is either relevant or not. Yet, the relevance of a tag to a song is not always evident. Indeed, during the ground-truth annotation process, several annotators may express doubts, or disagree with each other. In this paper, we propose to fuse annotators' decisions in a way to keep information about this uncertainty. This fusion provides us continuous scores, that are used for training a regressive boosting algorithm. Our experiments show that regression with this soft ground truth leads to a more accurate learning, and better predictions, compared to traditionally used binary classification.

The features are obtained through the automatic characterisation of pitch contours describing the predominant melodic line, extracted using a state-of-the-art audio melody extraction algorithm. Using standard machine learning algorithms the melodic features are used to classify excerpts into five different musical genres. We obtain a classification accuracy above 90% for a collection of 500 excerpts, demonstrating that successful classification can be achieved using high-level melodic features that are more meaningful to humans compared to low-level features commonly used for this task. We also compare our method to a baseline approach using low-level timbre features, and study the effect of combining these low-level features with our high-level melodic features. The results demonstrate that complementing low-level features with high-level melodic features is a promising approach.

We propose a new weighting method using a multiple kernel learning (MKL) algorithm to localize the brain area contributing to the accurate vowel discrimination. Our MKL simultaneously estimates both the classification boundary and the weight of each MEG sensor; MEG amplitude obtained from each pair of sensors is an element of the feature vector. The estimated weight indicates how the corresponding sensor is useful for classifying the MEG response patterns. Our results show both the large-weight MEG sensors mainly in a language area of the brain and the high classification accuracy (73.0%) in the 100 similar to 200 ms latency range.

The proposed BMMF scheme automatically detects image content and distortion types in a block via machine learning, which is motivated by the observation that the performance of an image quality metric is highly influenced by these factors. Locally, image block content is classified into three types; namely, smooth, edge and texture. Image distortion is detected and grouped into five types. An appropriate image quality metric is adopted for each block by considering its content and distortion types, and then all block-based quality metrics are fused to result in one final score. Furthermore, a corrected version of BMMF is derived for a specific group of distortions based on image complexity analysis. The proposed BMMF scheme is tested on TID database with its Spearman Correlation equal to 0.9471, which outperforms today's state-of-the-art image quality metrics.

A 12-D feature can be extracted from each group of pictures (GOP) and machine learning framework is adopted to enhance the detection accuracy. Furthermore, a novel approach with a serial Support Vector Machine (SVM) architecture to estimate original bit rate scale in doubly compressed video is proposed.

To enhance the performance of dimensionality reduction, a distance metric adjustment step is introduced in advance to achieve a suitable metric in the feature space. In addition, to further exploit the ordinal relationship of human ages, the "label-sensitive" concept is proposed, which regards the label similarity during the learning phase of distance metric and dimensionality reduction. Finally, an age-specific local regression algorithm is proposed to capture the complicated aging process for age determination. From the simulation results, the proposed framework achieves the lowest mean absolute error against the existing methods.

We focus on chroma and pitch features to yield a robust retrieval with queries which are generated from different arrangements and which include some mistakes. Conditional random fields (CRFs) are used to enhance simultaneous utilization of chroma and pitch features. This is because CRFs can discriminate the correct sequence from all the other candidate sequences without independence assumptions for features of the inputs. Experimental results show that the use of multiple features based on CRFs leads to a significant improvement of retrieval accuracy and accomplishes robust music retrieval regardless of performance style of queries.

If the traditional RBF kernel is adopted, the learned kernel-based classifier usually delivers better performance by engaging a large training dataset. However, such a high performance comes at the expense of costly learning and classification complexities, which grow drastically with the training size N. To overcome this curse of dimensionality, we propose a so-called TRBF kernel(with finite intrinsic degree J) which approximates the RBF kernel. The contributions of this paper are as follows. First, the optimal classification efficiency attainable is shown to be J' approximate to J. To improve learning efficiency, we propose a fast PDA algorithm with learning complexity linearly growing with N. We adopt pruned-PDA (PPDA) to improve the accuracy by removing harmful "anti-support" vectors from the training set. Experiments on ECG dataset showed that TRBF-PPDA delivers nearly optimal performance with very low power.	[Kung, S.

The ECOC contains three parts: coding design, decoding algorithm, and base dichotomizer. Recently, the Loss-Weighted (LW) decoding algorithm (Escalera et al., PAMI2010), which introduces a weight matrix to the Loss-Based (LB) decoding (Allwein et al., JMLR2001), achieves improved performance over traditional decoding methods. However, the weight matrix is assigned empirically. In this paper, we present a theoretical global optimization method for the weight matrix, so as to achieve the minimal training risk. Although the experimental results on real-world image, audio and text classification tasks show that the proposed decoding method only leads to slightly better performances than others in the case of discrete outputs of the dichotomizers, the proposed method provides a new screen on the decoding methods of the ECOC.

The system is based on discovery of short-term activity motifs from the sensory data and statistical analysis of these motifs on a larger time scale. Detected context segments are then clustered into high-level context categories and the data corresponding to these categories are used to train on-line classifiers for different contexts. Experiments show that the method is capable of segmenting sensory recordings into epochs of high-level environmental contexts based purely on audio signal, and that the classifiers trained from the obtained segments are selective towards specific contexts.

To improve the efficiency of solving lasso problems, we systematically investigate lasso screening, a process that quickly identifies dictionary entries that won't be used in the optimal sparse representation, and hence can be removed from the problem. We propose a general test called an R region test that unifies existing screening tests and we derive a particular instance called the dome test. This test is stronger than existing screening tests and can be executed in linear-time as a two-pass test with a memory footprint of only three codewords.

The model is a probabilistic model utilizing the framework of Bayesian Nonparametrics which can estimate the number of components in posterior distributions. The original Infinite Relational Model cannot handle continuous-valued or multidimensional data directly. Our proposed model overcomes the data expression restrictions by utilizing the proposed likelihood, which can handle many types of data. The posterior distribution is estimated via variational inference. Using real-world data, we show that the proposed model outperforms the original model in terms of AUC score and efficiency for a movie recommendation task.

In this paper we take a new estimation based approach. Identifying the problem as ill-posed, we show how to regularize the solution by imposing soft constraints on the amplitude and phase variables of the sinusoids. Estimation proceeds using a version of Kalman smoothing. We evaluate the method on synthetic and natural, clean and noisy signals, showing that it outperforms previous decompositions, but at a higher computational cost.

Many of the existing machine-learning approaches to speech summarization cast important sentence selection as a two-class classification problem and have shown empirical success for a wide array of summarization tasks. One common deficiency of these approaches is that the corresponding learning criteria are loosely related to the final evaluation metric. To cater for this problem, we present a novel probabilistic framework to learn the summarization models, building on top of the Bayes decision theory. Two effective training criteria, viz. maximum relevance estimation (MRE) and minimum ranking loss estimation (MRLE), deduced from such a framework are introduced to characterize the pair-wise preference relationships between spoken sentences. Experiments on a broadcast news speech summarization task exhibit the performance merits of our summarization methods when compared to existing methods.

In the latter case, the user's speech capabilities may also be affected. In this paper, we consider a NMF-based learning framework capable of doing this, and experimentally show that its learning rate crucially depends on how the speech data is represented. Higher-level units of speech, which hide some of the complex variability of the acoustics, are found to yield faster learning rates.

These problems arise in supervised machine learning models in which it is important to seek a sparse parameter vector. The proposed method operates in a batch setting, which is well suited for parallel computing environments, and employs sub-sampled Hessian information to accelerate progress of the iteration. The method consists of two phases, an active-set prediction phase that employs first-order and second-order information, and subspace phase that performs a Newton-like step. Numerical results on a speech recognition problem illustrate the practical behavior of the method.

Although platform non-idealities have always posed a fundamental limitation, the overheads of conventional margining are now reaching intolerable levels. We describe an alternate approach to hardware resilience that applies to applications where advanced modeling and inference capabilities are required, a rapidly increasing emphasis in many applications. We show how a data-driven modeling framework for analyzing application data can also be used to effectively model and overcome a broad range of hardware non-idealities. Specific examples for biomedical sensors are shown that are able to retain performance with minimal on-line overhead despite the presence of severe digital- and analog-circuit non-idealities.

Our goal is to recognize musical notes from polyphonic audio signals and simultaneously induce grammatical patterns from the recognized notes by integrating probabilistic acoustic and language models. Given music audio signals, both models could be jointly trained in a self-organizing manner without manually specifying the numbers of musical notes and grammatical patterns. In this paper, we introduce our nonparametric Bayesian acoustic and language models for multipitch analysis and chord progression analysis and discuss issues for integrating these models. We then provide a novel overview of various acoustic and language models whose underlying concepts are useful for implementing the framework.

Bayesian Modeling of Pretransplant Variables Accurately Predicts Kidney Graft Survival	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEPHROLOGY			English	Article						Renal allograft; Kidney transplant; United States Renal Data System; Graft failure; Bayesian Belief Network; Multivariate analysis	NEURAL-NETWORK; TRANSPLANTATION; TECHNOLOGY; NOMOGRAMS; OUTCOMES; DONORS	Introduction: Machine learning can enable the development of predictive models that incorporate multiple variables for a systems approach to organ allocation. We explored the principle of Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) to determine whether a predictive model of graft survival can be derived using pretransplant variables. Our hypothesis was that pretransplant donor and recipient variables, when considered together as a network, add incremental value to the classification of graft survival. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 5,144 randomly selected patients (age deceased donor kidney only, first-time recipients) from the United States Renal Data System database between 2000 and 2001. Using this dataset, we developed a machine-learned BBN that functions as a pretransplant organ-matching tool. Results: A network of 48 clinical variables was constructed and externally validated using an additional 2,204 patients of matching demographic characteristics. This model was able to predict graft failure within the first year or within 3 years (sensitivity 40%; specificity 80%; area under the curve, AUC, 0.63). Recipient BMI, gender, race, and donor age were amongst the pretransplant variables with strongest association to outcome. A 10-fold internal cross-validation showed similar results for 1-year (sensitivity 24%; specificity 80%; AUC 0.59) and 3-year (sensitivity 31%; specificity 80%; AUC 0.60) graft failure. Conclusion: We found recipient BMI, gender, race, and donor age to be influential predictors of outcome, while wait time and human leukocyte antigen matching were much less associated with outcome. BBN enabled us to examine variables from a large database to develop a robust predictive model.	[Brown, Trevor S.; Elster, Eric A.; Stevens, Kristin; Graybill, J.

The optimal parameter sigma and c of RBF kernel SVM were obtained by searching automatically. Those kinematic data was carried out through three major steps: wavelet transformation, Principle Component Analysis (PCA) -based dimensionality reduction and k-fold cross-validation, followed by implementing a best classifier to distinguish 6 difference actions. As an activity classifier, the SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm is used, and we have achieved over 94.5% of mean accuracy in detecting differential actions. It shows that the verification approach based on the recognition of human activity detection is valuable and will be further explored in the near future.

This paper presents an unsupervised approach for the training of an efficient and robust hand gesture detector. Different with traditional hand feature descriptors, the proposed approach use pair-patch comparison features to describe the samples. And the random forest is introduced to establish a machine learning model. The pair-patch comparison features could rapidly describe a sample and the distributions of them have some similarity between the same classes. In the training procedure, a database which consists of a large number of hand images with corresponding labels and background images are established. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve a detection and accuracy rate of 92.23% on the dataset.

However, considering the recent trends in internet behavior of people along with the development of so called social web, makes it popular amongst web scientists to work on this as a potential research topic with new perspectives. Real life is a complex social dynamic system comprising individuals starting of either as strong acquaintances or weak acquaintances and move towards strong or weak ties with passage of time. In this paper we validate the existence of varying degree of relationship individuals have on Facebook using unsupervised machine learning techniques like divisive hierarchical clustering and statistical techniques like SSE; analyzing strength of the boundaries that distinguish them. We have realized this on a feature rich dataset of more than 100 nodes collected during 10th of July, 2011 to the 9th of September 2011 using Facebook application. We provide descriptive error analysis interviews focussing on the clustered structure; obtaining it with an accuracy of 90%. The paper concludes by illustrating how modeling tie strength can improve social media design elements, including privacy controls, message routing and information prioritization in databases. Potential usage of this work can be in making complex recommender systems, lead generation marketing and in organizational or telecom network.

First, research on the mobile u-health service is just beginning, and there are very few cases where the existing techniques have been applied in the mobile u-health service environment. Second, since the machine learning technique requires a long learning period, it is not suitable for application in the mobile u-health service environment, which requires real-time disease management. Third, the various machine learning techniques that have been proposed until now do not include a way to assign the weight factors to the disease-related variables, and thus its use as a personalized disease prediction system is somewhat limited. This paper proposes PCADP, which is an ontology-based personalized disease prediction method, to solve such problems and to interpret the bio data analysis of the mobile u-health service system as a process. Moreover, the mobile u-health service ontology framework was modeled as a semantics type in order to meaningfully express the mobile u-health data and service statement based on PCADP. To validate the performance and efficiency of the PCADP technique proposed in this paper, the 5-cross validation method was used to measure the accuracy of the prediction. The validation of PCADP using a virtual disease group verified that the technique proposed in this paper shows much greater accuracy compared to existing methods. Moreover, the PCADP prediction method improved the flexibility and real-time attributes, which are the essential elements of any diagnosis technique in the mobile u-health environment, and showed efficiency in the continuous improvement of the monitoring and system of the diagnosis process.

Under this model, all training data is given a priori and training is performed in one batch. If more training data is later obtained the classifier must be re-trained from scratch. Re-solving the problem from scratch seems computationally wasteful. In this research we will focus on developing classifier for big data sets and incremental way of learning for dealing with real world problem. In this paper we propose a feature extraction and classification algorithm for big data which is based on incremental kernel PCA and conjugate gradient based LS-SVM. Through experimental results on big data in UCI machine learning repository we can show that proposed classification algorithm enables solving large scale classification problems.

A Novel Algorithm for Hub Protein Identification in Prokaryotic Proteome Using Di-Peptide Composition and Hydrophobicity Ratio	ECO-FRIENDLY COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS	Communications in Computer and Information Science		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Eco-friendly Computing and Communication systems (ICECCS)	AUG 09-11, 2012	Kochi, INDIA	Rajagiri Sch Engn & Technol, Comp Soc India, Cochin Chapter		Hub proteins; Protein- protein interaction networks; machine learning; Feature vectors	SEQUENCES; NETWORKS	It is widely hypothesized that the information for determining protein hubness is found in their amino acid sequence patterns and features. This has moved us to retook at this problem. In this study, we propose a novel algorithm for identifying hub proteins which relies on the use of dipeptide compositional information and hydrophobicity ratio. In order to discern the most potential and protuberant features, two feature selection techniques. CFS (Correlation-based Feature Selection) and ReliefF algorithms were applied, which are widely used in data preprocessing for machine learning problems. Overall accuracy and time taken for processing the models were compared using a neural network classifier RBF Network and an ensemble classifier Bagging. Our proposed models led to successful prediction of hub proteins from amino acid sequence information with 92.94% and 92.10 % accuracy for RBF network and bagging respectively in case of CFS algorithm and 94.15 % and 90.89 % accuracy for RBF network and bagging respectively in case of ReliefF algorithm.

The retrieval of information is based on features of image like colour, shape, texture, annotation etc. Many of the existing methods focus on the feature extraction and to bridge up the gap between low level features and high level semantics. In this paper we propose a supervised machine learning (SML) using artificial neural network (ANN) and singular value decomposition (SVD) for image retrieval. Specifically we use back propagation algorithm (multilayer perceptron) (MLP) for training and testing our proposed model. Experimental results show that by changing parameters of feature vector back propagation method can have 62% precision instead of 49% as claimed by in Hyoung Ku LEE, Suk In Yoo [1].

For fast transmission, compression of image data is necessary. Due to this images are lead to distortion like blocking, ringing and blurring. The channel noise also gets introduced if transmitted over communication channel. Due to the distortion, image quality assessment plays an important role. In majority applications, original image is not available for reference. In such application, the metric which evaluates quality without reference is called "no reference quality" metric. Since human perception has limitation and in automated quality assessment application there is an immense need of developing no reference quality assessment framework. In this paper, we propose no reference image quality assessment scheme using the machine learning approach. Based on the degradation such as blocking, ringing artifacts, the related features such as average absolute difference between in-block image sample and zero-crossing rate, spatial frequency measure and spatial activity measures are computed for JPEG gray scale images. The earlier related work uses such parameters and mathematical predictors. Many time the correlation of extracted features, DMOS and output of predictor do not present correct assessment. In the proposed approach, properly trained back propagation artificial neural network with MOS as target is used. The result indicates that accuracy of quality assessment is better.	[Bagade, J.

A Weighted Particle Swarm Optimization Technique for Optimizing Association Rules	GLOBAL TRENDS IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, PT 2	Communications in Computer and Information Science		English	Proceedings Paper	4th ObCom International Conference on Recent Trends in Computing, Communication and Information Technology	DEC 09-11, 2011	Vellore, INDIA	Vellore Inst Technol Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn		Association Rule Mining; Utility based Temporal Association rule mining; Particle Swam Optimization		The Process of finding out correlations among the data items in the databases forms the core concept in Association Rule Mining. The Association rule Mining algorithms helps in decision making process. Since it plays a vital role in this area, the rules generated by the algorithms should be of less in number and precise. Association rule algorithms, such as Apriori, scrutinize a long list of transactions in order to decide which items are most commonly purchased together. The challenge of digging out association patterns from data draws upon research in databases, machine learning and optimization to bring advanced intelligent solutions. But even though it provides some robustness, the rules generated from the algorithm may be redundant in some cases. So in order to overcome the problems we need to optimize the rules generated from these algorithms. Here we consider the Utility based Temporal Association Rule Mining method for generating the association rules and the Particle Swam Optimization algorithm is used to optimize the generated rules. The main processes in this proposed approach are calculation of the support and confidence from the input data, the Rule generation, Initialization, updation of the velocity, position of the rules and evaluation of fitness function. This paper attempts to use the PSO technique to optimize the utility based temporal rules by filtering out the redundant rules and thereby reducing the problem space.

The rules are extracted automatically by analyzing programming code from completed ERP systems upgrade projects. Later those rules are verified and tuned by experienced programmer. The rules that we are extracting are described in the language equivalent to the first-order logic (i.e. expressivity of Turing machine). Nevertheless, we put a. constrain on the rules description language by defining how knowledge base is used to define these rules. We require that ERP system code and ER,P upgrade knowledge base must be transformed to a series of aligned strings without lost of expressivity. Such strong requirement ensures that we are able to use existing machine learning algorithms in the process of software development and upgrade. These series of strings are compared by strings manipulation algorithms and then differences are resolved by merge algorithm presented in this paper. We used Microsoft Dynamics NAV as an example to test usefulness of presented method but other systems can be used as well if they can be presented as series of code strings.

It has been applied to machine learning, knowledge discovery, and data mining. The theory of matroids is a generalization of linear independence in vector spaces. It has been used in combinatorial optimization and algorithm design. In order to take advantages of both rough sets and matroids, in this paper we propose a matroidal structure of rough sets based on a serial and transitive relation on a universe. We define the family of all minimal neighborhoods of a relation on a universe and prove it satisfies the circuit axioms of matroids when the relation is serial and transitive. In order to further study this matroidal structure, we investigate the inverse of this construction: inducing a relation by a matroid. The relationships between the upper approximation operators of rough sets based on relations and the closure operators of matroids in the above two constructions are studied. Moreover, we investigate the connections between the above two constructions.

From the beginning, any Civil Infrastructure project is systematically divided into smaller subprojects in order to reduce or isolate the overall complexity. However, as a parallel design work, these subdesigns may experience divergences which often lead to design conflicts when they are merged back to the global design. If a high-quality design is desired, these conflicts need to be detected and solved. We present a Multi-agent system able to manage these design conflicts by detecting them, by assisting the engineers in the negotiation of solutions, and finally by learning how to solve future similar problems. The advantage of the system is that what is learned is not one individual's knowledge but the project's global distributed cognition.

Applying Multi-objective Optimization for Variable Selection to Analyze User Trust in Electronic Banking	MANAGEMENT INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS	Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Symposium on Management Intelligent Systems	JUL 11-13, 2012	Salamanca, SPAIN	Univ Granada, Soft Comp & Intelligent Informat Syst Res Grp, Univ Salamanca, Bioinformat Intelligent Syst & Educ Technol Res Grp			SATISFACTION	The potential fraud problems, international economic crisis and the crisis of confidence in markets have affected financial institutions, which have tried to maintain customer trust in many different ways. To maintain the trust level in financial institutions, the implementation of electronic banking for customers has been considered a successful strategy. However, the parameters that define user trust have not been analysed in detail due to the lack of experience and the recent use of e-banking. This paper aims to determine which variables are relevant to user trust by applying machine learning techniques as multi-objective genetic algorithms for the preparation of business strategies to improve confidence and profitability. The algorithms have been tuned following the indications given by experts and their results have been validated by them, setting a level of reliability. There is also a comparison among different fitness functions used in the evolution process that are able to rank the subset of variables encoded by the individuals.

In particular, the approach is detailed and applied on liver segmentation. It consists of three main components. First, an image texture analysis is done to derive pixel level features. It efficiently fuses the statistical features with structural features to achieve better segmentation. Then, a trained classifier based on support vector machine (SVM) is applied to classify the image into liver pixels or non-liver pixels. Finally, composite morphological operations are used to remove small wrongly classified areas and delineate the liver region. The approach is unique in two aspects: it states and provides experimental data to demonstrate that the fusion of the two classes of features does improve segmentation rate, comparing to the cases where only statistical features or structural features are used; it shows that an accurate segmentation can be achieved by combing regional morphological operations with pixel-wised SVM classifier. The algorithm can be applied to general non-rigid object segmentation which is a crucial part of an automatic surgical training and planning system.

Existing techniques that describe the quality of the encoded signal or controlled studies to measure opinion scores do not translate directly into user experience at scale. Recent work shows that measurable performance metrics such as buffering, startup time, bitrate, and number of bitrate switches impact user experience. However, converting these observations into a quantitative quality-of-experience metric turns out to be challenging since these metrics are interrelated in complex and sometimes counter-intuitive ways, and their relationship to user experience can be unpredictable. To further complicate things, many confounding factors are introduced by the nature of the content itself (e. g., user interest, genre). We believe that the issue of interdependency can be addressed by casting this as a machine learning problem to build a suitable predictive model from empirical observations. We also show that setting up the problem based on domain-specific and measurement-driven insights can minimize the impact of the various confounding factors to improve the prediction performance.

Typically, demonstrating such claims about social interaction would be approached through the lens of sentiment analysis. In this work, we argue instead for a multifaceted view of emotional state, which incorporates both a static view of emotion (sentiment) with a dynamic view based on the behaviors present in a text. We codify this dynamic view through data annotations marking information sharing, sentiment, and coping efficacy. Through machine learning analysis of these annotations, we demonstrate that while sentiment predicts a user's stress at the beginning of a chat, dynamic views of efficacy are stronger indicators of stress reduction.

Problems related to complexity, heterogeneity, and semantics of healthcare data are often out of the main focus. Healthcare is particularly rich in background knowledge. Surprisingly, few ML methods used in healthcare can handle these sources of background knowledge, and instead treat healthcare data as a set of numbers without particular meaning. This paper explores an approach that can fill in this gap. A medical ontology (i.e., UMLS) is proposed to provide background knowledge for the ML method to "understand" healthcare data. The ontology-guided ML-based rule induction method is described and illustrated to analyze the clinical data supplemented with an ontology-based background knowledge.

Strictly formatted medical reports offer high human readability and facilitate further data processing, such as querying, statistical analysis, and reasoning to support decision making. However, many medical reports, such as pathology reports, nursing notes and physician's notes, are written in free-text narration. Manually extracting free text reports by filling predefined data fields is cumbersome and error-prone. Meanwhile, information extraction tools try to automate such process, for example, through machine learning based methods. Such methods often require large volumes of training datasets annotated manually by humans, which is expensive to obtain. Furthermore, they are also limited by their accuracy (both precision and recall). To facilitate the process of extracting information from narrative medical reports and transforming extracted data into standardized structured forms, we present in this paper a semiautomatic system, ASLForm, that interacts with users, analyzes free text input and generates normalized answers to populate forms in real-time. This system learns from users' feedback transparently and establishes decision models incrementally. It requires no additional configurations and training datasets. ASLForm is not constrained to any domain, and is adaptable to free text input in any format. These features of the system offer high usability and portability. Its design also enables easy integration with existing reporting systems.

To make the most of the rich resources, it is crucial to precisely locate the information pertinent to users' interests. One of the obstacles in finding information in natural language text is negations, which deny or reverse the meaning of a sentence. This is especially problematic in the biomedical domain since scientific findings and clinical records often contain negated expressions to state negative effects or the absence of symptoms. Ignoring such negated expressions result in more irrelevant information and may even lead to false conclusions. Therefore, identifying negative words and their scopes are important sub-tasks in biomedical information processing. This paper reports on our ongoing work on a hybrid approach to negation identification combining statistical and heuristic approaches. Our approach is evaluated on three types of biomedical documents in comparison with an existing machine learning approach. In addition, the empirical results are manually analyzed to better understand the nature of the problems.

Both perfect and nearly perfect binding of miRNAs through base complementary could cause translation inhibition. Identification of miRNAs in organisms has mostly been focused on precursors of miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). These pre-miRNAs are found only in non-coding regions. However, pseudo pre-miRNAs, which are RNA sequences in the coding region, can be folded as hairpin structures. The classification of real and pseudo miRNAs is more complicated for plants, when compared to animals, due to their wider diversity. This study aims to extract the features of pre-miRNAs for classifying real and pseudo pre-miRNAs in plants and compare classification performance of five different machine learning approaches. Stochastic-based Random Forest and Naive Bayes Classifier showed the best classification performance with over 90% accuracy using 10-fold cross-validation and over 85% accuracy using cross-dataset validation.

To analyze GWAS data that often contains 0.5 to 1 million Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped from thousands of individuals, stringent statistical significant thresholds are pre-defined for multiple testing adjustment, e. g., with p-value < 10(-8) for single SNP detection and at least < 10(-12) for SNP-SNP interaction detection. Such stringent thresholds were used for efficiency computation but it hinders the discovery of many true genetic variants and more practical approaches are needed to conduct GWAS. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to identify groups of predictive SNPs in GWAS analysis. Our method differs from other methods by first translates the genomics knowledge into SNP grouping as priors, then select a list of most predictive SNP groups using linear regression regularized by group sparse constraints, solved by Group-lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator). The selected SNPs groups compose a sparse feature space which yields a higher predictive power for continuous trait prediction. We conduct experiment on SiMES (Singapore Malay Eye Study) data set, with 3280 Malay individuals genotyped on Illumina 610 quad arrays. We investigate one discrete trait (Glaucoma) and two glaucoma-related quantitative traits, optic Disc-Cup-Ratio (CDR) and Intraocular Pressure (IOP). The hypothesis is that, with more biological knowledge embedded, a learning mechanism yields higher predictive power. Our preliminary results support the above hypothesis. Further analysis reveals that our approach can identify groups of SNPs highly associated with a particular genetic trait, in spite of the small sample size and the incomplete biological knowledge.

Link prediction plays a central role in the network area. Supervised learning is an important class of algorithms used to address the link prediction problem. A big challenge in solving link prediction tasks is deciding how to choose relevant features. As an important machine learning technique to select relevant features, feature selection not only enhances classification accuracy, but also improves the efficiency of the training process. Thus, it is especially relevant for link prediction. However, to the best of our knowledge, feature selection under the link prediction scenario remains unstudied. In this paper, we propose FEature Selection for Link Prediction (FESLP), which contains a feature ranking algorithm and a feature weighting algorithm to address link prediction tasks. We measure the discriminative ability of each individual feature and select those features with greatest discriminative power. Simultaneously, we aim to minimize the correlations among features such that redundancy in the learned feature space is as small as possible. Thus, the feature space can accurately preserve the sketch of the original data. Feature weighting and feature ranking problems can be formalized as two quadratic optimization problems. The active set method is used to solve the feature weighting problem (via real number programming) while a greedy policy is applied to solve the feature ranking problem (via integer programming). In experiments, We evaluate FESLP on six large-scale email network datasets from a university. The results show the effectiveness of the FESLP.

WORKSHOP ON INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE			English	Proceedings Paper	5th ACM Ph.D. Workshop in Information and Knowledge (PIKM) Co-located with 21st ACM International Conference Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM)	NOV 02, 2012	Maui, HI	Assoc Comp Machinery Special Interest Grp Informat Retrieval (ACM SIGIR), Assoc Comp Machinery SIGWEB (ACM SIGWEB)		Scene understanding; Statistical learning; Video streams		Activity mining in traffic scenes aims to automatically explain the complex interactions among moving objects recorded with a surveillance camera. Traditional machine learning algorithms generate a model and validate it with manually labeled data, which is a time-consuming and expensive task. The common issue is that these models often get outdated when external variables take place during posterior recording such as dynamic background, illumination, and different weather conditions. Those changes practically impose a new domain that often makes the original model inaccurate for clustering and classification tasks. If we directly apply a statistical model trained in one domain to other over the same stream, the performance of the algorithm will notably decrease due to distinct activity representations and different marginal and conditional distributions. We approach this problem in two stages: 1) we present mature results on a hierarchical Bayesian model designed to represent every video scene as a multinomial distribution over topics. 2) we present early stage evidence of an algorithm to transfer knowledge across two instances of the hierarchical model described in the previous stage. A concrete example of this first stage consists of a simple (but efficient) algorithm to incrementally generate association rules to explain current traffic scenes as co-occurrence relationships between topics. This approach is especially useful when we do not have any labels in a target domain, but have some labeled information (which frames contain dangerous scenes?) in a source domain, by far the most frequent case in real surveillance systems. This algorithm clusters domain-dependent activities in the latent space and bridge them across domains via domain-independent activities. Our experiments show that our method is able to successfully compete with SVM to perform generalization when the temporal gap between source and target domain is large.

Social media platforms play an important role in shaping political discourse in the US and around the world. The truthy.indiana.edu infrastructure [6] allows us to mine and visualize a large stream of social media data related to political themes [5]. The analyses in this keynote address polarization and cross-ideological communication, and partisan asymmetries in the online political activities of social media users [3]. Machine learning efforts can successfully leverage the structure of meme diffusion networks to detect orchestrated astroturf attacks that simulate grassroots campaigns [7, 4], and to predict the political affiliation of active users [1]. The retweet network segregates individuals into two distinct, homogenous communities of left- and right-leaning users. The mention network does not exhibit this kind of segregation, instead forming a communication bridge across which information flows between these two partisan communities. We propose a mechanism of action to explain these divergent topologies and provide statistical evidence in support of this hypothesis [2]. Related to political communication are questions about the birth of online social movements. Social media data provides an opportunity to look for signatures that capture these seminal events. Finally, I will introduce a model of the competition for attention in social media [8]. A dynamic of information diffusion emerges from this process, where a few ideas go viral while most do not. I will show that the relative popularity of different topics, the diversity of information to which we are exposed, and the fading of our collective interests for specific memes, can all be explained as deriving from a combination between the competition for limited attention and the structure of social networks. Surprisingly, one can reproduce the massive heterogeneity in the popularity and persistence of ideas without the need to assume different intrinsic values among those ideas.

Environmental infromation including weather information and the bicycle station location is considered, as well as the time of the day and the number of bicycles at each hour at each station. Data mining methods are applied to predict the number of available bicycles at a certain time at a given station, to describe situations of empty and full stations and, to estimate the most common paths and usage patterns. The experiemntal evaluation of the proposed approach on real-world data gives promissing results, with machine learning mehtods achieving significantely lower error on predicting the number of bicycles compared to a baseline method.

Analysts can benefit greatly from Mind Snaps, semantic bookmarks that would allow them to return to a particular point in the analysis and recreate the complete context they had at that time. This paper addresses some basic issues related to creating and maintaining Mind Snaps. One issue is how frequently we need to take a Mind Snap. Our experiment shows that 10 to 30 analyst events offer 85 percent to 95 percent precision in the ability to distinguish analysts working on different tasks. This translates into an interval for taking Mind Snaps that should be between five to 15 minutes. Another important issue the paper addresses is how to separate actions into multiple micro-contexts in an environment where the analyst often concurrently engages in multiple tasks. The key to this issue is the ability to detect the change in contexts, i.e., context switch. We have developed an algorithm for separating context based on user modeling. Our experiment uses this algorithm to demonstrate the feasibility of capturing and disentangling the analytic micro-contexts. In particular, our results show that context switches can be successfully detected using as few as 10 analysis log event (ALE) windows. Better detection is achieved with larger windows. At a widow size of 30 ALE, we achieved a precision of 73 percent and a recall of 70 percent.

Improving efficiency of decision-making practices in a supply chain is a major competitive domain in today's uncertain business environments. The bullwhip effect is an important phenomenon in the supply chain, in which the order variability increases as moving up along the supply chain. This paper proposes a multiagent coordination mechanism utilizing RL method to the supply chain ordering management. Further, the analyses about the efficiency of the method are discussed in detail based on some representative test data. Results show that the RL agent reduces the bullwhip effect efficiently in the stochastic supply chain.

S	Vodencarevic, A			IEEE	Vodencarevic, Asmir			Learning Behavior Models of Hybrid Systems Using Wavelets for Autonomous Jumps Detection	2012 10TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS (INDIN)	IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics INDIN		English	Proceedings Paper	10th IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN)	JUL 25-27, 2012	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE, Beihang Univ			TIME	Today's hybrid technical systems, such as production facilities, evolve rapidly. Therefore the efforts and resources needed to obtain their trustworthy behavior models are significantly increased. This forms the modeling bottleneck, as the model creation mostly relies on the expensive and durable manual modeling. Behavior models are of the greatest importance in monitoring, anomaly detection, and diagnosis applications. To deal with this issue, the novel HyBUTLA algorithm was recently proposed for automated learning of behavior models from process data. Despite being the first hybrid automaton learning algorithm, it does not model the autonomous jumps (abrupt changes in process variables), and it suffers from long runtime due to the use of advanced machine learning methods. In this paper the HyBUTLA algorithm is improved to account for the autonomous jumps by introducing the splitting step based on discrete wavelet transform. This significantly improves the algorithm runtime, since high function approximation accuracy can be reached by using rather simple methods such as multiple linear regression. The benefits that splitting brings are formally proved and demonstrated in a real-world production system.

Yet, predicting network distances remains an open and difficult problem, as the results from a number of comparative and analytical studies have shown. From an application requirements perspective, there is significant room for improvement in achieving prediction accuracies at a satisfactory level. In this paper, we develop and analyze a new, machine learning-based approach to distance prediction that seeks to capture and generalize geographical characteristics between Internet node pairs, instead of relying on direct and ongoing measurements of partial paths. We apply a basic algorithm in machine learning to demonstrate this idea and highlight the potential benefits that this method may offer over other popular methods that exist today.

Estimation of Turbulence Closure Coefficients for Data Centers using Machine Learning Algorithms	2012 13TH IEEE INTERSOCIETY CONFERENCE ON THERMAL AND THERMOMECHANICAL PHENOMENA IN ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS (ITHERM)	InterSociety Conference on Thermal and Thermomechanical Phenomena in Electronic Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	13th IEEE InterSociety Conference on Thermal and Thermomechanical Phenomena in Electronic Systems (ITherm)	MAY 30-JUN 01, 2012	San Diego, CA	IEEE, IEEE Components, Packaging and Mfg Technol Soc (CPMT)		k-epsilon model; turbulence; optimal model constants; data center; artificial neural network; non-linear constrained minimization; CFD		CFD models of data centers often use two equation turbulence models such as the k-epsilon model. These models are based on closure coefficients or turbulence model constants determined from a combination of scaling/dimensional analysis and experimental measurements of flows in simple configurations. The simple configurations used to derive the turbulence model constants are often two dimensional and do not have many of the complex flow characteristics found in engineering flows. Such models perform poorly, especially in flows with large pressure gradients, swirl and strong three dimensionality, as in the case of data centers. This study attempts to use machine learning algorithms to optimize the model constants of the k-epsilon turbulence model for a data center by comparing simulated data with experimentally measured temperature values. For a given set of turbulence constants, we determine the Root Mean Square 'error' in the model, defined as the difference between experimentally measured temperature from a data center test cell and CFD calculations using the k-epsilon model. An artificial neural network (ANN) based method for parameter identification is then used to find the optimal values for turbulence constants such that the error is minimized. The optimum turbulence model constants obtained by our study results in lowering the RMS error by 25% and absolute average error by 35% compared to the error obtained by using standard k-epsilon model constants.

Usually this is done via a commissioning process which is both time consuming and disruptive. In this paper, we describe a machine learning based technique to model rack inlet temperature sensors in a data center as a function of CRAC settings. These models can then be used to automatically estimate thermal correlation indices (TCI) at any particular CRAC settings. We have implemented a prototype of our methodology in a real data center with eight CRACs and several hundred sensors. The temperature sensor models developed have high accuracy (mean RMSE error is 0.2 degrees C). The results are validated using manual commissioning, demonstrating the effectiveness of our techniques in estimating TCI and in determining thermal zones or regions of influence of the CRACs.

Online map-matching based on Hidden Markov model for real-time traffic sensing applications	2012 15TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (ITSC)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems-ITSC		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	SEP 16-19, 2012	Anchorage, AK					In many Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications that crowd-source data from probe vehicles, a crucial step is to accurately map the GPS trajectories to the road network in real time. This process, known as map-matching, often needs to account for noise and sparseness of the data because (1) highly precise GPS traces are rarely available, and (2) dense trajectories are costly for live transmission and storage. We propose an online map-matching algorithm based on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that is robust to noise and sparseness. We focused on two improvements over existing HMM-based algorithms: (1) the use of an optimal localizing strategy, the variable sliding window (VSW) method, that guarantees the online solution quality under uncertain future inputs, and (2) the novel combination of spatial, temporal and topological information using machine learning. We evaluated the accuracy of our algorithm using field test data collected on bus routes covering urban and rural areas. Furthermore, we also investigated the relationships between accuracy and output delays in processing live input streams. In our tests on field test data, VSW outperformed the traditional localizing method in terms of both accuracy and output delay. Our results suggest that it is viable for low-latency applications such as traffic sensing.	[Goh, C. Y.; Dauwels, J.; Mitrovic, N.; Asif, M.

Unsupervised Learning Based Performance Analysis of nu-Support Vector Regression for Speed Prediction of A Large Road Network	2012 15TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (ITSC)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems-ITSC		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	SEP 16-19, 2012	Anchorage, AK				TRAFFIC FLOW PREDICTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MACHINES; VALIDATION; MODELS	Many intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications require accurate prediction of traffic parameters. Previous studies have shown that data driven machine learning methods like support vector regression (SVR) can effectively and accurately perform this task. However, these studies focus on highways, or a few road segments. We propose a robust and scalable method using nu-SVR to tackle the problem of speed prediction of a large heterogenous road network. The traditional performance measures such as mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) provide little insight into spatial and temporal characteristics of prediction methods for a large network. This inadequacy can be a serious hurdle in effective implementation of prediction models for route guidance, congestion avoidance, dynamic traffic assignment and other ITS applications. We propose unsupervised learning techniques by employing k-means clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), and self organizing maps (SOM) to overcome this insufficiency. We establish the effectiveness of the developed methods by evaluation of spatial and temporal characteristics of prediction performance of the proposed variable window nu-SVR method.	[Asif, M.

Real-Time Vehicle Detection Using Parts at Intersections	2012 15TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (ITSC)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems-ITSC		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	SEP 16-19, 2012	Anchorage, AK			Active Safety; Driver Assistance; Real-time Vision; Machine Learning		In this study, we propose a novel, lightweight approach to real-time detection of vehicles using parts at intersections. Intersections feature oncoming, preceding, and cross traffic, which presents challenges for vision-based vehicle detection. Ubiquitous partial occlusions further complicate the vehicle detection task, and occur when vehicles enter and leave the camera's field of view. To confront these issues, we independently detect vehicle parts using strong classifiers trained with active learning. We match part responses using a learned matching classification. The learning process for part configurations leverages user input regarding full vehicle configurations. Part configurations are evaluated using Support Vector Machine classification. We present a comparison of detection results using geometric image features and appearance-based features. The full vehicle detection by parts has been evaluated on real-world data, runs in real time, and shows promise for future work in urban driver assistance.

We propose a motion contour image based HOG-like descriptor, MCHOG, and a machine learning algorithm that reaches the decision at an accuracy of 99 % within the initial step at the curb of smart infrastructure. MCHOG implicitly comprises the body language of gait initiation, especially the body bending and the spread of legs. In a case study at laboratory conditions we present ROC performance data and an evaluation of the span of time necessary for recognition. While MCHOG in special cases indicates detection of the intention before the whole body moves, on average it allows for detection of the movement within 6 frames at a frame rate of 50 Hz and an accuracy of 80 %. Feasibility of the method in a real world intersection scenario is demonstrated.

The majority build either upon the knowledge-based approach, which promises high accuracy but involves labour-intensive coding of extraction rules, or upon the automatically trainable systems approach, which produces highly portable solutions but requires an appropriate learning set. In this paper, we present results of a project that aims to provide a new methodology which combines the knowledge-based and the machine learning approach into a hybrid one in order to compensate for their respective shortcomings and to achieve high IE performance. Firstly, we propose the idea of a multi-dimensional space that guides users in selecting appropriate methods, i.e., different hybrid concepts, depending on the extraction task and the level of available features. Secondly, we provide the concept of one hybrid approach, namely the sequential processing of a knowledge-based approach and a selection of different machine learning methods. Thirdly, we present the evaluation of an implementation of the sequential extraction on a curriculum vitae corpus. Thus, we provide first results for filling the multi-dimensional space for hybrid information extraction.

Following a machine learning paradigm, this paper presents a model which regards TC as a classification task supported by a wrapper approach and combines the utilization of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with a filter. First, a filter is used to weigh the relevance of terms in documents. Then, the top-ranked terms are grouped in several nested sets of relatively small size. These sets are explored by a GA which extracts the subset of terms that best categorize documents. Experimental results on the Reuters-21578 dataset state the effectiveness of the proposed model and its competitiveness with the learning approaches proposed in the TC literature.

The aims of MALA are to cluster the microarray gene expression profiles in order to reduce the amount of data to be analyzed and to classify the microarray experiments. To fulfil this objective MALA uses a machine learning process based methodology, that relies on 1) Discretization, 2) Gene clustering, 3) Feature selection, 4) Formulas computation, 5) Classification. In this paper we describe the methodology, the software design, the different releases and user interfaces of MALA. We also emphasize its strengths: the identification of classification formulas that are able to precisely describe in a compact way the different classes of the microarray experiments. Finally, we show the experimental results obtained on a real microarray data set coming from Alzheimer diseased versus control mice microarray probes, and conclude that MALA is a powerful and reliable software for microarray gene expression analysis.

This restructuring increased the competitiveness of the market, but with it its complexity. The growing complexity and unpredictability of the market's evolution consequently increases the decision making difficulty. Therefore, the intervenient entities are forced to rethink their behaviour and market strategies. Currently, lots of information concerning electricity markets is available. These data, concerning innumerous regards of electricity markets operation, is accessible free of charge, and it is essential for understanding and suitably modelling electricity markets. This paper proposes a tool which is able to handle, store and dynamically update data. The development of the proposed tool is expected to be of great importance to improve the comprehension of electricity markets and the interactions among the involved entities.	[Praca, I.; Sousa, T.

The detection of SPAM over Instant Messaging (SPIM) is essential for the mobile service providers to achieve user satisfaction and efficient network load balancing. However, accurate SPIM detection is challenging at the server side due to large volume of data packets and near-real-time communication of messages. In this setting, we propose a message classification approach to collect valuable insight on SPIM inside LTE cellular telecommunication framework. The contribution of this paper is threefold: First, it identifies the location and scope of the SPIM detection component inside LTE architecture. Second, we compare the detection accuracy, training and testing time of different classification algorithms. Finally, we evaluate the additional delay in messaging for adding such a module inside LTE architecture using an OPNET simulation environment.

This is due to the many new applications that have been taken place in the field of Internet traffic. As conventional port number based and packet payload based methods are no longer adequate, pattern recognition by learning the statistical flow-based features in the training samples to classify the unknown flows has become popular. The applied method should be fast enough to identify the traffic type in real time before the entire flows are finished. This paper proposes a supervised machine learning based method to identify 7 different types of Internet applications. Our proposed system is able to detect the flows application types after observing just a few first packets in each flow in order to run in real time. The overall accuracy of 84.9% was achieved which is a promising result.

ANNEbot uses the concept of Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks (EANNs) to search for the optimum network architecture and connection structure that would best suit a given problem, without having to incorporate prior knowledge of the domain into the learning mechanism. The framework was tested on the Iris classification data set and the Parkinson's disease diagnosis data set, both of which provided results with above 95% accuracy. These results were then compared with the results obtained from applying other machine learning algorithms such as back propagation and support vector machines on these two data sets. The comparison showed that ANNEbot provided a higher degree of accuracy in contrast to the more commonly used machine learning algorithms.	[Perera, D. C.; Mathotaarachchi, M. S.

Accidents such as falling can be a serious problem for the elderly. An accurate automatic fall detection system can help elderly people be safe in every situation. In this paper a waist worn fall detection system has been proposed. A tri-axial accelerometer (ADXL345) was used to capture the movement signals of human body and detect events such as walking and falling to a reasonable degree of accuracy. A set of laboratory-based falls and activities of daily living (ADL) were performed by healthy volunteers with different physical characteristics. This paper presents the comparison of different machine learning classification algorithms using Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) platform for classifying falling patterns from ADL patterns. The aim of this paper is to investigate the performance of different classification algorithms for a set of recorded acceleration data. The algorithms are Multilayer Perceptron, Naive Bayes, Decision tree, Support Vector Machine, ZeroR and OneR. The acceleration data with a total data of 6962 instances and 29 attributes were used to evaluate the performance of the different classification algorithm. Results show that the Multilayer Perceptron algorithm is the best option among other mentioned algorithms, due to its high accuracy in fall detection.

Transient stability is one of key problems of power system stability. In this paper, support vector machines (SVM), a novel type learning method and based on statistical learning theory, is applied to assess the transient stability of power system after faults occur on transmission lines. Reactive and active powers of all generators after fault cleaning and abstract attributes consisted of the inputs of SVM. An effective feature selection technique was used to refine the inputs and increase the accuracy of SVM. As the comparison, we considered three kinds of classifiers, namely ANN, Decision tree and the SVM. Our results showed that the SVM with RBF kernel achieved the highest classification accuracy, followed by the SVC with polynomial kernel on IEEE 16-generator and 50-generator test systems, in transient stability analysis, SVM classifier showed superiority over traditional methods.

In this paper, we proposed a textual entailment system using a statistical approach that integrates syntactic and semantic techniques for Recognizing Inference in Text (RITE) using the NTCIR-9 RITE task and make a comparison between semantic and syntactic features based on their differences. We thoroughly evaluate our approach using subtasks of the NTCIR-9 RITE. As a result, our system achieved 73.28% accuracy on the Chinese Binary-Class (BC) subtask with NTCIR-9 RITE. Thorough experiments with the text fragments provided by the NTCIR-9 RITE task show that the proposed approach can significantly improve system accuracy.

Rankbox: An Adaptive Ranking System for Mining Complex Semantic Relationships Using User Feedback	2012 IEEE 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION REUSE AND INTEGRATION (IRI)			English	Proceedings Paper	13th IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration (IEEE IRI) / DIM / WICSOC / IEEE EM- RITE / IRI-HI	AUG 08-10, 2012	Las Vegas, NV	IEEE Syst Man & Cybernet Soc (IEEE SMC), Soc Informat Reuse & Integrat (SIRI), IEEE				This paper presents Rankbox, an adaptive ranking system for mining complex relationships on the Semantic Web. Our objective is to provide an effective ranking method for complex relationship mining, which can 1) automatically personalize ranking results according to user preferences, 2) be continuously improved to more precisely capture user preferences, and 3) hide as many technical details from end users as possible. We observe that a user's opinions on search results carry important information regarding his interests and search intentions. Based on this observation, our system supports each user to give simple feedback about the current search results, and employs a machine-learning based ranking algorithm to learn the user's preferences from his feedback. A personalized ranking function is then generated and used to sort results of the user's subsequent queries. The user can keep teaching the system his preferences by giving feedback through several iterations until he is satisfied with the search results. Our system is implemented and deployed on a web server that can be easily accessed through web browsers. We evaluate our system on a large RDF knowledge base created from the Freebase linked-open-data. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to the state-of-the-art.

One problem with this algorithm is the choice of k value. Different k values can have a large impact on the predictive accuracy of the algorithm, and picking a good value is generally unintuitive by looking at the data set. Cross-validation over multiple folds is often used to find the best value for k in kNN based on prediction results. In this paper, we propose automatic selection of neighboring instances as defined by a dynamic local region unique to each instance, as opposed to the traditional approach of considering the manually specified k nearest neighbors. Removing the need to select an appropriate k value removes the cross-validation step, which improves the computational performance of the algorithm. Classification accuracy achieved by this approach is only slightly lower than the results of using kNN with an optimally selected k value.

Although studies exist on the sharing of specific types of information (photos, posts, etc.), one area that has been less explored is how Facebook profiles can share personality information in a broad, machine-readable fashion. In this study, we apply data-mining and machine learning techniques to predict users' personality traits (specifically, the traits of the Big Five personality model) using only demographic and text-based attributes extracted from their profiles. We then use these predictions to rank individuals in terms of the five traits, predicting which users will appear in the top or bottom 5% or 10% of these traits. Our results show that when using certain models, we can find the top 10% most Open individuals with nearly 75% accuracy, and across all traits and directions, we can predict the top 10% with at least 34.5% accuracy (exceeding 21.8%, which is the best accuracy when using just the best-performing profile attribute).

Though traditional methods such as feature ranking and subset selection have been widely used, there has been little consideration given to assuring satisfactory performance of a learning machine in relation to the minimum of features required or the "critical dimension". This critical dimension is unique to a specific dataset, learning machine, and ranking algorithm combination. The empirical methods demonstrate that many datasets show the existence of critical dimension. The dependence of this critical dimension on the learning machines and ranking algorithms could provide newer insights in understanding datasets, machine learning classifiers and ranking algorithms. The preliminary results of analysis show that the critical dimension depends largely on the feature ranking algorithm and that learning machines are less significant in determining the critical dimension.

This problem, as defined by the one-class SVM approach, consists in identifying a sphere enclosing all (or the most) of the data. The classical strategy to solve the problem considers a simultaneous estimation of both the center and the radius of the sphere. In this paper, we study the impact of separating the estimation problem. It turns out that simple one-class classification methods can be easily derived, by considering a least-squares formulation. The proposed framework allows us to derive some theoretical results, such as an upper bound on the probability of false detection. The relevance of this work is illustrated on well-known datasets.

Several approaches that have attracted attention as promising ways of detecting such malware include employing various blacklists. However, these conventional approaches often fail to detect new attacks owing to the versatility of malicious websites. Thus, it is difficult to maintain up-to-date blacklists with information regarding new malicious websites. To tackle this problem, we propose a new method for detecting malicious websites using the characteristics of IP addresses. Our approach leverages the empirical observation that IP addresses are more stable than other metrics such as URL and DNS. While the strings that form URLs or domain names are highly variable, IP addresses are less variable, i.e., IPv4 address space is mapped onto 4-bytes strings. We develop a lightweight and scalable detection scheme based on the machine learning technique. The aim of this study is not to provide a single solution that effectively detects web-based malware but to develop a technique that compensates the drawbacks of existing approaches. We validate the effectiveness of our approach by using real IP address data from existing blacklists and real traffic data on a campus network. The results demonstrate that our method can expand the coverage/accuracy of existing blacklists and also detect unknown malicious websites that are not covered by conventional approaches.

SANS has reported the emergence of distributed SSH dictionary attacks, which are very stealthy in comparison with a simple one. Since even one success of such an attack causes serious problems, administrators should implement countermeasures. SSH dictionary attacks have been detected in two basic ways that rely on either log files or network traffic. Both approaches, however, have limitations. The first approach imposes upon administrators heavy maintenance costs, which grow linearly with the number of hosts in networks. The second approach cannot distinguish between successful and unsuccessful attacks. Of more immediate concern, neither approach is effective against stealthy attacks because the login attempts of these attacks have little impact on log files or network traffic. An ideal method would be able to detect individual attacks and distinguish between an attack's success or failure, using information derived from only network traffic. In this paper, we describe such a method, which was developed by combining two novel elements. First, on the basis of our assumptions, we use two criteria: "existence of a connection protocol" and "difference in the inter-arrival time of an auth-packet". These criteria are not available, though, owing to the confidentiality and flexibility of the SSH protocol. Second, we resolve this problem by identifying transition points of a sub-protocol through flow features and machine learning algorithms. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments on real traffic traces collected at the edge in our campus networks. The experimental results are encouraging for this research direction, though they are derived from reduced datasets of SSH dictionary attacks and under simplifying assumptions. The significant contribution is the demonstration that an ideal method for detecting SSH dictionary attacks seems feasible.

However, customers willing to participate in such projects are not always representative to the whole population. Standard random sampling gives some problems because not all results can be scaled. Defining sub-populations or strata to random samples from is theoretically sound, but the definition of sub-populations is quite expensive. The paper presents a customer sampling technique based on quota. The domains for the quota are defined by machine learning algorithms and the quota themselves are based on realistic data. Sampling is done by an optimization algorithm, which eliminates the common 'human error'-factor in quota sampling. The approach is a cost efficient and convenient way of sampling that is able to balance the representativeness of the electricity consumption patterns for the population against sampling accuracy. The method has been applied and validated on a large customer data set.

Just to name few, computer vision, robotics, biometric identification, control, communication system and forecasting are some of the scientific fields that take advantage of artificial neural networks (ANN) to emulate intelligent behavior. In computer vision the interpretation of 3D motion, 3D transformations and 3D face or object recognition are important tasks. There have been many methodologies to solve them but these methods are time consuming and weak to noise. The advantage of using neural networks for object recognition is the feasibility of a training system to capture the complex class conditional density of patterns. It will be desirable to explore the capabilities of ANN that can directly process three dimensional information. This article discusses the machine learning from the view points of 3D vector-valued neural network and corresponding applications.

Early diagnosis can help patient to receive timely treatment and slow down the deterioration. This paper proposed a hierarchical double layer structure with multi-machine learning algorithms for early stage dementia diagnosis. Fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) and probability neural networks (PNNs) were adopted to give initial diagnosis at based-layer, and then Bayesian networks (BNs) was used to make a final diagnosis at top-layer. Diagnosis results, "proposed treatment" and "no treatment required" can be used to provide self-testing or secondary dementia diagnosis to medical institutions. To demonstrate the reliability of the proposed system, a clinical data provided by the Cheng Kung University Hospital was examined. The accuracy of this system was as high as 83%, which showed that the proposed system was reliable and flexible.

Although the Inductive logic programming-ILP can flexibly express the multi-relation data,the background knowledge and the complex mode involving multi-relationship in process of relational learning and multi-relationship data mining, but the problems of predicate invention and utility are also difficult to solve and remain open problems in knowledge discovery based on first-order logic. The high-order logic knowledge representation can solve the problem effectively. For the higher-order logic knowledge representation formalism-Escher can express all kinds of complex structured data. It not only can provide strong guidance on the search for frequent patterns with its strong typed syntax but also can resolve the problem of the invention of new predicates with its higher-order characteristic. It is fit for knowledge discovery in complex structured data. This paper will investigate the knowledge discovery in complex structured data by employing Escher as knowledge representation formalism. In the case of algorithms, clustering of complex structured data is studied in it and experimental verification of its effectiveness.

We present a new methodology for modeling and predicting such future news events using machine learning and data mining techniques. Our Pundit algorithm generalizes examples of causality pairs to infer a causality predictor. To obtain precisely labeled causality examples, we mine 150 years of news articles and apply semantic natural language modeling techniques to headlines containing certain predefined causality patterns. For generalization, the model uses a vast number of world knowledge ontologies. Empirical evaluation on real news articles shows that our Pundit algorithm performs as well as non-expert humans.

In the context of public health intelligence, we integrated and incorporated some of these methods into an analyst's workflow that proceeds from the data-centric descriptive level of analysis to the model-centric causal level of reasoning. We show several case studies of the proposed analyst's workflow as applied to the US Health Indicators Warehouse (HIW), which is a medium scale, public dataset regarding community health information as collected by the US federal government. In our case studies, we demonstrate a series of visual analytics efforts targeted at the HIW, including visual analysis according to correlation matrices, multivariate outlier analysis, multiple linear regression of Medicare costs, confirmatory factor analysis, and hybrid scatterplot and heatmap visualization for distributions of a group of health indicators. We conclude by sketching a preliminary framework for examining causal dependence hypotheses for future data science research in public health.(1)	[Schryver, Jack; Shankar, Mallikarjun; Xu, Songhua] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA	Schryver, J (reprint author), Oak Ridge Natl Lab, 1 Bethel Valley Rd, Oak Ridge, TN 37831 USA.	schryverjc@ornl.gov; shankarm@ornl.gov; xus1@ornl.gov					Adler NE, 2008, ANNU REV PUBL HEALTH, V29, P235, DOI 10.1146/annurev.publhealth.29.020907.090852; Bailis DS, 2001, SOC SCI MED, V52, P1661, DOI 10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00280-X; Breault JL, 2002, ARTIF INTELL MED, V26, P37, DOI 10.1016/S0933-3657(02)00051-9; Chatterjee S., 1986, STAT SCI, V1, P379, DOI 10.1214/ss/1177013622; CLEVELAND WS, 1988, J AM STAT ASSOC, V83, P596, DOI 10.2307/2289282; Davison AC, 2000, J COMPUT GRAPH STAT, V9, P750, DOI 10.2307/1391091; Friendly M, 2002, AM STAT, V56, P316, DOI 10.1198/000313002533; Guo D., 2005, CARTOGR GEOGR INF SC, V32, P113, DOI DOI 10.1559/15234040053722150; Kline RB, 2011, PRINCIPLES PRACTICE; Koh H.C, 2011, J HEALTHCARE INFORM, V19, P64; Lavrac N, 2005, DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY HANDBOOK, P1107, DOI 10.1007/0-387-25465-X_52; Mulatu MS, 2002, J HEALTH SOC BEHAV, V43, P22, DOI 10.2307/3090243; Pearl J, 2000, CAUSALITY MODELS REA; Rajaram S, 2010, BMC BIOINFORMATICS, V11, DOI 10.1186/1471-2105-11-45; Reshef DN, 2011, SCIENCE, V334, P1518, DOI 10.1126/science.1205438; Rousseeuw PJ, 1999, AM STAT, V53, P382, DOI 10.2307/2686061; ROUSSEEUW PJ, 1990, J AM STAT ASSOC, V85, P633, DOI 10.2307/2289995	17	0	0	ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY	NEW YORK	1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA		978-1-4503-1712-2				2012							1	8				8	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Medical Informatics	Computer Science; Medical Informatics	BDC69	WOS:000312660200001

Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), a sequential labeling algorithm, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), which is based on large margin theory, are two typical machine learning algorithms that have been widely applied to NER tasks, including clinical entity recognition. However, Structural Support Vector Machines (SSVMs), an algorithm that combines the advantages of both CRFs and SVMs, has not been investigated for clinical text processing. In this study, we applied the SSVMs algorithm to the Concept Extraction task of the 2010 i2b2 clinical NLP challenge, which was to recognize entities of medical problems, treatments, and tests from hospital discharge summaries. Using the same training (N = 27,837) and test (N = 45,009) sets in the challenge, our evaluation showed that the SSVMs-based NER system required less training time, while achieved better performance than the CRFs-based system for clinical entity recognition, when same features were used. Our study also demonstrated that rich features such as unsupervised word representations improved the performance of clinical entity recognition. When rich features were integrated with SSVMs, our system achieved a highest F-measure of 85.74% on the test set of 2010 i2b2 NLP challenge, which outperformed the best system reported in the challenge by 0.5%.

Each document d in our collection D is a clinical trial protocol which itself contains a set of eligibility criteria. Given a small set of sample documents D ', |D '| << |D|, a user has initially identified as relevant e. g., via a user query interface, our scoring method automatically suggests eligibility criteria from D by ranking them according to how appropriate they are to the clinical trial protocol currently being designed. We view a document as a mixture of latent topics and our method exploits this by applying a three-step procedure. First, we infer the latent topics in the sample documents using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [ 3]. Next, we use logistic regression models to compute the probability that a given candidate criterion belongs to a particular topic. Lastly, we score each criterion by computing its expected value, the probability-weighted sum of the topic proportions inferred from the set of sample documents. Intuitively, the greater the probability that a candidate criterion belongs to the topics that are dominant in the samples, the higher its expected value or score. Results from our experiments indicate that our proposed method is 8 and 9 times better (resp., for inclusion and exclusion criteria) than randomly choosing from a set of candidates obtained from relevant documents. In user simulation experiments, we were able to automatically construct eligibility criteria that are on the average 75% and 70% (resp., for inclusion and exclusion criteria) similar to the correct eligibility criteria.

The percentage of the US population affected with childhood obesity and adult obesity has been on a constant upward linear trend for past few decades. According to Center for Disease control and prevention 35.7% of US adults are obese and 17% of children aged 2-19 years are obese [9]. Researchers and health care providers in the US and the rest of world studying obesity are interested in factors affecting obesity. One such interesting factor potentially related to development of obesity is type of feeding provided to babies [1]. In this work we describe an electronic health record (EHR) data set of babies with feeding method contained in the narrative portion of the record. We compare five supervised machine learning algorithms for predicting feeding method as a discrete value based on text in the field. We also compare these algorithms in terms of the classification error and prediction probability estimates generated by them.

ON A ZERO-FINDING PROBLEM INVOLVING THE MATRIX EXPONENTIAL	SIAM JOURNAL ON MATRIX ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						matrix exponential; zero-finder; Newton's method; matrix nearness; von Neumann divergence	RANK-ONE MODIFICATION; EIGENPROBLEM; DIVERGENCES	An important step in the solution of a matrix nearness problem that arises in certain machine learning applications is finding the zero of f(alpha) = z(T) exp(log X + azz(T))z-b. The matrix valued exponential and logarithm in f(alpha) arises from the use of the von Neumann matrix divergence tr(X log X - X log Y - X + Y) to measure the nearness between the positive definite matrices X and Y. A key step of an iterative algorithm used to solve the underlying matrix nearness problem requires the zero of f(alpha) to be repeatedly computed. In this paper we propose zero-finding algorithms that gain their advantage by exploiting the special structure of the objective function. We show how to efficiently compute the derivative of f, thereby allowing the use of Newton-type methods. In numerical experiments we establish the advantage of our algorithms.

J	Ercin, O; Coban, R				Ercin, Ozden; Coban, Ramazan			Identification of linear dynamic systems using the artificial bee colony algorithm	TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article						Dynamic modeling; system identification; artificial bee colony algorithm; linear time-invariant system; DC motor speed	EFFICIENT ALGORITHM; ABC ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION	This paper presents an investigation into the development of system identification using the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm. A system identification task can be formulated as an optimization problem where the objective is to obtain a model and a set of parameters that minimize the prediction error between the measured plant outputs and the model outputs. The most common existing system identification approaches, such as the recursive least squares method and autoregressive exogenous method, are substantially analytical and based on a mathematical derivation of the system's model. Evolutionary computation, which seems to be a very promising approach, is an alternative to these methods because a little knowledge about the problem is sufficient in this approach and it can be easily combined with many other techniques from artificial intelligence, control engineering, machine learning, and so on. In tics paper, an evolutionary approach for system identification is considered and attempted to demonstrate how the ABC algorithm, can be applied in system identification tasks. Mathematical models of dynamic systems are obtained using difference equations represented in discrete time and the ABC algorithm is used to estimate the unknown parameters of the systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed linear system identification method has good identification performance. Moreover, this method is applied to the identification of a, direct current motor in order to show the performance of the A BC algorithm. The obtained results show that the identified and actual plant outputs successfully match each other.

Hence it is desirable that learner must, generalize from the given examples, so that it can provide a useful output in new cases; otherwise the number of training instances available in training data must, be sufficient. We can have another case where the data set may contain some instances with multiple missing attributes, these instances need to be deleted; in such case sufficient data samples are required to improve generalization ability of the classifier. The proposed algorithm generates additional training instances and adds it to original training data to improve generalization ability of the decision tree classifiers. The proposed algorithm imputes missing attribute values with domain values and thus generates additional training instances. The proposed method is permutation and combination based multiple imputation method and it is also useful for imputation of missing data. The proposed method demonstrates good generalization ability on decision trees.

Results show that the performance of the signatures did not degrade significantly when they were evaluated on traffic that was captured from different locations and at different times as well as employed against evasion attacks. Our results on the evasion of Skype classifier demonstrate that the performance of the signatures are very promising even if the user tries maliciously to alter the characteristics of Skype traffic to evade the classifier.

In this paper we use three supervised machine learning methods, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and decision trees based J48 and PART, to classify attacker activities aimed at Web systems. The empirical analysis is based on four datasets, each in duration of four to five months, collected by high-interaction honeypots. Malicious Web sessions are characterized with forty three different features (i.e., session attributes) extracted from Web server logs. Our results show that the supervised learning methods can be used to efficiently distinguish attack sessions from vulnerability scan sessions, with very high probability of detection and very low probability of false alarms. Furthermore, we follow the principle of Occam's razor, that is, we seek for the simplest possible model that can successfully classify malicious Web sessions. Our results show that attacks differ from vulnerability scans only in a small number of features (i.e., session attributes). In particular, depending on the data set, classification of malicious activities can be performed using from four to six features without significantly affecting learners' performance compared to when all 43 features are used. Decision tree based methods J48 and PART perform better than SVM across all datasets.

Existing QoS solutions were designed to support only aggregated classes of service and cannot differentiate traffic based on an application's behavioral pattern. In order to improve the performance of eHealth applications for home and mobile users there is a need to develop new traffic identification techniques, which would work at the edge of the network. This paper addresses the above problem by proposing machine learning-based approach for eHealth traffic identification. We investigate different techniques which combine the results from multiple machine learning classifiers and show which combination of techniques is best suited for identifying diverse eHealth traffic. Our approach is validated in a mobile e-health application context and the results prove that multi-classification techniques can be used in practice to provide application-based service differentiation.			mgrajzer@telcordia.com; mkoziuk@telcordia.com; pszczech@telcordia.com; pescape@unina.it					Aceto G., 2010, INFOCOM IEEE C COMP, P1; Cascarano N., 2009, GLOBECOM 2009 IEEE, P1, DOI 10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425469; Chu YC, 2004, IEEE T INF TECHNOL B, V8, P456, DOI 10.1109/TITB.2004.837893; Crotti M, 2007, COMPUT COMMUN REV, V37, P5; Dainotti A, 2012, IEEE NETWORK, V26, P35, DOI 10.1109/MNET.2012.6135854; Dainotti A, 2011, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V6613, P122, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-20305-3_11; Dainotti A, 2009, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V5537, P64, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-01645-5_8; Grajzer M., 2012, ETELEMED 2012, P151; Hall M, 2009, ACM SIGKDD EXPLORATI, V11, P10, DOI DOI 10.1145/1656274.1656278; Karagiannis T, 2005, COMPUT COMMUN REV, V35, P229, DOI 10.1145/1090191.1080119; Kohavi R, 1997, ARTIF INTELL, V97, P273, DOI 10.1016/S0004-3702(97)00043-X; Koutsakis P., 2008, 2008 IEEE SARN S; Labovitz C., ATLAS INTERNET OBSER; Nguyen TTT, 2008, IEEE COMMUN SURV TUT, V10, P56, DOI 10.1109/SURV.2008.080406; Vouyioukas D, 2007, SIMUL-T SOC MOD SIM, V83, P329, DOI 10.1177/0037549707083113	15	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1095-2055	978-1-4673-1544-9	IEEE IC COMP COM NET			2012												6	Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Computer Science; Engineering	BDA91	WOS:000312390900089

Grey-box Approach for Performance Prediction in Map-Reduce based Platforms	2012 21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS (ICCCN)	IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks		English	Proceedings Paper	21st International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)	JUL 30-AUG 02, 2012	Munich, GERMANY	IEEE, IEEE Commun Soc, U S Natl Sci Fdn (NSF), City Mayor Munich				Map-Reduce has become an important paradigm for data-intensive computations. The ability to estimate Map-reduce application performance is critical for efficient resource scheduling and provisioning both on dedicated clusters and on the cloud. Current state-of-the-art techniques for performance prediction of Map-Reduce applications use analytical and simulation-based models. In this paper, we make the case for performance prediction using regression techniques based on machine-learning. Through modeling the Map-Reduce environment as a grey-box, we can leverage a combination of externally observed system features and information about sub-system internals. We identify four learning techniques with high prediction accuracy through a detailed comparative study of twenty methods. The powerful capabilities of data analytics platforms are usually accompanied by frequent faults that occur due to scale, complexity and the use of commercial off-the-shelf components. We show that our proposed approach can effectively predict degraded performance under these faulty conditions by the inclusion of additional fault-related input features. A mean prediction error of < 12% was achieved across the range of parameters studied on a 64-node Xen virtualized environment running an open-source Map-Reduce implementation, Hadoop.

This short paper briefly explains our ongoing work on customer churn prediction for telecom services. We are working on data mining methods to accurately predict customers who will change and turn to another provider for the same or similar service. Sample dataset we use for our experiments has been compiled by Orange Telecom from real data. They posted the sample dataset for 2009 Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Competition. IBM has scored the highest on this dataset requiring significant amount of computational resources. We are aiming to find alternative methods that can match or improve the recorded highest score with more efficient use of resources. Dataset has very large number of features, examples and incomplete values. As the first step, we employ some methods to preprocess the dataset for its imperfections. Then, we compare and contrast various ensemble and single classifiers. We conclude the paper with future directions for the study.

However, most of these inspection stations need to be tuned manually and only perform well on a specific product. This research integrates machine learning techniques in the process to automate the initial tuning of real-time vision-based inspection systems for bakery products. The combination of feature selection techniques with machine learning is assessed in terms of classification performance. A formal automated tuning methodology is introduced and evaluated experimentally with data from industrial inspection stations. The work demonstrates that an inspection system automatically tuned with the proposed technique can systematically achieve 98% correct classification when compared with the classification generated with a manually tuned system.

As the complexity of the demanded tasks being increased, the single techniques proved insufficient. This gave rise to intelligent systems that are hybrids of several machine learning techniques to solve the most challenging problems. In this paper we propose a hybrid multiple classifier approach for recognizing usual and unusual drilling events. We suggest using two different information sources namely: (1) real time data collected by sensors located around the drilling rig, and (2) daily morning reports written by drilling personnel to describe the drilling process. Text mining techniques were used to analysis the daily morning reports and to extract textual features that include keywords and phrases, whereas data mining techniques were used to analysis the sensors data and extracting statistical features. Three base classifiers were trained and combined in one ensemble to obtain better predictive performance. Experimental evaluation with real data and reports shows that the ensemble outperforms the base classifiers in every experiment, and the average classification accuracy is about 90% for usual events, and about 75% for unusual events.

This paper proposes to explore such novel approaches as inspired by multi-agent system (MAS) researches that conduct systematic investigation of interaction between autonomous entities. Within the MAS framework, a hierarchical WMSN architecture is established and swarm intelligence is introduced to facilitate its formation. Contract net protocol is employed to achieve efficient resource allocation among the sensor nodes for the purpose of intruding target classification. To make the best global decision, the mechanism of committee voting is exploited to combine all the individual decisions. The supervised machine learning techniques of Gaussian process classifier is presented for investigating the performance of the proposed hierarchical WMSN architecture. Simulation experiments with real-world data have been extensively performed to evaluate the proposed architecture, resource allocation and decision fusion mechanisms, and the results show that the proposed MAS approaches are effective and efficient.

The hostile forces outside of country and criminal elements are using the Internet to engage in illegal activities that endanger national security. So how to recognize this information to find the corresponding website and to carry on the effective supervision has become an urgent problem. For these reasons, this paper designs a new web information extraction system, which calls the extraction rule corresponding to the template by calculating the structural similarity among pages. In addition, a new method based on STU-DOM tree to construct decision tree is proposed. This method can use the classification of decision tree to determine sensitive information node.

Bayesian networks are increasingly finding application in areas such as computational and systems biology, and more recently in epidemiological analyses. The key distinction between standard empirical modeling approaches, such as generalised linear modeling, and Bayesian network analyses is that the latter attempts not only to identify statistically associated variables, but to additionally, and empirically, separate these into those directly and indirectly dependent with one or more outcome variables. Such discrimination is vastly more ambitious but has the potential to reveal far more about key features of complex disease systems. Applying Bayesian network modeling to biological and medical data has considerable computational demands, combined with the need to ensure robust model selection given the vast model space of possible DAGs. These challenges require the use of approximation techniques, such as the Laplace approximation, Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation and parametric bootstrapping, along with computational parallelization. A case study in structure discovery - identification of an optimal DAG for given data - is presented which uses additive Bayesian networks to explore veterinary disease data of industrial and medical relevance.

In this paper, neural network technique is proposed for the conditional simulation of non-Gaussian stochastic processes and fields. In machine learning of neural network, interpolation is employed to train finite non-Gaussian samples. As numerical examples, the conditional simulation of non-Gaussian fluctuating wind pressures is carried out through using back propagation neural network and generalized regression neural network respectively.

By this approach, motion detection programs can be automatically evolved instead of manually coded. This study investigates the suitable GP representation for motion detection as well as explores the advantages of this method. Unlike conventional methods, this evolutionary approach can generate programs which are able to mark target motions. The stationary background and the uninteresting or irrelevant motions such as swaying trees, noises are all ignored. Furthermore, programs can be trained to detect target motions from a moving background. They are capable of distinguishing different kinds of motions. Such differentiation can be based on the type of motions as well, for example, fast moving targets are captured, while slow moving targets are ignored. One of the characteristics of this method is that no modification or additional process is required when different types of motions are introduced. Moreover, real-time performance can be achieved by this GP motion detection method.

No longer! In today's abundance of product/service choices. CRM must be an integral part of business to maintain brand loyalty, which is becoming critical for any business to survive. What if you can anticipate what you can do for your customers before they know it, predict what your customers may like or dislike and take steps to address potential problems before your customers switch vendors, or target individual marketing campaign to very specific and appreciative group of customers instead of spamming. How would this improve a business bottom-line and change its operation? This paper discusses an Intelligent Decision Automation platform for such a CRM system of tomorrow. It was built by Amdocs and Franz using semantic technology. machine learning and scalable java middleware. The Semantic platform consists of a number of elements: an Event Collector, a Decision Engine, the AllegroGraph triple store. a Bayesian Belief Network and a Rule Workbench. Combined, this pipeline of technology implements an event-condition-action framework to drive business process in real time.

In this way, the NPC(Non-Player Character) in the game will act in a fixed and expectable way. It has greatly weakened the long-term attraction of single-played game. Extracting the human action patterns using a statistical-based machine learning algorithm can provide an easily-understanding way to implement the agent behavior intelligence. A daemon program records and sample the human player's input action and related properties of character and virtual environment, and then apply certain statistical-based machine learning algorithm on the sample data. As a result, a human-similar intelligent behavior model was obtained. It can be used to help agent making an action decision.

It continues to be one of the top three web threats that mankind has ever known. The botnets are the souped-up cyber engines driving nearly all criminal commerce on the Internet and are seen as relaying millions of pieces of junk e-mail, or spam. Thus, the need of the hour is the early detection and identification of the heart of network packet flooding or the C&C centre. Most of the botmasters perform DDos attacks on a target server by spoofing the source IP address. The existing botnet detection techniques rely on machine learning algorithms and do not expound the IF spoofing issue. These approaches are also found to be unsuccessful in the meticulous identification of the botmasters. Here we propose an architecture that depend on the PSO-based tracebacking. Our architecture also introduces the IP spoofing detector unit so as to ensure that the Traceback moves in the right direction. The approach also detects the zombies and utilizes the PSO optimization technique that aid in the identification of the C&C node. The experimental results show that our approach is successful in prompt detection of the bots.	[Raj, S.

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been successfully used in slope stability problem. However, there are some open issues for above-mentioned methods, which are very hard to overcome. For this reason, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) which has a theoretical framework for obtaining the optimum hyperparameters self-adaptively has been used in slope stability problem. Without complicated mechanics computation process, through learning the empirical knowledge coming from real engineering, the complicated nonlinear mapping relationship between slope stability and its influencing factors was established easily using GPR. The results of test study indicate that the method is feasible, effective and simple to implement for slope stability evaluation. The results are better than previously published paper of ANN and SVM.

In drinking water treatment, TOC is a precursor to disinfection byproducts such as total trihalomethanes (TTHM). With the aid of an early warning system for the detection of TOC concentrations, water treatment operators could make more informed decisions and adjust the treatment processes to minimize the generation of disinfection byproducts. In this paper, a near real-time monitoring system is explored using the Integrated Data Fusion and Machine-learning (IDFM) technique to predict the spatial distribution of TOC in a lake based upon surface reflectance data from satellite imagery. Landsat 5 TM and MODIS Terra satellite imagery can be acquired free of charge, yet MODIS has coarse spatial resolution, while Landsat has a lengthy 16 day revisit time. This difficulty is solved using data fusion algorithms to fuse the fine spatial resolution of Landsat with the daily revisit time of MODIS to generate a synthetic image with both high spatial and temporal resolution. To demonstrate the capabilities of IDFM, this case study uses the fused surface reflectance band data and applied machine-learning techniques to reconstruct the spatiotemporal distribution of TOC in Harsha Lake, which serves as the source water intake for the McEwen Water Treatment Plant in Ohio. The results of this application of IDFM were analyzed using 4 statistical indices, which indicated that the Artificial Neural Network model is capable of reconstructing TOC concentrations throughout the lake.

In particular, previous studies have shown that the unsupervised clustering approach is both accurate and capable of discovering previously unknown application classes. In this paper, we explore the utility of side information in the process of traffic clustering. Specifically, we focus on the flow correlation information that can be efficiently extracted from packet headers and expressed as instance-level constraints, which indicate that particular sets of flows are using the same application and thus should be put into the same cluster. To incorporate the constraints, we propose a modified constrained K-Means algorithm. A variety of real-world traffic traces are used to show that the constraints are widely available. The experimental results indicate that the constrained approach not only improves the quality of the resulted clusters, but also speeds up the convergence of the clustering process.

The new paradigm features an l(1)-regularised least squares loss function, in which the control error variance competes with the sum of input channels magnitude (or slew rate) over the whole horizon length. This cost choice is motivated by the successful development of LASSO theory in signal processing and machine learning. In the latter fields, "sum-of-norms regularisation" have shown a strong capability to provide robust and sparse solutions for system identification and feature selection. In this paper, a discrete-time dual-mode l(asso) MPC is formulated, and its stability is proven by application of standard MPC arguments. The controller is then tested for the problem of ship course keeping and roll reduction with rudder and fins, in a directional stochastic sea. Simulations show the l(asso) MPC to inherit positive features from its corresponding regressor: extreme reduction of decision variables' magnitude, namely, actuators' magnitude (or variations), with a finite energy error, being particularly promising for over-actuated systems.

For example, these gaits can reduce the energy expended and the number and complexity of actuators required for level-ground walking. However, robot walkers employing dynamic gaits are, in general, also notoriously sensitive to terrain variations. In this paper, we focus on new methods for developing improved control strategies for and analyzing resulting stability of a simple yet effective model for biped walking on rough terrain. Our primary contributions are as follows. (1) We quantify the stabilizing value of adding a torso to the standard compass gait model; (2) we optimize a class of simple controllers on this walker to be robust to unsensed changes in upcoming terrain height; and (3) we develop improved numerical tools for estimating the statistics of fall events for rough terrain walking. Our results indicate that the torso walker can handle unanticipated step changes in terrain of approximately 14% of leg length, and that our statistical tools are effective for a 6-dimensional state space system, indicating promise in the challenge of addressing the curse of dimensionality when applying machine learning techniques to rough terrain walking.

We achieve robustness by simultaneously designing one control law for multiple models with potentially different model structures, which represent model uncertainty and unmodeled dynamics. Providing explicit examples of possible unmodeled dynamics during the control design process is easier for the designer and is more effective than providing simulated perturbations to increase robustness, as is currently done in machine learning. Our approach supports the design of deterministic nonlinear and time varying controllers for both deterministic and stochastic nonlinear and time varying systems, including policies with internal state such as observers or other state estimators. We highlight the benefit of control laws made up of collections of simple policies where only one component policy is active at a time. Controller optimization and learning is particularly fast and effective in this situation because derivatives are decoupled.

Traditional spam detection fails to differentiate between user needs and evolving social relationships. Online Social Networks (OSNs) contain more and more social information, contributed by users. OSN information may be used to improve spam detection. This paper presents a method that can use several social networks for detecting spam and a set of metrics for representing OSN data. The paper investigates the impact of using social network data extracted from an E-mail corpus to improve spam detection. The social data model is compared to traditional spam data models by generating and evaluating classifiers from both model types. The results show that accurate spam detectors can be generated from the low-dimensional social data model alone, however, spam detectors generated from combinations of the traditional and social models were more accurate than the detectors generated from either model in isolation.

This paper presents an automatic approach detecting phishing attacks. Our approach combines a personalized whitelisting approach with machine learning techniques. The whitelist is used as filter that blocks phish web pages used to imitate innocuous user behavior. The phishing pages that are not blocked by the whitelist pass are further filtered using a Support Vector Machine classifier designed and optimized to classify these threats. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach improves over the current state-of-the-art methods.

By exploiting this feature, an uncertainty based locational optimisation strategy combining with an entropy based data selection method for mobile sensor networks is presented in this paper. Centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) is used as a locational optimisation framework and Informative Vector Machine (IVM) is applied for data selection.

It involves quality of service, network accounting, Intrusion Detection and so on. Traditional identification approaches, such as those based on port and payload analysis, are no longer applicable in actual networks. In this paper we present a machine-learning approach, independent of port numbers, to accurately classify Internet traffic using decision tree. In our work, we think over not only the accuracy, but also the time cost. We use FCBF to remove redundant features and C4.5 algorithm to build the classification model and guarantee both accuracy and efficiency.

This failure is not corrigible, with the subsequent cost increment. Modelling the foundry process as an expert knowledge cloud allows machine learning algorithms to foresee the value of a certain variable, in this case, the probability that a microshrinkage appears within a foundry casting. However, this approach needs to label every instance to generate the model that will classify the castings. In this paper, we present a new approach for detecting faulty castings through collective classification to reduce the labelling requirements of completely supervised approaches. Collective classification is a type of semi-supervised learning that optimises the classification of partially-labelled data.

Several machine learning methods are used in this regard. Among them, Adaboost is popular for its simplicity and considerable accuracy. In Adaboost, decisions are made based on the weighted majority vote of several weak classifiers. However, such weighted combination may not give expected accuracy due to the lack of proper uncertainty management. In this paper, we propose to adopt the Dempster Shafer theory (DST) of Evidence based solution where mass values are calculated from k-nearest neighboring feature information based on some distance metric, and combined together using DST. Experiments on a renowned dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	[Shoyaib, Mohammad; Ishraque, S. M.

While analysis techniques that involve pattern recognition, signal processing and machine learning are very relevant to this aim, the underlying psychological and sociological aspects of inducing behavioral change cannot be neglected. This paper provides a framework for assessing the impact of social factors for these applications, and discusses the role of social mediation of behaviors and attitudes.

N-Queen problem is solved employing genetic algorithm. Fitness function is one of the most critical parts of a genetic algorithm and its purpose is for parent selection and a measure for convergence. Problems with fitness are premature convergence and slow finishing. In general, a chromosome's value is computed by the order of its genes: any change in the order results in different chromosome's value. Here, a weight is computed to each bit (gene) position to compute the fitness of the string. To improve system performance, a weakest bit in the string is selected for cross over. It reduces the probability of dummy iterations and generation of recessive strings. Experimental results are compared with simple genetic algorithm, and enhanced improved genetic algorithm and adaptive genetic algorithm. Potential application includes search techniques and machine learning.

RELIEF-DISC which was shown to be efficient in estimating features, cannot handle incomplete data for continuous features. In this paper. we propose an extended RELIEF-DISC algorithm by introducing a new approach to deal with the noisy and incomplete data sets. We investigate the performance of the Decision Tree classifier by imputing the missing values in RELIEF-DISC algorithm. The datasets are taken from the UCI ML Repository.	[Blessie, E.

A key component in this strategy is the selection of the rule quality function, since the algorithm aims at creating one rule at a time using an ACO-based procedure to search the best rule. Recently, an improved strategy has been proposed in the c Ant-Miner P B algorithm, where an ACO-based procedure is used to create a complete list of rules instead of individual rules. In the cAnt-Miner(PB) algorithm, the rule quality function has a smaller role and the search is guided by the quality of a list of rules. This paper sets out to determine the effect of different rule and list quality functions in terms of both predictive accuracy and size of the discovered model in c Ant-Miner P B.

The introduced approach considers the ASP as a cost-sensitive classification task which is based on Exploratory Landscape Analysis. Low-level features gathered by systematic sampling of the function on the feasible set are used to predict a well-performing algorithm out of a given portfolio. Example-specific label costs are defined by the expected runtime of each candidate algorithm. We use one-sided support vector regression to solve this learning problem. The approach is illustrated by means of the optimization problems and algorithms of the BBOB'09/10 workshop.

Recently, an evolutionary algorithm based on this formalism, called Evolutionary Reaction Systems, has been presented. This new algorithm proved to have comparable performances to other well-established machine learning methods, like genetic programming, neural networks and support vector machines on both artificial and real-life problems. Even if the results are encouraging, to make Evolutionary Reaction Systems an established evolutionary algorithm, an in depth analysis of the effect of its parameters on the search process is needed, with particular focus on those parameters that are typical of Evolutionary Reaction Systems and do not have a counterpart in traditional evolutionary algorithms. Here we address this problem for the first time. The results we present show that one particular parameter, between the ones tested, has a great influence on the performances of Evolutionary Reaction Systems, and thus its setting deserves practitioners' particular attention: the number of symbols used to represent the reactions that compose the system. Furthermore, this work represents a first step towards the definition of a set of default parameter values for Evolutionary Reaction Systems, that should facilitate their use for beginners or inexpert practitioners.

These techniques involve selecting an individualised boundary threshold in order to reduce implicit bias that may be introduced through employing arbitrarily chosen values. Individuals that can chose their own boundaries and the manner in which they are applied, are freed from having to learn to force their outputs into a particular range or polarity and can instead concentrate their efforts on seeking a problem solution. Our investigation suggests that while a particular boundary selection method may deliver better performance for a given problem, no single method performs best on all problems studied. We propose a new flexible combined technique which gives near optimal performance across each of the tasks undertaken. This method together with seven other techniques is tested on six benchmark binary classification data sets. Experimental results obtained suggest that the strategy can improve test fitness, produce smaller less complex individuals and reduce run times. Our approach is shown to deliver superior results when benchmarked against a standard GP system, and is very competitive when compared with a range of other machine learning algorithms.

While the first two operators work on the independent rules to reduce the number of expressed attributes, the last one changes the order of the rules (based on the similarities between them) to identify and delete the unnecessary ones. These operators were tested using the BioHEL system over 35 different problems. Our results show that it is possible to reduce the number of specified attributes per rule and the number rules up to 30% in some problems, without producing significant changes in the test accuracy. Moreover, the approaches presented in this paper can be easily extended to other learning paradigms and representations.

We first evolve a pool of simple classifiers with NSGA-II using values of the ROC curves as the optimization objectives. These simple classifiers are then combined at the decision level using the Iterative Boolean Combination method (IBC). This method produces multiple ensembles of classifiers optimized for various operating conditions. We perform a rigorous series of experiments to demonstrate the properties and behaviour of this approach. This allows us to propose interesting venues for future research on optimizing ensembles of classifiers using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms.

Guided Evolution in XCSF	PROCEEDINGS OF THE FOURTEENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GENETIC AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	14th International Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO)	JUL 07-11, 2012	Philadelphia, PA	SIGEVO ACM Special Interest Grp Genet & Evolutionary Computat		High-Dimensional; Function Approximation; Learning Classifier Systems; XCSF; Guided Evolution		High-dimensional problems are challenging for iterative, online (Michigan-style) Learning Classifier Systems, especially because of the large size of the evolutionary search space. The present work proposes to guide mutation toward most suitable classifier condition structures. Focusing on XCSF, we introduce a guided mutation operator: Each classifier stores a finite set of matched samples. Mutation uses those samples to optimize classifier condition shapes by means of an accuracy-weighted covariance matrix. While this approach does not necessarily produce an optimal shape, it is sufficient to discriminate relevant from irrelevant dimensions. Regular evolutionary operators handle the fine tuning. We show that guided XCSF does not only drastically speed up learning, but it also solves higher-dimensional problems than regular XCSF. Experiments illustrate that guided XCSF quickly detects the intrinsic structure of nonlinear, oblique, fully sampled, ten-dimensional approximation tasks. The results show that guided XCSF strongly outperforms regular XCSF as well as a statistics-based machine learning approach, the so called Locally Weighted Projection Regression algorithm.

To properly and efficiently decode brain signals into computer commands the application of machine-learning techniques is required. Evolutionary algorithms have been increasingly applied in different steps of BCI implementations. In this paper we introduce the use of the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) for BCI systems based on motor imagery. The optimization algorithm is used to evolve linear classifiers able to outperform other traditional classifiers. We also analyze the role of modeling variables interactions for additional insight in the understanding of the BCI paradigms.

A Hyper-Heuristic Evolutionary Algorithm for Automatically Designing Decision-Tree Algorithms	PROCEEDINGS OF THE FOURTEENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GENETIC AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	14th International Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO)	JUL 07-11, 2012	Philadelphia, PA	SIGEVO ACM Special Interest Grp Genet & Evolutionary Computat		Decision trees; hyper-heuristics; evolutionary algorithms	CLASSIFICATION TREES; SELECTION; DISCRETIZATION; INDUCTION	Decision tree induction is one of the most employed methods to extract knowledge from data, since the representation of knowledge is very intuitive and easily understandable by humans. The most successful strategy for inducing decision trees, the greedy top-down approach, has been continuously improved by researchers over the years. This work, following recent breakthroughs in the automatic design of machine learning algorithms, proposes a hyper-heuristic evolutionary algorithm for automatically generating decision-tree induction algorithms, named HEAD-DT. We perform extensive experiments in 20 public data sets to assess the performance of HEAD-DT, and we compare it to the traditional decision-tree algorithms C4.5 and CART. Results show that HEAD-DT can generate algorithms that significantly outperform C4.5 and CART regarding predictive accuracy and F-Measure.	[Barros, Rodrigo C.; de Carvalho, Andre C. P. L.

Recently, the engineers concentrated on variant concepts of artificial intelligence such as machine learning, simulation, fuzzy logic, game theory, and evolutionary computing to deal with complicated barriers and obstacles. Artificial intelligence and expert system techniques play an important role for surveying and controlling mechanical systems such as power plants and reservoirs. This is because of their interdisciplinary applications and versatile servicing potential in mathematical modeling of industrial systems. In this article, a new method called synchronous parallel shuffling self-organized Pareto strategy algorithm is presented which synthesizes different artificial techniques, nominally evolutionary computing, swarm intelligence techniques, and time adaptive self-organizing map that apply simultaneously incorporating with a stochastic data sharing behavior. Thereafter, it is applied to verify the optimum operating parameter of Damavand power plant as the biggest constructed power plant in Middle East with the potential of producing about 2300MW electricity sited in Tehran, capital of Iran, as a multi-objective, multi-modal complex problem. It is also proved that implementing the governing equations of power plant leads to a multi-objective problem where some of these objectives are non-linear, non-convex, and multi-modal with different type of real-life engineering constraints. The results confirm the acceptable performance of proposed technique in optimizing the operating parameters of Damavand power plant.

Gene Expression Profiles for Predicting Metastasis in Breast Cancer: A Cross-Study Comparison of Classification Methods	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article							MICROARRAY CLASSIFICATION; PROGNOSTIC SIGNATURE; DISTANT METASTASIS; VALIDATION; SURVIVAL; WOMEN	Machine learning has increasingly been used with microarray gene expression data and for the development of classifiers using a variety of methods. However, method comparisons in cross-study datasets are very scarce. This study compares the performance of seven classification methods and the effect of voting for predicting metastasis outcome in breast cancer patients, in three situations: within the same dataset or across datasets on similar or dissimilar microarray platforms. Combining classification results from seven classifiers into one voting decision performed significantly better during internal validation as well as external validation in similar microarray platforms than the underlying classification methods. When validating between different microarray platforms, random forest, another voting-based method, proved to be the best performing method. We conclude that voting based classifiers provided an advantage with respect to classifying metastasis outcome in breast cancer patients.

To learn effectively from dynamic data evolving over time, it is required to detect the drift of the concept of data. We present a method to detect it by utilizing the correlation information of value distribution and apply our method to a learning task on a multi-stream data model. The result of experiments on a synthetic data set shows that our approach could provide a reasonable threshold to detect the change between windowed batches of stream data.

As usual, simplicity and high performance are two sides of a same coin. Our aim is to explore an easy-to-use classifier without losing its effectiveness. On this account, a single attribute based classification (SAC) algorithm is proposed. SAC first splits the original data set into multi one-dimensional data sets. After that, it creates a base classifier, e.g. C4.5, for each one-dimensional data, and then selects all classifiers having the highest accuracy. At last, SAC uses these selected classifiers to make prediction and the most frequent label is assigned to the new instance. Results of classification accuracy on 16 data sets from UCI machine learning repository indicate that the proposed method performs better in comparison with classical OneR algorithm. Experiments on high-dimensional data are also conducted to evaluate the proposed method, which demonstrates its scalability.

One of the major security flaws experienced by WSNs is denial of service (DoS) which can even lead to the breakdown of the complete system or to wrong decisions being made by the system that can cause adverse results. This research work focuses on two techniques for detecting a DoS attack at a medium access control (MAC) layer. Our research compares and evaluates the performance of two major machine learning techniques: neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM). Vanderbilt Prowler is used for simulating the scenarios. In the simulations, normalized critical parameters and their corresponding probabilities of DoS attack are computed in 50 trial runs. These normalized critical parameters and their corresponding probabilities of DoS attack are used as training inputs in NN and SVM approaches. The simulation results clearly show that SVM provides better accuracy compared to NN, 97% accuracy by SVM and 91% accuracy by NN. The simulation also shows that SVM takes much less time to detect and determine the probability of a DoS attack, 0.25 seconds by SVM and 0.75 seconds by NN. All these results clearly show that SVM performs better than NN when used for detecting the probability of DoS attack in WSNs.			aswathy.braj13@gmail.com; maneesha@am.amrita.edu; arvie@ieee.org; hemalatha@am.amrita.edu					Dargie W., 2010, FUNDAMENTALS WIRELES; Fausett Laurene, FUNDAMENTALS NEURAL; Hemalatha T, 2009, International Journal of Recent Trends in Engineering, V1; Hu F., 2003, AD HOC NETW, P69; Kalita H.

Most microprocessors allow part of their important parameters to be reconfigured, such as the frequency, cache prefetch mechanism, and so on. Predicting the performance of reconfigurable processor is still an open question since the performance model needs to consider not only program characteristic, but also processor architecture parameters. In this paper, we propose a new performance prediction model for reconfigurable processor based on machine learning. We employ the M5P as base learners to gain better performance and custom an ensemble learner to get better accuracy. The experiment results show that the ensemble learner reduce the prediction error to 3% from 8%, which is the prediction of a single M5P learner. Furthermore, benefited from considering both program architecture-independent characteristics and the architecture parameters, our model can not only predict the performance of the program under specific architecture, but also help to optimize processor's architecture and scheduling processes.

Order to detect flexible and improve the detection accuracy, we propose a scene-adaptive moving detection model with machine learning based on clustering. The model uses a group of testing images to train the camera firstly, which means we can get out accurate parameters for one scene. We design a detection algorithm that used in training process based on clustering. Then it uses the parameters and detection algorithm to detect the changes in monitor scene. The experience shows our model has a high adaptability and accuracy.

However, topics in real-world stream data are non-stationary. Training a reliable topic model is a challenging study. Further, the usage of words in different paragraphs within a document is varied due to different composition styles. This study presents a hierarchical segmentation model by compensating the heterogeneous topics in stream level and the heterogeneous words in document level. The topic similarity between sentences is calculated to form a beta prior for stream-level segmentation. This segmentation prior is adopted to group topic-coherent sentences into a document. For each pseudo-document, we incorporate a Markov chain to detect stylistic segments within a document. The words in a segment are generated by identical composition style. This new model is inferred by a variational Bayesian EM procedure. Experimental results show benefits by using the proposed model in terms of perplexity and F measure.

The proposed approach maximizes the signal variance while minimizes the estimated noise variance in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The KSNR can be used in any kernel method to deal with correlated (possibly non-Gaussian) noise. We illustrate the method in nonlinear regression examples, dependence estimation and causal inference, nonlinear channel equalization, and nonlinear feature extraction from high-dimensional satellite images. Results show that the proposed KSNR yields more fitted solutions and extracts more noise-free features when confronted with standard approaches.

KPR offers a strong smoothing capability critical to the robustness of regression or classification results. For Gaussian cases, the notion of orthogonal polynomials is instrumental to optimal estimation and its error analysis. More exactly, the regressor may be expressed as a linear combination of many simple Hermite Regressors, each focusing on one (and only one) orthogonal polynomial. For Gaussian or non-Gaussian cases, this paper formally establishes a "Two-Projection Theorem" allowing the estimation task to be divided into two projection stages: the first projection reveals the effect of model-induced error (caused by under-represented regressor models) while the second projection reveals the extra estimation error due to the (inevitable) input measuring error. The two-projection analysis leads to a closed-form error formula critical for order/error tradeoff. The simulation results not only confirm the theoretical prediction but also demonstrate superiority of KPR over the conventional ridge regression method in MSE reduction.	[Kung, S.

A novel, direct approach to determine such importance weighting is presented. It relies on a nearest neighbor classification scheme and is relatively straightforward to implement. Comparative experiments on various classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our so-called nearest neighbor weighting (NNeW) scheme. Considering its performance, our procedure can act as a simple and effective baseline method for importance weighting.

More precisely, we are aiming at learning the main features of an object seen in different scenarios. We adapt the statistical framework from [1] to propose a model in which an object is described by independent classes representing its variability. Our work consists in proposing an algorithm which learns each class characteristics in a sequential way: each new observation will improve our object knowledge. This algorithm is particularly well suited to real time applications such as shape recognition or classification, but turns out to be a challenging problem. Indeed, the so-called classic machine learning algorithms in missing data problems such as the Expectation Maximization algorithm (EM) are not designed to learn from sequentially acquired observations. Moreover, the so-called hidden data simulation in a mixture model can not be achieved in a proper way using the classic Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, such as the Gibbs sampler. Our proposal, among other, takes advantage from the contribution of Cappe and Moulines [2] for a sequential adaptation of the EM algorithm and from the work of Carlin and Chib [3] for the hidden data posterior distribution simulation.
