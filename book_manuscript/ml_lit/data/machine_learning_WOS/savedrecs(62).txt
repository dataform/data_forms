Various applications are used to browse the Internet, thus access financial data, and store sensitive personal information. In consequence, mobile devices are exposed to several types of attacks. Specifically, phishing attacks can easily take advantage of the limited or lack of security and defense applications therein. Furthermore, the limited power, storage, and processing capabilities render machine learning techniques inapt to classify phishing and spam emails in such devices. The present study proposes a distributed architecture hinging on machine learning approaches to detect phishing emails in a mobile environment based on a modified version of Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). Apparently, BART suffers from high computational time and memory overhead, therefore, distributed algorithms are proposed to accommodate detection applications in resource constrained wireless environments.

Most approaches to question classification are based on handcrafted rules. Recent studies classify simple questions using machine learning techniques and recommends SVM as on of the best performing classifiers. This study applies a hierarchical classifier based on the SVM machine learning algorithm on questions posed by users, drawn from Yahoo! Answers. The significance of this study is that we attempted to directly classify complex questions with multiple sentence questions posed by real users. We report the accuracy achieved using both a coarse-grained classifier and fine-grained classifier to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach on complex questions. We also present a confusion matrix to analyze the results made by our classifier.

In this paper, a video summarization approach based on machine learning is developed for automatic video transition prediction. Several novel features are extracted to characterize video boundary, including cut, fade in, fade out and dissolve for facilitating the understanding content structure and domain rules of a video. These features not only can be used to filter negative false alarms caused by illumination changes but also to improve recognition rate of the key frames. Our approach provides a good view on temporal continuity of video event. Our results have shown that our approach can accurately predict the transitions in a video sequence and would be a practical solution for automatic video segmentation and video summarization.

So far much of the research has been focused on English due to the lack of semantically annotated resources in other languages. This paper reports first results on semantic role labeling using a pre-release version of the Chinese FrameNet. In this work, we used the pre-release version of the Chinese FrameNet corpora to train a complete semantic role labeler. The labeler uses heuristic rules to look for lexical and semantic clues in the sentences. We evaluated the labeler by applying it to a small portion of the pre-release version of the Chinese FrameNet example corpus that was labeled manually. Overall, the labeler found the F-score of the correct Core roles 82.4% of the time, which is encouraging given the simplicity of its rules.

Comparison Analysis On Supervised Learning Based Solutions For Sports Video Categorization	2008 IEEE 10TH WORKSHOP ON MULTIMEDIA SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	10th IEEE Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing	OCT 08-10, 2008	Cairns, AUSTRALIA	IEEE Signal Proc Soc				Due to the wide viewer-ship and high commercial potentials, recently, sports video analysis attracts extensive research efforts. One of the main tasks in sports video analysis is to identify sports genres i.e. sports video categorization. Most of the existing work focus on mapping content-based features to sports genres by using supervised learning methods. Moreover, video data sets seeks efficient data reduction methods due to the large size and noisy data. It lacks comparison analysis on the implementation and performance of these methods. In this paper, the research is carried out by using four dominant machine learning algorithms, namely Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbor and Naive Bayesian, and comparing their performance on a high dimensional feature set which selected by some feature selection tools such as Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS), Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Relief. Experimental results shows that Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-NN are not sensitive to reduction of training sets. Moreover, three different feature reduction methods perform very differently with respect to four different tools.

As volume of online musical contents expands rapidly in recent years, demands for retrieval by emotion are emerging. Currently, literature on music retrieval using emotional terms is rare. Emotion annotated data are scarce in existing music databases because annotation is still a manual task. Automating music emotion annotation is an essential prerequisite to research in music retrieval by emotion, for without which even sophisticated retrieval methods may not be very useful in a data deficient environment. This paper describes a machine learning approach to annotate music using a large number of emotional terms. We also estimate the training data size requirements for a workable annotation system. Our empirical result shows that 1) the task of music emotion annotation could be modelled using machine learning techniques to support a large number of emotional terms, 2) the combination of sampling method and data-driven detection threshold is highly effective in optimizing the use of existing annotated data in training machine learning models, 3) synonymous relationships enhance the annotation performance and 4) the training data size requirement is within reach for a workable annotation system. Essentially, automatic music emotion annotation enables music retrieval by emotion to be performed as a text retrieval task.

CPU C-states can be used to reduce power consumption during processor idle time. The key unsolved problem is: when and how to use which C-state. We propose a machine learning prediction method and usage model. We evaluate this model with idle traces collected on dual-core and quad-core processor, and find this method can well predict CPU's activity pattern at the error level not exceeding 4%. Compared with existing OS C-state policy, it results in 12% additional CPU power saving and 2% performance improvement. In industry, 12% power saving for any processor is very significant improvement. SPECWeb (which we used consists of 3 different benchmarks - We consistently see double-digit power saving) is representative 'front-end" server workload - it takes >60% DP server market segment share.

However, manually developing and tuning so called stressmarks is extremely tedious and time-consuming while requiring an intimate understanding of the processor. A synthetic program that can be tuned to produce a variety of benchmark characteristics would significantly help in addressing this problem by enabling the automatic exploration of the large temperature and power design space. This paper demonstrates that with a suitable choice of only 40 hardware-independent program characteristics related to the instruction mix, instruction-level parallelism, control flow behavior, and memory access patterns, it is possible to generate a synthetic benchmark whose performance relates to that of general-purpose and commercial applications. Leveraging this abstract workload modeling approach, we propose StressMaker, a framework that uses machine learning for the automated generation of stressmarks. A comparison with an exhaustive exploration of a large power design space demonstrates that StressMaker is very effective in automatically generating stressmarks in a limited amount of time.

To most effectively utilize these now computationally tractable techniques, we characterize design topology roughness and leverage this characterization to guide our usage of analysis and optimization methods. In particular, we compute roughness metrics that require high-order derivatives and multi-dimensional integrals of design metrics, such as performance and power These roughness metrics exhibit noteworthy correlations (1) against regression model error, (2) against non-linearities and non-monotonicities of contour maps, and (3) against the effectiveness of optimization heuristics such as gradient ascent. Thus, this work quantifies the implications of design topology roughness for commonly used methods and practices in microarchitectural analysis.

It has been widely used in many fields of information processing, such as machine learning, data mining, information retrieval, and pattern recognition. However, the computation of LDA involves dense matrices eigen-decomposition which can be computationally expensive both in time and memory. Specifically, LDA has O(mnt + t(3)) time complexity and requires O(mn + mt + nt) memory, where m is the number of samples, n is the number of features and t = min(m,n). When both m and n are large, it is infeasible to apply LDA. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for discriminant analysis, called Spectral Regression Discriminant Analysis (SRDA). By using spectral graph analysis, SRDA casts discriminant analysis into a regression framework which facilitates both efficient computation and the use of regularization techniques. Our theoretical analysis shows that SRDA can be computed with O(ms) time and O(ms) memory, where s(<= n) is the average number of non-zero features in each sample. Extensive experimental results on four real world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm.

Having these labels is a requirement for several techniques that attempt to retrieve and integrate data that reside in online databases and that are hidden behind form interfaces, including schema matching and clustering, and hidden-Web crawlers. Whereas previous approaches to this problem have relied on heuristics and manually specified extraction rules, our technique makes use of learning classifiers to identify form labels. Our preliminary experiments show this approach is promising and has high accuracy.

The approach is suitable for small and fast hardware implementation and was designed to be embedded in network appliances. Each network packet is characterized using a novel technique that efficiently maps the payload histogram onto a simple pair of features using hypercube hash functions, which were chosen for their implementation efficiency in both hardware and software. This two-dimensional feature space is quantized into a binary bitmap representing the normal and anomalous feature regions. The potential loss of accuracy due to the reduction in feature space is countered by the ability of the bitmaps to capture nearly arbitrary shaped regions in the feature space. These bitmaps are used as the classifiers for real-time detection. The proposed method is extremely efficient in both the offline machine learning and real-time detection components. Results using the 1999 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Data Set yield a 100% detection of all applicable attacks, with extremely low false positive rate. The approach is also evaluated on real traffic captures.

These methods try to exploit the information provided by the large and easily gathered unlabeled data besides the labeled training set. Analogously, many semi-supervised kernels appeared which determine similarity in feature space considering also the unlabeled data points. In this paper we propose a novel kernel construction algorithm for supervised and semi-supervised learning, which actually constitutes a general frame of semi-supervised kernel construction. The technique is based on the cluster assumption: the cluster the labeled and unlabeled data by an agglomerative clustering technique, and then we use the linkage distances induced by the clustering hierarchy to construct our kernel. The hierarchical cluster kernel is then compared to other existing techniques and evaluated on synthetic and real data sets.

Besides wasting users' time and effort to scan and delete the massive amount of junk e-mails received; it consumes network bandwidth and storage space, slows down e-mail servers, and provides a medium to distribute harmful and/or offensive content. Several machine learning approaches have been applied to this problem. In this paper, we explore a new approach based on fuzzy similarity that can automatically classify e-mail messages as spam or legitimate. We study its performance for various conjunction and disjunction operators for several datasets. The results are promising as compared with a naive Bayesian classifier. Classification accuracy above 97% and low false positive rates are achieved in many test cases.

This when coupled with telemedicine could help care providers provide better individualized therapy more frequently. Currently, diabetics might get 15 minutes of interaction with a health expert during a checkup, and in that amount Of time the physician must quickly evaluate the patient's health to offer therapy advice. The Intelligent Diabetes Assistant (IDA) addresses this problem by remotely collecting data, instantaneously sharing that data with a physician, and automatically processing the data to reveal important patterns.

As part of an activity supported through NASA's Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO), we have developed techniques that enable such assets to be dynamically combined to form sensor webs that can respond quickly to short-lived events and provide rich multi-modal observations of objects, such as clouds, that are evolving in space and time. A key focus of this work involves relating the observations made by one instrument to the observations made by another instrument. We have applied approaches derived from data mining, computer vision, and machine learning to automatically establish correspondence between different sets of observations. We will describe a number of Earth science scenarios that were used to direct this development and which have benefited from the approach.(12).

Multivariate survival analysis (I): Shared frailty approaches to reliability and dependence modeling	2008 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-9	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 01-08, 2008	Big Sky, MT	IEEE		multivariate survival analysis; shared frailty model; dependent failure; common risks failure; common events failure; event-related dependence; network survivability; prognostic and health management (PHM); software reliability	FAILURE TIME DATA; PROPORTIONAL ODDS MODEL; MULTISTATE MODELS; EVENT TIMES; REGRESSION; TRANSFORMATION; DISTRIBUTIONS; LIFE	The latest advances in survival analysis have been centered on multivariate systems. Multivariate survival analysis has two major categories of models: one is multistate modeling; the other is shared frailty modeling. Multistate models, although formulated differently in both fields, have been extensively studied in reliability analysis in the context of Markov chain analysis. In contrast, shared frailty modeling seems little known in reliability analysis and computer science. In this article, we focus exclusively on shared frailty modeling. Shared frailty refers to the often-unobserved factors or risks responsible for the common risks dependence between multiple events. It is well recognized as the most effective modeling approach to address common risks dependence and, more recently, the event-related dependence. The only exclusion of dependence modeling for the frailty approach is the common events type, which is best addressed by multi-state modeling. We argue that shared frailty modeling not only is perfectly applicable for engineering reliability, but also is of significant potential in other fields of computer science, such as networking and software reliability and survivability, machine learning, and prognostics and health management (PHM).

The introduction of wireless technology in such players motivates new business opportunities where music distribution is ubiquitous. However, in such high-supply scenario, consumers may have difficulties to find interesting content In such context, music recommender systems assist consumers in identifying their preferences and in supporting content searches. An important feature in such market is the low attention given to new music styles, what increases the promotion costs. In order to assist consumers who, positive or negatively, pay attention to such novelty factor, this work proposes a novel method to estimate music preference profiles based on acoustic similarity measures. Such profiles are learnt by an artificial neural network, named Self-Organizing Novelty Detection Neural Network Architecture (SONDE), which classifies and quantifies the novelty level of music tides regarding the user profile. Based on novelty levels, we suggest a discount rate model to support promotion strategies. The proposed method is evaluated by simulating some scenarios.

A breath gas sensing system is designed by using a quartz crystal resonator with a plasma-polymer film as a sensor. To collect breath gas data under emotional state, psychological experiments are carried out using a dental rise to excite emotions. In computational experiment of emotion recognition, two emotions of comfortableness and no emotion are considered and the machine learning-based approach such as an artificial neural network (ANN) and a support vector machine (SVM) is investigated. The obtained average emotion recognition rates are 47.5% using the ANN and 67.5% using the SVM, respectively. Experimental results show that using breath gas information is feasible and the machine learning-based approach is well suited for this task.

Jensen-Shannon divergence is used to compute a set-similarity of intensity distributions derived from stratified data. We prove that derived regularity measures form a continuum as a function of the stratification's granularity and also upper-bounded by the Shannon entropy. This enables to interpret it as a generalized Shannon entropy with an intuitive spatial parameterization. This measure is applied as a novel feature extraction method for a real-world medical image anaysis problem. The proposed measure is employed to describe ground-glass lung nodules whose shape and intensity distribution tend to be more irregular than typical lung nodules. Derived descriptors are then incorporated into a machine learning-based computer-aided detection system. Our ROC experiment resulted in 83% success rate with 5 false positives per patient, demonstrating an advantage of our approach toward solving this clinically significant problem.

The accuracy of this function directly influences the accuracy of the entire process of model fitting. Unfortunately, building these functions is a non-trivial task. Dedicated to the application of face model fitting, this paper proposes to consider a multi-band image representation that indicates the facial components, from which a large set of image features is computed. Since it is not possible to manually formulate an objective function that considers this large amount of features, we apply a Machine Learning framework to construct them. This automatic approach is capable of considering the large amount of features provided and yield highly accurate objective functions for face model fitting. Since the Machine Learning framework rejects non-relevant image features, we obtain high performance runtime characteristics as well.

The majority, of printed dictionaries organize ASL signs (represented in drawings or pictures) based on their nearest English translation; so unless one already knows the meaning of a sign, dictionary, look-up is not a simple proposition. In this paper we introduce the ASL Lexicon Video Dataset, a large and expanding public dataset containing video sequences of thousands of distinct ASL signs, as well as annotations of those sequences, including start/end frames and class label of every sign. This dataset is being created as part of a project to develop a computer vision system that allows users to look up the meaning of an ASL sign. At the same time, the dataset can be useful for benchmarking a variety of computer vision and machine learning methods designed for learning and/or indexing a large number of visual classes, and especially approaches for analyzing gestures and human communication.

In our framework, the structures of classes are conceptualized as a semi-Riemannian manifold which is considered as a submanifold embedded in an ambient semi-Riemannian space. The class structures of original samples can be characterized and deformed by local metrics of the semi-Riemannian space. Semi-Riemannian metrics are uniquely determined by the smoothing of discrete functions and the nullity of the semi-Riemannian space. Based on the geometrization of class structures, optimizing class structures in the feature space is equivalent to maximizing the quadratic quantities of metric tensors in the semi-Riemannian space. Thus supervised discriminant subspace learning reduces to unsupervised semi-Riemannian manifold learning. Based on the proposed framework, a novel algorithm, dubbed as Semi-Riemannian Discriminant Analysis (SRDA), is presented for subspace-based classification. The performance of SRDA is tested on face recognition (singular case) and handwritten capital letter classification (nonsingular case) against existing algorithms. The experimental results show that SRDA works well on recognition and classification, implying that semi-Riemannian geometry is a promising new tool for pattern recognition and machine learning.

In real-world applications when labeled data are limited, LDA does not work well. Under many situations, however, it is easy to obtain unlabeled data in large quantities. In this paper, we propose a novel dimensionality reduction method, called Semi-Supervised Discriminant Analysis (SSDA), which can utilize both labeled and unlabeled data to perform dimensionality reduction in the semi-supervised setting. Our method uses a robust path-based similarity measure to capture the manifold structure of the data and then uses the obtained similarity to maximize the separability between different classes. A kernel extension of the proposed method for nonlinear dimensionality reduction in the semi-supervised setting is also presented. Experiments on face recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Methods for efficiently searching this incredibly rich resource are vital for a large number of applications. These include object recognition [2], computer graphics [11, 27], personal photo collections, online image search tools. In this paper, our goal is to develop efficient image search and scene matching techniques that are not only fast, but also require very little memory, enabling their use on standard hardware or even on handheld devices. Our approach uses recently developed machine learning techniques to convert the Gist descriptor (a real valued vector that describes orientation energies at different scales and orientations within an image) to a compact binary code, with a few hundred bits per image. Using our scheme, it is possible to perform real-time searches with millions from the Internet using a single large PC and obtain recognition results comparable to the full descriptor Using our codes on high quality labeled images from the LabelMe database gives surprisingly powerful recognition results using simple nearest neighbor techniques.

There are many IM systems such as MSN Messenger and Yahoo Messenger which are used by millions of users everyday. However, IM technology serves as a double edged sword and could be misused for illegitimate information exchange or committing crimes for its anonymity and completely uncontrolled chatting environment. To help enforce legitimate contents communicated in chat environments, IM monitoring systems have been developed for monitoring chat messages. Although most of these systems can provide good monitoring functions, they only provide simple message analysis features such as browsing and simple keyword-based searching of the recorded messages. In this paper, we propose a system, called IMAnalysis, that supports intelligent chat message analysis using text mining techniques. The IMAnalysis system provides functions on chat message retrieval, social network analysis and topic analysis. Chat message retrieval provides general browsing and retrieval support. Social network analysis discovers the social interactions of IM users with their contacts. And topic analysis detects automatically the topics that IM users are involved in.

The main CPU sends command(s) and retrieves data/status from the slave controller(s) and the slave controller(s) act accordingly, as the result, two major impacts had occurred, the hardware design is much simpler, it can be designed into a much simpler basic unit and it can be duplicated throughout the system for any equivalent job. Even though the jobs, may vary based on various functionalities, only minor additional hardware had been added to cover all the extra features. The major improvement is in the software development cycle, it has been cut drastically from months/year to just only week(s). This paper is a good example of an effort to implement the Distributed Control concept into a model of scaled-down Mars Rover Spirit which in turn simplifies the overall design (both hardware and software) and allows the designer to easily add more software features such as: machine learning, artificial intelligence, etc. to the robot in the future.

The presented framework proposes an hybrid cognitive architecture that relies on subsumption theory and includes some important extensions. These extensions can be condensed in inclusion of learning capabilities through bioinspired reinforcement machine learning systems, an evolutionary mechanism based on gene expression programming to self-configure the behaviour arbitration between layers, a co-evolutionary mechanism to evolve behaviour repertories in a parallel fashion and finally, an aggregation mechanism to combine the learning algorithms outputs to improve the learning quality and increase the robustness and fault tolerance ability of the cognitive agent. The proposed architecture was proved in an animat environment using a multi-agent platform where several learning capabilities and emergent properties for self-configuring internal agent's architecture arise.

Compact Fuzzy Rules Induction and Feature Extraction Using SVM with Particle Swarms for Breast Cancer Treatments	2008 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOLS 1-8	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation	JUN 01-06, 2008	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE			NOTTINGHAM-PROGNOSTIC-INDEX; CLASSIFICATION; CLASSIFIERS; SELECTION; RANKING; SYSTEMS	Developing a treatment plan for breast cancer patient is a very complex process. In this paper, we propose a scheme of inducing fuzzy rules that characterise breast caner treatment knowledge from data. These fuzzy rules can augment the human experts in the process of medical diagnosis to select optimal treatment for patients. The proposed machine learning scheme applies the particle swarm optimisation technique (PSO) to the construction of an optimal support vector machine (SVM) model for the sake of inducing accurate and parsimonious fuzzy rules and simultaneously reducing input space dimensions, in which a new fittness function that regularises the importance ranks of features with misclassification rate is suggested. The SVM-based fuzzy classifier evades the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional breast cancer data space in the sense that the number of support vectors, which equals the number of induced fuzzy rules, is not related to the dimensionality. The experiments have shown that not only the classification performance achieved by the proposed fuzzy classifier outperforms the ones achieved by other methods in the literature, but also the input space dimension has been reduced greatly.

And, very often SVMs show slow speeds in test phase due to their large number of support vectors. To remedy SVMs deficiencies, we propose a novel SVM-like method, which is called evolutionary support center machine (ESCM) in this paper. The key idea behind ESCM is to apply evolutionary algorithm to construct the separation hyperplane with the similar form to those constructed by SVMs in an incremental way. ESCM can not only optimize the support centers and tune the kernel parameters adaptively, but also control the number of support centers appropriately. Numerical experiments on several UCI benchmarks verify the efficiency of ESCM.

But at the level of meso-scale and even micro-scale severe weather phenomena (involving very short-term chaotic perturbations) such as turbulence and wind shear phenomena, these approaches have not been so successful. This paper focuses on the use of chaotic oscillatory-based neural networks for the study of a meso-scale weather phenomenon, namely, wind shear, a challenging and complex meteorological phenomena which has a vital impact on aviation safety. Using LIDAR data collected at the Hong Kong International Airport via the Hong Kong Observatory, we are able to forecast the Doppler velocities with reasonable accuracy and validate our prediction model. Preliminary results are promising and provide room for further research into its potential for application in aviation forecasting.	[Kwong, K. M.; Liu, James N.

To analyze these data, many excellent machine learning techniques have been proposed in recent related work. In this paper, we try to perform the clustering of microarray data by combining the recently proposed Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) method with PCA, i.e. PCA-LPP. The comparison between PCA and PCA-LPP is performed based on two clustering algorithms, K-means and agglomerative hierarchical clustering. As we already known, clustering with the components extracted by PCA instead of the original variables does improve cluster quality. Moreover, our empirical study shows that by using LPP to perform further process the dimensions of components extracted by PCA can be further reduced and the quality of the clusters can be improved greatly meanwhile. Particularly, the first few components obtained by PCA-LPP capture more information of the cluster structure than those of PCA.

In this paper we present a novel algorithm which extracts some meaningful patterns from time series data and then uses traditional machine learning algorithm to create classifier. During the stage of pattern extraction, the Gini function is used to evaluate the patterns and the starting position and the length of each pattern are automatically determined. We also apply sampling method to reduce the search space and improve efficiency. The common datasets are used to check our algorithm which is compared with the naive algorithms. The results show that a lot of improvement can be gained in terms of interpretability, simplicity of the model and also in terms of accuracy.

In this work we will assess some of the main machine learning algorithms used or suitable for model-building in a controlled environment and under equal conditions. They are analyzed in terms of solution accuracy and computational complexity. To the best of our knowledge a study like this has not been put forward before and it is essential for the understanding of the nature of the model-building problem of MOEDAs and how they should be improved to achieve a quantum leap in their problem solving capacity.

Real-time systems are no exception. A significant issue is that the information needed is not always freely available and derived it using manual methods is costly in terms of time and money. Previous work showed how machine learning information derived during software testing can be used to derive loop bounds as part of the Worst-Case Execution Time analysis problem. In this paper we build on this work by investigating the issue of branch prediction.

In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised machine learning algorithm namely multiobjective evolutionary clustering ensemble algorithm (MECEA) to perform the texture image segmentation. MECEA comprises two main phases. In the first phase, MECEA uses a multiobjective evolutionary clustering algorithm to optimize two complementary clustering objectives: one based on compactness in the same cluster, and the other based on connectedness of different clusters. The output of the first phase is a set of Pareto solutions, which correspond to different tradeoffs between two clustering objectives, and different numbers of clusters. In the second phase, we make use of the meta-clustering algorithm (MCLA) to combine all the Pareto solutions to get the final segmentation. The segmentation results are evaluated by comparing with three known algorithms; K-means, fuzzy K-means (FCM), and evolutionary clustering algorithm (ECA). It is shown that MECEA is an adaptive clustering algorithm, which outperforms the three algorithms in the experiments we carried out.

Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are integrated effectively based on a wrapper approach. Specifically, the GA component searches for the best attribute set using principles of evolutionary process, after which the reduced dataset is presented to the SVMs. Simulation results show that GA-SVM hybrid is able to produce good classification accuracy and a high level of consistency. In addition, improvements are made to the hybrid by using a correlation measure between attributes as a fitness measure to replace the weaker members in the population with newly formed chromosomes. This correlation measure injects greater diversity and increases the overall fitness of the population.	[Ang, J. H.; Teoh, E. J.; Tan, C. H.; Goh, K. C.; Tan, K.

The classifier can predict the class of unknown data based on their given attribute values. In ubiquitous computing environment, a great deal information can be obtained from various sensors. However, with the time going on, new sensor may be recruited. The recruited new sensors may bring new outcomes to the existing attribute. How to handle the new outcomes is a difficult issue. This paper first presents the problem and meanwhile a new method for handling new outcomes is proposed. The old rule is generated from the old data with fewer outcomes and modified and combined with the new data smoothly. In the method, the old rule can improve the performance of classifier constructed only from the new data set. The experiments show that the proposed approach is effective in handling new outcomes.

On the efficient use of uncertainty when performing expensive ROC optimisation	2008 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOLS 1-8	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation	JUN 01-06, 2008	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE			MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; CURVE; AREA	When optimising receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves there is an inherent degree of uncertainty associated with the operating point evaluation of a model parameterisation x. This is due to the finite amount of training data used to evaluate the true and false positive rates of x. The uncertainty associated with any particular x can be reduced, but only at the computation cost of evaluating more data. Here we explicitly represent this uncertainty through the use of probabilistically non-dominated archives, and show how expensive ROC optimisation problems may be tackled by only evaluating a small subset of the available data at each generation of an optimisation algorithm. Illustrative results are given on data sets from the well known UCI machine learning repository.

The cost of extending a search method with an ANN based learning skill is relatively low, the memory requirements and model building cost being at most linearithmic in the number of variables. As a case study, we show how these mechanisms can enable the simple (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm to efficiently solve hard problems, which are provably intractable using just fixed representation and problem independent operators.

The classification system consists of an expert system for preselecting relevant regions in an image and a subsequent machine learning classifier. Both utilize specifically designed features for the application. The latter classifier is implemented by a Generalized Radial Basis Function (GRBF) algorithm to assure the interpretability of the detection system. The GRBF is constructed based on the kernel of an ensemble method classifier, the Random Forest (RF) algorithm in order to achieve a low generalization error. The high accuracy of the proposed technique for vehicle rear detection is validated using data from real traffic situations.

The key point of such method is the definition of a generic model able to describe the huge variability of pedestrians. We propose a learning based approach using a training set composed by positive and negative samples. A simple description of each candidate image provides a huge feature vector from which can be built weak classifiers. We select a subset of relevant weak classifiers using a classic AdaBoost algorithm. The resulting subset is then used as binary vectors in a kernel based machine learning classifier (like SVM, RVM,...). The major contribution of the paper is the original association of an AdaBoost algorithm to select the relevant weak classifiers, followed by a SVM like classifier for which input data are given by the selected weak classifiers. Kernel based machine learning provides non-linear separator into the weak classifier space while standard AdaBoost gives a linear one. Performances of this method are compared to state of art methods and a real-time application with a monocular camera embedded in a moving vehicle is also presented to match this approach against a real context.

QRS, detection is an old problem that has been studied for several decades. In the literature, there are many methods based on various forms of transformations and thresholding, which require predetermined or fine-tuned thresholds. Another class of existing methods are based on machine learning, which require carefully labeled training data. In our study, we propose the modified p-spectrum for QRS detection, which does not require either predetermined thresholds or training data, and can operate in real-time. The proposed method is evaluated using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database.

Despite its usefulness in the analysis of real world signals, the process is rather deterministic and sensitive to parameters such as local envelope estimation. A combination of EMD and machine learning is proposed which provides an algorithm that is more robust to EMD parameters. In addition, the proposed extension is fully adaptive and facilitates the "data fusion via fission" mode of operation. The derivation and analysis of the proposed framework is supported with simulations in denoising and prediction applications.	[Looney, D.; Mandic, D.

This can be attributed to limited dynamic range (determined by atialog-to-digital conversion) of the sensor which is insufficient to overcome the artifacts due to cross-channel redundancy, non-homogenous mixing and high-dimensionality of the signal space. In this paper we propose a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by integrating learning algorithms directly with analog-to-digital conversion. At the core of the proposed approach is a novel regularized min-max optimization approach that yields "delta-sigma" limit-cycles. An on-line adaptation modulates the limit-cycles to enhance resolution in the signal sub-spaces containing non-redundant information. Numerical experiments simulating far-field recording conditions demonstrate consistent improvements over a benchmark setup used for independent component analysis (ICA).

The parameters of an IST are trained in combination with the parameters of the polynomial exponents of softmax functions. The: resulting gradient of the WKL can be efficiently calculated and the computational effort scales well with the size of the training set. The paper compares IST's to PCA and LDA in classification experiments with two different types of classifiers on three different datasets, two of them from the UCI machine learning repository. It is shown that IST's outperform PCA and LDA in a majority of the cases. In one case reducing the dimension with an IST even gives an improvement over the high dimensional baseline system.

LSAT problems naturally arise in many applications in which one is interested in the class of inputs that produce desirable outputs, rather than simply a single optimum. A distinctive aspect of LSAT problems is that the output behavior is assessed only on the solution set, whereas in most statistical learning problems output behavior is evaluated over the entire input space. We present a novel support vector machine (SVM) algorithm for solving LSAT problems and apply it to a synthetic data set to illustrate the impact of the LSAT formulation.

However, the solutions of these SVMs do not necessarily produce set estimates that are nested as the parameters controlling the density level or cost-asymmetry are continuously varied. Such a nesting constraint is desirable for applications requiring the simultaneous estimation of multiple sets, including clustering, anomaly detection, and ranking problems. We propose new quadratic programs whose solutions give rise to nested extensions of the one-class and cost-sensitive SVMs. Furthermore, like conventional SVMs, the solution paths in our construction are piecewise linear in the control parameters. We also describe a decomposition algorithm to solve the quadratic programs. The results of these methods are demonstrated on synthetic data sets.

Recently, much attention has been paid to the problem of learning the kernel itself from given training examples. The main emphasis has been on formulating the problem as a tractable convex optimization problem.. Only for a few very special cases such as support vector machines are explicit convex formulations known. In this paper, we show that, in a wide variety of kernel-based learning algorithms, the kernel learning problem can be formulated as a convex optimization problem which interior-point methods can solve globally and efficiently. The kernel learning method is illustrated with a regression problem that arises in petroleum engineering.

Though an integral part of musicianship, it is rarely or minimally addressed in traditional music lessons. In this paper, we describe a real-time system for sight-reading evaluation of solo instrumental music. The system is trained to recognize monophonic and polyphonic music from acoustic instruments without digital pick-ups. The pattern-matching in the back-end is achieved by nonnegative matrix factorization, an algorithm that represents notes as combinations of learned templates and chords as combinations of single notes. As part of the user interface, an animated musical score provides beginning musicians with instant visual feedback as they practice to improve their sight-reading.

The proposed method for automatic prominence labelling is based on well-known machine learning techniques in a three step procedure: i) a feature extraction step in which we propose a framework for systematic and multi-level speech acoustic feature extraction, ii) a feature selection step for identifying the more relevant prominence acoustic correlates, and iii) a modelling step in which a gaussian mixture model is used for predicting prominence. This model shows robust performance on read speech (84%).

The proposed method has two novel features. One is its use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) to estimate the subjective correctness of pitch accent with respect to each accent phrase of possible candidate speech segments. The other is its use of a determination function to identify the best segment based on SVM output. The determination function involves two assessments; one counts the number of each sign of SVM output and the other compares the distance values. The sign of SVM output is generally used to classify target objects, but the distance SVM output also represents important information. An experiment that assesses SVM performance for Japanese accent validity shows that its accuracy is 81%. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed segment selection method, preference tests are conducted. The test indicates that the proposed method can yield Japanese synthesized speech with more natural intonation than the conventional method that uses only target cost and concatenation cost.

The approach consists of finding the subset of sentences that are very likely to be relevant or irrelevant for the query from candidate documents, and iteratively training a classification model using these examples.

However, the existence of corpora of spoken dialog makes it possible to acquire the words and structure of system prompts antomatically. In this paper, we construct statistical models for generating system prompts, both for word choice and for word ordering. We evaluate these models using a human-computer dialog multicorpus and a human-human dialog corpus. Our results show that statistical models for word choice can work well, while more work is needed on statistical models for word ordering.

Traditionally, control skill analysis focuses on how to design a state-action map to provide appropriate actions according to the states. Therefore approaches such as dynamic programming and neural networks are employed to compute the appropriate actions for all the states. However, this results in time consuming computation, low robustness and no human control characteristics. Although human control skill is robust, it is subcognitive and difficult to be described by the human operators themselves. In this case, human control trajectory is proposed to record and analyze human control skill. Human control trajectory is just a sequence of the system's states and corresponding human operator's control actions, sampled at a certain frequency. Taking the advantages of human control trajectories and computation, a new approach is proposed. That is analyzing the human operators' control trajectories to find out the most important states which limit the control effect. And then compute the selected states to set up the local state-action map. After that, based on the computational results and the human control trajectories, synthesize the global state-action map to realize the control skill transformation process. In this paper, a dynamic simulator is used as an example to evaluate the effect of the proposed approach. The results show that this approach can reduce the total computational cost while improve the human operator's control skill effectively.

Finding alternative splicing events experimental is both expensive and time consuming. Computational methods, in general, and machine learning algorithms, in particular can be used to complement experimental methods in the process of identifying alternative splicing events. hi this paper we explore the predictive power of a rich set of features that have been experimentally shown to affect alternative splicing. We use these features to build support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for distinguishing between alternatively spliced exons and constitutive exons. Our results show hat simple linear SVM classifiers built from a rich set of features give results comparable to those of more sophisticated SVM classifiers that use more basic sequence features. Furthermore, we use feature selection methods to identify computationally the most informative features for the prediction problem considered.

Since they, provide important information about research outcomes, mining techniques targeting them have attracted a great deal of attention. Our final goal is to develop a figure finding system, FigFinder, to retrieve figures relevant to a users query by mining information contained in figures, their legends, and the main text in an integrative manner. In this study, we worked on figure classification to choose those representing signaling or metabolic pathways, based on textual information contained in biomedical papers, as the first step to develop) FigFinder. We took several supervised machine learning methods, and could confirm that the use of main text combined with figure legends was quilt, effective. Although man., groups have considered figure legends, this is the first attempt to address figure classification by utilizing figure legends together with main text to our knowledge.

Because the experimental determination of B-cell epitopes is time-consuming and expensive, there is an argent need for computational methods for reliable identification of putative B-cell epitopes from antigenic sequences. In this study, we explore the utility of evolutionary profiles derived from antigenic sequences in improving the performance (of machine learning methods for protective linear B-cell epitope prediction. Specifically, we compare propensity scale based methods with a Naive Bayes classifier using three different representations of the classifier input: amino acid identities, position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) profiles, and dipeptide composition.

Using machine learning techniques for protein fold recognition, most of the state-of-the-art research has focused oil more traditional algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Neural Networks (NN). In this paper; we present an empirical study of two variants of Boosting algorithms - AdaBoost and LogiBoost for the problem of fold recognition, Prediction accuracy is measured oil a dataset with proteins from 27 most populated folds from the SCOP database, and is compared with results from other literature using SVM, KNN and NN algorithms oil the same dataset. Overall, Boosting methods achieve 60% fold recognition accuracy on an independent test protein dataset which is the highest prediction achieved when compared with the accuracy values obtained with other methods proposed in the literature. Boosting algorithms have the potential to build efficient classification models in a very fast manner.

However, it has weaknesses in excessive unnecessary biopsy referrals that enfeeble its effectiveness due to difficulty in distinguishing actual cancer lesions from benign abnormalities. To overcome this issue, computer aided diagnosis (CADx) using machine learning techniques have been studied worldwide. Since this is a classification problem and the number of features obtainable from a mammogram image is theoretically infinite, CADx can be improved by introducing feature selection techniques that is suitable for mammograms. In this paper, we propose a new ensemble feature selection method based on a recently developed multiple support vector machine recursive feature elimination (MSVM-RFE). We also conduct experiments on actual digital mammograms publicly available and find that our proposed method performs competitively with other leading feature selection schemes.

The mining and curation of experimental PPI knowledge is critical for analysis of high-throughput genomics and proteomics data. Several PPI knowledge bases have been generated by expensive manual curation but far from comprehensive. Document classification systems have been shown to have the potential to accelerate the curation process by retrieving PPI-related documents. However, it is usually a case that a small number of positive documents can be obtained manually or from PPI knowledge bases with literature-based evidence and there are a large number of unlabeled documents where most of them are negative documents. Such data sets are called imbalanced. Learning from imbalanced data sets, where the number of examples of one (majority) class is much higher than the others, presents an important challenge to the machine learning community. It is not clear what kind of classification algorithm is suitable for PPI document classification. In this paper, we compared the performance of several document classifiers on two PPI document sets and varied the size of the number of positives and the ratio of the number of positives to the number of negatives (or unlabeled) in the experiment.

First, the traffic flows from active hosts are separated into different clusters by sequentially applying the information entropy techniques. The clusters are then classified into broad-based application types by examining the parameters of the clusters, as well as the dynamic properties of the clusters during the clustering process. Experiment results from a campus backbone environment are presented, where the network traffic flows from the top 20 active hosts are identified. The results showed that the identification accuracy is approximately 93.81%. This compares to prior works using unsupervised machine learning methods, where the classification accuracy is generally lower, with the highest being 86.5%. We also show that our method can be combined with supervised learning method to further improve the classification accuracy and perform automatic training on the classification engine.

Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques such as one class support vector machines (SVMs) have been introduced to overcome this difficulty. One class support vector machines model the normal or target data using non-linear surfaces in the input space while ignoring the anomalous data. Our approach to this problem is based on fitting a hyperellipsoid with a minimal effective radius, centered at the origin, around a majority of the data vectors in a higher dimensional space. We formulate this as a linear optimisation problem, which is advantageous in terms of its computational complexity. We demonstrate using real data from the Great Duck Island Project that our approach achieves better detection performance and flexibility in terms of parameter selection, compared to an earlier detection scheme using a quarter sphere SVM.

The result shows that our method outperforms other previous works in protocol level identification with more than 8%similar to 21% accuracy improvement based on fixed-ratio sample flow sets. Furthermore, the proposed method is also suitable to identify encrypted protocols.

The key challenges of timely and continuous classification are addressed in [1], In which multiple short sub-flows taken at different points within the original application's flow lifetime are used to train the classifier. The classification decision process is repeated continuously using a sliding window of the flow's most recent N packets. The work left a critical question of how to automate the identification of appropriate sub-flows for training. In this paper we propose a novel approach for sub-flows identification and selection using ML, clustering algorithms. We evaluate our approach using accuracy, model build time, classification speed and physical resource consumption metrics.	[Nguyen, Thuy T.

The early detection of potential failures and malfunctions, the identification and localization of present or impending component failures and, in particular, the monitoring of the underlying physical process are of crucial importance for the efficient operation of complex process industry assets. With respect to these suppositions a software agent based diagnosis and monitoring concept has been developed, which allows an integrated and continuous diagnosis of the communication network and the underlying physical process behavior. The present paper outlines the architecture of the developed distributed diagnostic concept based on software agents and presents the functionality for the diagnosis of the unknown process behaviour of the underlying automation system based on machine learning methods.

However, the reduced available resources raise a lot of technical challenges. Self organization in WSN is a desirable characteristic that can be achieved by means of data fusion techniques when delivering reliable data to users. In this paper it is proposed a genetic machine learning algorithm (GMLA) approach that makes a trade-off between quality of information and communication efficiency. GMLA is based on genetic algorithms and it can adapt itself dynamically to environment modifications. The main target of the proposed approach is to achieve set(organization in a WSN application with data fusion. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach can optimize communication efficiency in a dense WSN.	[Pinto, A.

Here, the best categorization performance provide mammalian brain functions that motivate to partly mimic such a formation for the application to machine learning and automation. Curiosity and experimental willingness support human recognizing and detecting in relation to still unknown objects. In order to learn an understanding of the topology of such objects, objects are observed from a series of different viewpoints. This results in a collection of object views that afterward can be used by cognitive processes. State-of-the-art systems provide learning structures that are subsequently utilized for object recognition and tracking tasks. However, most Of these systems aim at very specific goals in restricted domains, and therefore, it remains no room for learning and understanding of object structures. In the work of this paper we propose a new robot vision model for neural categorization. This is close to our initial idea of mimicking mammalian brain functions for robot vision. We use the combinatorial solution of our cognitive framework with an embedding of a recently presented stochastic n-gram model, supported by a three-dimensional grammar model on a discrete three-dimensional lattice. Furthermore, we use ant colony optimization heuristics for collecting the transition probabilities of the n-gram model. The proposed solution is exemplified by applying the method to several object view series of 69 polytopes generated out of the five platonic solids by truncation; thus, generating images from 32 viewpoints each, yields an object set of 2208 images. These set is further expanded to four sets perturbed by Gaussian-noise with varying sigma = {0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2}. Finally, we show results for selected objects and conclude with an outlook on further work.

This useful interpolative skill relies on the highly complex pattern matching systems in the human brain, but the general idea can be applied to a computer vision recognition system using comparatively simple machine learning techniques. An approach to the recognition of 3D objects in arbitrary pose relative the the vision equipment given only a limited training set of views is presented. This approach involves computing a disparity map using stereo cameras, extracting a set of features from the disparity map, and classifying it via a fuzzy associative map to a trained object.

We automatically generate a fuzzy model, using a three-stage methodology: (i) generation of a crisp model from a decision tree, induced from the data, (ii) transformation of the crisp model into a fuzzy one, and (iii) optimization of the fuzzy model's parameters. Based on this methodology, the generated fuzzy model includes a set of parameters, which are all the parameters included in the sigmoid functions. In addition, local, global and class weights are included, thus the fuzzy model is optimized with respect to both sigmoid function parameters and weights. The class weight introduction, which is a novel approach, grants to the fuzzy model the ability to identify the individual importance of each class and thus more accurately reflect the underlying properties of the classes under examination, in the domain of application. The above described methodology is applied to five known classification problems, obtained from the UCI machine learning repository, and the obtained classification accuracy is high.

A machine learning algorithm, LOPPS, has been developed to learn about optimal power source combinations with respect to minimum power loss for all possible load requests and various system power states. The results generated by the LOPPS are used to build a fuzzy power controller (FPC). FPC is integrated into a simulation program implemented by using a generic simulation software as indicated in reference [22] and is used to dynamically allocate optimal power sources during online drive. The simulation results generated by FPC show that the proposed machine learning algorithm combined with fuzzy logic is a promising technology for vehicle power management.

Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) (Liu and Yao; 1999a,b) is a successful approach to construct neural network ensembles. By encouraging the diversity of ensembles, it makes different neural networks to learn different knowledge of the incoming data so that the ensembles can learn the whole data better. Its partial learning effect can help ensembles overcome the problem of catastrophic forgetting. These features make NCL a potentially powerful approach to incremental learning. In previous researches, it has been found that Incremental NCL algorithms are very sensitive to their parameters. In this paper an approach based on evolutionary computation techniques is proposed to tackle the problem of automatic and robust parameter setting for Incremental NCL. Via typical comparative experiments, the proposed approach exhibit clearly improved performance over existing algorithms.

This research belongs to the automatic harmonization field. Here we approach Chinese folksong harmonization with piano accompaniment as a machine learning task, in a probabilistic framework. We use existing example of Chinese folksong with piano accompaniment to build a model of piano accompaniment process. This model can then be used to harmonize new Chinese folksong with piano accompaniment.

In this study, we implemented a machine learning approach and developed reliable neural network and SVM based methods to classify human milochondria proteins with high confidence. We used experimentally characterized human mitochondria proteins as positive training datasets and human proteins localized in other organelles as negative training datasets for neural network, support vector machine, naive bayes and bayes network classification. In addition, we constructed simple amino acid composition model, a hybrid model of simple amino acid composition combining amino acid chemical-physical properties, and dipeptide amino acid composition model. With 5 fold cross-validations, the results demonstrate that multiple perceptrone neural network performs better than SVM in all three training models. We concluded that our classification approach utilizing empirically characterized human mitochondria protein sequences is a valuable tool for classifying human mitochondria proteins.

NHOP: Detecting Descriptive Patterns Using Association Pattern Mining	2008 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GRANULAR COMPUTING, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing	AUG 26-28, 2008	Hangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE				To facilitate interpretation and consider the relationships of internal interdependency between data values, a new form of high-order (multiple-valued) pattern known as Nested High-Order Pattern (NHOP) is presented. This pattern satisfies a consistent statistical criterion when the pattern is iteratively extracted. The general form of High-Order Pattern (HOP), that NHOP is a subtype, is a set of multiple associated values (identified as variable outcomes) extracted from a random N-tuple. The pattern Is detected by statistical testing if the occurrence is significantly deviated from the expected according to a prior model or null hypothesis. Here we extend our work of NHOP to classification and clustering tasks to identify a clearer description of the patterns. The rationale is that, complex association patterns reinforce the underlying meaningfulness in interpreting the regularity, thus can provide a better understanding of the classification and data domain. We develop a search strategy, called NHOP-Covering algorithm, to detect a set of NHOP. Experiments on benchmark machine learning data and real-world biomolecular data are evaluated with promising results.	[Lui, Thomas W. H.; Chiu, David K.

Like most standard machine learning methods, traditional rough sets based rule learning algorithms do not usually work well on highly unbalanced data sets. In this paper, we present a minority class rule learning algorithm for a highly unbalanced inconsistent data set where the class of interest is the minority one. The proposed algorithm pivots on discovery of the main features that discriminate the minority class from majority classes by finding the so called dominant minority subset. An. illustrative example and a real application to customer churning prediction in Telecom are given to show. the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

The successful detection of both gradual and abrupt transitions is necessary to this end. In this paper a new gradual transition detection algorithm is proposed, that is based on novel criteria such as color coherence change that exhibit less sensitivity to local or global motion than previously proposed ones. These criteria, each of which could serve as a standalone gradual transition detection approach, are then combined using a machine learning technique, to result in a meta-segmentation scheme. Besides significantly improved performance, advantage of the proposed scheme is that there is no need for threshold selection, as opposed to what would be the case if any of the proposed features were used by themselves and as is typically the case in the relevant literature. Performance evaluation and comparison with four other popular algorithms reveals the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

Since relations among the coefficients arc specific to the signal, SVM regularization re. moves the poise, which does not share this property. Moreover, due to its non parametric nature, the method can eventually cope with different noise sources. The results show that: (1) the proposed non-parametric method outperforms conventional methods that assume coefficient independence, and (2) its performance 's similar to state of the art parametric methods that do explicitly include these relations. Therefore, the proposed machine learning approach can he seen as a more flexible (model-free) alternative to the explicit description of wavelet coefficient relations in Bayesian approaches.

In contrast we propose to first extract features front both images and labels. Subsequently we induce a mapping from pixel features to label features and synthesize the final output by combining the newly derived label components. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by applying log Gabor filters to both input and ground truth images of mineral ore. Subsequently we train perceptrons and repression trees to produce individual output components that arc combined in frequency space to create the final segmentation. Experimental results show significant improvements over contextual pixel labeling and over ensemble methods.

Trademark localization is performed through robust clustering of matched feature points in the video frame. A supervised machine learning approach is used to automatically adapt the similarity threshold used to assess the trademark matches. Experimental results are provided, along with an analysis of the precision and recall. Results show that our proposed technique is efficient and effectively detects and classifies trademarks.

DVC proposed a dramatic structural change to video coding by shifting the majority of complexity conventionally residing in the encoder towards the decoder. Nevertheless, these kinds of architectures have some serious limitations that hinder its practical application. The uses of a feedback channel between the encoder and the decoder requires an interactive decoding procedure which is a limitation for certain applications such as offline processing. On the other hand, the decoder needs an efficient way to estimate the probability of error without assuming the availability of the original video at the decoder. In this paper we investigate a first approximation to solve both problems based on the use of machine learning to extract the knowledge that exits between the residual frame and the number of requests over this feedback channel. Exploiting this correlation gives us a more practical architecture without higher complexity encoders. We apply these concepts to pixel-domain Wyner-Ziv coding and the results show a loss of 0.21 dB in the rate-distortion performance.	[Martinez, J.

The method uses an effective probabilistic network model for analyzing various kinds of log data in mobile environments, which were modularized to decrease complexity. We also propose a mobile life browser, which visualizes and searches human's mobile life based on the contents and context of personal information. The mobile life browser is for searching the personal information effectively collected on his/her mobile device and for supporting the concept-based searching method by using concept networks and Bayesian networks.

IP traceback a counter measure against DDoS, is the ability to trace IP packets back to the true source/s of the attack. In this paper, an IP traceback scheme using a machine learning technique called Intelligent Decision Prototype (IDP), is proposed. IDP can be used on both Probabilistic Packet Marking (PPM) and Deterministic Packet Marking (DPM) traceback schemes to identify DDoS attacks. This will greatly reduce the packets that are marked and in effect make the system more efficient and effective at tracing the source of an attack compared with other methods. IDP can be applied to many security systems such as Data Mining, Forensic Analysis, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and DDoS defense systems.

How is an amputee supposed to command the prosthesis what to do (i.e., how to grasp an object) and with what force (i.e., holding a hammer or grasping an egg)? So far, in literature, the most interesting results have been achieved by applying machine learning to forearm surface electromyography (EMG) to classify finger movements; but this approach lacks, in general, the possibility of quantitatively determining the force applied during the grasping act. In this paper we address the issue by applying machine learning to the problem of regression from the EMG signal to the force a human subject is applying to a force sensor. A detailed comparative analysis among three different machine learning approaches (Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and Locally Weighted Projection Regression) reveals that the type of grasp can be reconstructed with an average accuracy of 90%, and the applied force can be predicted with an average error of 10%, corresponding to about 5N over a range of 50N. None of the tested approaches clearly outperforms the others, which seems to indicate that machine learning as a whole is a viable approach.

The method learns offline a conditional density model of the joint angles given the workspace coordinates. This density implicitly defines the multivalued inverse kinematics mapping for any workspace point. At run time, given a trajectory in the workspace, the method (1) computes the modes of the conditional density given each of the workspace points, and (2) finds the reconstructed angle trajectory by minimising over the set of modes a global, trajectory-wide constraint that penalises discontinuous jumps in angle space or invalid inverses. We demonstrate the method with a PUMA 560 robot arm and show how it can reconstruct the true angle trajectory even when the workspace trajectory contains singularities, and when the number of inverse branches depends on the workspace location.

These models are typically provided and hand-tuned by a human operator and are often derived from intensive and careful calibration experiments and the operator's knowledge and experience with the robot and its operating environment. In this paper, we demonstrate how the parameters of both the motion and sensor models can be automatically estimated during normal robot operations via machine learning methods thereby eliminating the necessity of manually tuning these models through a laborious calibration process. Results from real-world robotic experiments are presented that show the effectiveness of the estimation approach.

Inspired by biological findings on the mammalian hippocampus, here, episodic memories retain a sequence of experienced observation, behavior, and reward. Incorporating multiple machine learning methods, this approach attempts to help reducing the computational burden of a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) problem. In particular, proposed computational reduction techniques include: 1) abstraction of the state space via temporal difference learning; 2) abstraction of the action space by utilizing motor schemata; 3) narrowing down the state space in terms of goals through instance-based learning; 4) elimination of the value-iteration by assuming a unidirectional-linear-chaining formation of the state space; 5) reduction of the state-estimate computation by exploiting the property of the Poisson distribution; and 6) trimming the history length by imposing a cap on the number of episodes that are computed. Claims 5) and 6) were empirically verified, and it was confirmed that the state estimation can be in fact computed in an O(n) time (where n is the number of the states), more efficient than a conventional Kalman-filter based approach of O(n(2)).

These applications ideally require vision algorithms which are robust to camera motion and scene change but are cheap and fast enough to run on small, low power embedded systems. Unfortunately most robust visual tracking algorithms are either computationally expensive or are restricted to a stationary camera. This paper describes a new color based tracking algorithm, the Adaptive Background CAMSHIFT (ABCshift) tracker and an associated technique, mean shift servoing, for efficient pan-tilt servoing of a motorized camera platform. ABCshift achieves robustness against camera motion and other scene changes by continuously relearning its background model at every frame. This also enables robustness in difficult scenes where the tracked object moves past backgrounds with which it shares significant colors. Despite this continuous machine learning, ABCshift needs minimal training and is remarkably computationally cheap. We first demonstrate how ABCshift tracks robustly in situations where related algorithms fail, and then show how it can be used for real time tracking with pan-tilt servo control using only a small embedded microcontroller.

We present an algorithm based on gradient boosting for biosanar-based robots that recognize different objects such as different trees via reflected sonar echoes. Gradient boosting is a machine learning approach, that builds one strong classifier from many base learners. We present two kinds of base learners for the gradient boosting: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and kernel-based base learners. Compared with our previous works, in which we presented a time resolved spectrum kernel to extract the similarities between echoes, we get more efficient and accurate results with the newly proposed boosting method. We compare the methods in terms of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and Matthew's correlation coefficient and also the runtime of training and testing.

S	Ruvolo, P; Fasel, I; Movellan, J			IEEE	Ruvolo, Paul; Fasel, Ian; Movellan, Javier			Auditory mood detection for social and educational robots	2008 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION, VOLS 1-9	IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation	MAY 19-23, 2008	Pasadena, CA	IEEE			INTERACTIVE ROBOTS	Social robots face the fundamental challenge of detecting and adapting their behavior to the current social mood. For example, robots that assist teachers in early education must choose different behaviors depending on whether the children are crying, laughing, sleeping, or singing songs. Interactive robotic applications require perceptual algorithms that both run in real time and are adaptable to the challenging conditions of daily life. This paper explores a novel approach to auditory mood detection which was born out of our experience immersing social robots in classroom environments. We propose a new set of low-level spectral contrast features that extends a class of features which have proven very successful for object recognition in the modern computer vision literature. Features are selected and combined using machine learning approaches so as to make decisions about the ongoing auditory mood. We demonstrate excellent performance on two standard emotional speech databases (the Berlin Emotional Speech [1], and the ORATOR dataset [2]). In addition we establish strong baseline performance for mood detection on a database collected from a social robot immersed in a classroom of 18-24 months old children [3]. This approach operates in real time at little computational cost. It has the potential to greatly enhance the effectiveness of social robots in daily life environments.

Humans modulate their arm joint impedance parameters during contact tasks, and such aspect suggests a key feature how human successfully executes various contact tasks in variable environments. Our strategy for successful contact tasks is to find appropriate impedance parameters for optimal task execution by Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this study Recursive Least-Square (RLS) filter based episodic Natural Actor-Critic is employed to determine the optimal impedance parameters. Through dynamic simulations of contact tasks, this paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The simulation results show that the proposed method successfully optimizes the performance of the contact task and adapts to uncertain conditions of the environment.

Proper severity assessment is essential for appropriate resource allocation and planning for fixing activities and additional testing. Severity assessment is strongly influenced by the experience of the test engineers and by the time they spend on each issue. The paper presents a new and automated method named SEVERIS (SEVERity ISsue assessment), which assists the test engineer in assigning severity levels to defect reports. SEVERIS is based on standard text mining and machine learning techniques applied to existing sets of defect reports. A case study on using SEVERIS with data from NASA's Project and Issue Tracking System (PITS) is presented in the paper. The case study results indicate that SEVERIS is a good predictor for issue severity levels, while it is easy to use and efficient.

In order to use one of machine learning based approaches for the task, documents should be encoded into numerical vectors; it causes two problems: huge dimensionality and sparse distribution. The proposed approach is intended to address the No problems. In other words, the two problems are avoided by encoding a document or documents into a table, instead of numerical vectors. Therefore, the goal of the research is to improve the performance of text categorization by solving the two problems.

Our method starts by representing each candidate noun using a feature context vector, which is simply a vector of all its co-occuring neighbors excluding itself. We then applied bisection clustering to hierarchically cluster the context vectors to obtain a cluster hierarchy. Lastly, we proposed and evaluated two methods to label each intermediate clustering node with the most representative member context feature vector. Experiments conducted on 3 sets of on-line reviews (in both Chinese and English) benchmarked qualitatively and quantitatively against a well known existing approach demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

What the genre classification concerned is not the topic but the genre of document. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of using machine learning techniques to solve genre classification of Chinese text with the same topic, viz. finance. Based on the likelihood ratio test, we present a new method for selecting feature terms, which can improve the performance clearly and perform better than others with up to 80% terms removal. In empirical results with SVMs classifier on the real world corpora, we find that this method can gain a better selecting effect and likelihood ratio is a reliable measure for selecting informative features.

Thus, any improvement in the accuracy estimation of the cross-validation method will benefit a lot of people and help in improving the results of many researches. In this paper the focus is on skewed noisy datasets. Applications such as fraud detection is an important example of skewed data. Usually for CV, simple random sampling (SRS) is performed to divide the data into the required number of folds, e.g., 10-fold CV requires the data to be divided into 10 folds. SRS is known to give poor performance (accuracy of classification) when data is skewed. We propose a new algorithm, based on the frequency histogram of each attribute value, to divide the dataset into the required number of folds.

BCI can help users send messages and commands to the external world without using their brain's normal output channels or muscles. The central element in each BCI system is to rind a reliable method to detect the specific feature patterns extracted from the raw brain signals, and then translate it into usable control signals. In this paper, we introduce our approach to detect N170 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP) based on its spatiotemporal patterns in single-trial EEG signals. Common spatial pattern (CSP) method and machine-learning technique support vector machine (SVM) are adopted for N170 feature extraction and translation, i.e. they convert electrophysiological input from the user into on-off signal to control external devices. Our results indicate that the CSP can effectively extract discriminatory information, and SVM has an efficient performance for N170 classification. Comparing to several other methods, high performances of our framework show that the temporal and spatial features of N170 are very stable and it is promising for new type BCI applications.

The MCC method mainly considers the local distribution of each class around a new tuple to be classified and uses minimal coverage principle - covering minimal number of tuples with different classes - to classify this new tuple. The merits of MCC over other machine learning algorithms are threefold: (1) uniform approach for both numerical and categorical data; (2) deals with missing values; (3) given a new data tuple, it provides values for all classes which measure the likelihood of the tuple being in each class. The experimental results of MCC conducted on seven toxicity data sets from real-world applications are compared with the results of IBL, DT, Ripper, MLP and SVM in terms of classification performance. This application shows that MCC is a promising method for the toxicity prediction of chemical compounds.

However, it is a challenge to build such a system, given the difficulties brought by the mixed-attribute property of network connection data and the constraints on network communication. In this paper, we present a framework for distributed detection of network intrusions based on a parametric model. The parametric model can explicitly reflect the distributions of different intrusion types and handle the mixed-attribute data naturally. Based on the model, we can generate an accurate global intrusion detector with a very low cost of communication among the distributed detection sites, and no sharing of original network data is needed. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework in the distributed intrusion detection application.

Existing research work show: the supervised algorithms deteriorates significantly if unknown attacks are present in the test data; the unsupervised algorithms exhibit no significant difference in performance between known and unknown attacks but their performances are not that satisfying. In this contribution, we propose two semi-supervised classification methods, Spectral Graph Transducer and Gaussian Fields Approach, to detect unknown attacks and one semi-supervised clustering method-MPCK-means to improve the performances of the traditional purely unsupervised clustering methods. Our empirical study shows that performances of semi-supervised classification methods are much better than those of supervised classifiers, and semi-supervised clustering method can improve purely unsupervised clustering methods markedly.

Data mining is the search for relationships and patterns within this data that could provide useful knowledge for effective decision-making. Classification analysis is one of the widely adopted data mining techniques for healthcare applications to support medical diagnosis, improving quality of patient care, etc. Usually medical databases are high dimensional in nature. If a training dataset contains irrelevant features (i.e., attributes), classification analysis may produce less accurate results. Data pre-processing is required to prepare the data for data mining and machine learning to increase the predictive accuracy. Feature selection is a preprocessing technique commonly used on high-dimensional data and its purposes include reducing dimensionality, removing irrelevant and redundant features, reducing the amount of data needed for learning, improving algorithms' predictive accuracy, and increasing the constructed models' comprehensibility. Much research work in data mining has gone into improving the predictive accuracy of the classifiers by applying the techniques of feature selection. The importance of feature selection in medical data mining is appreciable as the diagnosis of the disease could be done in this patient-care activity with minimum number of features. Feature selection may provide us with the means to reduce the number of clinical measures made while still maintaining or even enhancing accuracy and reducing false negative rates. In medical diagnosis, reduction in false negative rate can, literally, be the difference between life and death. In this paper we propose a feature selection approach for finding an optimum feature subset that enhances the classification accuracy of Naive Bayes classifier. Experiments were conducted on the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset to assess the effectiveness of our approach.

Reinforcement Learning Methods for Finding Equilibria and Tracking Evolution Paths in Conflicts	2008 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN AND CYBERNETICS (SMC), VOLS 1-6	IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on System, Man, and Cybernetic	OCT 12-15, 2008	Singapore, SINGAPORE	IEEE				The search for the equilibrium states of a given conflict is a major issue in conflict analyses. There are several traditional methodologies to determine the equilibrium states of a strategic conflict, such as logical definitions within the graph model for conflict resolution and the matrix representation for conflict resolution. However, these methods depend on a graphical or mathematical representation and need analytical expressions to calculate the equilibrium states. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning method that can search for the equilibrium states by trial-and-error without the need for a precise mathematical model of the conflict problem. This paper proposes a novel multiple RL technique that deals with conflict resolution problems for the case of two decision makers. Moreover, the proposed method cannot only find equilibria but also track all paths from any status quo to the equilibria in conflicts when these paths exist. This method is evaluated using two well-known conflict analysis examples. The experimental results show that the proposed method can quickly, correctly, and efficiently find the equilibria and track the evolution paths.

In this paper, we propose a cost-sensitive cascaded method for automatic mass detection, which employs machine learning techniques to detect region of interests (ROI). In detail, we divide the original mammograms into overlapped squared sub-images. For each sub-image, intensity features based on gray histogram, texture features based on spatial gray-level co-occurrence matrix (SGLDM) and texture features based on local binary patterns (LBP) are extracted and input to a cost-sensitive cascaded classifier. Simple threshold segmentation and neural network are used to further reduce false positives. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective in mass detection.

Since E-Learning systems are digital by their very nature, their introduction rises the issue of modeling the didactic design in a way that implies the chance to apply Knowledge Engineering Techniques (like Machine Learning and Data Mining). A modeling approach called storyboarding, is outlined here. Storyboarding is setting the stage to apply Knowledge Engineering Technologies to verify and validate the didactics behind a learning process. Moreover, didactics can be refined according to revealed weaknesses and proven excellence and successful didactic patterns can be inductively inferred by analyzing the particular knowledge processing and its alleged contribution to learning success.

Though there exist a lot of approaches for pattern mining, few of them consider the local distribution of the data. In the paper, we not only design six challenge datasets related to the local patterns, but also propose a new pattern mining algorithm based on local distribution. Unlike traditional pattern mining algorithms, our new algorithm first creates a local distribution for each data point by a random approach. Then, the distribution curve of each data point is simulated by the sum of low frequency curves obtained by the wavelet approach. In the third step, the coefficients of these low frequency curves for each data point are clustered by the normalized cut approach. Finally, the patterns of the datasets are obtained by the new pattern mining algorithm. The experiments show that our new algorithm outperforms traditional unsupervised learning approaches, such as K-means, EM, spectral clustering algorithm (SCA), and so on, on these six new datasets.

Ensemble feature relevance determination can properly group the most relevant features together and separate the relevant features from the irrelevant and redundant features. However, it cannot provide reliable local feature relevance rank. In this paper, we demonstrate that the predicted local relevance rank for the relevant features could be influenced by their highly correlated redundant features, according to the strength of their correlations.

The developmental robotics aims to design computational systems that are endowed with such an intrinsic motivation mechanism. There are possible links between developmental robotics and machine learning. Affective computing takes into account emotions in human machine interactions for intelligent system design. The main difficulty to implement automatic detection of emotions in speech is the prohibitive labelling cost of data.

The generalization performance of classification system improves when correlated and redundant features are removed. In order to reduce the dimensionality of pattern representation, A new feature selection method for Support Vector Machine is proposed. Based on pattern similarly measurement in kernel space, class separability is deduced and we explore the use of the class separability in feature selection. The key idea of our method is that the feature whose removal downgrades the class separability in kernel space most is relevance to the classification. Experiments on linear and nonlinear synthetic problems and real world data sets have been carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.

Using a robot task as a case study, we have shown that using the feedback from the robot itself, the system can learn from experience, or example provided by an expert. We present a system where the processing of the feedback is integrated entirely in the growing of a spiking neural network system. The feedback is extracted from a measurement of a reward interpretation system provided by the designer, which takes into consideration the robot actions without the need for external explicit inputs. Starting with a small basic neural network, new connections are created. The connections are separated into artificial dendrites, which are mainly used for classification issues, and artificial axons, which are responsible for selecting appropriate actions. New neurons are then created using a special connection structure and the current reward interpretation of the robot. We show that dyadic connections can also make an artificial neural network acting and learning faster because they reduce the total number of neurons and connections needed in the resulting neural system. The main contribution of this research is the creation of a novel unsupervised learning system where the designer needs to define only the interface between the robot and the neural network in addition to the feedback system which includes a calculation of a reward value depending on the performance of the robot (or task aim of the system being developed).

In this paper, a semi-supervised kernel-based fuzzy C-means algorithm called PCKFCM is proposed which incorporates both semi-supervised learning technique and the kernel method into traditional fuzzy clustering algorithm. The clustering is achieved by minimizing a carefully designed objective function. A kernel-based fuzzy term defined by the violation of constraints is included. The proposed PCKFCM is compared with other clustering techniques on benchmark and the experimental results convince that effective use of constraints improves the performance of kernel-based clustering. As for the effect of key parameter selection and the non-linear capability, it outperforms a similar semi-supervised fuzzy clustering approach Pairwise Constrained Competitive Agglomeration (PCCA).

The essential idea of ADASYN is to use a weighted distribution for different minority class examples according to their level of difficulty in learning, where more synthetic data is generated for minority class examples that are harder to learn compared to those minority examples that are easier to learn. As a result, the ADASYN approach improves learning with respect to the data distributions in two ways: (1) reducing the bias introduced by the class imbalance, and (2) adaptively shifting the classification decision boundary toward the difficult examples. Simulation analyses on several machine learning data sets show the effectiveness of this method across five evaluation metrics.

Historical model errors which are mismatch between observed and predicted values are assumed to be indicators of total model uncertainty; it is measured in the form of prediction intervals, and comprises all sources of uncertainty including model structure, model parameters, input and output data.

According to idea of entropy function, a new weighted information functions (WIF) is proposed, and the information content of data matrix X is measured by it. Based on WIF, the information compression rate (ICR, R-IC) and accumulated information compression rate (AICR, R-AIC) are set up, by which the degree of information compression is measured At last, an improved PCA algorithm (IPCA) based on WIF is constructed.

However, most of these existing algorithms are developed intuitively and pragmatically, i.e., on the base of the experience and knowledge of experts for their own purposes. Therefore, it will be more informative to provide some a systematic framework for understanding the common properties and intrinsic differences in the algorithms. In this paper, we propose such a framework, i.e., "patch alignment", which consists of two stages: part optimization and whole alignment With the proposed framework, various algorithms including the conventional linear algorithms and the manifold learning algorithms are reformulated into a unified form, which gives us some new understandings on these algorithms.

In this application, the focus is on healthcare claim payment processing, which is a major component of administrative healthcare costs. Due to the compleidty of healthcare data, current methods require a large amount of healthcare claim payment processing to occur through manual intervention by human operators. This limitation necessitates the inclusion of machine learning techniques to create a hybrid system for automation of healthcare claim payments. Further automation of claims payment processing will lead to improved quality cost components of healthcare delivery. Machine learning techniques are used to demonstrate the feasibility of a hybrid system for healthcare claim payment automation, leading to reduced administrative costs and increased efficiencies. When the administrative cost savings are applied to the industry, this contributes to lowering the overall cost of healthcare.

When data are naturally separated into groups, SVM+[7] can effectively utilize this structure information to improve generalization. Alternatively, we can view learning based on data from each group as an individual task, but all these tasks are somehow related; so the same problem can also be formulated as a multi-task learning problem. Following the SVM+ approach, we propose a new multi-task learning algorithm called svm+MTL, which can be thought as an adaptation of SVM+ for solving MTL problem. The connections between SVM+ and svm+MTL are discussed and their performance is compared using synthetic data sets.

Nevertheless, there are still some fundamental issues remaining to be addressed, and an important one is what factors affect the accuracy of an ensemble, and to what extent they do, which is thus taken as the main topic of this paper. The factors studied include the accuracy of individual models, the diversity among the individual models in an ensemble, decision-making strategy, and the number of the members used for constructing an ensemble. This paper firstly describes the conceptual and theoretical analyses on these factors, and then presents the possible relationships between them.

The P300 models are first learned using a pool of existing subjects and Fisher linear discriminant, and then autonomously adapted to the unlabeled data of a new subject using an unsupervised machine learning technique. In data analysis, we apply this technique to a set of EEG data of 10 subjects performing word spelling in an oddball paradigm. The results are very positive: the adapted models with unlabeled data yield virtually the same classification accuracy as the conventional methods with labeled data. Therefore, it proves the feasibility of P300-based BCIs which can be applied directly to a new subject without training sessions.

We show that employing composite vectors is similar to using more samples by analysis, which is a great advantage in classification problems when the size of training samples is small. Motivated by this, we apply composite vectors to kernel-based methods, which may have overfitting problems when training samples are not sufficient. Experimental results using several data sets from UCI machine learning repository show that C-KDA gives a better performance compared to other methods based on primitive input variables and linear discriminant analysis using composite vectors (C-LDA) when the training sample size is relatively small.

An effective BCI system should be adaptive to and robust against the dynamic variations in brain signals. One solution to it is to adapt the model parameters of BCI system online. However, CSP is poor at adaptability since it is a batch type algorithm. To overcome this, in this paper, we propose the Incremental Common Spatial Pattern (ICSP) algorithm which performs the adaptive feature extraction on-line. This method allows us to perform the online adjustment of spatial filter. This procedure helps the BCI system robust to possible non-stationarity of the EEG data. We test our method to data from BCI motor imagery experiments, and the results demonstrate the good performance of adaptation of the proposed algorithm.

In our findings we find the class document frequency, dfc, of a word is the most important feature in document classification. Machine learning algorithms trained with dfc of words show similar performance in terms of correct classification of test documents when compared to more complicated features. The importance of dfc is further verified when simple algorithms developed solely on the basis of dfc shows performance that compares closely with that of more complex machine learning algorithms. We also found improved performance when the dfc of links of documents in a class is used along with the dfc of the words of the document. We compared the algorithms for showing the importance of dfc on the Reuters-21578 text categorization test classification and the Cora data set.

Relevant instances are automatic cancer detection/classification, machine-learning pathologic prediction, automatic predictive toxicology, etc. Molecules may be represented in terms of graphical structures in a natural way: each node in the graph can be used to represent an atom, whilst the edges of the graph represent the atom-atom bonds. Labels (in the form of real-valued vectors) are associated with nodes and edges in order to express physical and chemical properties of the corresponding atoms and bonds, respectively. These structured data are expected to contain more information than a traditional (flat) feature vector, information that may strengthen the classification capabilities of a machine learner. This paper investigates the application of a novel Bayesian/connectionist classifier to this graphical pattern recognition task. The approach is much simpler than state-of-the-art machine learning paradigms for graphical/relational learning. It relies on the idea of describing the graph in terms of a binary relation. The posterior probability of a class given the relation is estimated as a function of probabilistic quantities modeled with a neural network, trained over individual vertex pairs in the graph. The popular and challenging Mutagenesis dataset is considered for the experimental evaluation. Despite its simplicity, the technique turns out to yield the highest recognition accuracies to date on the complete (friendly + unfriendly) dataset, outperforming complex machines (relational and graph neural nets, kernels for graphs, inductive logic programming techniques, etc.). Some preliminary chemical/biological implications are eventually hypothesized in the light of the results obtained.

However, current machine learning techniques are far from sufficient for achieving human-level intelligence. Here we identify the properties of learners required for human-level intelligence and suggest a new direction of machine learning research, i.e. the cognitive learning approach, that takes into account the recent findings in brain and cognitive sciences. In particular, we suggest two fundamental principles to achieve human-level machine learning: continuity (forming a lifelong memory continuously) and glocality (organizing a plastic structure of localized micromodules connected globally). We then propose a multimodal memory game as a research platform to study cognitive learning architectures and algorithms, where the machine learner and two human players question and answer about the scenes and dialogues after watching the movies. Concrete experimental results are presented to illustrate the usefulness of the game and the cognitive learning framework for studying human-level learning and intelligence.

In both situations, most classifiers including SVMs will still give a prediction by assigning the test point to one of the classes. However, when a test instance is very close to the decision boundary, the side of the boundary on which the instance lies, and hence the predicted class, will depend in many instances more on the choices of the tuning or training parameters rather than a clear differences in features. Furthermore, if a test instance is substantially different from all instances used during the training, the classical SVM classifiers will still assign it to a class although there is little evidence to support such assignment. In both cases, it is very useful for a classifier to be able to assess its ability to classify a given instance by identifying those regions of the feature space in which the class assignments are less certain. In this paper, we propose two novel approaches based on: i) a geometric uncertainty margin and ii) the convex hulls of the training points in the feature-space. Our proposed techniques improve upon the existing SVM-based approaches by adding the ability to identify "uncertainty" areas where the assignment of a test instance to a class cannot be guaranteed. We illustrate both the problems and our novel techniques on the Iris data set from the UCI machine learning repository.

First, it transfers the kernel methods to a center-constrained minimum enclosing ball problem, and subsequently it trains the kernel methods using the proposed MEB algorithm, and the primal variables of the kernel methods are recovered via KKT conditions. Then, detailed theoretical analysis and rigid proofs of our new algorithm are given. After that, experiments are investigated via using several typical classification datasets from UCI machine learning benchmark datasets. Moreover, performances compared with standard support vector machines are seriously considered. It is concluded that our proposed algorithm owns comparable even superior performances yet with rather fast converging speed in the experiments studied in this paper. Finally, comments about the existing problems and future development directions are discussed.

Towards Autonomous Data Ferry Route Design through Reinforcement Learning	2008 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON A WORLD OF WIRELESS, MOBILE AND MULTIMEDIA NETWORKS, VOLS 1 AND 2	IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks	JUN 23-26, 2008	Newport Beach, CA	IEEE				Communication in delay tolerant networks can be facilitated by the use of dedicated mobile "ferries" which physically transport data packets between network nodes. The goal is for the ferry to autonomously find routes which minimize the average packet delay in the network. We prove that paths which visit all nodes in a round-trip fashion, i.e., solutions to the Traveling Salesman Problem, do not yield the lowest average packet delay. We propose two novel ferry path planning algorithms based on stochastic modeling and machine learning. We model the path planning task as a Markov Decision Process with the ferry acting as an independent agent. We apply Reinforcement Learning to enable the ferry to make optimal decisions. Simulation experiments show the resulting routes have lower average packet delay than solutions known to date.

Online detection of anomalies is attractive because it offers the possibility of immediate corrective action, early termination, and redesign of assays that may require many hours or days to execute. The proposed approach employs assay-specific image processing within an assay-independent framework for distributed control, machine learning, and anomaly reporting. Specifically, we exploit coarse-grained parallelism to distribute image processing over several computing nodes while efficiently aggregating sufficient statistics across nodes. This architecture also allows us to easily handle geographically-distributed data sources. Our results from two applications, adipocyte quantitation and neurite growth estimation, confirm that this online approach to anomaly detection is feasible, efficient, and accurate.

Work to date has concentrated on hardware development and validation by clinicians in comparison with standard histological staining. As this technology gains acceptance, the development of automated processing methods becomes more important. We concentrate here on detection of the dominant internal feature of the skin, the epidermis/dermis boundary, a complex corrugated 3-dimensional layer marked by optically subtle changes and features. We adopt a machine learning approach to this segmentation problem, using a hierarchical multi-scale classifier with sophisticated on-line feature selection, to minimize the required expert labeling and maximize the range of potential features in the face of high inter- and intra-subject variability and low optical contrast. Initial results indicate the ability of our approach to recover the complex 3-D boundary surface.

The nature of tumor has a direct effect on the number of voxels being contaminated, as well as on the changes in the observed CT scan. In order to deal with this challenge, in this paper we propose the use of advanced non-linear machine learning techniques to determine the optimal features, as well as the hyperplane that use these features to separate tumoral voxels from voxels corresponding to healthy tissues. Very promising classification results using an important volume of clinically annotated data (86% sensitivity, 82% specificity) demonstrate the potentials of our approach.

We tackle the problem using the watershed transform. Watershed transform is known for its ability to generate closed contours and its extreme sensitivity to image borders. One main drawback of this method is over-segmentation. In order to circumvent this, marked watershed based on the "modified gradient" method has been developed. However, the choice of the watershed mark locations is critical and their inadequacy may cause wrong results. Similarly to randomization and combination procedures used in the machine learning field, the present paper promotes the use of an assembly of marked watershed transforms, in order to increase the segmentation robustness. This results in the definition of candidate segmentations margins (expressed in terms of object border confidence) from which final segmentation can be chosen by means of thresholding.

These challenges call for novel engineering toolsets to study stem cell behaviors and the associated stemness. Towards this goal, we are developing a computer vision based system to automatically and reliably follow the behaviors of individual stem cells in expanding populations. This paper reports on significant progress in our development. In particular, we present a machine-learning approach for detecting spatiotemporal mitosis events without image segmentation. This approach not only improves tracking performance, but can also independently quantify mitoses and cellular divisions. We also employ bilateral filtering to improve cell detection performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this system on tracking C2C12 mouse myoblast stem cells.

To automate synapse detection in such images, one has to simulate aspects of human pattern recognition skills to account for low signal-to-noise-ratios. We propose a machine learning based method that allows a direct integration of the experts' visual expertise who tag a low number of referential synapses according to their degree of synapse likeness. The sensitivity and positive predictive values show that by using graded likeness information in our learning algorithm we can provide an intuitively tunable tool for neural tissue slide evaluation.

Our method uses machine learning to discover automatically the most discriminative asymmetry feature set from different brain regions and image scales. Applying this regression model on a T1 MR brain image set of 246 healthy individuals (121 females; 125 males, 66 +/- 7.5 years old), we achieve a mean absolute error of 5.4 years and a mean signed error of -0.2 years for age estimation on unseen MR images using the stringent leave-15%-out cross validation. Our results show significant changes in asymmetry with aging in the following regions: the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles, the amygdala, the ventral putamen with a nearby region of the anterior inferior caudate nucleus, the basal forebrain, hyppocampus and parahyppocampal regions. We confirm the validity of the age estimation model using permutation test on 30 replicas of the original dataset with randomly permuted ages (with p-value < 0.001). Furthermore, we apply this model to a separate set of MR images containing normal, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects.

But till now, most of the machine-learning classifiers do not give any insight as to which features play key roles with respect to the derived classifier as well as the individual class. Recently, the variables importance measure yielded by random forest (RF) has been proposed in many applications. However, in multi-label classifications RF attempts to yield a common feature ranking for all classes, which fail in identifying the distinct predictive structures for individual class, This paper developed an improved random forest variables importance measure to evaluate the importance of features according to each individual class in multi-classification problem, and then applied a wrapper method for feature selection to construct the key features sets referring to each subtype of the chronic gastritis. Experiment results show that, compared with the previous studies, the selected features are more close to expert knowledge and contribute to better understanding of the underlying process that characterize the chronic gastritis.

Failure Prediction Models for Proactive Fault Tolerance within Storage Systems	2008 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MODELING, ANALYSIS & SIMULATION OF COMPUTER AND TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS (MASCOTS)	International Symposium on Modeling Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	16th IEEE International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems	SEP 08-10, 2008	Baltimore, MD	IEEE				The increasingly large demand for data storage has spurred on the development of systems that rely on the aggregate performance of multiple hard drives. In many of these applications, reliability and availability are of utmost importance. It is therefore necessary to closely scrutinize a complex storage system's reliability characteristics. In this paper, we use Markov models to rigorously demonstrate the effects that failure prediction has on a system's mean time to data loss (MTTDL) given a parameterized sensitivity. We devise models for a single hard drive, RAID1, and N+1 type RAID systems. We find that the normal SMART failure prediction system has little impact on the MTTDL, but striking results can be seen when the sensitivity of the predictor reaches 0.5 or more. In past research, machine learning techniques have been proposed to improve SAMRT showing that sensitivity levels of 0.5 or more are possible by training on past SMART data alone. The results of our stochastic models show that even with such relatively modest predictive power these failure prediction algorithms can drastically extend the MTTDL of a data storage System. We feel that these results underscore the importance and need for complex prediction systems when calculating impending hard drive failures.

Adaptive-LEKM proves to be more accurate and exhibits a much stable predictive performance over the existing machine learning models. Adaptive-LEKM is trained using Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) to detect possible protein phosphorylation sites for a target sequence. The performance of the proposed model was compared to seven existing different machine learning models on newly proposed PS-Benchmark_1 dataset in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and correlation coefficient. Adaptive-LEKM showed better predictive performance with 82.3% accuracy, 80.1% sensitivity, 84.5% specificity and 0.65 correlation-coefficient than contemporary machine learning models.

Conventional capacity measurement approaches based on high-level performance metrics like response time and throughput may result in either resource over-provisioning or lack of responsiveness. It is because a website may have different capacities in terms of the maximum concurrent level when the characteristic of workload changes. Moreover, bottleneck in a multi-tier website may shift among tiers as client access pattern changes. In this paper, we present an online robust measurement approach based on statistical machine learning techniques. It uses a Bayesian network to correlate low level instrumentation data like system and user cpu time, available memory size, and I/O status that are collected at run-time to high level system states in each tier. A decision tree is induced over a group of coordinated Bayesian models in different tiers to identify the bottleneck dynamically when the system is overloaded. Experimental results demonstrate its accuracy and robustness in different traffic loads.

Reducing the run-time of MCMC programs by multithreading on SMP architectures	2008 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PARALLEL & DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING, VOLS 1-8			English	Proceedings Paper	22nd IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS 2008)	APR 14-18, 2008	Miami, FL	IEEE			INFERENCE	The increasing availability of multi-core and multiprocessor architectures provides new opportunities for improving the performance of many computer simulations. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations are widely used for approximate counting problems, Bayesian inference and as a means for estimating very high-dimensional integrals. As such MCMC has found a wide variety of applications in fields including computational biology and physics, financial econometrics, machine learning and image processing. This paper presents a new method for reducing the run-time of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations by using SMP machines to speculatively perform iterations in parallel, reducing the runtime of MCMC programs whilst producing statistically identical results to conventional sequential implementations. We calculate the theoretical reduction in runtime that may be achieved using our technique under perfect conditions, and test and compare the method on a selection of multi-core and multi-processor architectures. Experiments are presented that show reductions in runtime of 35% using two cores and 55% using four cores.	[Byrd, Jonathan M.

Diagnosing a problem with one application on one machine is hard enough, but diagnosing problems in workloads of millions of jobs running on thousands of machines is a problem of a new order of magnitude. Suppose that a user submits one million jobs to a grid, only to discover some time later that half of them have failed, Users of large scale systems need tools that describe the overall situation, indicating what problems are commonplace versus occasional, and which are deterministic versus random.

This new collection of workloads is not yet fully understood by researchers. In this study we compare the SPLASH-2 and PARSEC benchmark suites with each other to gain insights into differences and similarities between the two program collections. We use standard statistical methods and machine learning to analyze the suites for redundancy and overlap on Chip-Multiprocessors (CMPs). Our analysis shows that PARSEC workloads are fundamentally different from SPLASH-2 benchmarks. The observed differences can be explained with two technology trends, the proliferation of CMPs and the accelerating growth of world data.

Although small, hand-coded microbenchmarks can be used to accelerate performance evaluation, these programs lack the complexity to stress increasingly complex architecture designs. Larger and more complex real-world workloads should be employed to measure the performance of a given design or to evaluate the efficiency of various design alternatives. These applications can take days or weeks if run to completion on a detailed architecture simulator. In the past, researchers have applied machine learning and statistical sampling methods to reduce the average number of instructions required for detailed simulation. Others have proposed statistical simulation and workload synthesis techniques, which can produce programs that emulate the execution characteristics of the application from which they are derived but have a much shorter execution period than the original. However, these existing methods are difficult to apply to multi-threaded programs and can result in simplifications that miss the complex interactions between multiple, concurrently running threads. This study focuses on developing new techniques for accurate and effective multi-threaded workload synthesis, which can significantly accelerate architecture design evaluation of multi-core processors. We propose to construct synchronized statistical flow graphs that incorporate inter-thread synchronization and sharing behavior to capture the complex characteristics and interactions of multiple threads. Moreover, we develop thread-aware data reference models and wavelet-based branching models to generate accurate memory access and dynamic branch statistics. Experimental results show that a framework integrated with the aforementioned models can automatically generate synthetic programs that maintain characteristics of original workloads but have significantly reduced runtime.

In our approach, EVM is modeled as a function of the system static non-idealities (IQ mismatch, gain, IIP3 parameters) and dynamic non-idealities (system noise, VCO phase noise). Using a selected subset of the OFDM tones, the static parameters are calculated first. These are then used to facilitate noise estimation using a back-end constellation compensation and noise amplification procedure. The data generated is used to predict EVM using machine learning methods. Significant reduction in test time is achieved with little loss in test accuracy.

They enhance and extend the measurement capabilities of sensors allowing the use of sophisticated algorithms for sensor compensation, or for the automatic classification of physical phenomena. Machine learning systems differ quite a bit from components more commonly found in measurement systems, both in the way they introduce uncertainty and in the way that uncertainty is usually estimated. In this work we provide an analysis of uncertainty of such kind of systems, focusing on the peculiarities resulting from the presence of the LfE module in the measurement chain. The analysis is at a theoretical level, with support of numerical simulations.

They offer a challenging, dynamic environment with complex problems that often have no perfect solutions. Learning Classifier Systems are rule-based machine learning techniques that rely on a Genetic Algorithm to discover a knowledge map used to classify an input space into a set of actions. This paper focuses on the use of Accuracy-based Learning Classifier System (XCS) as the learning mechanism for generating adaptive strategies in a Real Time Strategy Game. The performance and adaptability of the developed strategies with the XCS is analyzed by facing these against scripted opponents on an open source game called Wargus. Results show that the XCS module is able to learn adaptive strategies effectively and achieve the objectives of each training scenario.(1)	[Lujan, Alejandro; Werner, Richard; Boukerche, Azzedine] Univ Ottawa, PARADISE Res Lab, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada	Lujan, A (reprint author), Univ Ottawa, PARADISE Res Lab, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.	aluja023@site.uottawa.ca; rwerner@site.uottawa.ca; boukerch@site.uottawa.ca					ABBASS HA, 2004, ONLINE ADAPTION LEAR; BARRY A, 2003, LIMITS LONG PATH LEA; BASSETT JK, 2000, INT S METH INT SYST, P157; Bernado E, 2002, LECT NOTES ARTIF INT, V2321, P115; Buro M., 2003, P 18 INT JOINT C ART, P1534; Butz M.V., 2001, P GEN EV COMP C GECC, P927; BUTZ MV, 2004, LECT NOTES COMPUTER, P1051; BUTZ MV, 2004, 2004011 ILL GEN ALG; COLE N, 2004, C EV COMP 2004, V1, P139; Holland J.

The problem today is that our computerized tools are poorly adapted to our needs as they are often too formal: we illustrate this matter in the first section of this article with the example of multimedia collections. We then propose a software tool, ReCollection, for dealing with digital collections in a less formal and more sustainable manner. Finally, we explain how our software design is strongly backed up by both artistic and psychological knowledge concerning the ancient human activity of collecting, which we will see can be described as a metaphor for categorization in which two irreducible cognitive modes are at play: aspectual similarity and spatio-temporal proximity.

In this work we describe first a method for monitoring and modeling of performance degradation in SOA applications, particularly application servers. This method works for a large class of the aging processes caused by resource depletion (e.g. memory leaks). It can be deployed non-intrusively in a production environment, tinder arbitrary service request distributions. Based on this schema we investigate in the second part of the paper how machine learning (classification) algorithms can be used for proactive detection of performance degradation or sudden drops caused by aging. We leverage the predictive power of these algorithms with several techniques to make the measurement-based aging models more adaptive and more robust against transient failures. We evaluate several state-of-the-art classification methods for their accuracy and computational efficiency in this scenario. The studies are performed on a data set generated by a TPC-W benchmark instrumented with a memory leak injector. The results show that the probing method yields accurate aging models with low overhead and the machine learning approach gives statistically significant short-term predictions of degrading application performance. Both approaches can be used directly to fight aging via adaptive software rejuvenation (restart of the application), for operator alerting, or for short-term capacity planning.

However, considering the size, complexity and heterogeneity that those networks will have in the future, current solutions either do not scale properly, or have no support for automation, or lack of the flexibility and simple control that operators will need for managing future networks in a cost-effective way. To address this problem, we designed Omega, a distributed and policy-based network management system that uses rich knowledge-modeling techniques to develop self-configuration capabilities. Omega also implements a novel conflict-resolution method that uses high-level goals and machine learning techniques to optimize its policy-based decisions. Using simulations, in this paper we show how Omega reduces the impact of a node crash on the overall availability of a radio access network by optimizing the lists of neighboring cells of the nodes in the vicinity.

SVM uses kernel mapping to map the non-linear data in input space to a high-dimensional feature space where the data is linearly separable. A hybrid wavelet kernel construction for support vector machine is introduced in this paper. The construction involves a multi-dimensional sine wavelet function together with one of the conventional kernel functions. We show that the hybrid kernel is an admissible support vector (SV) kernel satisfying Mercer's theorem. The hybrid kernels thus constructed are used for the automated detection of temporal bone abnormalities. From High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) images features are extracted and fed to the learning machine for classification. Hybrid kernels provide better classification of the signal points in the mapped feature space, compared to conventional kernels. The experimental results denote promising generalization performance with the hybrid kernels.

Design of an Automated Essay Grading (AEG) System in Indian Context	2008 IEEE REGION 10 CONFERENCE: TENCON 2008, VOLS 1-4	TENCON-IEEE Region 10 Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Region 10 Conference (TENCON 2008)	NOV 19-21, 2008	Hyderabad, INDIA	IEEE				Automated Essay Grading (AEG) or scoring systems are not more a myth they are reality. These AI systems are blessings to the educational community where teachers normally face lots of problem while correcting students' essays. Valuation of huge amount of student essays within stipulated time frame, with feed back is a real challenge. But today, the human written (not hand written) essays easily evaluated by AEG systems easily. The TOEFL exam is one of the best examples of this application. The students' essays are evaluated both by human and automated essay grading system, (e-rater [28]). Then the average is taken. AEG might provide precisely the platform we need to explicate many of the features those characterize good and bad writing and many of the linguistic, cognitive and other skills those underline the human capability for both reading and writing. They can also provide time-to-time feedback to the writers/students by using that the people can improve their writing skill. A meticulous research of last couple of years has helped us to understand the existing systems which are based on AI & Machine Learning techniques and finding the loopholes and at the end to propose a system, which will work under Indian context, presently for English language influenced by local languages. Currently most of the essay grading systems is used for grading pure English essays or essays written in pure European languages. In India we have almost 21 recognized languages and influence of these local languages, in English, is very much here. Due to the influence of local languages and English written by nonnative English speakers (ie. Indians) the result of TOEFL exams has shown lower scores against Indian students (also Asian students). This paper focuses on the existing automated essay grading systems, basic technologies behind them and proposes a new framework to over come the problems of influence of local Indian languages in English essays while correcting and by providing proper feedback to the writers.

In this paper we propose a hybrid classification technique to extract fuzzy rules from the support vector machine and evaluate the rules against decision tree classifier constructed from the same support vector machine. The hybrid approach proceeds in three major steps. In the first step we use training patterns with class labels to build an SVM model that gives the support vectors with acceptable accuracy. Fuzzy rules are generated using the extracted support vectors during second step. In the final step the resulting rule set is tested using the test data of the problem. The quality of the extracted rules is then evaluated in terms of accuracy and fidelity. It is found that the proposed hybrid approach using fuzzy rules yielded highest accuracy and fidelity compared to hybrid with decision tree classifier.	[Farquad, M. A.

Majority Filter-based Minority Prediction (MFMP): An Approach for Unbalanced Datasets	2008 IEEE REGION 10 CONFERENCE: TENCON 2008, VOLS 1-4	TENCON-IEEE Region 10 Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Region 10 Conference (TENCON 2008)	NOV 19-21, 2008	Hyderabad, INDIA	IEEE		Clustering; Classification; Random Under-sampling; Selective Sampling; Unbalanced dataset		For many data mining and machine learning applications predicting minority class samples from skewed unbalanced data sets is a crucial problem. To address this problem, we propose a majority filter-based minority prediction (MFMP) approach for unbalanced datasets. The MFMP adopts an unsupervised learning technique for selecting samples for supervised learning. The approach is based on two steps. In the first-step, minority samples are clustered and majority class samples that are out of minority classification regions are identified. This improves minority prediction rate. In the second step majority samples are randomly selected in individual clusters and this enhances majority prediction rate. Experimentally we studied the behavior of MFMP approach and compared with the traditional random under-sampling approach on a synthetic data set and three UCI repository datasets using the following classifiers: decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes and Radial basis function network. Precision, Recall and F-Measure are used for evaluating performance of classifiers. The experimental evidence suggests that MFMP approach exhibits good prediction rates over minority and majority classes on all classifiers. Furthermore, the proposed approach outperforms the traditional random under-sampling approach. MFMP applied on the decision tree gave better prediction as compared to other classifiers studied.

Machine learning techniques such as Decision trees have been applied to the field of intrusion detection. Machine learning techniques can learn normal and anomalous patterns from training data and generate classifiers that are used to detect attacks on computer system. In general the input to classifiers is in a high dimension feature space, but not all features are relevant to the classes to be classified. Feature selection is a very important step in classification since the inclusion of irrelevant and redundant features often degrade the performance of classification algorithms both in speed and accuracy. In this paper, we have considered three different approaches for feature selection, Chi square, Information Gain and ReliefF which is based on filter approach. A comparative study of the three approaches is done using decision tree as classifier. The KDDcup 99 data set is used to train and test the decision tree classifiers.

To make an energy-efficient WSN application, power consumption due to raw data collection and pre-processing needs to be kept to a minimum level. In this paper, an energy-efficient data acquisition method has investigated for WSN applications using modern machine learning techniques. In an existing system, four sensor nodes were placed in each railway wagon to collect data to develop a monitoring system for railways. In this system, three sensor nodes were placed in each wagon to collect the same data using popular regression algorithms, which reduces power consumption of the system. This study was conducted using six different regression algorithms with five different datasets. Finally the best suitable algorithm have suggested based on the performance metrics of the algorithms that include: correlation coefficient, root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), root relative squared error (RRSE), relative absolute error (RAE) and computation complexity.

In this paper, a new methodology for slip detection during grasping by robot grippers/end-effectors using tactile sensor has been presented. During the object slippage, the tactile sensor in touch with the object surface travels along the peaks and valleys of surface texture of the object which creates vibratory motions in the tactile. A newly developed mathematical model is used to compute the scattered energy of vibrations, which contains parameters of surface texture geometry as well as trial grasping force, and other relevant parameters. Using the scattered energy of vibrations predicted by soft computing techniques, an attempt to instantly estimate the adequate grasping force has been reasonably successful. Surface texture data, for experimental estimation of grasping force, were collected from a huge number of machined specimens and were used to build four different machine learning estimation techniques. Experimental results using Linear Regression (LR), Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Pace Regression (PR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) demonstrate a relatively better technique for industrial applications.

In such cases, machine learning offers a promising alternative for approximating the robot dynamics using measured data. This approach offers a natural framework to incorporate unknown nonlinearities as well as to continually adapt online for changes in the robot dynamics. However, the most accurate regression methods, e.g. Gaussian processes regression (GPR) and support vector regression (SVR), suffer from exceptional high computational complexity which prevents their usage for large numbers of samples or online learning to date. Inspired by locally linear regression techniques, we propose an approximation to the standard GPR using local Gaussian processes models inspired by [11, [2]. Due to reduced computational cost, local Gaussian processes (LGP) can be applied for larger sample-sizes and online learning. Comparisons with other nonparametric regressions, e.g. standard GPR, v-SVR and locally weighted projection regression (LWPR), show that LGP has higher accuracy than LWPR and close to the performance of standard GPR and v-SVR while being sufficiently fast for online learning.

The navigation task requires identifying safe, traversable paths which allow the robot to progress toward a goal while avoiding obstacles. Machine learning techniques-in particular, classifier ensembles-are well adapted to this task, accomplishing near-to-far learning by augmenting near-field stereo readings in order to identify safe terrain and obstacles in the far field. Composition of the ensemble and subsequent combination of model outputs in this dynamic problem domain remain open questions. Recently, Ensemble Selection has been proposed as a mechanism for selecting and combining models from an existing model library and shown to perform well in static domains. We propose the adaptation of this technique to the time-evolving data associated with the outdoor robot navigation domain. Important research questions as to the composition of the model library, as well as how to combine selected models' outputs, are addressed in a two-factor experimental evaluation. We evaluate the performance of our technique on six fully labeled datasets, and show that our technique outperforms memoryless baseline techniques that do not leverage past experience.

Robotic systems can take advantage of simple, highly reliable spatial scaffolding cues to learn from human teachers. We present an integrated robotic architecture that combines social attention and machine learning components to learn tasks effectively from natural spatial scaffolding interactions with human teachers. We evaluate the performance of this architecture via a human subjects experiment which examines our humanoid robot's ability to learn from live interactions with human teachers in a secret-constraint task domain. This evaluation provides quantitative evidence for the utility of spatial scaffolding cues to systems that learn from natural human teaching behavior.

The most challenging step is de-illumination, where unlike existing methods that require either the 3D geometry or expensive setups, we show that the problem can be solved with relatively simple kernel regression models. For this purpose, the problem of decomposing an observed image into its intrinsic components, i.e. reflectance and albedo, is formulated as a nonlinear regression problem. The estimation of an intrinsic component is then accomplished by estimating local linear constraints on images in terms of derivatives using multi-scale patches of the observed images, comprising from a three-level Laplacian Pyramid.

Although the existing framework can. be applied to (and does have power against) the subpixel case, it is possible to optimize that framework for the subpixel case when the size of the anomalous change is known. The limit of inLntesimally small anomaly turns out to be well deLned, and provides a new parameter-free anomalous change detector which is effective over a range of subpixel anomalies, and continues to have reasonable power against the full-pixel case.

The challenge is to race against an opponent around a track, trying to get as many points as possible. Previous research on similar problems are mostly based on either state-based or action-based controller architectures trained with machine learning techniques. In this paper, a hybrid controller architecture is presented, combining both the advantages of the existing architectures. The main component of the controller is designed as fuzzy systems whose membership functions are changeable according to the context. Finally, the competition results are given.

This adaptive agent is applied to the city placement selection task in the commercial computer game Civilization IV. The city placement selection determines the founding sites for the cities in this turn-based empire building game from the Civilization series. Our aim is the creation of an adaptive machine learning approach for a task which is originally performed by a complex deterministic script. This machine learning approach results in a more challenging and dynamic computer AI. We present the preliminary findings on the performance of our reinforcement learning approach and we make a comparison between the performance of the adaptive agent and the original static game AI. Both the comparison and the performance measurements show encouraging results. Furthermore the behaviour and performance of the learning algorithm are elaborated and ways of extending our work are discussed.

While the biological, functional and molecular basis of this interaction between the response elements and their corresponding transcription factor is not fully understood, the sequences of these HREs are known to be conserved for certain nucleotides. Machine learning processes have enabled researchers to predict and identify HREs in a quick and efficient manner. We had previously constructed a statistical model for HRE prediction from approximately 700 experimentally validated HRE sequences. To see if we can improve the performance of our statistical model for HRE prediction, we propose a phylogeny-adaptive model for HRE detection which takes into account the phylogenetic relationship of the sequences. The results of our analysis show that the new model ensures minimal false positive predictions.

Since the biological data is highly non-linear, the machine-learning techniques have been widely used for modeling it. In the present work, the clustering, genetic algorithm (GA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) are used to develop computational prediction models on a dataset of HIV protease inhibitors. The hybrid GA- ANN technique is used for feature selection. The ANN-QSAR prediction models are then developed to link the structures to their reported biological activity. These models can be useful for predicting the biological activity of new untested HIV protease inhibitors and virtual screening for identifying new lead compounds.

Our aim in this paper is to compare several commonly-used sparsity measures according to intuitive attributes that a sparsity measure should have. Sparsity of representations of signals in fields such as blind source separation, compression, sampling and signal analysis has proved not just to be useful but a key factor in the success of algorithms in these areas. Intuitively, a sparse representation is one in which a small number of coefficients contain a large proportion of the energy. In this paper we discuss six properties (Robin Hood, Scaling, Rising Tide, Cloning, Bill Gates and Babies) that we believe a sparsity measure should have. The main contribution of this paper is a table which classifies commonly-used sparsity measures based on whether or not they satisfy these six propositions.

The system uses analog computation, and consists of cyclostationary feature extraction and a radial basis function network for classification. The description of the system is partially abstract, but our design choices are motivated by domain knowledge and we believe the system will be feasible for future nanotechnology implementation. We describe an error model for the system, and simulate experimental performance and fault tolerance of the system in recognizing WLAN signals, under different levels of input noise and computational errors. The system performs well under the expected non-ideal manufacturing and operating conditions.

Seizure prediction is a major field of neurological research, enabled by statistical analysis methods applied to features derived from intracranial Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of brain activity. However, no reliable seizure prediction method is ready for clinical applications. In this study, we use modern machine learning techniques to predict seizures from a number of features proposed in the literature. We concentrate on aggregated features that encode the relationship between pairs of EEG channels, such as cross-correlation, nonlinear interdependence, difference of Lyapunov exponents and wavelet analysis-based synchrony such as phase locking. We compare L1-regularized logistic regression, convolutional networks, and support vector machines. Results are reported on the standard Freiburg EEG dataset which contains data from 21 patients suffering from medically intractable focal epilepsy. For each patient, at least one method predicts 100% of the seizures on average 60 minutes before the onset, with no false alarm. Possible future applications include implantable devices capable of warning the patient of an upcoming seizure as well as implanted drug-delivery devices.

Currently, since P2P applications consume a great percentage of Internet bandwidth, certain network optimization strategies are needed to improve the nerwork performance. Traffic identification is the most important component that could be adopted in these optimization strategies. In this paper, we focus on developing a machine learning strategy to perform quick identification, and continuous tracking of flows associated with various P2P media streaming and file sharing applications. With the use (if Random Forests (RF) and evaluated by using 10-fold cross validation, our method achieves greater than 98% accuracy rate and 89% precision rate of identifying the P2P flows, with less than 1% false positive rate. With the help of winner-lake-all strategy, the generalization performance of using the RF built with data collected from one network to classify flows in other networks can achieve accuracy of being over 97%, with the precision being over 81% and the FP rate being below 2%.

These statistics are used a, input for three machine learning algorithms, which generate models for overall Survival and event-free survival. The results obtained by these methods are better than the ones obtained by visual analysis, and competitive or better than the ones obtained by a quantitative measure of prognosis. Besides, the results indicate that there is a lot of redundant information coming from the images, and only 2 out of 10 attributes might be enough to predict prognosis.

But their training require to solve a quadratic optimization problem so that training time increases dramatically with the increase of the training set size. Hence, standard SVM have difficulty in handling large scale problems. In this paper, we present a new fast training algorithm for soft margin Support Vector Classification. This algorithm searches for successive efficient feasible directions. A heuristic for searching the direction maximally correlated with the gradient is applied and the optimum step size of the optimization algorithm is analytically determined. Furthermore the solution, gradient and objective function are recursively obtained. In order to deal with large scale problems, the Gram matrix has not to be stored. Our iterative algorithm fully exploits quadratic functions properties. F-SVC is very simple, easy to implement and able to perform on large data sets.

Often, a linear projection in which classes are separable may exist, but is hard to find. In the absence of methods that can find such plane, one may unnecessarily resort to nonlinear dimension reduction (DR). Generalization of two-class separation criteria such as Mahalanobis, Bhattacharya, or Chernoff distance are often done in an ad-hoc fashion. In this paper, we propose two algorithms for multiclass LDR that aim at minimizing upper bounds on the probability of misclassification and are based on generalizations of Chemoff distance for the multiclass problem. We present a numerical study and comparison to state-of-the-art LDR methods on datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. We show that our algorithms result in lower classification error rates compared to techniques of the same class.

Support Vector Classification using a Sinc-Cauchy hybrid wavelet kernel is presented in this paper A hybrid wavelet kernel construction for support vector machine is introduced. The construction involves a multidimensional sinc wavelet function together with Cauchy kernel. Me show that the kybrid kernel is an admissible kernel. Hybrid kernels provide better classification of the signal points in the mapped feature space. The Sinc-Cauchy hybrid kernel thus constructed is used for the classification of Cardiac Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images and Cardiac Arrhythmia signals. The experimental results show that promising generalization performance can be achieved with the hybrid kernel., compared to conventional kernels.

We present an approach for kernel machine learning and generalization performance assessment that integrates concepts from prior work on Rademacher-type data-dependent generalization bounds and learning based on the optimization of quasi-convex losses. Our main contribution focuses on the direct estimation of the Rademacher penalty in order to obtain a tighter generalization bound.

After a preliminary analysis of the Zulu data used for our experiments, we concentrate on supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised approaches comparing strengths and weaknesses of each method. The challenges we face are limited data availability and data sparsity in connection with morphological analysis of indigenous languages. At the end of the paper we draw conclusions for our future work towards a morphological analyzer for Zulu.

Since the latter will be based on machine learning approaches, we created training data by annotating a corpus with the needed content. Given a sentence Of our transcribed corpus, domain concepts and other linguistic levels ranging from basic ones, i.e. part-of-speech tagging and constituent chunking level, to more advanced ones, i.e. syntactic and predicate argument structure (PAS) levels are annotated. In particular, the proposed PAS and taxonomy of dialog acts appear to be promising for the design of more complex dialog systems. Statistics about our semantic annotation are reported.

The two approaches used are support vector machines (SVMs) and mixtures of probabilistic PCA (MPPCA). While recognition in the PLP domain attains superb accuracy on clean data, it is significantly affected by mismatch between training and test noise levels. Classification in the high-dimensional acoustic waveform domain, on the other hand, is more robust in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise. We also show some results on the effects of custom-designed kernel functions for SVM classification in the acoustic waveform domain.

This may be possible due to proper allocation of resources on fault prone parts of the design and code of the software. Hence, importance and usefulness of such metrics is understandable, but empirical validation of these metrics is always a great challenge. Random Forest (RF) algorithm has been successfully applied for solving regression and classification problems in many applications. This paper evaluates the capability of RF algorithm in predicting fault prone software classes using open source software. The results indicate that the prediction performance of Random Forest is good. However, similar types of studies are required to be carried out in order to establish the acceptability of the RF model.

But data in real-world is usually imbalanced. The class imbalance problem is pervasive and ubiquitous, causing trouble to a large segment of the data mining community. The tradition machine learning algorithms have bad performance when they learn from imbalanced data sets. Thus, machine learning on imbalanced data sets becomes an urgent problem. The importance of imbalanced data sets and their broad application domains in data mining are introduced, and then methods to deal with the class imbalance problem are discussed and their effectiveness are compared. Last but not least, the existing evaluation measures of class imbalance problem are systematically analyzed.

Systems are employed to detect internet anomaly play a vital role in internet security. To solve this problem, a technique called Frequent Episode Rules (FERs) base on Data Mining has been introduced into anomaly detection system (ADS). These episode rules are used to distinguish anomalous sequences of TCP, UDP, or ICMP connections from normal traffic episodes. Unfortunately, this technique is so depend on the machine learning that we may get some false alarms if the results of machine learning cannot cover all the normal traffic data. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for internet anomaly detection with weighted fuzzy matching over frequent episode rules. We use weighted fuzzy matching algorithm to match the rules, though machine learning may not cover all the normal traffic. The results show that the proposed approach can improve the detection performance of the ADS, where only pure frequent episode rule is used.

In this paper, we apply an unsupervised machine learning approach based on clustering by exploiting the characteristic of applications. This approach uses an improved K-Means clustering algorithm named as I-K-Means. I-K-Means uses a transcendental initial value for K and assigns an individual weight value for each feature of the cluster. The results of the experiments show that I-K-Means has better performance than generic K-Means.

In some applications, however, background prior knowledge can be easily obtained, such as pairwise constraints. Therefore, semi-supervised learning is getting increasing attention in recent Years. In this paper, a new algorithm named self-tuning semi-supervised spectral clustering (STS(3)C) is proposed We incorporate two types of instance-level constraints-must-link and cannot-link into SC and use self-tuning parameter to solve the scaling parameter selection problem in SC. Experimental results over four datasets from UCI machine learning repository, show that STS(3)C performs better than semi-supervised spectral clustering with fixed scaling parameter, and also avoids the time-consuming procedure of parameter selection.

In this context, telecare systems emerge as a cheap and effective approach. A telecare system helps elderly and care-dependent people to satisfy their needs and special requirements, requiring fewer resources and enabling users to be at their own homes. The purpose of this paper is to define a telecare Conceptual System Architecture based on ontologies, rules and inference engines, machine learning techniques and data mining procedures. Some open sources are also proposed in order to develop certain modules of this architecture. The approach tries to provide a representation of an entire telecare system, offering customised solutions for users, professional care facilities and service centres.

This is done within the context of a generic system for the visual surface inspection of manufactured parts. The issues treated are relevant not only to wider computer vision applications, but also to classification more generally Some of these issues arise from the nature of humans themselves: they will be not only internally inconsistent, but will often not be completely confident about their decisions, especially if they are making decisions rapidly People will also often differ systematically from each other in the decisions they make. Other issues may arise from the nature of the process, which may require the machine learning to have the capacity for real-time, online adaptation in response to users' input. It may be that the users cannot always provide input to a consistent level of detail. We describe how all of these issues may be tackled within a coherent methodology. Using a range of classifiers trained on real data sets from a CD imprint production process, we will present results which show that properly addressing most of these issues may actually lead to improved performance.

The aim of this method is to extract credit scoring models from data that not only have the required performance, but is also relatively interpretable, which is very important to predict effectively the creditworthiness of the new customers and to understand the decision process of the model. To achieve these two objectives: accuracy and interpretability, an evolutionary-neurofuzzy method is adopted. In the first phase, a fuzzy rule base is automatically extracted from a data set using a clustering method, then genetic algorithm is used to increase the performance of the fuzzy inference system in the second phase. In the last phase a multi-objective genetic algorithm is applied to achieve two goals: to preserve the accuracy of the fuzzy model to a given value and to enhance the interpretability of the fuzzy model by reducing the fuzzy sets in the rule base. Two datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository are selected to evaluate the proposed method.	[Lahsasna, A.; Ainon, R.

The speech recognition uses neural nets, hidden Markov models, Bayesian networks, DTW and other tools for recognizing the particular speech. The classification modules are playing a very important role in most of the modern speech recognition systems. The performance of the speech recognition systems is based on the classification techniques used for training the systems. Broadly, two methods are considered for developing the classification modules using either statistical methods or discriminative methods. To overcome from the occurred weaknesses, a new machine learning technique called Support Vector Machine is introduced. This paper provides an overview of speech recognition system using support vector machines. Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a new approach to pattern classification that automatically control generalization, which gives good generalization and has been applied to various tasks, and parameterization as part of the overall optimization process. Specifically, SVM will be used to classify speech patterns.	[Sonkamble, Balwant A.] PICT, Pune, Maharashtra, India	Sonkamble, BA (reprint author), PICT, Pune, Maharashtra, India.

Multi layer neural network trained using backpropagation algorithm is used to segment the color image. The results show that the algorithm is able to segment the images reliably with less appearance of small blobs. This will help improve the accuracy and minimize the processing time of the subsequent processes in the robot vision system where real-time issue is of important.

To reduce traffic accidents, it is necessary to improve not only active safety technology, but also the driver awareness about driving safety. One of the methods to increase the driver awareness is to inform the degree of safety of driving behavior. To realize the system, it is necessary to develop the driving behavior recognition algorithm by sensing data of drive recorder. Therefore, this study focuses on lane change recognition method and develops the algorithm by sequential labeling method based on boosting framework; Boosted Conditional Random Fields. To develop the algorithm, four features are focused here to train the model: those are, velocity, steering wheel angle, moving variance and moving standard deviation. Finally, the recognition results are shown, and the best features in machine learning process for recognition algorithm are examined.

The proposed method uses principal component analysis (PCA) for global property and locality preserving projections (LPP) for local property of the pattern. PCA is known for preserving the most descriptive ones after projection while LPP is known for preserving the neighborhood structure of the data set. Our combing method integrates global and local descriptive information and finds a richer set of alternatives beyond PCA and LPP in a 2-D parametric space. In order to find the hybrid features adaptively and find optimal parameters, we employ the genetic algorithm (GA). Experiments are performed with UCI machine learning repository to show the performance of the proposed algorithm.

But the requirements for reasonable feature extraction are sophisticated and depend on different applications. Based on machine learning, an approach to gradient feature extraction using double thresholds is provided for feature list object matching in this paper. By training, the double thresholds adapted to the special application can be automatically estimated, where an unsupervised learning means is used. Then, the estimated double thresholds are used to the extraction of gradient feature points for the features list matching. The proposed method has been verified by the experiments.

The Omni-directional vision is provided by various image systems. Fisheye lens is one of the most efficient ways to establish omni-directional image systems. However fisheye lens images, which can include a 2 pi steradian field of view, appear with an unavoidable inherent distortion. But it can be corrected with image processing techniques. A method for geometric restoration of such distorted images is derived in this paper. A simple method of correcting the distortion of fisheye image by means of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to replace ordinary correction model is proposed., SVM is a machine learning method based on the theory of statistics, which have good capabilities of imitating, regression and classification. The approach using SVM provides a mapping between the fisheye image and the standard image for human eyes, which involves a coordinate conversion between fisheye image and real world view. According to this method we don't need to evaluate the various parameters of the distortion and to concern the projection model of fisheye lens which usually needs to be acquired from the manufacturer. Finally, the experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the method for real time image process and the results are satisfactory for image restoration.

Zero pronoun recognition was treated as the problem of finding missing verbs logic arguments. First, based on automatic main verbs identification, syntax hierarchies were analysed. Second, combining the syntax hierarchy and verbal logic valence theory, zero pronouns were identified. And then using a machine learning approach, zero pronouns were resolved. Experimental results on 150 news articles indicated that the precision and recall of zero pronoun detection is 72.9% and 92.7% respectively, and the accuracy of antecedent estimation is 64.3%.. These results demonstrated this zero pronouns identifying and resolving method works effectively.

This paper presents a new algorithm called IETreeCS(Concept Sets based on Intension and Extension Tree) based on the IE-Tree(Intension and Extension Tree) and characteristic space partitions. The IETreeCS algorithm firstly defines an IE-Tree, and then it converts the formal context into the IE-Tree to reduce the storage of data sets. The paper also defines characteristic spaces and describes how to partition a characteristic space on the basis of the IE-Tree, and finally presents an integrated algorithm that generates all concepts efficiently from a binary relation. The experimental results show that the IETreeCS algorithm performs much better than the NextClosure and SSPCG algorithms in the large-scale sparse data sets or distributed data sets.

The directionatity feature of curvelet transform makes it a good choice for representation of curves and edges in the image. The second generation curvelet transform theory makes it understood and implemented more easily. In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed to improve compression performance by using the second generation curvelet transform and SVM (Support Vector Machine) regression. The method is also compared with image compression method based on wavelet transform. Experimental results show that the compression performance of our method gains much improvement. Moreover, the algorithm works fairly well for declining block effect at higher compression ratios.

This paper addresses this problem by integrating several machine learning algorithms. The approach proposed relies on a classification system to determine the likelihood of component failures and to provide rough indications of remaining life. It then introduces clustering and SVM-based local regression to refine the time to failure estimations provided by the classification system. The paper illustrates the applicability of the proposed approach through a real world aerospace application and discusses data pre-processing requirements. The preliminary results show that the proposed method can reduce uncertainty in time to failure estimates, which in turn helps augment the usefulness of prognostics.

We describe a system for context aware multi-homing and mobility handling which enacts network interface allocation and handoff decisions based on the predicted characteristics of transport layer sockets and network interfaces. Predictions are made using a statistical machine learning technique which can utilise simple context data such as time-of-day and GPS co-ordinates, as well as more complex contextual information such as nearby Blueooth beacons and internal system state. We present a prototype implementation of the described system and show via experimentation that it enables more timely mobility handling without requiring changes to either applications or to the underlying operating system.

The simple techniques currently used in practice, such as looking at the transport port numbers or at the application payload, are increasingly less effective for new applications using random port numbers and/or encryption. Therefore, there is increasing interest in machine learning techniques capable of identifying applications by examining features of the associated traffic process such as packet lengths and interarrival times. However, these techniques require that the classification algorithm is trained with examples of the traffic generated by the applications to be identified, possibly on the link where the the classifier will operate. In this paper we provide two new contributions. First, we apply the C4.5 decision tree algorithm to the problem of early application identification (i.e. looking at the first packets of the flow) and show that it has better performance than the algorithms proposed in the literature. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of the classifier when training is performed on a link different from the link where the classifier operates. This is an important issue, as a pre-trained portable classifier would greatly facilitate the deployment and management of the classification infrastructure.

In order to improve the accuracy of the forecasting, we apply an integrated architecture to optimize the prediction. Based on an integration of two machine learning techniques: Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm Search approach based on test-sample error estimate criterion (AFSAS-TEE) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), we proposed a novel forecasting model for future electricity load forecasting. On the one hand the theory of Phase Space Reconstruction (PSR) technique was used for nonlinear dynamic system analysis with the chaotic load series and on the other hand a AFSAS-TEE tuning system is proposed to choose the parameters of SVR automatically in time series prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated with actual data taken from the Australia Power Grid, and the actual data are compared with the presented and Neural Networks (NN) methods.

Traditional credit rating models employ classical econometrics - methods with heteroscedasticity adjustments across various industries. In this paper, we propose using machine learning techniques in predicting corporate ratings and demonstrate, empirically, that multiclass machine learning algorithms outperform traditional econometrics models in exact, 1-notch, or 2-notch away rating predictions. We use three years of CompuStat data from four very different industries and compare corporate credit rating prediction tasks across linear regression. ordered probit model, bagged decision tree with Laplace smoothing, multiclass support vector machines (SVM), and multiclass proximal support vector machines (PSVM). Our findings show. that with the proper multiclass and heteroscedasticity adjustments, the computationally inexpensive-multiclass PSVM can be utilized in making viable automated corporate credit rating systems for today's vast marketplace.

It uses an index called "SIG" to select the suitable level of granularity and two membership functions to describe the features of information granules, then knowledge rules abstracted from the information granules are used to predict unknown patterns. The experimental results show that the FIG model can improve classification performance, and the performance indexes, such as G-mean, also show its better performance on skewed datasets than C4.5.

The state-of-the-art techniques for tackling this task are mostly based on statistical language learning. How human parsing sentences is also an important research topic attracting research efforts for decades in the field of cognitive psychology. Some behavioristic experiments have convinced that the interactionist approach is rational and effective to simulate human parsing mechanism. This paper presents a sentence parser, the Interactionist Parser, which incorporated the cognitive interactionist approach with semantic information and simple recurrent networks, to extend and enrich the techniques for sentence parsing. Thinking of the parsing efficiency, the semantic information of two word types, noun and verb, are included during the parsing procedure in current stage. The experimental results demonstrate that the Interactionist Parser has comparability with the state-of-the-art parsing techniques based on statistical language learning.

Document clustering description is a problem of labeling the clustered results of document collection clustering. It can help users determine whether one of the clusters is relevant to users' information requirement. To resolve the problem of the weak readability of the traditional document clustering results, a method of automatic labeling documents clusters based on machine learning is put forward. Experimental results show that the method based on SVM will provide users with more concise and comprehensive document clustering results.

In this paper, the dynamic recognition classifier is constructed based on two types of learning. The static aspect of the learning is ensured by classifiers or systems of classifiers, while the dynamic aspect is translated by the learning of the planning of the various states by fuzzy Petri nets.

However, the practicability of SVM is affected due to the difficulty of selecting appropriate SVM parameters. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a new. optimization method, which is motivated by social behavior of bird flocking or fish schooling. The optimization method not only has strong global search capability, but also is very easy to implement. Thus, in the study, the proposed PSO-SVM model is applied to fault diagnosis of turbo-generator, among which PSO is used to determine free parameters of support vector machine. Finally, the effectiveness and correctness of this method are validated by the results of fault diagnosis examples. Consequently PSO-SVM is a proper method in fault diagnosis of turbo-generator.

In this paper a new semi-supervised SVM algorithm is proposed. It applies tri-training to improve SVM. The semi-supervised SVM makes use of the large number of unlabeled data to modify the classifiers iteratively. Although tri-training doesn't put any constraints on the classifier, the proposed method uses three different SVMs as the classification algorithm. Experiments on UCI datasets show that tri-training can improve the classification accuracy of SVM and can increase the difference of classifiers, the accuracy of final classifier will be higher.

Due to the ineffectiveness of traditional port-based and payload-based methods, recent works proposed using machine learning methods to classify flows based on statistical characteristics. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning techniques on the real-time traffic classification problem. We identify the most suitable ML, classifier for network traffic classification by comparing various ML schemes, including both supervised and unsupervised methods. We also apply feature selection to identify significant features. Finally, we simulate real-time classification by using features derived from the first few packets of each flow. The results show that classifiers based on decision tree outperform others on both accuracy and performance; and that classifiers based on early flow properties can achieve high accuracy while reducing the computational complexity.

Unfortunately, deriving the signatures manually is very time consuming and difficult. Machine learning has been widely used in network data analysis. But existing studies mostly considered statistical network flow attributes such as packet size distributions, for that there aren't so Jar efficient solutions to extract signatures based on application-level content. The association rules algorithm may be the key to solve the problem, but its unavailable while itemset is a permutation of items or transaction is a set of itemsets. Aiming at this problem, the paper provides a signatures extracting algorithm based on offset constraint, which present the notion of Sequence Itemset and Offset Attribute Set, remedying the defect of association rules algorithm. The results indicate that signatures extracted by this approach is highly accurate for apply to online application identification.

This paper applies the multi-classification method based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) to vehicle recognition. Support vector machine, appeared recently, is a new theory and technology in the filed of pattern recognition and has shown excellent performance in practice. This method was proposed basing on Structural Risk Minimization (SRM) in place of Experiential Risk Minimization (ERM), thus it has good generalization capability. By mapping input data into a high dimensional characteristic space in which an optimal separating hyperplane is built, SVM presents a lot of advantages for resolving the small samples, nonlinear and high dimensional pattern recognition, as well as other machine-learning problems such as function fitting. The simulation results show that the proposed method is effective and feasible.

However, the conventional authentications methods using the EEG require heavy computational load: AR modeling and/or machine learning. In this paper, we propose simple spectral features of the EEG to make the authentication system using the EEG more practical.

Some commercial tools for collecting network traffic data exist, such as SNORT. The traffic data collected from the network using these tools, however, usually doesn't fit the format requirement of the input data for data mining systems. Thus transforming the network traffic data into the required format is mandate for a data mining system to induce network intrusion detection rules. In this paper, collecting the network packet information using SNORT is introduced, storing the collected data into the MySq1 database is presented, and selecting the significant data in the database and transforming them to the format of input data for a data mining system See5 is discussed. The data collection, selection, and transformation approaches illustrated in this paper have been used in the Information Fusion in Sensor Based Intrusion Detection System that is being under development in our Computer Security Research Laboratory. The system framework is briefly introduced and the preliminary results for data collection from multiple resources are illustrated.

First, we model standard audio parameters with Gaussian mixture models (GMM). Then, symmetric Kullback-Leiber divergences between models are approximated with a Monte-Carlo method. We use these statistical dissimilarities to find a low-dimensional representation of each audio sequence through Multidimensional scaling (MDS) algorithm. Vectors in low-dimensional spaces are then easily explored with kernel and clustering methods. Experiments carried out in different kind of audio databases (music, speakers and languages) show good potential of the proposed approach and provide a framework for more challenging applications.

The importance of classifier diversity in MCS has been raised recently; nevertheless, only a few of the researches have been studied in land cover classification problem. In this paper, a SPOT IV satellite image covering the Hong Kong Island and Kowloon Peninsula with six land cover classes were classified with four base classifiers: Minimum Distance Classifier, Maximum Likelihood Classifier, Mahalanobis Classifier and K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier. Same training and testing data sets were applied throughout the experiments and five Bayesian decision rules, including product rule, sum rule, max rule, min rule, and median rule, were utilized to construct different ensemble of classifiers. Performance of MCS was measured using the overall accuracy and kappa statistics, and three statistical tests including McNemar's Test, Cochran's Q Test and F-Test were introduced to examine the dependence of the classification results. The experimental comparison reveals that i. increasing number of base classifiers may not improve the overall accuracy in MCS, ii. significant diversity in base classifiers cannot enhance the overall performance and vice versa. These findings are noted with the condition in using the same data set and the same training set.

In the processed-food industry where the external quality attributes of the product are inspected visually before the packaging line, machine vision systems often involve the extraction of a larger number of features than those actually needed to ensure proper quality control. This work experiments with several feature selection techniques in order to reduce the number of attributes analyzed by a real-time vision-based food inspection system, Four filter-based and wrapper-based feature selectors are evaluated on seeded buns and tortillas datasets. Experimental results show that consistency-based and the RELIEF subset evaluation techniques perform the best for all the considered datasets in terms of accuracy However, variations in the number of attributes selected still vary significantly between these techniques.

Generalization performance is the key of soft-sensing technique. Therefore, it is significant that conducting research aiming at improving the generalization performance of soft sensor. This paper analyses the principle and disadvantage of empirical risk minimization, indicates the reasons why artificial neural network based on empirical risk minimization has the poor generalization performance. From the perspective of relationship between complexity and generalization capacity on Machine learning, principle of structural risk minimization is expounded and the advantages comparing to empirical risk minimization are indicated. On the basis of contrast of mathematical expressions, topology and main training algorithm on RBF neural network and Support Vector Machine, in order to improve generalization performance of soft sensor, a modeling method of soft sensor based on Support Vectors-RBF neural network suitable for regression is proposed and expounded in theory: Taking classical cholesterin data set in MTLAB 6.5 as an example, simulation presents that Support Vector set-RBF neural network modeling method is superior to RBF neural network and evenly can compare with SVM in generalization performance.

As case of Hubei Province, China, this paper selects seven land-use change driving force factors and uses data from 1986 to 2000 as training sample and another set from 2001 to 2004 as test sample, building regression simulation model based on SVM between data of arable land area and driving force factors. Then four kernel function models of SVM are used to simulate the process and the results are compared. It indicates that the accuracy of the four is comparatively high and RBF kernel function is the best one. The study shows that the SVM model has these intelligent features of self-learning and self-adaptive, and capability to solve practical problems of the land use change such as small samples, nonlinear functions. It can be predicted that SVM model would be widely applied in the simulation of land-use change process.

Today, to meet the increasing need of electricity resource, a great number of large reservoirs are being or will be built in western China. RIS has been received much attention because it is known for its potential large devastation to natural environment and people. Because of poor understanding of the mechanism of RIS, it is still difficult to give accurate estimation using conventional methods. How to forecast magnitude of RIS effectively for safety has become an unresolved key problem. A new method based on Gaussian Process (GP), which is a newly developed machine learning method with excellent capability of classification for solving pattern recognition problem of highly nonlinear and small sample, is proposed. At first, Information of worldwide historical cases of RIS with the real records of magnitude and influence factors of RIS are collected into database and are taken as prior knowledge for GP model. Reservoir depth, tectonic stress, lithologic character, activity background of seismictiy, activity of fault, development degree of geology structure plane, connectivity between geology structure plane and reservoir water, development degree of carst, which can reflect the internal and exterior conditions of RIS occurrence nicely, are suggested to be main influential factors of RIS. Then, through learning process by GP model, the nonlinear mapping relationship between RIS magnitude and its influence factors is established easily and quickly. Finally, forecast for the novel conditions can be obtained by using the model. The new model was applied in forecast for RIS magnitude at Three Gorges reservoir in China.

Instead of inherence of samples, only parts of characters of series are emphasized. Time series in different granular space are constructed in the paper. We apply,the Quotient Space Theory to simulate the thought of people and to analyze the attributes of the different time series. Generally, it is a process from granularity coarse to thin step by step. The samples in different granular space will be constructed based on this novel method, which, can mine the essence of information in or among the data. Constructive machine learning method (the Covering Algorithm) and BP algorithm are combined to form an ensemble-learning machine for samples studying. This method not only takes advantage of the high accuracy of categorizations by the constructive machine learning method, but also overcomes its shortcomings that the prediction results are not continuous values but discrete values. The experimental results show that using this novel method to forecast and analyze air quality is effective and the prediction accuracy is better than that of commonly used statistical models and the single machine learning method. Multi-granular Ensemble Learning Method improves the accuracy of time-series predictions effectively, and offers a new way to the application of time-series prediction, a new model to the research of Environmental Sciences.

Coordinated Management of Multiple Interacting Resources in Chip Multiprocessors: A Machine Learning Approach	2008 PROCEEDINGS OF THE 41ST ANNUAL IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MICROARCHITECTURE: MICRO-41	International Symposium on Microarchitecture Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	41st Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture	NOV 08-12, 2008	Lake Como, ITALY	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, ACM, Politec, Milano, Intel, hp invent, AMD, ATMEL, Nokia, ST, Microsoft Res, ARM, IBM Res				Efficient sharing of system resources is critical to obtaining high utilization and enforcing system-level performance objectives on chip multiprocessors (CMPs). Although several proposals that address the management of a single microarchitectural resource have been published in the literature, coordinated management of multiple interacting resources on CMPs remains an open problem. We propose a framework that manages multiple shared CMP resources in a coordinated fashion to enforce higher-level performance objectives. We formulate global resource allocation as a machine learning problem. At runtime, our resource management scheme monitors the execution of each application, and learns a predictive model of system performance as a function of allocation decisions. By learning each application's performance response to different resource distributions, our approach makes it possible to anticipate the system-level performance impact of allocation decisions at runtime with little runtime overhead. As a result, it becomes possible to make reliable comparisons among different points in a vast and dynamically changing allocation space, allowing us to adapt our allocation decisions as applications undergo phase changes. Our evaluation concludes that a coordinated approach to managing multiple interacting resources is key to delivering high performance in multiprogrammed workloads, but this is possible only if accompanied by efficient search mechanisms. We also show that it is possible to build a single mechanism that consistently delivers high performance under various important performance metrics.

If to prevent any resulting timing errors, we design processors for worst-case parameter values, we may lose substantial performance. An alternate approach explored in this paper is to design for closer to nominal values, and provide some transistor budget to tolerate unavoidable variation-induced errors. To assess this approach, this paper first presents a novel framework that shows how microarchitecture techniques can trade off variation-induced errors for power and processor frequency. Then, the paper introduces an effective technique to maximize performance and minimize power in the presence of variation-induced errors, namely High-Dimensional dynamic adaptation. F,or efficiency, the technique is implemented using a machine-learning algorithm. The results show that our best configuration increases processor frequency by 56% on average, allowing the processor to cycle 21% faster than without variation. Processor performance increases by 40% on average, resulting in a performance that is 14% higher than without variation - at only a 10.6% area cost.

The Responsive Mirror provides shoppers with real-time "self' and "social" clothes comparisons. The system recommends clothing that is "similar" and "different" than the clothing that the person is tying on in the mirror. The goal of the research in this paper is to create a recommendation system that uses a definition of "similar" and "different" that matches human perception. We address the social nature of the recognition problem by conducting a user study to identify the salient clothes factors that people use to determine clothes similarity. We describe the computer vision and machine learning techniques employed to recognize the factors that human eyes perceive in term of clothing similarity from frontal-view outfit images. We describe the key components of the motion-tracking and clothes-recognition systems and evaluate their performance by user study and experiments on a simulated clothes fitting image dataset. The approach and results presented here will benefit designers and developers of similar applications in the future.

In this paper, we propose a combined use of machine learning techniques (i.e. Support Vector Machines) and Natural Language Processing techniques (i.e. Stanford NLP parser) to tackle the problem of unsupervised key phrases extraction from scientific papers. The proposed method strongly depends on the robust structural properties of a scientific paper as well as on the lexical knowledge that we are able to mine from its text. For the experimental assessment we have use a subset of ACM(1) papers in the Computer Science domain containing 400 documents. Preliminary evaluation of the approach shows promising result that improves - on the same data-set - on state-of-the-art Bayesian learning system KEA(2) from a minimum 17% to a maximum 77% depending on KEA parameters tuning and specific evaluation set. Our assessment is performed by comparison with key phrases assigned by human experts in the specific domain and freely available through ACM portal(3).

Knowing the user's context offers various possibilities for support, like for example enhancing information delivery or providing work guidance. Hence, user interactions have to be aggregated and mapped to predefined task categories. Without machine learning tools, such an assignment has to be done manually. The identification of suitable machine learning algorithms is necessary in order to ensure accurate and timely classification of the user's context without inducing additional workload.

The method is based on language-specific resources available for English. First, documents are translated to English using standard translation software. For polarity detection, sentiment-bearing terms are identified by means of SentiWordNet. Polarity scores calculated for words of three word classes are exploited by a machine learning classifier for determining the document polarity. The introduced method is tested and evaluated on movie reviews in six different languages. The results show that polarity can be correctly determined even if language specific resources are unavailable.

We address this problem through a novel approach: reducing it to the problem of learning classifiers for some meaningful multivariate performance measures. In particular, we show how a powerful machine learning algorithm, Support Vector Machine, can be adapted to solve this problem. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach have been confirmed by our experiments on three real-world datasets.

Users spend a lot of time reading, replying and organizing their emails. To help users organize their email messages, we propose a new framework to help organised and prioritized email better; email reply prediction. The goal is to provide concise, highly structured and prioritized emails, thus saving the user from browsing through each email one by one and help to save time. In this paper, we discuss the features used to differentiate emails, show promising initial results with unsupervised machine learning model, and outline future directions for this work.

Unfortunately, these decisions (e. g., resource allocation, job assignment, etc.) may be complex and thus difficult to model. A few approaches based on Artificial Intelligence methods have already been proposed. Unfortunately, these approaches need explicit knowledge about the decision logic, which is often difficult to obtain or formalize. To tackle this difficulty, we propose an approach that places the decision maker "in situ". For this, a VIS is used. The real-time decisions taken by the decision-maker are collected and processed by a machine learning program. The resulting rules or decision tree characterize the decision logic and can be embedded in the simulation model to simulate decision-making processes.	[Huyet, A.

To develop such tools, the knowledge of the effective water-use by different consumer groups is required. In this paper, such a tool will be introduced. It is based on an adaptive concept which uses previous effective water requirement (EWR), previous water allocated, environmental and socio-economic conditions to derive policies to determine water to be allocated in the future. The model combines two water demand modeling approaches, a micro-component-based approach to calculate the EWR and a data-based approach to calculate and predict the future water-use if no policy-adaptations are made. The results of the two models are used subjected to environmental and socioeconomic conditions to determine future policies of water allocation by induction. Due to the uncertainty of the determinants of water demand, fuzzy logic theory is applied. This allows imitating the behavior of water resources administrators. The model can be a decision aid for water distribution planning and such an instrument can be very useful for the local specialists and administrations for justification of their allocation practice.

However, pricing high-dimensional Bermudan-American options is quite computationally intensive and using traditional computing infrastructures may take up to hours for these computations. This can result in potential financial losses, further weakening the competitiveness of an organization. Several parallel approaches for pricing have been practiced utilizing parallel or cluster computing techniques. We aim to address this problem in the context of grid computing, relying on the ProActive Java distributed computing platform. We parallelize the Classification-Monte Carlo algorithm, which relies on classification techniques front the machine learning domain, for pricing Bermudan-American options. Consequently, we evaluate the performance of two machine learning techniques, Boosting and Support Vector Machines, and compare the numerical results with respect to accuracy, speed up and their applicability in the grid settings. Furthermore, the paper also contributes to the numerical experiments of a high-dimensional Bermudan-American option with 40 underlying assets.

Central to this analysis is the automated classification of these transactions to hierarchical commodity coding systems. Spend classification is challenging due not only to the complexities of the commodity coding systems but also because of the sparseness and quality of each individual transaction text description and the volume of such transactions in an organization. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of off-the-shelf machine learning tools to address the challenges in spend classification. We hove built a system using off-the-shelf SVM, Logistic Regression, and language processing toolkits and describe the effectiveness of these different learning techniques for spend classification.

Conventional techniques for dealing with such omissions, such as mean imputation, generally do not significantly improve the performance of the resulting classifier. We proposed imputation-helped classifiers, which use accurate imputation techniques, such as Bayesian multiple imputation (BMI), predictive mean matching (PMM), and Expectation Maximization (EM), as preprocessors for conventional machine learning algorithms. Our empirical results show that EM-helped and BMI-helped classifiers work effectively when the data is "missing completely at random", generally improving predictive performance over most of the original machine learned classifiers we investigated.

Addressing Class Imbalance in Non-Binary Classification Problems	20TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TOOLS WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, VOL 1, PROCEEDINGS	PROCEEDINGS - INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TOOLS WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	20th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence	NOV 03-05, 2008	Dayton, OH	IEEE Comp Soc, Biol & Artificial Intelligence Soc, Wright State Univ, Univ Patras, Virginia Tech		Machine learning; class imbalance; non-binary classifiers; data sampling; artificial intelligence	SMOTE	The problem of class imbalance in machine learning is quite real and cumbersome when it comes to building a useful and practical classification model. We present a unique insight into addressing class imbalance for classification problems that involve three or more categories, i.e. non-binary. This study is different than related works in the literature because most works focus on addressing class imbalance only for binary classification problems, even if it means transforming a non-binary dataset into a binary classification problem. We propose an effective, yet simple approach to alleviating class imbalance issues when the classification problem involves more than two classes. The process, with four different methods, is based on applying random undersampling and random oversampling to different parts of the dataset for achieving better classification performance. The proposed data sampling methods are evaluated in the context of two real-world datasets obtained from the UCI Repository for Machine Learning Databases, and two commonly used classification algorithms: C4.5 and RIPPER. Our results demonstrate that the multi-group classification accuracy increases significantly in most cases after the proposed data sampling methods are applied. The positive outcome of this study motivates us to further our research on class imbalance and non-binary classification problems.

Yet, their tight integration with Information Extraction (IE) systems is still a research issue, a fortiori with complex ones that go beyond hierarchies. In this paper we introduce an original architecture where IE is specified by designing an ontology, and the extraction process is seen as an Ontology Population (OP) task. Concepts and relations of the ontology define a normalized text representation. As their abstraction level is irrelevant for text extraction, we introduced a Lexical Layer (LL) along with the ontology, i.e. relations and classes at an intermediate level of normalization between raw text and concepts. On the contrary to previous IE systems, the extraction process only involves normalizing the outputs of Natural Language Processing (NLP) modules with instances of the ontology and the LL. All the remaining reasoning is left to a query module, which uses the inference rules of the ontology to derive new instances by deduction. In this context, these inference rules subsume classical extraction rules or patterns by providing access to appropriate abstraction level and domain knowledge. To acquire those rules, we adopt an Ontology Learning (OL) perspective, and automatically acquire the inference rules with relational Machine Learning (ML). Our approach is validated on a genic interaction extraction task from a Bacillus subtilis bacterium text corpus. We reach a global recall of 89.3% and a precision of 89.6%, with high scores for the ten conceptual relations in the ontology.

Then, the proposed relearning and combining ensemble computations are an effective technique for improving accuracy. We develop anew approach to combine kNN classifier based on rough set and distance functions with relearning and ensemble computations. The combining algorithm shows higher generalization accuracy, compared to other conventional algorithms. First, to improve classification accuracy, an instance-based learning method with genetic algorithm is developed Second, additional ensemble computations are followed by the relearning.

These questions require inferencing and synthesizing information from multiple documents that can be seen as a kind of topic-oriented, informative multi-document summarization. In this paper, we have experimented with one empirical and two unsupervised statistical machine learning techniques: k-means and Expectation Maximization (EM), for computing relative importance of the sentences. The feature set includes different kinds of features: lexical, lexical semantic, cosine similarity, basic element, tree kernel based syntactic and shallow-semantic.

To reduce efforts of testing strategies, some design metrics have been used to predict the fault-proneness of a software class or module. Recent works have explored the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for fault prediction. However most used ML techniques can not deal with unbalanced data and their results usually have a difficult interpretation. Because of this, this paper introduces a Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm for fault prediction. It allows the creation of classifiers composed by rules with specific properties by exploring Pareto dominance concepts. These rules are more intuitive and easier to understand because they can be interpreted independently one of each other Furthermore, all experiment using the approach is presented and the results are compared to the other techniques explored in the area.

Poor children suffer twice as much dental caries as their more affluent peers, but are less likely to receive treatment. This paper presents an experimental study of the application of machine learning methods to the problem of caries prediction. For this paper a data set collected from interviews with children under five years of age, in 2006, in Recife, the capital of Pernambuco, a state in northeast Brazil, was built. Four different data mining techniques were applied to this problem and their results were confronted in terms of the classification error and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results showed that the MLP neural network classifier outperformed the other machine learning methods employed in the experiments, followed by the support vector machine (SVM) predictor In addition, the results also show that some rules (extracted by decision tress) may be useful for understanding the most important factors that influence the occurrence of caries in children.

One type of such fragments are promoters, i.e., short regulatory DNA sequences located upstream of a gene. Detection of promoters in DNA sequences is important for successful gene prediction. In this paper, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for classification of DNA sequences and promoter recognition. For optimal classification, various SVM learning and kernel parameters (hyperparameters) and their optimization methods are analyzed. In a case study, the optimization of the SVM hyperparameters for linear, polynomial and power series kernels is perforrmed using a modification of the Nelder-Mead (downhill simplex) algorithm. The method allows for improving the precision of identification of the promoter sequences. The results of classification for a drosophila sequence dataset are presented.

Self-assembly, however, inherently lends itself to innate disparities in the structure of nominally identical nanodevices and, consequently, wide inter-device variance in their functionality. As a result, nanodevice characterization and testing calls for a slow and tedious procedure involving a large number of measurements. In this work, we discuss a statistical approach which learns measurement correlations from a small set of fully characterized nanodevices and utilizes the extracted knowledge to simplify the process for the rest of the nanodevices. More specifically, we employ various machine-learning methods which rely on a small subset of measurements to i) predict the performances of a fabricated nanodevice, ii) decide whether a nanodevice passes or fails a given set of specifications, and iii) bin a nanodevice with regards to several sets of increasingly strict specifications.

A framework for automatic causality extraction using semantic similarity	27TH COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, VOL 2, PTS A AND B 2007: PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences/Computers and Information in Engineering Conference	SEP 04-07, 2007	Las Vegas, NV	ASME, Design & Engn Div, ASME, Comp & Informat Engn Div		automatic causality extraction; natural language processing; supervised machine learning; semantic similarity		Textual documents are the most common way of storing and distributing information within organizations. Extracting useful information from large text collections is therefore the goal of every organization that would like to take advantage of the experience encapsulated in those texts. Entering data using a free text style is easy, as it does not require any special training. However, unstructured texts pose a major challenge for automatic extraction and retrieval systems. Generally, deep levels of text analysis using advanced and complex linguistic processing are necessary that involve computational linguistic experts and domain experts. Linguistic experts are rare in engineering organizations, which thus find it difficult to apply and exploit such advanced extraction techniques. It is therefore desirable to minimize the extensive involvement of linguist experts by learning extraction patterns automatically from example texts. In doing so, the analysis of given texts is necessary in order to identify the scope and suitable automatic methods. Focusing on causality reasoning in the field of fault diagnosis, the results of experimenting with an automatic causality extraction method using shallow linguistic processing are presented.

Conventional stress testing approaches measure the server capacity in terms of application-level performance metrics like response time and throughput. They are limited in measurement accuracy and timeliness. In a multi-tier website, resource bottleneck often shifts between tiers as client access pattern changes. This makes the capacity measurement even more challenging. This paper presents a measurement approach based on hardware performance counter metrics. The approach uses machine learning techniques to infer application-level performance at each tier A coordinated predictor is induced over individual tier models to estimate system-wide performance and identify the bottleneck when the system becomes overloaded. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach is able to achieve an overload prediction accuracy of higher than 90% for a priori known input traffic patterns and over 85% accuracy even for traffic causing frequent bottleneck shifting. It costs less than 0.5% runtime overhead for data collection and no more than 50 ms for each on-line decision.

While most malware is blocked by software using rule-based signature systems or heuristics to determine functionality and respond, malware detection mechanisms are limited by the robustness of their classification systems and existing definitions. Software cracking and code reverse engineering, by contrast, are creative activities where an attacker typically employs novel solutions to circumvent protection systems and to prevent his own actions from being detected. Currently, there is no capability that totally prevents or detects code reverse engineering activities. To perfectly prevent reverse engineering of software, a system designer would have to be able to completely specify all potential attack vectors and then to implement countermeasures which address each type of attack vector. The first part of autonomically responding to a threat action is to detect it, Potential answers to the detection problem lie in artificial intelligence research, but even the most advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies are currently unable to produce a system which can detect a completely novel attack vector. Human cognition abilities, on the other hand, allow a person to recognize a novel event like an attack even if it does not fall into the typical categories of what that person expects for that given event. This paper discusses Jean Piaget's cognitive development model and maps the phases of that model to different representations in computational intelligence. This mapping highlights the current state of the art of artificial intelligence and autonomic problem solving and highlights limitations of currently available approaches. This mapping will enable researchers to move toward developing theoretical and technological improvements in the hopes of detecting even novel code reverse engineering activities. This paper explores some different paths to be able to replicate the ability in a computer to detect a novel attack, classify novel events and circumstances, develop classification systems on-the-fly, and cross boundaries of classifications.

SVM has strengths as such that it uses a kernel function to deal with arbitrary structured data which comprises of non-linear data sets. However, to fully optimize the benefits of using the kernel function, one will have to fine-tune the parameters of SVM in order to achieve feasible results. However, parameter selection can get complicated as the number of parameters and the size of the dataset increases. In this paper, we propose a method to deal with effective parameter selection for SVM for optimal performance through experiments done on heart sound data using the features of IEEE extraction technique.

The clustering research is at the cross road of research from several research communities such as document retrieval, image segmentation, and artificial intelligence research communities especially from machine learning and data mining in which the data size is very large. In this paper, we surveyed the clustering aspects of protein sequence data sets by pointing out the problems that was encountered during the procedures. Challenges include identifying multidomain proteins, identifying remote homologues, identifying protein families, and dealing with large-scale data sets. We then analyzed the clustering techniques that have been developed by exploring how they addressed the issues. In this survey, we focused on the alignment method and clustering algorithm that were employed. We limit our study on the heuristic-based categories namely hierarchical and partitional approaches. We concluded this paper with some research issues.	[Rahman, S. A.; Bakar, A.

An Efficient Model to Decipher the Electroencephalogram Signals Using Machine Learning Approach	4TH KUALA LUMPUR INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING 2008, VOLS 1 AND 2	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	4th Kuala Lumpur International Conference on Biomedical Engineering	JUN 25-28, 2008	Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA			Wavelet; Neural Network; Biomedical; EEG	BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE	The objective of this paper is to develop a powered Room Automation and Robot control based on Electro encephalogram signals (EEG) for users with high-level spinal cord injury. A Brain Computer Interface (BCI) provides a new non-muscular channel for sending messages and commands to the external world. This BCI was designed with two Operational Modes (OM): Training with Feedback OM and Execute OM. Our project emphasized on design to implementation of Execute OM in BCI. The main functionality of a Execute OM is described as follows: it receives EEG data taken from the user, interprets and classifies it as a Mental Activity Task defined in a previous Training Phase and finally executes a specific action using a rendering component, in this case the one dimensional(1D) platform. This classification can be achieved using a classification technique known as Wavelet feature Extraction followed by Neural Network. The development of this 1D platform is also part of this paper, such platform uses a Graphical user interface (GUI) developed in Visual Basic (VB). Its task is to receive the Mental Activity Task output from MATLAB and execute a predetermined action such as 1D movement of cursor. Additionally hardware is integrated for room automation and robotic control which can be controlled by Offline EEG data taken from the user. In the Training with Feedback OM shows visual clues to the user, treats the input data and shows a visual feedback to the user. The body of paper starts with a brief introduction to the BCI system architecture, its implementation using MATLAB followed with the experimental results of the system and ends with conclusion.

The IPC uses a neural network for online prediction of roadway types and traffic congestion levels. The IPC and the prediction model have been implemented in a conventional (non-hybrid) vehicle model for online vehicle power control in a simulation program. The benefits of the IPC combined with the predicted drive cycle are demonstrated through simulation. Experiment results show that the IPC gives close to optimal performances.

We presented several concept similarity measures for the machine learning framework and conducted experiments for testing the framework using real-world data. Our experimental results show that our approach has increased performance with respect to precision, recall and F-measure in comparison with other methods.

Recent advances in microarray technology have promised significant advantages in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Several microarray studies have successfully yielded a set of signature genes associated with heart failure. However, it has been found that the overlap of these heart failure associated genes derived from different experiments is very, small. Based on the analysis of two publicly available microarray datasets associated with heart failure with three types of machine learning and statistical prediction models, this paper explores this phenomenon. We found that there is no unique set of genes associated with heart failure. Many sets of genes can achieve very high prediction accuracy. In order to identify biomarkers in human heart failure, it may not be sufficient to just focus a certain number of top genes. Such main candidates should be chosen from the much longer list of genes.

In animals, target prediction of the miRNAs is accomplished through several computational methods, i.e. miRanda, TargetScan and PicTar. Typically, these methods predict targets from features of miRNA-target interaction such as sequence complementarity, free energy of RNA duplexes and conservation of target sites. They are constructed for high throughput and also result in a large amount of predictions and a high estimated false-positive rate. To date, specific rules to capture all known miRNA targets have not been devised. We observed that miRNAs sometimes share targets. Therefore, in this paper we present an approach which analyzes miRNA-miRNA relationships and utilizes them for target prediction. We use machine learning techniques to reveal the feature patterns between known miRNAs. Different data setups are evaluated and compared to achieve the best performance. Furthermore, the derived rules are applied to miRNAs of which the targets are not yet known so as to see if new targets could be predicted. In the analysis of functionally similar miRNAs, we found that genomic distance and seed similarity between miRNAs are dominant features in the description of a group of miRNAs binding the same target. Application of one specific rule resulted in the prediction of targets for seven miRNAs for which the targets were formerly unknown. Some of these targets were also detected by the existing methods. Our method contributes to the improvement of target identification by predicting targets with high specificity and without conservation limitation.

Protein Similarity Networks and Genetic Algorithm Driven Feature Selection for Fold Recognition	8TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS AND BIOENGINEERING, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	8th IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering	OCT 08-10, 2008	Athens, GREECE	IEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc			AMINO-ACID-SEQUENCE; HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; ALIGNMENT; SCOP; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; CHOICE; SERVER; SPACE	Fold recognition based on sequence-derived features is a complex classification problem and usually sequence-derived features are exploited using proper machine learning techniques. Here we adress the task of fold recognition on a protein similarity network (PSN) basis. We construct a protein sequence similarity network (PSeSN) using a set of 125 sequence-derived features for an available set of 311 proteins. PSeSN is optimized by using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to select the features that construct a PSeSN which is as similar as possible with the corresponding protein structure similarity network (PStSN). A random walk based algorithm is then utilized to recognize the fold of a query protein sequence by calculating its affinities to sequences-vertices both in the initial and the optimized PSeSN. Total accuracy (TA) measurements obtained using 10-fold cross validation show that the use of 48 out of 125 sequence-derived features (optimized PSeSN) yielded better results (mean TA: 0.35 in testing sets) than the initial PSeSN (mean TA: 0.316 in testing sets).

For instance, transcriptome, interactome and phenome-level information may be derived from mRNA expression data, protein-protein interaction networks, and biomedical literature corpora. Each source provides a distinct "view" of the same domain, but potentially encodes different biologically-relevant patterns. Effective integration of such views can provide a richer, more informative model of an organism's functional modules than that produced on a single view alone. Existing machine learning strategies for information fusion largely focus on the production of a consensus model that reflects patterns shared between views. However, the information provided by different views may not always be easily reconciled, due to the incomplete nature of the data, or the fact that some patterns will be present in one view but not in another. To address this problem, we present the Parallel Integration Clustering Algorithm (PICA), a novel cluster analysis approach which supports the simultaneous integration of information from two or more sources. The resulting model preserves patterns that are unique to individual views, as well as those common to all views. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PICA in identifying significant patterns corresponding to functional groupings, when applied to three genome-wide datasets.

Interestingly, some close relationships between miRNA expression levels and several human diseases like cancers have been recently uncovered. Difficulties of identifying miRNAs via direct experimental method due to their special and temporal expression patterns make the computational prediction methods paramount important. Specially, non-comparative computational methods would have the advantage of recognizing species-specific miRNAs that can be missed by comparative methods. In this paper we present a systematic development of an improved classifier system for non-comparative human miRNA gene recognition using effective machine learning techniques.

It has been recognized as a rich source of information extending the existing sources since it allows simultaneous collection of spatial and temporal protein information. In order to enable a high-throughput and high-content image analysis, sophisticated image processing routines become essential. We present a machine learning based approach for semantic image annotation i.e. identifying biologically meaningful objects. A semantic annotation becomes necessary, if image variables have to be associated to single biological objects, for example cells. We apply our method to pancreatic tissue sample images to detect and annotate cells of the Islets of Langerhans and whole pancreas. Based on the annotation, aligned multichannel fluorescence images are evaluated for cell type classification allowing accurate and rapid determination of the cell number and mass. This high-throughput analytical technique, requiring only few parameters, should he of great value in diabetes studies and for screening of new anti-diabetes treatments.

SOM has been used as a good tool of clustering. Generally the weights of SOM are updated by a learning process which is depended on not distributions but values. After complete updating process, the final weights are determined by fixed values. So, the clustering result from a complete updating is only outcome. But, for example, the cognitive behaviors of human being are shown different results from the given experience. In this paper, we propose a new heuristic of SOM (NHSOM) using updating distributions. NHSOM is able to provide diverse results from the weight distributions. In our experimental results, we verify efficient and improved performances of NHSOM to compare other competitive algorithms using the data sets from UCI machine learning repository and synthesis.

A small percentage of the cases there is actually cancer in an image to be detected. It is very important to detect cancer in an early stage where it can be treated well at relative low costs. Today, the analysis of an image is done by a radiologist and is time consuming. Also, the amount of images is growing faster then the number of radiologists can analyze. Because of the need to analyze more images with a very high accuracy and reliability there is a need for software, which can help to reduce the workload of the radiologist. New machine learning based algorithms, which are part of Oracle Data Mining, might be used to learn on a small set of training images to classify a large collection of images. By analyzing a large collection of images and thus reduce workload one can focus on early screening and safe life and safe money.

With proper feature extractions and machine learning techniques, it is possible to extract implicit and explicit knowledge from learner corpora and develop useful applications to support effective foreign language teaching and learning, such as automatic proficiency level checking, error-driven and personalized learning etc. In this paper, we use a learner corpus and experiment with feature extraction and machine learning techniques to explore such applications. In particular, we reported our experimental results in automatic proficiency checking with ID3 and C4.5 Decision Tree algorithms, Bayesian Net and SVM. We also briefly outline other potential applications of learner corpora such as in error-driven learning by using implicit and explicit features along with machine learning.

A Set of Classical Factors for Rule Mining in Pruning Methods	ICCN: 2008 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING, COMMUNICATION AND NETWORKING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking	DEC 18-20, 2008	Karur, INDIA			Data mining rule mining classifier; instance-centric; prune		Classification is an important task in both data mining and machine learning communities. In this paper we present a method to build a categorization system that merges association rule mining task with the classification problem. A classifier is built by applying a learning method to a training set of objects. In this case the learning method is represented by the association rule mining and used for building classification models. A good text classifier is a classifier that efficiently categorizes large sets of text documents in a specified time and with an acceptable accuracy, But most of the learning approaches with new technique text automatic categorization method are coming from machine learning research using association rule mining in the data-mining field which proves to he efficient and effective for construction of effective classifiers. We focus on two major problems: (1) finding the best term association rules in a textual database by generating and pruning; and (2) using the rules to build a text classifier. in addition, training as well as classification is fast The main idea behind this approach is to discover strong patterns that are associated with the class labels._ The problem of discovering all association rules from a set of transactions consists of generating the rules that have a support and confidence greater than given thresholds. These rules are called strong rules.. The pruning methods eliminate the specific rules and keep only those that are more general and with high confidence, and prune unnecessary rules by database coverage.I have presented an association rule-based classifier with all categories (ARC-AC) algorithm for building the classifier and association rule based classifier by category (ARC-BC) that considers categories one at a time. The algorithm assumes a transaction-based model for the training document. The introduction of the dominance factors allowed multi-class categorization..

The distributed clustering algorithm is used to cluster the distributed datasets without necessarily downloading all the data to a single site. Manly applications can benefit from soft clustering, where each object is assigned to multiple clusters with membership weight that sum to one. In this paper, a novel distributed soft clustering algorithm based on ensemble learning is proposed by modifying the existing distributed K-Means algorithm, to attain high quality soft clusters. The proposed algorithm is able to cluster multiple homogeneous data sources, distributed over several local sites by combining local clustering results. The Jazzy C-Means algorithm is used to cluster local datasets and the centroids of individual datasets form an ensemble. The global centroid is obtained by clustering local centroids using K-Means algorithm with global K value at central place. The local soft clusters are updated using global centroid The experiments are carried out for various datasets of UCI machine learning data repository to compare the performance the proposed algorithm with conventional centralized fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm.

This paper presents an optimal algorithm of modeling dynamic architecture for artificial neural networks (ANN) and a novel machine-learning algorithm for extracting rules from databases via using genetic algorithm. Classical architecture Of AAW is arbitrary. Before training ANN, the number of hidden layers and hidden nodes has already been fixed In the dynamic architecture, the number of hidden layers and the number of hidden nodes are sequentially and dynamically generated until a level of performance accuracy is reached In addition, in this paper, a new genetic algorithm is proposed, which does not need the computational complexity. The genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal values of input attributes (chromosome), X(m), which maximizes output function OK of output node k. The optimal chromosome is decoded and used to obtain a rule belonging to class k. The better result is achieved by applying the two new algorithms to a given database for customers buying computer.

Inner structural analyses induce constitutions of person, location and organization name from the point of linguistics. However inner structural rules for named entities only provide necessary conditions for a sequence of Chinese characters being an entity name but not sufficient. Whether a string being a proper name or not is also determined by its contextual information or sometimes common sense. We build Chinese NER system based on supervised machine learning using features induced from simple inner structure and contextual information. We compare some NER approaches. The experimental results indicate complicated cases of various NER strategies. Then this paper turns to explore contextual features of named entities on large scale corpus, seeking for contextual evidence for different strategies of NER and mark words giving clues to the occurrence of NE. Finally we apply some conclusions to improve NER system by enriching features in model and enhance the performance distinctly.

Dimensionality reduction (DR) can be beneficial not only reasons of computational efficiency but also because it can improve the accuracy of the analysis. Now we have tried to introduce a novel transform to achieve dimensionality reduction. This paper summarizes survey on feature selection and extraction from high-dimensionality data sets using genetic algorithm. The feature selection process can be considered a problem of global combinatorial optimization in machine learning, which reduces the number of features, removes irrelevant, noisy and redundant data, to obtain the accuracy and saves the computation time and simplifies the result We are trying to develop GA-based approach utilizing a feedback linkage between feature evaluation and association rule. That is we carry out feature selection simultaneously with association rule mining, through "genetic learning and evolution."

Classification of Arrhythmia Using Rough Sets	INNOVATIONS AND ADVANCED TECHNIQUES IN SYSTEMS, COMPUTING SCIENCES AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Systems, Computing Science and Software Engineering	DEC 03-12, 2007	ELECTR NETWORK			Arrhythmia classification; rough sets; principal component analysis (PCA); feature reduction; Discretization and reduction	ECG	Arrhythmia is caused due to the changes in the normal rhythm of heart with great risk of fatality if sustained over long periods of time. Many machine-learning algorithms have been developed for a fast diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia. Also, the decision accuracies vary from method to method with Support Vector Machines (SVM) giving the highest. However, SVM cannot deal with the uncertainties in the process of diagnosis. Therefore, the authors have considered the Rough Set method for this classification. Analysis has been done with and without reducing the number of features. It has been found that the classification accuracies vary between 87% and 54% respectively. It may be emphasized that rough set reasons out all the possibilities and the decision could be as close as human diagnosis. The experimental results are presented.

In the previous researches, mainly classifiers including AIS classifiers require the data to be in numerical or categorical data types prior to processing. The transformation of data into any other specific types from their original form can degrade the originality of the data and consume more space and pre processing time. This paper introduces AIS model using clonal selection technique for classifying heterogeneous data in its original types. The model is able to process the data with the types as represented in the database and it solves some problems highlighted in the AIS reviews. To ensure the consistent conditions and fair comparison, the selected algorithms uses the same set of data as used in the proposed model. Experimental results show that this model produces a better accuracy rate than other immune algorithm and comparable to the standard classifiers on most of the benchmark data from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Among various classification techniques, one very attractive and effective method is employing machine learning to classify the whole volume according to some minimum user input through an interactive brushing interface, where users paint directly on slices of the volume. For routine visualization tasks, we can thus reduce their cost if the visualization system can learn the tasks and apply the captured knowledge in future tasks. This paper presents an intelligent, interactive visualization system that supports Focus+Context viewing of volume data. Features of interest should be the focal point of the visualization, and by applying appropriate rendering methods we are able to enhance these features and create more illustrative visualizations in a Focus+Context style. We show with a set of case studies that it is possible to use machine learning to not only help classify volume but also better present the classified results. This new capability makes visualization a more usable tool.			ckchen@ucdavis.edu; rdthomason@ucdavis.edu; ma@cs.ucdavis.edu					Bruckner S, 2006, IEEE T VIS COMPUT GR, V12, P1559, DOI 10.1109/TVCG.2006.96; Bruckner S, 2006, IEEE T VIS COMPUT GR, V12, P1077, DOI 10.1109/TVCG.2006.140; Correa CD, 2006, IEEE T VIS COMPUT GR, V12, P1069, DOI 10.1109/TVCG.2006.144; DIEPSTRATEN J, 2003, P EUR C 03; Ebert D., 2000, Proceedings Visualization 2000.

In this paper, we propose a new ensemble scheme which focuses on driving the relationship between multiple learning algorithms and variant data distributions. The advantage of the framework can form an expressive hypotheses combination allowing a set of learning algorithms with respect to the data distributions, instead of majority voting scheme which was commonly employed for improving the prediction stability or a weak learning algorithm needed in bagging/boosting/random-forest algorithm. Experimental results on several UCI benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed scheme gains a worthwhile valuable performance on the classification learning task.

The proposed scheme employs SVR predictive function to obtain characteristic of the database and uses Huffman coding to encode the characteristic for compressing important payload information. In detection phase, minor and necessary additional payload information of the database is used to accomplish tampering detection.

Due to the significant learning ability in the correlations of training samples by support vector regression, the trained SVR function is obtained by neighboring pixels of the sample pixels to predict the embedded pixel values, and then the proposed scheme uses pixel-value differences to embed the secret data. In the data extraction phase, the proposed scheme uses trained SVR function to predict the embedded pixel value, and the secret data is extracted from pixel-value differences. Experimental results show that SVR is good at learning the correlations of neighboring pixel, and the proposed scheme also has reliable security, high embedding capacity and better image quality for the stego-image.

But, the contribution of each descriptor may not be the same for a domain specific image database when computing the similarity measure. Machine learning techniques for the optimization of feature descriptor weights are desirable to enhance the accuracy of image annotation systems. In our system, we use a real coded chromosome genetic algorithm and support vector machine (SVM) classification accuracy as fitness function to optimize the weights of MPEG-7 image feature descriptors. The experimental results over 2000 classified Corel images show that with the real coded genetic algorithm, the accuracies of image annotation system are improved comparing to the method without machine learning techniques.

In order to set up effective parameters that are frequently used in the learning platforms, we advance three types of learning parameter improvement mechanisms in this article. The proposed learning parameter improvement mechanisms have three useful points: the first is that it can calculate the students' effective online learning time; the second is that the portion of a message in discussion section which is strongly related to the learning topics can be extracted; the third is plagiarism in students' homework can be defected easily. Then we feed the derived numeric parameters into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict each learner's performance so as to verify whether they reflect the student's studying behaviors. The results from experiments show that the prediction rate for the SVM classifier can be increased up to 35.7% in average after the inputs to the classifier are "purfied" by the learning parameter improvement mechanisms. This great achievement reveals that the proposed algorithms indeed produce the effective learning parameters for commonly used e-learning platforms in the literature.

Current manifold learning algorithms assume that the observed data set has the high density. But, how to evaluate the denseness of the high dimensional observed data set? This paper proposes an algorithm based on the average geodesic distance as the preprocessing step of manifold learning. Moreover, for a high dense data set evaluated, we further utilize the average geodesic distance to quantitatively analyze the mapping relationship between the high-dimensional manifold and the corresponding intrinsic low-dimensional manifold in the known ISOMAP algorithm. Finally, experimental results on two synthetic Swiss-roll data sets show that our method is feasible.

In contrast to the Support Vector Machine approach, our algorithm is free to use any finite family of continuously differentiable functions which linearly compose the decision function. Nevertheless, robustness properties are maintained due to a maximizing margin. To obtain a useful algorithm, the inherent difficult problem is formulated in a convex Semi-infinite Program. Using this new formulation, we develop a duality result enabling us to solve the original problem iteratively as a finite sequence of constrained quadratic programming problems over a convex hull of matrices. We compare the performance of the Lipschitz classifier algorithm with state-of-the-art machine learning methodologies using a. benchmark data set as well as a data set randomly generated from Gaussian mixtures.

Although recent algorithms, like support vector machines, can handle high dimensionality, it remains valuable to find smaller and more fitted spaces to perform learning tasks. We propose a twofold approach to tackle these high dimensionality issues in a text classification setting. First we use manifold learning as a pre-processing step to non-linearly reduce the feature space. Second we use support vector machines to implement an active learning strategy' where the kernel trick is used to define the active examples. This approach deals with the high dimensionality both reducing the features and the number of examples needed to reach a desired performance. Results on a real-world benchmark corpus from Reuters and also on a reduced realistic version of the corpus show first the visualization capabilities of manifold learning and the performance improvement achieved with the active learning strategy.

Automating Microarray Classification using General Regression Neural Networks	SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING AND APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications	DEC 11-13, 2008	San Diego, CA	IEEE SMC, Calif State Univ, Bakersfield, Assoc Machine Learning & Applicat			LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; FEATURE-SELECTION; EXPRESSION; CANCER; PREDICTION; TUMOR	Microarray Classification compares thousands of genes of an unknown patient with the genes of known patients in order to predict and diagnose diseases. Since first introduced, many algorithms and techniques have been applied in search of the best solution. In response, the Seventh International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA) is holding a competition in search of the best classification technique. As an entry, the authors use a General Regression Neural Network, in conjunction with a Particle Swarm Optimizer to predict microarray classifications. The GRNN is trained and tested on two datasets: colon cancer and leukemia. The algorithm is evaluated using two measures: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUROC) and Accuracy. The algorithm's best averages for the colon cancer dataset are an AUROC value of 0.90044 and an accuracy of 78.4% and for the leukemia dataset, 0.978214 and 89.5%, proving it to be a useful tool.

Often, however, models should also bring insights into interesting relationships in the domain. It is then desirable that machine learning techniques have the ability to obtain small and transparent models, where the user can control the tradeoff between accuracy, comprehensibility and coverage. In this study, three different decision list algorithms are evaluated on a data set concerning the interaction of molecules with a human gene that regulates heart functioning (hERG). The results show that decision list algorithms can obtain predictive performance not far from the state-of-the-art method random forests, but also that algorithms focusing on accuracy alone may produce complex decision lists that are very hard to interpret. The experiments also show that by sacrificing accuracy only to a limited degree, comprehensibility (measured as both model size and classification complexity) can be improved remarkably.

For example, aiming towards the design of an automated diagnostic tool for some diseases, one may wish to integrate data gathered from many different hospitals. Analyzing and mining these distributed heterogeneous data sources require distributed machine learning and data mining technique In this paper, a Modified Distributed Combining Algorithm is proposed to cluster disparate data sources having diverse, possibly overlapping set of features and also need not share objects. First, all objects located at local sites are grouped using K-Means/Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm and resulting centroid is considered as local models. Then, the set of centroids are transformed into unified structure and optimum values are assigned to missing attributes. Finally, global cluster centroid is computed to identify global cluster model based on cluster ensemble and centroid mapping. The experiments are carried out for various datasets of UCI machine learning data repository in order to achieve the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.	[Visalakshi, N.

We consider the problem of time-varying regression estimation, which implies also the inevitable necessity to choose the individual appropriate levels of model volatility in each of regressors, ranging from the full stationarity of instant models to their a solute independence in time. The problem is considered from the Bayesian point of view as that of estimating the sequence of regression coefficients associated with the hidden vector state of a stochastic linear dynamic system, whose a priori model includes parameters responsible for both the size of the subset of active regressors and the time-volatility factors of regression coefficients at them. The proposed technique of adaptive time varying regression estimation is built as that of estimating both the state and parameters of the hidden state-space model.

One issue is to define the appropriate units over which to perform feature measurements and assign type labels. We propose an alpha-shape tree that operates across multiple scales. A second issue is to devise image features that offer inferential power for machine learning algorithms. We report on a feature that measures edge turn statistics. A third issue is how to combine local and neighborhood evidence. We exploit the alpha shape tree in a direct inference architecture.

Decomposing the main problem into multiple relaxed subproblems allows them to be simultaneously solved by individual computing units operating in parallel and having access to only a subset of the data. A sufficient condition is derived under which a synchronous, discrete-time gradient update algorithm converges to the approximate solution. We apply the proposed distributed learning framework in the context of automatic image tagging as a first processing layer Initial results from corresponding experiments indicate that he proposed framework has favorable properties including efficiency, configurability, robustness, suitability for online learning, and low communication. overhead.

Question classification plays an important role in the question answer frame to reduce the gap between question and answer. This paper presents our research work on automatic question classification through machine learning approaches. We have experimented with machine learning algorithms Support Vector Machines (SVM) using kernel methods. An effective way to integrate syntactic structures for question classification in machine learning algorithms is the use of tree kernel (TK) functions. Here we use SubSet Tree kernel with Bag of words. Trade-off between training error and margin, Cost-factor and the decay factor has significant impact when we use SVM for the mentioned kernel type. The experiments determined the individual impact for Trade-off between training error and margin, Cost-factor and the decay factor and later the combined effect for Trade-off between training error and margin, Cost-factor. Depending on these result we also figure out some hyperplanes which can maximize the performance. Based on some standard data set outcomes of our experiment for question classification is promising.

The proposed general paradigm aims at incorporating unsupervised kernel methods into population-based heuristics, which rely on spatial fusion of solutions, in order to learn the solution clusters from the search history. This form of extracted knowledge guides the heuristic to detect automatically promising regions of solutions. The proposed algorithm derived from this paradigm is an extension of the classical Scatter Search and can automatically learn during the search process by exploiting the history of solutions found. Preliminary results, with an application to the well-known vehicle routing problem (VRP) show the great interest of such paradigm and can effectively find near-optimal solutions for large problem instances	[Zennaki, Mahmoud; Ech-Cherif, Ahmed] USTOMB, Dept Comp Sci, Fac Sci, Oran, Algeria	Zennaki, M (reprint author), USTOMB, Dept Comp Sci, Fac Sci, BP 1505 El Mnaouer, Oran, Algeria.	mzennaki@yahoo.fr; a.echerif@alum.rpi.edu					BATTITI R, 2006, DIT06027; BATTITI R, 2005, DIT05058 TRENT U; Battiti R, 2001, ALGORITHMICA, V29, P610, DOI 10.1007/s004530010074; BATTITI R, 2001, LNCS, V2170; Breimer E, 2005, DIMACS SER DISCRET M, V69, P7; CHANG C.

Generally, the training data for learning to rank come in two different forms: 1) absolute relevance judgments assessing the degree of relevance of a document with respect to a query. This type of judgments is also called labeled data and axe usually obtained through human editorial efforts; and 2) relative relevance judgments indicating that a document is more relevant than another with respect to a query. This type of judgments is also called preference data and can usually be extracted from the abundantly available user clickthrough data recording users' interactions with the search results. Most existing learning to rank methods ignore the query boundaries, treating the labeled data or preference data equally across queries. In this paper, we propose a minimum effort optimization method that takes into account the entire training data within a query at each iteration. We tackle this optimization problem using functional iterative methods where the update at each iteration is computed by solving an isotonic regression problem. This more global approach results in faster convergency and significantly improved performance of the learned ranking functions over existing state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using data sets obtained from a commercial search engine as well as publicly available data.

Some Machine Learning techniques become very popular in the research of Spam Filter. Support Vector Machine Is one of the most excellent methods in classifying. But these techniques are usually applied to spam identity based on the mail body textual content only, seldom discussing about mail header. This paper hereby proposes the Spam Discrimination Model based on SVM, and uses SVM to sort out mail according to the feature of mail headers. By feature abstraction carried out on the mails dataset (CDSCE) with C++ program and SVM classifying, Experimental result indicates that the proposed model can effectively Improve the accuracy of spam Identification.

FFT features are first extracted from the vibration signal and cutting force in cutting process, and then FFT vectors are presorted and converted into integers by SOM. Finally, these codes are introduced to DHMM for machine learning and 3 models for different tool wear stage are built up. Pattern of HMM is recognised by calculating probability. The results of tool wear recognition and failure prediction experiments show that the method is effective.

Using machine learning such as gradient boosting tree enables the sort and class data to be modeled such that the effect input parameters could be ranked based on importance and each single input factor can be considered by the auto-screening algorithm. This is different from conventional statistical methods such as one-way plots, ANOVA analysis etc. which do not efficiently address the problem of confounding effect from multiple factors. The method employs the maximum gradient algorithm to select the threshold and then simulate the yield, overkill (potential good units being killed at sort) and underkill (potential bad units escaping sort screen).			chun.chew.lim@intel.com; wen.jau.lee@intel.com					BORISOV A, 2005, INTEL TECHNOLOGY J, V9; BORISOV A, 2006, PERFORMANCE PREDICTI; Friedman J.H., 1999, STOCHASTIC GRADIENT; YIP WK, 2007, 3 ANN IEEE C AUT SCI, P478	4	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA		978-1-4244-2022-3				2008							236	241				6	Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Automation & Control Systems; Engineering	BIO08	WOS:000261320400039

The early detection of potential failures and malfunctions, the identification and localization of present or impending component failures and, in particular, the monitoring of the underlying physical process are of crucial importance for the efficient operation of complex process industry assets. With respect to these suppositions a software agent based diagnosis and monitoring concept has been developed, which allows an integrated and continuous diagnosis of the communication network and the underlying physical process behavior. The present paper outlines the architecture of the developed distributed diagnostic concept based on software agents and presents the functionality for the diagnosis of the unknown process behaviour of the underlying automation system based on machine learning methods.

Business rules described by natural language are very hard for machine to understand. In order to let machine know the business rules, parts of business process, we need to translate them into a language which machine can understand. Object constraint language is one of those languages. In this paper we present a statistical machine learning method to understand the natural business rules and then translate them into object constraint language. Subsequently a translation algorithm for business process modeling is also provided. A real case, air cargo load planning process is proposed to illustrate the efficiency and effective of the method and the algorithm. The result has shown that this method and algorithm enrich business process modeling technology and enhance the efficiency of software developers, in business process modeling.

In this paper we present a machine learning method that allows agents in an environment with changing tasks to adapt and modify their behavior thus ensuring their survival. These agents do not get explicit information about the change in tasks. The learning mechanism ensures the presence of enough diversity in the agents so that they can restart learning if the previous learning stops to be effective and enough continuity in the system so that the agents can keep on learning if their task has not changed.

Labelled instances however are often difficult, expensive, or time consuming to obtain, as they require the efforts of experienced human annotators. Meanwhile unlabeled data may be relatively easy to collect, but there has been few ways to use them. Semi-supervised learning addresses this problem by using large amount of unlabeled data, together with the labelled data, to build better classifiers. Because semi-supervised learning requires less human effort and gives higher accuracy, it is of great interest both in theory and in practice. The paper discusses various important approaches to semi-supervised learning such as self-training, co-training(CO), expectation maximization (EM) ,CO-EM, Then how graph-based methods are useful is explained All semi-supervised learning methods are classified into generative and discriminative methods. But experimental results show that the hybrid algorithm gives better classification accuracy.

Machine learning has a wide spectrum Of applications and has been paid many attentions by researchers. However, the quantitative measurement problem of the learning quality and the completeness of the supervisor's knowledge under incomplete information haven't been solved very well. Rough sets theory is a mathematical tool for extracting knowledge from uncertain and incomplete information. The paper firstly introduced some related concepts about machine learning and supervised learning, then, from the perspective of rough sets theory, studied the learning quality of machine learning and the completeness of supervisor's knowledge, which may provide some new ideas for studying the machine learning.

The successful detection of both gradual and abrupt transitions is necessary to this end. In this paper a new gradual transition detection algorithm is proposed, based on novel features exhibiting less sensitivity to local or global motion than previously proposed ones. These features, each of which could serve as a stand-alone transition detection approach, are then combined using a machine learning technique, to result in a meta-segmentation scheme. Besides significantly improved performance, advantage of the proposed scheme is that there is no need for threshold selection, as opposed to what would be the case if any of the proposed features were used by themselves and as is typically the case in the relevant literature. Comparison of the proposed approach with four popular algorithms of the literature reveals the significantly improved performance of it.

Rigorous evaluation of video summaries generated by automatic systems is a complicated process because the ground truth is often difficult to define, and even when it exists, it is difficult to match with the obtain results. The TRECVID BBC evaluation campaign has recently introduced a rushes summarization task and has defined a manual evaluation methodology. In this paper, we explore the use of machine learning techniques to automate this evaluation. We present our approach and describe the current results, in comparison with manual evaluations performed in the 2007 campaign.

J	Yang, JY; Yang, MQ				Yang, Jack Y.; Yang, Mary Qu			Predicting protein disorder by analyzing amino acid sequence	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article								Background: Many protein regions and some entire proteins have no definite tertiary structure, presenting instead as dynamic, disorder ensembles under different physiochemical circumstances. These proteins and regions are known as Intrinsically Unstructured Proteins (IUP). IUP have been associated with a wide range of protein functions, along with roles in diseases characterized by protein misfolding and aggregation. Results: Identifying IUP is important task in structural and functional genomics. We exact useful features from sequences and develop machine learning algorithms for the above task. We compare our IUP predictor with PONDRs (mainly neural-network-based predictors), disEMBL (also based on neural networks) and Globplot (based on disorder propensity). Conclusion: We find that augmenting features derived from physiochemical properties of amino acids (such as hydrophobicity, complexity etc.) and using ensemble method proved beneficial. The IUP predictor is a viable alternative software tool for identifying IUP protein regions and proteins.

Data were collected with the RAI-HC assessment system, in which the Activities of Daily Living Clinical Assessment Protocol (ADLCAP) is used to identify clients with rehabilitation potential. For study purposes, a client is defined as having rehabilitation potential if there was: i) improvement in ADL functioning, or ii) discharge home. SVM and KNN results are compared with those obtained using the ADLCAP. For comparison, the machine learning algorithms use the same functional and health status indicators as the ADLCAP. Results: The KNN and SVM algorithms achieved similar substantially improved performance over the ADLCAP, although false positive and false negative rates were still fairly high (FP > .18, FN > .34 versus FP > .29, FN. > .58 for ADLCAP). Results are used to suggest potential revisions to the ADLCAP. Conclusion: Machine learning algorithms achieved superior predictions than the current protocol. Machine learning results are less readily interpretable, but can also be used to guide development of improved clinical protocols.

How to detect and defend against DDoS attacks is currently a hot topic in both industry and academia. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to robustly and efficiently detect DDoS attacks and identify attack packets. The key idea of L our framework is to exploit spatial and temporal correlation of DDoS attack traffic. In this framework, we design a perimeter-based anti-DDoS system, in which traffic is analyzed only at the edge routers of an internet service provider (ISP) network. Our framework is able to detect any source-address-spoofed DDoS attack, no matter whether it is a low-volume attack or a high-volume attack. The novelties of our framework are (1) temporal-correlation based feature extraction and (2) spatial-correlation based detection. With these techniques, our scheme can accurately detect DDoS attacks and identify attack packets without modifying existing IP forwarding mechanisms at routers. Our simulation results show that the proposed framework can detect DDoS attacks even if the volume of attack traffic on each link is extremely small. Especially, for the same false alarm probability, our scheme has a detection probability of 0.97, while the existing scheme has a detection probability of 0.17, which demonstrates the superior performance of our scheme.

J	Brameier, M; Wiuf, C				Brameier, Markus; Wiuf, Carsten			Ab initio identification of human microRNAs based on structure motifs	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							HOST GENES; PRECURSORS; PREDICTION; SEQUENCE; FEATURES; CLASSIFICATION; CONSERVATION; BIOGENESIS; ALIGNMENT; PATTERNS	Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNA molecules that are directly involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. The mature miRNA sequence binds to more or less specific target sites on the mRNA. Both their small size and sequence specificity make the detection of completely new miRNAs a challenging task. This cannot be based on sequence information alone, but requires structure information about the miRNA precursor. Unlike comparative genomics approaches, ab initio approaches are able to discover species-specific miRNAs without known sequence homology. Results: MiRPred is a novel method for ab initio prediction of miRNAs by genome scanning that only relies on (predicted) secondary structure to distinguish miRNA precursors from other similar-sized segments of the human genome. We apply a machine learning technique, called linear genetic programming, to develop special classifier programs which include multiple regular expressions (motifs) matched against the secondary structure sequence. Special attention is paid to scanning issues. The classifiers are trained on fixed-length sequences as these occur when shifting a window in regular steps over a genome region. Various statistical and empirical evidence is collected to validate the correctness of and increase confidence in the predicted structures. Among other things, we propose a new criterion to select miRNA candidates with a higher stability of folding that is based on the number of matching windows around their genome location. An ensemble of 16 motif-based classifiers achieves 99.9 percent specificity with sensitivity remaining on an acceptable high level when requiring all classifiers to agree on a positive decision. A low false positive rate is considered more important than a low false negative rate, when searching larger genome regions for unknown miRNAs. 117 new miRNAs have been predicted close to known miRNAs on human chromosome 19. All candidate structures match the free energy distribution of miRNA precursors which is significantly shifted towards lower free energies. We employed a human EST library and found that around 75 percent of the candidate sequences are likely to be transcribed, with around 35 percent located in introns. Conclusion: Our motif finding method is at least competitive to state-of-the-art feature-based methods for ab initio miRNA discovery. In doing so, it requires less previous knowledge about miRNA precursor structures while programs and motifs allow a more straightforward interpretation and extraction of the acquired knowledge.

Thus, the neural circuits in their olfactory system are likely to implement an efficient method for coding, processing, and classifying chemical information. Here, we describe a computational method to process molecular representations and classify molecules. The three-step approach mimics neurocomputational principles observed in olfactory systems. In the first step, the original stimulus space is sampled by "virtual receptors," which are chemotopically arranged by a self-organizing map. In the second step, the signals from the virtual receptors are decorrelated via correlation-based lateral inhibition. Finally, in the third step, olfactory scent perception is modeled by a machine learning classifier. We found that signal decorrelation during the second stage significantly increases the accuracy of odorant classification. Moreover, our results suggest that the proposed signal transform is capable of dimensionality reduction and is more robust against overdetermined representations than principal component scores. Our olfaction-inspired method was successfully applied to predicting bioactivities of pharmaceutically active compounds with high accuracy. It represents a way to efficiently connect chemical structure with biological activity space.

J	Florez-Lopez, R				Florez-Lopez, Raquel			Modelling of insurers' rating determinants. An application of machine learning techniques and statistical models	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						credit risk management; ratings determinants; insurance; basel II; solvency II; statistical models; machine learning techniques	LIABILITY INSURANCE MARKETS; RISK; INDUSTRY; REINSURANCE; QUALITY; PRICE	In recent years, financial regulations such as Basel 11 and Solvency 11 have highlighted the utility of credit risk assessments through internal rating systems, particularly for estimating the probability of default (PD) of credit exposures. Financial entities must provide clear definitions of their internal ratings; thus, it is possible to associate internal grades to some external rating scale, and then to attribute the external PD to the internal grades. However, this mapping must be based on an extensive comparison of both internal and external rating criteria. A substantial body of research has been undertaken of rating determinants for banks and large industrial corporations. However, the academic literature on insurers' rating determinants is very limited and fitness measures have not traditionally been provided. This paper proposes a three-step model to analyse rating determinants, and it is applied to a sample of European insurance firms. Firstly, a feature selection process is performed, that mixes statistical, Bayesian, and Machine Learning approaches. From selected features, several multivariate models are run, both in the statistical field (MDA, logit models) and the decision trees research area (C4.5, CART). Their accuracies are compared through bootstrapping strategies, and a final model is proposed. Results show that the feature selection process selects a small group of relevant attributes. Regarding multivariate models, the CART Gini oblique decision tree appears to be a good strategy, providing a quite satisfactory equilibrium between precision and comprehensibility.

J	Yang, YX				Yang, Yingxu			Adaptive credit scoring with kernel learning methods	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						risk management; credit scoring; kernel methods; machine learning	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; PATTERNS	Credit scoring is a method of modelling potential risk of credit applications. Traditionally, logistic regression and discriminant analysis are the most widely used approaches to create scoring models in the industry. However, these methods are associated with quite a few limitations, such as being instable with high-dimensional data and small sample size, intensive variable selection effort and incapability of efficiently handling non-linear features. Most importantly, based on these algorithms, it is difficult to automate the modelling process and when population changes occur, the static models usually fail to adapt and may need to be rebuilt from scratch. In the last few years, the kernel learning approach has been investigated to solve these problems. However, the existing applications of this type of methods (in particular the SVM) in credit scoring have all focused on the batch model and did not address the important problem of how to update the scoring model on-line. This paper presents a novel and practical adaptive scoring system based on an incremental kernel method. With this approach, the scoring model is adjusted according to an on-line update procedure that can always converge to the optimal solution without information loss or running into numerical difficulties. Non-linear features in the data are automatically included in the model through a kernel transformation. This approach does not require any variable reduction effort and is also robust for scoring data with a large number of attributes and highly unbalanced class distributions. Moreover, a new potential kernel function is introduced to further improve the predictive performance of the scoring model and a kernel attribute ranking technique is used that adds transparency in the final model. Experimental studies using real world data sets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Chua, HN; Sung, WK; Wong, L				Chua, Hon Nian; Sung, Wing-Kin; Wong, Limsoon			An efficient strategy for extensive integration of diverse biological data for protein function prediction	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							YEAST SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; GENE-FUNCTION PREDICTION; ANNOTATION; NETWORKS; DISCOVERY; DISPLAY; TOOL	Motivation: With the increasing availability of diverse biological information, protein function prediction approaches have converged towards integration of heterogeneous data. Many adapted existing techniques, such as machine-learning and probabilistic methods, which have proven successful on specific data types. However, the impact of these approaches is hindered by a couple of factors. First, there is little comparison between existing approaches. This is in part due to a divergence in the focus adopted by different works, which makes comparison difficult or even fuzzy. Second, there seems to be over-emphasis on the use of computationally demanding machine-learning methods, which runs counter to the surge in biological data. Analogous to the success of BLAST for sequence homology search, we believe that the ability to tap escalating quantity, quality and diversity of biological data is crucial to the success of automated function prediction as a useful instrument for the advancement of proteomic research. We address these problems by: (1) providing useful comparison between some prominent methods; (2) proposing Integrated Weighted Averaging (IWA)-a scalable, efficient and flexible function prediction framework that integrates diverse information using simple weighting strategies and a local prediction method. The simplicity of the approach makes it possible to make predictions based on on-the-fly information fusion. Results: In addition to its greater efficiency, IWA performs exceptionally well against existing approaches. In the presence of cross-genome information, which is overwhelming for existing approaches, IWA makes even better predictions. We also demonstrate the significance of appropriate weighting strategies in data integration.

Advances in green fluorescence protein (GFP) fusion proteins and automated fluorescence microscopy allow for rapid acquisition of large collections of protein localization images. Recognition of these cell images requires an automated image analysis system. Approaches taken by previous work concentrated on designing a set of optimal features and then applying standard machine-learning algorithms. In fact, trends of recent advances in machine learning and computer vision can be applied to improve the performance. One trend is the advances in multiclass learning with error-correcting output codes (ECOC). Another trend is the use of a large number of weak detectors with boosting for detecting objects in images of real-world scenes. Results: We take advantage of these advances to propose a new learning algorithm, AdaBoost.ERC, coupled with weak and strong detectors, to improve the performance of automatic recognition of protein subcellular locations in cell images. We prepared two image data sets of CHO and Vero cells and downloaded a HeLa cell image data set in the public domain to evaluate our new method. We show that AdaBoost.ERC outperforms other AdaBoost extensions. We demonstrate the benefit of weak detectors by showing significant performance improvements over classifiers using only strong detectors. We also empirically test our methods capability of generalizing to heterogeneous image collections. Compared with previous work, our method performs reasonably well for the HeLa cell images.

It is shown that kernelised FCM provides marginal improvements in the classification rate for several popular Machine Learning data sets. It is observed that the performance of kernelised FCM depends greatly on the selection of the kernel parameters.

Authentic facial expression analysis	IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING			English	Article						authentic emotions; facial expression analysis; classifiers	ALGORITHMS; CLASSIFIERS	There is a growing trend toward emotional intelligence in human-computer interaction paradigms. In order to react appropriately to a human, the computer would need to have some perception of the emotional state of the human. We assert that the most informative channel for machine perception of emotions is through facial expressions in video. One current difficulty in evaluating automatic emotion detection is that there are currently no international databases which are based on authentic emotions. The current facial expression databases contain facial expressions which are not naturally linked to the emotional state of the test subject. Our contributions in this work are twofold: first, we create the first authentic facial expression database where the test subjects are showing the natural facial expressions based upon their emotional state. Second, we evaluate the several promising machine learning algorithms for emotion detection which include techniques such as Bayesian networks, SVMs, and decision trees. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

J	Seewald, AK; Kleedorfer, F				Seewald, Alexander K.; Kleedorfer, Florian			Lambda pruning: an approximation of the string subsequence kernel for practical SVM classification and redundancy clustering	ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION			English	Article						Machine learning; Kernel methods; String kernels; Runtime estimation; Memory consumption estimation		The support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful learning algorithm, e. g., for classification and clustering tasks, that works even for complex data structures such as strings, trees, lists and general graphs. It is based on the usage of a kernel function for measuring scalar products between data units. For analyzing string data Lodhi et al. (J Mach Learn Res 2:419-444, 2002) have introduced a String Subsequence kernel (SSK). In this paper we propose an approximation to SSK based on dropping higher orders terms (i.e., subsequences which are spread out more than a certain threshold) that reduces the computational burden of SSK. As we are also concerned with practical application of complex kernels with high computational complexity and memory consumption, we provide an empirical model to predict runtime and memory of the approximation as well as the original SSK, based on easily measurable properties of input data. We provide extensive results on the properties of the proposed approximation, SSK-LP, with respect to prediction accuracy, runtime and memory consumption. Using some real-life datasets of text mining tasks, we show that models based on SSK and SSK-LP perform similarly for a set of real-life learning tasks, and that the empirical runtime model is also useful in roughly determining total learning time for a SVM using either kernel.

Although, buildup factors for single-layer shields comprised of a single material are well known, calculation of buildup factors for stratified shields, each layer comprised of different material or a combination of materials, represent a complex physical problem. Recently, a new compact mathematical model for multi-layer shield buildup factor representation has been suggested for embedding into point-kernel codes thus replacing traditionally generated complex mathematical expressions. The new regression model is based on support vector machines learning technique, which is an extension of Statistical Learning Theory. The paper gives complete description of the novel methodology with results pertaining to realistic engineering multi-layer shielding geometries. The results based on support vector regression machine learning confirm that this approach provides a framework for general, accurate and computationally acceptable multi-layer buildup factor model.

A machine learning approach to algorithm selection for NP-hard optimization problems: a case study on the MPE problem	ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article							COMPLEXITY; NETWORKS; SOFTWARE; SYSTEMS	Given one instance of an NP- hard optimization problem, can we tell in advance whether it is exactly solvable or not? If it is not, can we predict which approximate algorithm is the best to solve it? Since the behavior of most approximate, randomized, and heuristic search algorithms for NP- hard problems is usually very difficult to characterize analytically, researchers have turned to experimental methods in order to answer these questions. In this paper we present a machine learning-based approach to address the above questions. Models induced from algorithmic performance data can represent the knowledge of how algorithmic performance depends on some easy-to-compute problem instance characteristics. Using these models, we can estimate approximately whether an input instance is exactly solvable or not. Furthermore, when it is classified as exactly unsolvable, we can select the best approximate algorithm for it among a list of candidates. In this paper we use the MPE ( most probable explanation) problem in probabilistic inference as a case study to validate the proposed methodology. Our experimental results show that the machine learning-based algorithm selection system can integrate both exact and inexact algorithms and provide the best overall performance comparing to any single candidate algorithm.

Pretreatment gene expression profiles can be used to predict response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in esophageal cancer	ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY			English	Article						esophageal cancer; cDNA microarray; response prediction; chemoradiation	SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA; PREOPERATIVE CHEMORADIOTHERAPY; ADENOCARCINOMA; MICROARRAY; CHEMORADIATION; CHEMOTHERAPY; ASSOCIATION; PATTERNS; CLASSIFICATION; MANAGEMENT	Background: The use of neoadjuvant therapy, in particular chemoradiotherapy (CRT), in the treatment of esophageal cancer (EC) remains controversial. The ability to predict treatment response in an individual EC patient would greatly aid therapeutic planning. Gene expression profiles of EC were measured and relationship to therapeutic response assessed. Methods: Tumor biopsy samples taken from 46 EC patients before neoadjuvant CRT were analyzed on 10.5K cDNA microarrays. Response to treatment was assessed and correlated to gene expression patterns by using a support vector machine learning algorithm. Results: Complete clinical response at conclusion of CRT was achieved in 6 of 21 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 11 of 25 adenocarcinoma (AC) patients. CRT response was an independent prognostic factor for survival (P < .001). A range of support vector machine models incorporating 10 to 1000 genes produced a predictive performance of tumor response to CRT peaking at 87% in SCC, but a distinct positive prediction profile was unobtainable for AC. A 32-gene classifier was produced, and by means of this classifier, 10 of 21 SCC patients could be accurately identified as having disease with an incomplete response to therapy, and thus unlikely to benefit from neoadjuvant CRT. Conclusions: Our study identifies a 32-gene classifier that can be used to predict response to neoadjuvant CRT in SCC. However, because of the molecular diversity between the two histological subtypes of EC, when considering the AC and SCC samples as a single cohort, a predictive profile could not be resolved, and a negative predictive profile was observed for AC.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a promising unsupervised machine learning technique inspired from the earlier studies in animal learning. In this paper, we propose a new RL technique called the Two Level Reinforcement Learning with Communication (2LRL) method to provide cooperative action selection in a multiagent environment. In 2LRL, learning takes place in two hierarchical levels; in the first level agents learn to select their target and then they select the action directed to their target in the second level. The agents communicate their perception to their neighbors and use the communication information in their decision-making. We applied 2LRL method in a hunter-prey environment and observed a satisfactory cooperative behavior.

The majority of these techniques have been only focused on the prediction of beta-turn location in proteins. We developed a hybrid approach for analysis and prediction of different types of beta-turn. Results: A two-stage hybrid model developed to predict the beta-turn Types I, II, IV and VIII. Multinomial logistic regression was initially used for the first time to select significant parameters in prediction of beta-turn types using a self-consistency test procedure. The extracted parameters were consisted of 80 amino acid positional occurrences and 20 amino acid percentages in beta-turn sequence. The most significant parameters were then selected using multinomial logistic regression model. Among these, the occurrences of glutamine, histidine, glutamic acid and arginine, respectively, in positions i, i + 1, i + 2 and i + 3 of beta-turn sequence had an overall relationship with five beta-turn types. A neural network model was then constructed and fed by the parameters selected by multinomial logistic regression to build a hybrid predictor. The networks have been trained and tested on a non-homologous dataset of 565 protein chains by 9-fold cross-validation. It has been observed that the hybrid model gives a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.235, 0.473, 0.103 and 0.124, respectively, for beta-turn Types I, II, IV and VIII. Our model also distinguished the different types of beta-turn in the embedded binary logit comparisons which have not carried out so far.

Accurate prediction of enzyme mutant activity based on a multibody statistical potential	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS; PROTEIN-STRUCTURE; HIV-1 PROTEASE; ROC CURVE; MUTAGENESIS; INFERENCE; MUTATION; AREA; SNPS	Motivation: An important area of research in biochemistry and molecular biology focuses on characterization of enzyme mutants. However, synthesis and analysis of experimental mutants is time consuming and expensive. We describe a machine-learning approach for inferring the activity levels of all unexplored single point mutants of an enzyme, based on a training set of such mutants with experimentally measured activity. Results: Based on a Delaunay tessellation-derived four-body statistical potential function, a perturbation vector measuring environmental changes relative to wild type (wt) at every residue position uniquely characterizes each enzyme mutant for model development and prediction. First, a measure of model performance utilizing area (AUC) under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve surpasses 0.83 and 0.77 for data sets of experimental HIV-1 protease and T4 lysozyme mutants, respectively. Additionally, a novel method is introduced for evaluating statistical significance associated with the number of correct test set predictions obtained from a trained model. Third, 100 stratified random splits of the protease and T4 lysozyme mutant data sets into training and test sets achieve 77.0 and 80.8 mean accuracy, respectively. Next, protease and T4 lysozyme models trained with experimental mutants are used to predict activity levels for all remaining mutants; a subsequent search for publications reporting on dozens of these test mutants reveals that experimental results are matched by 79 and 86 of predictions, respectively. Finally, learning curves for each mutant enzyme system indicate the influence of training set size on model performance.

GOFR breaks up the heartbeat signal into Gaussian mesa functions, in such a way that each wave is modeled by a single GMF; the model thus generated is easily interpretable by the physician. GOFR is an essential ingredient in a global procedure that locates the R wave after some simple pre-processing, extracts the characteristic shape of each heart beat, assigns P, Q, R, S and T labels through automatic classification, discriminates normal beats (NB) from abnormal beats (AB), and extracts features for diagnosis.

J	Li, Y; Guo, L				Li, Yang; Guo, Li			An active learning based TCM-KNN algorithm for supervised network intrusion detection	COMPUTERS & SECURITY			English	Article						network security; intrusion detection; TCM-KNN (Transductive Confidence Machines for K-Nearest Neighbors); algorithm; machine learning; active learning		As network attacks have increased in number and severity over the past few years, intrusion detection is increasingly becoming a critical component of secure information systems and supervised network intrusion detection has been an active and difficult research topic in the field of intrusion detection for many years. However, it hasn't been widely applied in practice due to some inherent issues. The most important reason is the difficulties in obtaining adequate attack data for the supervised classifiers to model the attack patterns, and the data acquisition task is always time-consuming and greatly relies on the domain experts. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised network intrusion detection method based on TCM-KNN (Transductive Confidence Machines for K-Nearest Neighbors) machine learning algorithm and active learning based training data selection method. It can effectively detect anomalies with high detection rate, low false positives under the circumstance of using much fewer selected data as well as selected features for training in comparison with the traditional supervised intrusion detection methods. A series of experimental results on the well-known KDD Cup 1999 data set demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust and effective than the state-of-the-art intrusion detection methods, as well as can be further optimized as discussed in this paper for real applications.

Understanding the structural features of beta-barrel membrane proteins and detecting them in genomic sequences are challenging tasks in structural and functional genomics. In this review, with the survey of experimentally known amino acid sequences and structures, the characteristic features of amino acid residues in beta-barrel membrane proteins and novel parameters for understanding their folding and stability will be described. The development of statistical methods and machine learning techniques for discriminating beta-barrel membrane proteins from other folding types of globular and membrane proteins will be explained along with their relative importance. Further, different methods including hydrophobicity profiles, rule based approach, amino acid properties, neural networks, hidden Markov models etc. for predicting membrane spanning segments of beta-barrel membrane proteins will be discussed. In addition, the applications of discrimination techniques for detecting beta-barrel membrane proteins in genomic sequences will be outlined. In essence, this comprehensive review would provide an overall picture about beta-barrel membrane proteins starting from the construction of datasets to genome-wide applications.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk of developing low bone mineral density (BMD). This study aimed at developing a new approach to select truly affected IBD patients who are indicated for densitometry, hence, subjecting fewer patients for bone densitometry and reducing expenses. Materials and methods Simple decision trees have been developed by means of WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) package of machine learning algorithms to predict factors influencing the bone density among IBD patients. The BMD status was the outcome variable whereas age, sex, duration of disease, smoking status, corticosteroid use, oral contraceptive use, calcium or vitamin D supplementation, menstruation, milk abstinence, BMI, and levels of calcium, phosphorous, alkaline phosphatase, and 25-OH vitamin D were all attributes. Results Testing showed the decision trees to have sensitivities of 65.7-82.8%, specificities of 95.2-96.3%, accuracies of 86.2-89.8%, and Matthews correlation coefficients of 0.68-0.79. Smoking status was the most significant node (root) for ulcerative colitis and IBD-associated trees whereas calcium status was the root of Crohn's disease patients' decision tree. Conclusion BD specialists could use such decision trees to reduce substantially the number of patients referred for bone densitometry and potentially save resources.

Moreover the reduction of cost and time associated with drug discovery and development is becoming a crucial requirement for pharmaceutical industry. Therefore computational methods allowing reliable predictions of newly synthesized compounds properties are of outmost relevance. In this paper we discuss the role of genetic programming in predictive pharmacokinetics, considering the estimation of adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity processes (ADMET) that a drug undergoes into the patient's organism. We compare genetic programming with other well known machine learning techniques according to their ability to predict oral bioavailability (%F), median oral lethal dose (LD50) and plasma-protein binding levels (%PPB). Since these parameters respectively characterize the percentage of initial drug dose that effectively reaches the systemic blood circulation, the harmful effects and the distribution into the organism of a drug, they are essential for the selection of potentially good molecules. Our results suggest that genetic programming is a valuable technique for predicting pharmacokinetics parameters, both from the point of view of the accuracy and of the generalization ability.

The generic architecture of the diagnostic scheme and its stages of denoising, stamp extraction, and fault detection are explained. The method is tested on three systems of various physical nature. Then, approaches to automated diagnostics of the different classes of the systems are proposed. Machine learning methods (decision-tree-based fuzzy logic) are used to effectively detect faults. Their advantages are explained and confirmed by examples.

The fact that each example document belongs to many classes often leads to very high computational costs that sometimes grow exponentially in the number of features. Seeking to reduce these costs, we explored the possibility of running a "baseline induction algorithm" separately for subsets of features, obtaining a set of classifiers to be combined. For the specific case of classifiers that return not only class labels but also confidences in these labels, we investigate here a few alternative fusion techniques, including our own mechanism that was inspired by the Dempster-Shafer Theory. The paper describes the algorithm and, in our specific case study, compares its performance to that of more traditional mechanisms.

Bayesian kernel methods for analysis of functional neuroimages	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING			English	Article						functional neuroimaging; kernel methods; relevance vector machine (RVM); reversible-jump Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (RJMCMC)	MAGNETIC-RESONANCE IMAGES; CHAIN MONTE-CARLO; FMRI DATA; STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; BRAIN; ACTIVATION; MAPS; MODEL; RESOLUTION; MACHINE	We propose an approach to analyzing functional neuroimages in which 1) regions of neuronal activation are described by a superposition of spatial kernel functions, the parameters of which are estimated from the data and 2) the presence of activation is detected by means of a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). Kernel methods have become a staple of modern machine learning. Herein, we show that these techniques show promise for neuroimage analysis. In an on-off design, we model the spatial activation pattern as a sum of an unknown number of kernel functions of unknown location, amplitude, and/or size. We employ two Bayesian methods of estimating the kernel functions. The first is a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation method based on a Reversible-Jump Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm that searches for both the appropriate model complexity and parameter values. The second is a relevance vector machine (RVM), a kernel machine that is known to be effective in controlling model complexity (and thus discouraging overfitting). In each method, after estimating the activation pattern, we test for local activation using a GLRT. We evaluate the results using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for simulated neuroimaging data and example results for real fMRI data. We find that, while RVM and RJMCMC both produce good results, RVM requires far less computation time, and thus appears to be the more promising of the two approaches.

J	Geng, X; Zhou, ZH; Smith-Miles, K				Geng, Xin; Zhou, Zhi-Hua; Smith-Miles, Kate			Automatic age estimation based on facial aging patterns	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						computer vision; pattern recognition; machine learning; face and gesture recognition; age estimation	FACE VERIFICATION; RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION; IMAGES; SHAPE; MODELS	While recognition of most facial variations, such as identity, expression, and gender, has been extensively studied, automatic age estimation has rarely been explored. In contrast to other facial variations, aging variation presents several unique characteristics which make age estimation a challenging task. This paper proposes an automatic age estimation method named AGES ( AGing pattErn Subspace). The basic idea is to model the aging pattern, which is defined as the sequence of a particular individual's face images sorted in time order, by constructing a representative subspace. The proper aging pattern for a previously unseen face image is determined by the projection in the subspace that can reconstruct the face image with minimum reconstruction error, while the position of the face image in that aging pattern will then indicate its age. In the experiments, AGES and its variants are compared with the limited existing age estimation methods ( WAS and AAS) and some well- established classification methods (kNN, BP, C4.5, and SVM). Moreover, a comparison with human perception ability on age is conducted. It is interesting to note that the performance of AGES is not only significantly better than that of all the other algorithms, but also comparable to that of the human observers.

Finding a machine with maximum number of states is a nontrivial problem because the total number of machines with memory order k is (256)(2k-2), a pretty large number. Based on the analysis of Group-Linking Method, it is shown that the amount of data necessary to reconstruct an FMM is the set of strings not longer than the depth of the machine plus one, which is significantly less than that required for traditional greedy-based machine learning algorithm. Group-Linking Method provides a useful systematic way of generating unified benchmarks to evaluate the capability of machine learning techniques. One example is to test the learning capability of recurrent neural networks. The problem of encoding finite state machines with recurrent neural networks has been extensively explored. However, the great representation power of those networks does not guarantee the solution in terms of learning exists. Previous learning benchmarks are shown to be not rich enough structurally in term of solutions in weight space. This set of benchmarks with great expressive power can serve as a convenient framework in which to study the learning and computation capabilities of various network models. A fundamental understanding of the capabilities of these networks will allow users to be able to select the most appropriate model for a given application.

J	Yu, J; Hao, P				Yu, Jian; Hao, Pengwei			A novel insight into learning theory: The gap between teaching and learning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						data; model; learning algorithm	STABILITY	In our education system, teacher hopes his students to learn something specific from his demonstrations and textbook, his students try to understand his teacher's demonstration and textbook by their own learning methods. Obviously, the aim of the teacher may not be achievable for all students' learning methods. Therefore, students' final learning results are different from teacher's expectation in general, which is called the gap between teaching and learning (in short, GTL) in this paper. As the goal of machine learning is to design a computer program with learning ability, it is naturally questioned if GTL occurs in the machine learning fields. In this paper, we prove that there exists GTL in machine learning. As a common assumption in the current learning theory is that a learning algorithm usually realizes the original expectation, GTL provides a new insight into learning theory. According to the GTL Theory, the learning algorithms can be classified into four types, Type I through Type-IV. Comparison with human learning, the GTL Theory substantiates an intuitive observation: artificial intelligence can never surpass human intelligence from the learning point of view.

We applied our method to Saccharomyces cerevisiae experiments, focusing our attention on cell cycle regulatory mechanisms. We exploited data from deletion mutant experiments (static data), gene expression time series (dynamic data) and the knowledge encoded in the Gene Ontology. Methods: The proposed method is based on four phases. An initial gene network was derived from static data by means of a simple statistical approach. Then, the genes classified in the Gene Ontology as being involved in the cell cycle were selected. As a third step, the network structure was used to initialize a linear dynamic model of gene expression profiles. Finally, a genetic algorithm was applied to update the gene network exploiting data coming from an experiment on the yeast cell cycle. Results: We compared the network models provided by our approach with those obtained with a fully data-driven approach, by looking at their AIC scores and at the percentage of preserved connections in the best solutions. The results show that several nearly equivalent solutions, in terms of AIC scores, can be found. This problem is greatly mitigated by following our approach, which is able to find more robust models by fixing a portion of the network structure on the basis of prior knowledge. The best network structure was biologically evaluated on a set of 22 known cell cycle genes against independent knowledge sources. Conclusions: An approach able to integrate several sources of information is needed to infer gene regulatory networks, as a fully data-driven search is in general prone to overfitting and to unidentifiability problems. The learned networks encode hypotheses on regulatory relationships that need to be verified by means of wet-lab experiments. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

One solution to facilitate the utilization of narrative data could be to classify them according to their content. Objectives: Our objective is to address two issues related to designing an automated classifier: domain experts' agreement on the content of classes Breathing, Blood Circulation and Pain, as well as the ability of a machine-learning-based classifier to learn the classification patterns of the nurses. Methods: The data we used were a set of Finnish intensive care nursing narratives, and we used the regularized least-squares (RLS) algorithm for the automatic classification. The agreement of the nurses was assessed by using Cohen's kappa, and the performance of the algorithm was measured using area under ROC curve (AUC). Results: On average, the values of kappa were around 0.8. The agreement was highest in the class Blood Circulation, and lowest in the class Breathing. The RLS algorithm was able to learn the classification patterns of the three nurses on an acceptable level; the values of AUC were generally around 0.85. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the free text in nursing documentation can be automatically classified and this can offer a way to develop electronic patient records.

For temporal expressions, it relies on semi-automatically produced patterns. For person and organization names, it employs an ensemble of Support Vector Machines that scan the input text in two passes. The ensemble is trained using active learning, whereby the system itself proposes candidate training instances to be annotated by a human during training. The recognizer was evaluated on both a general collection of newspaper articles and a more focussed, in terms of topics, collection of financial articles.

The vast majority of content-based techniques rely on word-based representation of messages. Such approaches require reliable tokenizers for detecting the token boundaries. As a consequence, a common practice of spammers is to attempt to confuse tokenizers using unexpected punctuation marks or special characters within the message. In this paper we explore an alternative low-level representation based on character n-grams which avoids the use of tokcnizers and other language-dependent tools. Based on experiments on two well-known benchmark corpora and a variety of evaluation measures, we show that character n-grams are more reliable features than word-tokens despite the fact that they increase the dimensionality of the problem. Moreover, we propose a method for extracting variable-length n-grams which produces optimal classifiers among the examined models under cost-sensitive evaluation.

The presence of intentional misspellings significantly decrease the accuracy of existing spell checking techniques for TL words. In this work, we formally investigate the nature and type of compressions used in SMS texts, and develop a Hidden Markov Model based word-model for TL. The model parameters have been estimated through standard machine learning techniques from a word-aligned SMS and standard English parallel corpus. The accuracy of the model in correcting TL words is 57.7%, which is almost a threefold improvement over the performance of Aspell. The use of simple bigram language model results in a 35% reduction of the relative word level error rates.

There are often too few training examples for a statistical learner like SVM to overcome the noise and extract useful information reliably. Existing prior domain knowledge represents a valuable source of information for classifying handwritten characters. Explanation-based learning (EBL) provides a way to incorporating prior domain knowledge into the learner. The dynamic bias formed by the interaction of domain knowledge with training examples can yield solution knowledge of potential higher quality. Two EBL approaches, one that uses a special feature kernel function in SVM, the other uses a conventional kernel for the SVM but provides additional preference in choosing the classification hyperplane, are reported.

In this paper, we present an unsupervised approach that both selects the relevant reference set(s) automatically and then uses it for unsupervised extraction. We validate our approach with experimental results that show our unsupervised extraction is competitive with supervised machine learning approaches, including the previous supervised approach that exploits reference sets.

Two machine learning classifiers-quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and support vector machines with Gaussian kernel (SVMg)-were trained separately using standard perimetry data from the Diagnostic Innovations in Glaucoma Study (DIGS), clustered using three clustering schemes on a training data set (123 eyes/123 glaucoma patients with GON; 135 eyes/135 normal control subjects). Trained classifiers were then applied to an independent data set containing 69 eyes of 69 glaucoma patients with early visual field loss and 83 eyes of 83 normal control subjects. Two control conditions were included: unclustered data and a random assignment of locations to clusters. RESULTS. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve ranged from 0.85 (SVMg, thresholds clustered by Glaucoma Hemifield Test sectors) to 0.92 (QDA, thresholds clustered by Garway-Heath mapping) for the training data set. Use of clustered data showed no significant optimization of sensitivity over use of unclustered data, and no single clustering method resulted in significantly higher performance in the independent data set. Sensitivities tended to be higher with QDA than with SVMg, regardless of specificity cutoff and clustering method. CONCLUSIONS. QDA performed better with the early glaucoma data set than did the SVMg. Clustering may be advantageous when data-dimension reduction is needed-for example, when combining field results with other high-dimensional data (e. g., structural imaging data)-but it is not necessary for visual field data alone.

Machine learning classification procedure for selecting SNPs in genomic selection: application to early mortality in broilers	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL BREEDING AND GENETICS			English	Article						filter-wrapper feature selection; genomic selection; machine learning; mortality; single nucleotide polymorphism	GENETIC VALUE; ASSISTED PREDICTION; ASSOCIATION; WRAPPERS; MODEL	Genome-wide association studies using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can identify genetic variants related to complex traits. Typically thousands of SNPs are genotyped, whereas the number of phenotypes for which there is genomic information may be smaller. When predicting phenotypes, options for statistical model building range from incorporating all possible markers into the specification to including only sets of relevant SNPs (features). In the latter case, an efficient method of selecting influential features is required. A two-step feature selection method for binary traits was developed, which consisted of filtering (using information gain), and wrapping (using naive Bayesian classification). The filter reduces the large number of SNPs to a much smaller size, to facilitate the wrapper step. As the procedure is tailored for discrete outcomes, an approach based on discretization of phenotypic values was developed, to enable feature selection in a classification framework. The method was applied to chick mortality rates (0-14 days of age) on progeny from 201 sires in a commercial broiler line, with the goal of identifying SNPs (over 5000) related to progeny mortality. To mimic a case-control study, sires were clustered into two groups, low and high, according to two arbitrarily chosen mortality rate cut points. By varying these thresholds, 11 different 'case-control' samples were formed, and the SNP selection procedure was applied to each sample. To compare the 11 sets of chosen SNPs, predicted residual sum of squares (PRESS) from a linear model was used. The two-step method improved naive Bayesian classification accuracy over the case without feature selection (from around 50 to above 90% without and with feature selection in each case-control sample). The best case-control group (63 sires above or below the thresholds) had the smallest PRESS statistic among groups with model p-values below 0.003. The 17 SNPs selected using this group accounted for 31% of the variation in raw mortality rates between sire families.

A method for linking computed image features to histological semantics in neuropathology	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Self Organizing Map; Discrete Wavelet Transform; feature selection; histopathology; image analysis	RETRIEVAL; CLASSIFICATION; WAVELETS; SYSTEM	In medical image analysis the image content is often represented by features computed from the pixel matrix in order to support the development of improved clinical diagnosis systems. These features need to be interpreted and understood at a clinical level of understanding Many features are of abstract nature, as for instance features derived from a wavelet transform. The interpretation and analysis of such features are difficult. This lack of coincidence between computed features and their meaning for a user in a given situation is commonly referred to as the semantic gap. In this work, we propose a method for feature analysis and interpretation based oil the simultaneous visualization of feature and image domain. Histopathological images of meningiomas WHO (World Health Organization) grade I are represented by features derived from color transforms and the Discrete Wavelet Transform. The wavelet-based feature space is then visualized and explored using unsupervised machine learning methods. We show how to analyze and select features according to their relevance for the description of clinically relevant characteristics. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A number of methods, such as grid search and evolutionary algorithms, have been utilized to optimize model parameters of SVMs. The sensitivity of the results to changes in optimization methods has not been investigated in the context of medical applications. In this study, radial-basis kernel SVM and polynomial kernel SVM mortality prediction models for percutaneous coronary interventions were optimized using (a) mean-squared error, (b) mean cross-entropy error, (c) the area under the receiver operating characteristic, and (d) the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test (HL chi(2)). A threefold cross-validation inner and outer loop method was used to select the best models using the training data, and evaluations were based on previously unseen test data. The results were compared to those produced by logistic regression models optimized using the same indices.

However, high-content screens produce complex data sets, presenting a challenge for both extraction and interpretation of meaningful information. This shifts the high-content screening process bottleneck from the experimental to the analytical stage. In this article, the authors discuss different approaches of data analysis, using a phenotypic neurite outgrowth screen as an example. Distance measurements and hierarchical clustering methods lead to a profound understanding of different high-content screening readouts. In addition, the authors introduce a hit selection procedure based on machine learning methods and demonstrate that this method increases the hit verification rate significantly (up to a factor of 5), compared to conventional hit selection based on single readouts only.

Prediction of side chain Orientations in proteins by statistical machine learning methods	JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS			English	Article						side chain orientations; Statistical machine learning; Protein structure prediction	SECONDARY STRUCTURE PREDICTION; DEAD-END ELIMINATION; AMINO-ACIDS; FOLD-RECOGNITION; NATIVE PROTEINS; HYDROPHOBICITY; ALGORITHM; CASP6; SEQUENCE; MODELS	We develop ways to predict the side chain orientations of residues within a protein structure by using several different statistical machine learning methods. Here side chain orientation of a given residue i is measured by an angle Omega(i) between the vector pointing from the center of the protein structure to the C-i(alpha) atom and the vector pointing from the C-i(alpha) atom to the center of its side chain atoms. To predict the Omega(i) angles, we construct statistical models by using several different methods such as general linear regression, a regression tree and bagging, a neural network, and a support vector machine. The root mean square errors for the different models range only from 36.67 to 37.60 degrees and the correlation coefficients are all between 30% and 34%. The performances of different models in the test set are, thus, quite similar, and show the relative predictive power of these models to be significant in comparison with random side chain orientations.

Krishna			Reduced alphabet motif methodology for GPCR annotation	JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE & DYNAMICS			English	Article						G-protein coupled receptors; GPCRs; reduced alphabets; regular expression; motifs; orphan receptors	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; AMINO-ACID ALPHABETS; MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; INCREASED COVERAGE; FAMILIES DATABASE; LINKED RECEPTORS; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; FOLD; BIOINFORMATICS	Identification and Classification of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) using protein sequences is an important computational challenge, given that experimental screening of thousands of ligands is an expensive proposition. There are two distinct but complementary approaches to GPCR classification - machine learning and sequence motif analysis. Machine learning methodologies typically suffer from problems of class imbalance and lack of multi-class classification. Many sequence motif methods, meanwhile, are too dependent on the similarity of the primary sequence alignments. It is desirable to have a motif discovery and application methodology that is not strongly dependent on primary sequence similarity. It should also overcome limitations of machine learning. We propose and evaluate the effectiveness of a simple methodology that uses a reduced protein functional alphabet representation, where similar functional residues have similar symbols. Regular expression motifs can then be obtained by ClustalW based multiple sequence alignment, using an identity matrix. Since evolutionary matrices like BLOSUM, PAM are not used, this method can be useful for any set of sequences that do not necessarily share a common ancestry. Reduced alphabet motifs can accurately classify known GPCR proteins and the results are comparable to PRINTS and PROSITE. For well known GPCR proteins from SWIS-SPROT, there were no false negatives and only a few false positives. This methodology covers most currently known classes of GPCRs, even if there are very few representative sequences. It also predicts more than one class for certain sequences, thus overcoming the limitation of machine learning methods. We also annotated, 695 orphan receptors, and 121 were identified as belonging to Family A. A simple JavaScript based web interface has been developed to predict GPCR families and subfamilies (www.insilico-consulting.com/gpcrmotif.html).

In this paper we focus on the locomotion of quadruped robots. An effective walking gait of quadruped robots is mainly concerned with two key aspects, namely speed and stability. The large search space of potential parameter settings for leg joints means that hand tuning is not feasible in general. As a result walking parameters are typically determined using machine learning techniques. A major shortcoming of using machine learning techniques is the significant wear and tear of robots since many parameter combinations need to be evaluated before an optimal solution is found. This paper proposes a direct walking gait learning approach, which is specifically designed to reduce wear and tear of robot motors, joints and other hardware. In essence we provide an effective learning mechanism that leads to a solution in a faster convergence time than previous algorithms. The results demonstrate that the new learning algorithm obtains a faster convergence to the best solutions in a short run. This approach is significant in obtaining faster walking gaits which will be useful for a wide range of applications where speed and stability are important. Future work will extend our methods so that the faster convergence algorithm can be applied to a two legged humanoid and lead to less wear and tear whilst still developing a fast and stable gait.

Even though many methods have been proposed to solve this problem, they often result in a loss of model interpretability. The requirement of alignment is a restriction imposed by traditional regression methods due to their failure to represent relations between data objects directly. Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a class of machine-learning methods able to describe relational data directly. We propose a new methodology which is aimed at using the richness in molecular interaction fields (MIFs) without being restricted by any alignment procedure. A set of MIFs is computed and further compressed by finding their minima corresponding to the sites of strongest interaction between a molecule and the applied test probe. ILP uses these minima to build easily interpretable rules about activity expressed as pharmacophore rules in the powerful language of first-order logic. We use a set of previously published inhibitors of factor Xa of the benzamidine family to discuss the problems, requirements and advantages of the new methodology.

Models are based on about 4000 compounds, including an in-house set of 632 drug discovery molecules of Bayer Schering Pharma. For each method, we also consider an appropriate method to obtain error bars, in order to estimate the domain of applicability (DOA) for each model. Here, we investigate error bars from a Bayesian model (Gaussian Process (GP)), an ensemble based approach (Random Forest), and approaches based on the Mahalanobis distance to training data (for Support Vector Machine and Ridge Regression models). We evaluate all approaches in terms of their prediction accuracy (in cross-validation, and on an external validation set of 536 molecules) and in how far the individual error bars can faithfully represent the actual prediction error.

J	Zhao, P; Yu, B				Zhao, Peng; Yu, Bin			Stagewise Lasso	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						backward step; boosting; convexity; Lasso; regularization path	VARIABLE SELECTION; ORACLE PROPERTIES; STATISTICAL VIEW; REGRESSION; APPROXIMATION; NOISE	Many statistical machine learning algorithms minimize either an empirical loss function as in Ad-aBoost, or a penalized empirical loss as in Lasso or SVM. A single regularization tuning parameter controls the trade-off between fidelity to the data and generalizability, or equivalently between bias and variance. When this tuning parameter changes, a regularization "path" of solutions to the minimization problem is generated, and the whole path is needed to select a tuning parameter to optimize the prediction or interpretation performance. Algorithms such as homotopy-Lasso or LARS-Lasso and Forward Stagewise Fitting (FSF) (aka e-Boosting) are of great interest because of their resulted sparse models for interpretation in addition to prediction. In this paper, we propose the BLasso algorithm that ties the FSF (e-Boosting) algorithm with the Lasso method that minimizes the L-1 penalized L-2 loss. BLasso is derived as a coordinate descent method with a fixed stepsize applied to the general Lasso loss function (L1 penalized convex loss). It consists of both a forward step and a backward step. The forward step is similar to e-Boosting or FSF, but the backward step is new and revises the FSF (or e-Boosting) path to approximate the Lasso path. In the cases of a finite number of base learners and a bounded Hessian of the loss function, the BLasso path is shown to converge to the Lasso path when the stepsize goes to zero. For cases with a larger number of base learners than the sample size and when the true model is sparse, our simulations indicate that the BLasso model estimates are sparser than those from FSF with comparable or slightly better prediction performance, and that the the discrete stepsize of BLasso and FSF has an additional regularization effect in terms of prediction and sparsity. Moreover, we introduce the Generalized BLasso algorithm to minimize a general convex loss penalized by a general convex function. Since the (Generalized) BLasso relies only on differences not derivatives, we conclude that it provides a class of simple and easy-to-implement algorithms for tracing the regularization or solution paths of penalized minimization problems.

A tutorial on kernel methods for categorization	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review						kernel; similarity; machine learning; generalization; categorization	LINEAR SEPARABILITY; CLASSIFICATION; SIMILARITY; EXEMPLAR; MODELS	The abilities to learn and to categorize are fundamental for cognitive systems, be it animals or machines, and therefore have attracted attention from engineers and psychologists alike. Modern machine learning methods and psychological models of categorization are remarkably similar, partly because these two fields share a common history in artificial neural networks and reinforcement learning. However, machine learning is now an independent and mature field that has moved beyond psychologically or neurally inspired algorithms towards providing foundations for a theory of learning that is rooted in statistics and functional analysis. Much of this research is potentially interesting for psychological theories of learning and categorization but also hardly accessible for psychologists. Here, we provide a tutorial introduction to a popular class of machine learning tools, called kernel methods. These methods are closely related to perceptrons, radial-basis-function neural networks and exemplar theories of categorization. Recent theoretical advances in machine learning are closely tied to the idea that the similarity of patterns can be encapsulated in a positive definite kernel. Such a positive definite kernel can define a reproducing kernel Hilbert space which allows one to use powerful tools from functional analysis for the analysis of learning algorithms. We give basic explanations of some key concepts-the so-called kernel trick, the representer theorem and regularization-which may open up the possibility that insights from machine learning can feed back into psychology.

J	Xie, Y; Raghavan, VV				Xie, Ying; Raghavan, Vijay V.			Language-modeling kernel based approach for information retrieval	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								In this presentation, we propose a novel integrated information retrieval approach that provides a unified solution for two challenging problems in the field of information retrieval. The first problem is how to build an optimal vector space corresponding to users' different information needs when applying the vector space model. The second one is how to smoothly incorporate the advantages of machine learning techniques into the language modeling approach. To solve these problems, we designed the language-modeling kernel function, which has all the modeling powers provided by language modeling techniques. In addition, for each information need, this kernel function automatically determines an optimal vector space, for which a discriminative learning machine, such as the support vector machine, can be applied to find an optimal decision boundary between relevant and nonrelevant documents. Large-scale experiments on standard test-beds show that our approach makes significant improvements over other state-of-the-art information retrieval methods.

The presented approach is aimed at handling uncertain information during the process of inducing decision trees and generalizes the rough set based approach to decision tree construction by allowing some extent misclassification when classifying objects. In the paper, two concepts, i.e. variable precision explicit region, variable precision implicit region, and the process for inducing decision trees are introduced. The authors discuss the differences between the rough set based approaches and the fundamental entropy based method. The comparison between the presented approach and the rough set based approach and the fundamental entropy based method on some data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is also reported.

Monitoring novel metabolic pathways using metabolomics and machine learning: induction of the phosphoketolase pathway in Aspergillus nidulans cultivations	METABOLOMICS			English	Article						Aspergillus nidulans; phosphoketolase; metabolite profile; self organizing maps (SOM)	SELF-ORGANIZING MAP; CHAIN FATTY-ACIDS; FUSARIUM-OXYSPORUM; FILAMENTOUS FUNGI; ACETATE; XYLOSE; YEAST; QUANTIFICATION; BIOSYNTHESIS; GLUCOSE	The physiological phenotype of Aspergillus nidulans was determined under di. erent environmental conditions through the quanti. cation of the intracellular and extracellular metabolite pools and clear evidence of the presence of a novel fungal metabolic pathway, the phosphoketolase pathway, was obtained. Induction of the phosphoketolase pathway resulted after blocking the EMP pathway through the deactivation of glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase (G3PD). Deactivation of G3PD in cultivations of A. nidulans on glucose and xylose led to a 10-fold decrease in the specific growth rate; however, growth could still be sustained solely through the phosphoketolase pathway. Metabolomics and machine learning tools were successfully used to monitor the alteration caused by the inhibition of G3PD in the metabolism of A. nidulans grown on glucose, xylose, acetate as well as mixtures of glucose or xylose with acetate. This is the first study that demonstrates in vivo that the fungal central carbon metabolism includes an active phosphoketolase pathway.

An augmented CRTRL for complex-valued recurrent neural networks	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						complex nonlinear adaptive filters; recurrent neural networks (RNNs); complex-valued RTRL (CRTRL); augmented complex statistics	ALGORITHM	Real world processes with an "intensity" and "direction" component can be made complex by convenience of representation (vector fields, radar, sonar), and their processing directly in the field of complex numbers C is not only natural but is also becoming commonplace in modern applications. Yet, adaptive signal processing and machine learning algorithms suitable for the processing of such signals directly in C are only emerging. To this cause we introduce a second order statistical learning framework for a I general class of nonlinear adaptive filters with feedback realized as recurrent neural networks (RNNs). For rigour, both the so-called proper- and improper-second order statistics of complex processes is taken into account, and the proposed augmented complex real-time recurrent learning (ACRTRL) algorithm for RNNs has been shown to be suitable for processing a wide range of both benchmark and real-world complex processes.

Hardware implementation of a novel genetic algorithm	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						genetic algorithms; genetic hardware; machine learning		This paper introduces a novel genetic algorithm whose features have been purposely designed to be suited to hardware implementation. This is distinct from previous hardware designs that have been realized directly from conventional genetic algorithm approaches. To be suitable for hardware implementation, we propose that a genetic algorithm should attempt to both minimize final layout dimensions and reduce execution time while remaining a valid implementation. Consequently, the new genetic algorithm specifically aims to keep the requisite silicon area to a minimum by incorporating a monogenetic strategy that retains only the optimal individual, resulting in a dramatic reduction in the memory requirement and obviating the need for crossover circuitry. The results given in this paper demonstrate that new approach improves on a number of existing hardware genetic algorithm implementations in terms of the quality of the solution produced, the calculation time and the hardware component requirements.

J	Navia-Vazquez, A				Navia-Vazquez, A.			Compact multi-class support vector machine	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						compact; multiclass; support vector; reduced set; pre-image	CLASSIFIERS; CLASSIFICATION	Multiclass support vector machines (MSVMs) have become a very appealing machine learning approach due to their good results in many classification problems. The resulting machines, though, are usually too large for being usable in many real world applications, especially when fast real-time response is needed. Some approaches aim at decreasing the complexity of the resulting full-size SVM classifiers. The most successful methods follow the "reduced-set" procedure, but they have to start from a full SVM solution, and then solve a pre-image problem, prone to fall in local minima. We propose here a compact multiclass SVM (CMSVM) method, that does not need the full SVM solution as a starting point (and hence scales potentially better), and does not need to address the pre-image problem. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme by means of real world data sets, and we compare it against other state-of-the-art MSVM techniques. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To retrieve similar motion data, each human joint's motion clip is regarded as a bag, while each of its segments is regarded as an instance. First 3D temporal- spatial features and their keyspaces of each human joint are extracted. Then, data driven decision trees based on ensemble multiple instance are automatically constructed to reflect the influence of each point during the comparison of motion similarity. Last, we use the method of multiple instance retrieval to complete motion retrieval. Experiment results show that our approaches are effective for motion data retrieval in agriculture inforinatisation.

To test whether MCS could improve land cover classification results from remote sensing imagery, conservative voting, majority voting, and plurality voting were processed to combine individual classification results in this study. Considering the characteristics of high spatial resolution imagery, object-oriented classification methods were employed. Firstly, the objects were acquired by segmenting the original images at two scales; then taking the "objects" as the classification units, five kinds of classifiers-iterative self-organising data analysis (ISODATA), Mahalanobis distance, maximun-likelihood, neural network, and expert system-were selected to classify urban vegetation categories using different samples and feature spaces to maintain independence among individual classifiers. The three voting rules were then used to combine the individual classification results. For unclassified objects, the ISODATA method was used again to identify their categories. The accuracy assessment showed that the three combined classification results gained higher accuracy than the individual classifier, and the plurality voting rules obtained the best identification results.

Using a compilation of genome-scale temporal transcriptome data for the model organism, Streptomyces coelicolor, under different environmental and genetic perturbations, we have developed a supervised machine-learning method for operon prediction in this microorganism. We demonstrate that, using features dependent on transcriptome dynamics and genome sequence, a support vector machines (SVM)-based classification algorithm can accurately classify 90 of gene pairs in a set of known operons. Based on model predictions for the entire genome, we verified the co-transcription of more than 250 gene pairs by RT-PCR. These results vastly increase the database of known operons in S. coelicolor and provide valuable information for exploring gene function and regulation to harness the potential of this differentiating microorganism for synthesis of natural products.

Classification in the presence of class noise using a probabilistic Kernel Fisher method	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						classification; class noise; labeling noise; Kernel Fisher discriminant	COMPARATIVE GENOMIC HYBRIDIZATION; NEAREST-NEIGHBOR RULE; RECOGNITION; TUMORS; BRCA1	In machine learning, class noise occurs frequently and deteriorates the classifier derived from the noisy data set. This paper presents two promising classifiers for this problem based on a probabilistic model proposed by Lawrence and Schoikopf (2001). The proposed algorithms are able to tolerate class noise, and extend the earlier work of Lawrence and Scholkopf in two ways. First, we present a novel incorporation of their probabilistic noise model in the Kernel Fisher discriminant; second, the distribution assumption previously made is relaxed in our work. The methods were investigated on simulated noisy data sets and a real world comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) data set. The results show that the proposed approaches substantially improve standard classifiers in noisy data sets, and achieve larger performance gain in non-Gaussian data sets and small size data sets.

J	Hu, QH; Xie, ZX; Yu, DR				Hu, Qinghua; Xie, Zongxia; Yu, Daren			Hybrid attribute reduction based on a novel fuzzy-rough model and information granulation	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						numerical feature; categorical feature; feature selection; attribute reduction; fuzzy set; rough set; inclusion degree	FEATURE-SELECTION; INCLUSION DEGREE; SETS; APPROXIMATION; ALGORITHM; DISCRETIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; CATEGORIZATION; DIMENSIONALITY; SIMILARITY	Feature subset selection has become an important challenge in areas of pattern recognition, machine learning and data mining. As different semantics are hidden in numerical and categorical features, there are two strategies for selecting hybrid attributes: discretizing numerical variables or numericalize categorical features. In this paper, we introduce a simple and efficient hybrid attribute reduction algorithm based on a generalized fuzzy-rough model. A theoretic framework of fuzzy-rough model based on fuzzy relations is presented, which underlies a foundation for algorithm construction. We derive several attribute significance measures based on the proposed fuzzy-rough model and construct a forward greedy algorithm for hybrid attribute reduction. The experiments show that the technique of variable precision fuzzy inclusion in computing decision positive region can get the optimal classification performance. Number of the selected features is the least but accuracy is the best. (c) 2007 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Both theoretical and experimental researches show that combining a set of accurate and diverse classifiers will lead to a powerful classification system. An algorithm, called FS-PP-EROS, for selective ensemble of rough subspaces is proposed in this paper. Rough set-based attribute reduction is introduced to generate a set of reducts, and then each reduct is used to train a base classifier. We introduce an accuracy-guided forward search and post-pruning strategy to select part of the base classifiers for constructing an efficient and effective ensemble system. The experiments show that classification accuracies of ensemble systems with accuracy-guided forward search strategy will increase at first, arrive at a maximal value, then decrease in sequentially adding the base classifiers. We delete the base classifiers added after the maximal accuracy. The experimental results show that the proposed ensemble systems outperform bagging and random subspace methods in terms of accuracy and size of ensemble systems. FS-PP-EROS can keep or improve the classification accuracy with very few base classifiers, which leads to a powerful and compact classification system. (c) 2007 Pattern Recognition Society.

J	Frankel, J; King, S				Frankel, Joe; King, Simon			Factoring Gaussian precision matrices for linear dynamic models	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						linear dynamic model; error distribution; precision matrix	SPEECH RECOGNITION; COVARIANCE MATRICES	The linear dynamic model (LDM), also known as the Kalman filter model, has been the subject of research in the engineering, control, and more recently, machine learning and speech technology communities. The Gaussian noise processes are usually assumed to have diagonal, or occasionally full, covariance matrices. A number of recent papers have considered modelling the precision rather than covariance matrix of a Gaussian distribution, and this work applies such ideas to the LDM. A Gaussian precision matrix P can be factored into the form P = (USU)-S-T where U is a transform and S a diagonal matrix. By varying the form of U, the covariance can be specified as being diagonal or full, or used to model a given set of spatial dependencies. Furthermore, the transform and scaling components can be shared between models, allowing richer distributions with only marginally more parameters than required to specify diagonal covariances. The method described in this paper allows the construction of models with an appropriate number of parameters for the amount of available training data. We provide illustrative experimental results on synthetic and real speech data in which models with factored precision matrices and automatically-selected numbers of parameters are as good as or better than models with diagonal covariances on small data sets and as good as models with full covariance matrices on larger data sets.

We applied in silico methods to automatically classify drugs according to the Biopharmaceutics Drug Disposition Classification System (BDDCS). Materials and Methods. Models were developed using machine learning methods including recursive partitioning (RP), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms with ChemDraw, clogP, polar surface area, VolSurf and MolConnZ descriptors. The dataset consisted of 165 training and 56 test set molecules. Results. RF model 3, RP model 1, and SVM model 1 can correctly predict 73.1, 63.6 and 78.6% test compounds in classes 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Both RP and SVM models can be used for class 4 prediction. The inclusion of consensus analysis resulted in improved test set predictions for class 2 and 4 drugs. Conclusions. The models can be used to predict BDDCS class for new compounds from molecular structure using readily available molecular descriptors and software, representing an area where in silico approaches could aid the pharmaceutical industry in speeding drugs to the patient and reducing costs. This could have significant applications in drug discovery to identify molecules that may have future developability issues.

J	Kelly, KT				Kelly, Kevin T.			A new solution to the puzzle of simplicity	PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	20th Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy-of-Science-Association	NOV 02-04, 2006	Vancouver, CANADA	Philosophy Sci Assoc			INFERENCE	Explaining the connection, if any, between simplicity and truth is among the deepest problems facing the philosophy of science, statistics, and machine learning. Say that an efficient truth finding method minimizes worst case costs en route to converging to the true answer to a theory choice problem. Let the costs considered include the number of times a false answer is selected, the number of times opinion is reversed, and the times at which the reversals occur. It is demonstrated that (1) always choosing the simplest theory compatible with experience, and (2) hanging onto it while it remains simplest, is both necessary and sufficient for efficiency.

J	Edelman, S; Waterfall, H				Edelman, Shimon; Waterfall, Heidi			Behavioral and computational aspects of language and its acquisition	PHYSICS OF LIFE REVIEWS			English	Review						computational cognitive linguistics; Psycholinguistics; machine learning; language acquisition	MATERNAL SPEECH; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; PROBABILISTIC MODELS; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; INDUCTIVE INFERENCE; CHILDS DEVELOPMENT; UNIVERSAL GRAMMAR; COGNITIVE SCIENCE; YOUNG-CHILDREN; FORMAL THEORY	One of the greatest challenges facing the cognitive sciences is to explain what it means to know a language, and how the knowledge of language is acquired. The dominant approach to this challenge within linguistics has been to seek an efficient characterization of the wealth of documented structural properties of language in terms of a compact generative grammar-ideally, the minimal necessary set of innate, universal, exception-less, highly abstract rules that jointly generate all and only the observed phenomena and are common to all human languages. We review developmental, behavioral, and computational evidence that seems to favor an alternative view of language, according to which linguistic structures are generated by a large, open set of constructions of varying degrees of abstraction and complexity, which embody both form and meaning and are acquired through socially situated experience in a given language community, by probabilistic learning algorithms that resemble those at work in other cognitive modalities.

An invariant is a property that holds at a certain point or points in a program; these are often used in assert statements, documentation, and formal specifications. Examples include being constant (x = a), non-zero (x not equal 0), being in a range (a <= x <= b), linear relationships (y = ax + b), ordering (x <= y), functions from a library (x = fn(y)), containment (x epsilon y), sortedness (x is sorted), and many more. Users can extend Daikon to check for additional invariants. Dynamic invariant detection runs a program, observes the values that the program computes, and then reports properties that were true over the observed executions. Dynamic invariant detection is a machine learning technique that can be applied to arbitrary data. Daikon can detect invariants in C, C + +, Java, and Perl programs, and in record-structured data sources; it is easy to extend Daikon to other applications. Invariants can be useful in program understanding and a host of other applications. Daikon's output has been used for generating test cases, predicting incompatibilities in component integration, automating theorem proving, repairing inconsistent data structures, and checking the validity of data streams, among other tasks.

Nave Bayes for microRNA target predictionsmachine learning for microRNA targets	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							GENES; IDENTIFICATION	Motivation: Most computational methodologies for miRNA:mRNA target gene prediction use the seed segment of the miRNA and require cross-species sequence conservation in this region of the mRNA target. Methods that do not rely on conservation generate numbers of predictions, which are too large to validate. We describe a target prediction method (NBmiRTar) that does not require sequence conservation, using instead, machine learning by a nave Bayes classifier. It generates a model from sequence and miRNA:mRNA duplex information from validated targets and artificially generated negative examples. Both the seed and out-seed segments of the miRNA:mRNA duplex are used for target identification. Results: The application of machine-learning techniques to the features we have used is a useful and general approach for microRNA target gene prediction. Our technique produces fewer false positive predictions and fewer target candidates to be tested. It exhibits higher sensitivity and specificity than algorithms that rely on conserved genomic regions to decrease false positive predictions.

Efforts in predicting peroxisomal protein import are challenged by species variation and sparse sequence data sets with experimentally confirmed localization. We present a predictor of peroxisomal import based on the presence of the dominant peroxisomal targeting signal one (PTS1), a seemingly well conserved but highly unspecific motif. The signal appears to rely on subtle dependencies with the preceding residues. We evaluate prediction accuracies against two alternative predictor services, PEROXIP and the PTS1 PREDICTOR. We test the integrity of prediction on a range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteomes lacking peroxisomes. Similarly we test the accuracy on peroxisomal proteins known to not overlap with training data. The model identified a number of proteins within the RIKEN IPS7 mouse protein dataset as potentially novel peroxisomal proteins. Three were confirmed in vitro using immunofluorescent detection of myc-epitope-tagged proteins in transiently transfected BHK-21 cells (Dhrs2, Serhl, and Ehhadh). The final model has a superior specificity to both alternatives, and an accuracy better than PEROXIP and on par with PTs1 PREDICTOR. Thus, the model we present should prove invaluable for labeling PTS1 targeted proteins with high confidence. We use the predictor to screen several additional eukaryotic genomes to revise previously estimated numbers of peroxisomal proteins. Available at http://pprowler.itee.uq.edu.au.

Constitutional descriptors and topological descriptors are calculated to characterize the structural and physicochemical properties of compounds and Kennard-Stone method is used to design the training set and Metropolis Monte Carlo simulated method is used for feature selection. It is shown that SVM method outperforms other machine learning methods used in this study and the final SVM model after feature selection can give a prediction accuracy of 91.62%. This suggests that SVM method with proper training set design and feature selection is potentially useful for the prediction of the activity of a diversity set of DHFR inhibitors.

Generator estimation of Markov jump processes	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS			English	Article						Markov jump process; generator estimation; embedding problem; EM-algorithm; maximum likelihood	SUBSTITUTION MODELS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; EM ALGORITHM; CHAINS; MATRICES	Estimating the generator of a continuous-time Markov jump process based on incomplete data is a problem which arises in various applications ranging from machine learning to molecular dynamics. Several methods have been devised for this purpose: a quadratic programming approach (cf. [D.T. Crommelin, E. Vanden-Eijnden, Fitting timeseries by continuous-time Markov chains: a quadratic programming approach, J. Comp. Phys. 217 (2006) 782-805]), a resolvent method (cf. [T. Muller, Modellierung von Proteinevolution, PhD thesis, Heidelberg, 2001]), and various implementations of an expectation-maximization algorithm ([S. Asmussen, O. Nerman, M. Olsson, Fitting phase-type distributions via the EM algorithm, Scand. J. Stat. 23 (1996) 419-441; I. Holmes, G.M. Rubin, An expectation maximization algorithm for training hidden substitution models, J. Mol. Biol. 317 (2002) 753-764; U. Nodelman, C.R. Shelton, D. Koller, Expectation maximization and complex duration distributions for continuous time Bayesian networks, in: Proceedings of the twenty-first conference on uncertainty in AI (UAI), 2005, pp. 421-430; M. Bladt, M. Sorensen, Statistical inference for discretely observed Markov jump processes, JR. Statist. Soc. B 67 (2005) 395-410]). Some of these methods, however, seem to be known only in a particular research community, and have later been reinvented in a different context. The purpose of this paper is to compile a catalogue of existing approaches, to compare the strengths and weaknesses, and to test their performance in a series of numerical examples. These examples include carefully chosen model problems and an application to time series from molecular dynamics. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Glycosylation plays an important role in biological processes ranging from protein folding and subcellular localization, to ligand recognition and cell-cell interactions. Experimental identification of glycosylation sites is expensive and laborious. Hence, there is significant interest in the development of computational methods for reliable prediction of glycosylation sites from amino acid sequences. Results: We explore machine learning methods for training classifiers to predict the amino acid residues that are likely to be glycosylated using information derived from the target amino acid residue and its sequence neighbors. We compare the performance of Support Vector Machine classifiers and ensembles of Support Vector Machine classifiers trained on a dataset of experimentally determined N-linked, O-linked, and C-linked glycosylation sites extracted from O-GlycBase version 6.00, a database of 242 proteins from several different species. The results of our experiments show that the ensembles of Support Vector Machine classifiers outperform single Support Vector Machine classifiers on the problem of predicting glycosylation sites in terms of a range of standard measures for comparing the performance of classifiers. The resulting methods have been implemented in EnsembleGly, a web server for glycosylation site prediction.

J	Gu, J; Fu, H; Zhang, X; Li, Y				Gu, Jin; Fu, Hu; Zhang, Xuegong; Li, Yanda			Identifications of conserved 7-mers in 3'-UTRs and microRNAs in Drosophila	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							RNA SECONDARY STRUCTURES; GENOME BROWSER DATABASE; FACTOR-BINDING SITES; COMPUTATIONAL IDENTIFICATION; ANIMAL MICRORNAS; GENE ONTOLOGY; SEQUENCE; DISCOVERY; PREDICTION; TARGETS	Background: MicroRNAs ( miRNAs) are a class of endogenous regulatory small RNAs which play an important role in posttranscriptional regulations by targeting mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression. The base-pairing between the 5'-end of miRNA and the target mRNA 3'UTRs is essential for the miRNA: mRNA recognition. Recent studies show that many seed matches in 3'-UTRs, which are fully complementary to miRNA 5'-ends, are highly conserved. Based on these features, a two-stage strategy can be implemented to achieve the de novo identification of miRNAs by requiring the complete base-pairing between the 5'-end of miRNA candidates and the potential seed matches in 3'-UTRs. Results: We presented a new method, which combined multiple pairwise conservation information, to identify the frequently-occurred and conserved 7-mers in 3'-UTRs. A pairwise conservation score (PCS) was introduced to describe the conservation of all 7-mers in 3'-UTRs between any two Drosophila species. Using PCSs computed from 6 pairs of flies, we developed a support vector machine (SVM) classifier ensemble, named Cons-SVM and identified 689 conserved 7-mers including 63 seed matches covering 32 out of 38 known miRNA families in the reference dataset. In the second stage, we searched for 90 nt conserved stem-loop regions containing the complementary sequences to the identified 7-mers and used the previously published miRNA prediction software to analyze these stem-loops. We predicted 47 miRNA candidates in the genome-wide screen. Conclusion: Cons-SVM takes advantage of the independent evolutionary information from the 6 pairs of flies and shows high sensitivity in identifying seed matches in 3'-UTRs. Combining the multiple pairwise conservation information by the machine learning approach, we finally identified 47 miRNA candidates in D. melanogaster.

Towards the development of an error checker for radiotherapy treatment plans: a preliminary study	PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article							RADIATION TREATMENT; QUALITY-ASSURANCE; INCIDENTS; DELIVERY	Major accidents can happen during radiotherapy, with an extremely severe consequence to both patients and clinical professionals. We propose to use machine learning and data mining techniques to help detect large human errors in a radiotherapy treatment plan, as a complement to human inspection. One such technique is computer clustering. The basic idea of using clustering algorithms for outlier detection is to first cluster (based on the treatment parameters) a large number of patient treatment plans. Then, when checking a new treatment plan, the parameters of the plan will be tested to see whether or not they belong to the established clusters. If not, they will be considered as 'outliers' and therefore highlighted to catch the attention of the human chart checkers. As a preliminary study, we applied the K-means clustering algorithm to a simple patient model, i.e., 'four-field' box prostate treatment. One thousand plans were used to build the clusters while another 650 plans were used to test the proposed method. It was found that there are eight distinct clusters. At the error levels of +/-100% of the original values of the monitor unit, the detection rate is about 100%. At +/-50% error level, the detection rate is about 80%. The false positive rate is about 10%. When purposely changing the beam energy to a value different from that in the treatment plan, the detection rate is 100% for posterior, right-lateral and left-lateral fields, and about 77% for the anterior field. This preliminary work has shown promise for developing the proposed automatic outlier detection software, although more efforts will still be required.

PDFAs are a probabilistic model for the generation of strings of symbols, that have been used in the context of speech and handwriting recognition, and bioinformatics. Recent work on learning PDFAs from random examples has used the KL-divergence as the error measure; here we use the variation distance. We build on recent work by Clark and Thollard, and show that the use of the variation distance allows simplifications to be made to the algorithms, and also a strengthening of the results; in particular that using the variation distance, we obtain polynomial sample size bounds that are independent of the expected length of strings.

Nonetheless, their reasonable combination is yet to be studied, and integrating the existing solutions either fails or works with a complexity that can be significantly improved. In this paper we prove the equivalence of EXACT learning attribute-efficiently with and without corrupt oracles. For each of the possible scenarios we describe a generic scheme that enables learning in these cases using modifications of the standard learning algorithms. We also generalize and improve previous non-attribute-efficient algorithms for teaming with corrupt oracles. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Landry, M; Winters-Hilt, S				Landry, Matthew; Winters-Hilt, Stephen			Analysis of nanopore detector measurements using Machine-Learning methods, with application to single-molecule kinetic analysis	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article								Background: A nanopore detector has a nanometer-scale trans-membrane channel across which a potential difference is established, resulting in an ionic current through the channel in the pA-nA range. A distinctive channel current blockade signal is created as individually "captured" DNA molecules interact with the channel and modulate the channel's ionic current. The nanopore detector is sensitive enough that nearly identical DNA molecules can be classified with very high accuracy using machine learning techniques such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Results: A non-standard implementation of an HMM, emission inversion, is used for improved classification. Additional features are considered for the feature vector employed by the SVM for classification as well: The addition of a single feature representing spike density is shown to notably improve classification results. Another, much larger, feature set expansion was studied (2500 additional features instead of 1), deriving from including all the HMM's transition probabilities. The expanded features can introduce redundant, noisy information (as well as diagnostic information) into the current feature set, and thus degrade classification performance. A hybrid Adaptive Boosting approach was used for feature selection to alleviate this problem. Conclusion: The methods shown here, for more informed feature extraction, improve both classification and provide biologists and chemists with tools for obtaining a better understanding of the kinetic properties of molecules of interest.

A convergent decomposition algorithm for support vector machines	COMPUTATIONAL OPTIMIZATION AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Mathematical Methods for Learning (MML-2004)	JUN 21-24, 2004	Como, ITALY	US Natl Sci Fdn		large scale optimization; decomposition methods; proximal point modification; support vector machine	OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS; MINIMIZATION	In this work we consider nonlinear minimization problems with a single linear equality constraint and box constraints. In particular we are interested in solving problems where the number of variables is so huge that traditional optimization methods cannot be directly applied. Many interesting real world problems lead to the solution of large scale constrained problems with this structure. For example, the special subclass of problems with convex quadratic objective function plays a fundamental role in the training of Support Vector Machine, which is a technique for machine learning problems. For this particular subclass of convex quadratic problem, some convergent decomposition methods, based on the solution of a sequence of smaller subproblems, have been proposed. In this paper we define a new globally convergent decomposition algorithm that differs from the previous methods in the rule for the choice of the subproblem variables and in the presence of a proximal point modification in the objective function of the subproblems. In particular, the new rule for sequentially selecting the subproblems appears to be suited to tackle large scale problems, while the introduction of the proximal point term allows us to ensure the global convergence of the algorithm for the general case of nonconvex objective function. Furthermore, we report some preliminary numerical results on support vector classification problems with up to 100 thousands variables.

Artificial immune recognition system has shown an effective performance on several problems such as machine learning benchmark problems and medical classification problems like breast cancer diabetes and liver disorders classification. The proposed approach consists of three stages. In the first stage, the dimensions of heart disease and hepatitis disease datasets are reduced to 9 from 13 and 19 in the feature selection (FS) sub-program by means of C4.5 decision tree algorithm (CBA program), respectively In the second stage, heart disease and hepatitis disease datasets are normalized in the range of [0,1] and are weighted via fuzzy weighted pre-processing. In the third stage, weighted input values obtained from fuzzy weighted pre-processing are classified using AIRS classifier system. The obtained classification accuracies of our system are 9239% and 81.82% using 50-50% training-test split for heart disease and hepatitis disease datasets, respectively with these results, the proposed method can be used in medical decision support systems.

J	Huang, CJ; Chu, SS; Guan, CT				Huang, Chenn-Jung; Chu, San-Shine; Guan, Chih-Tai			Implementation and performance evaluation of parameter improvement mechanisms for intelligent e-learning systems	COMPUTERS & EDUCATION			English	Article						portfolio; open source software; machine learning; support vector machines; Chinese knowledge and information processing	DIAGNOSIS	In recent years, designing useful learning diagnosis systems has become a hot research topic in the literature. In order to help teachers easily analyze students' profiles in intelligent tutoring system, it is essential that students' portfolios can be transformed into some useful information to reflect the extent of students' participation in the curriculum activity. It is observed that students' portfolios seldom reflect students' actual studying behaviors in the learning diagnosis systems given in the literature; we thus propose three kinds of learning parameter improvement mechanisms in this research to establish effective parameters that are frequently used in the learning platforms. The proposed learning parameter improvement mechanisms can calculate the students' effective online learning time, extract the portion of a message in discussion section which is strongly related to the learning topics, and detect plagiarism in students' homework, respectively. The derived numeric parameters are then fed into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict each learner's performance in order to verify whether they mirror the student's studying behaviors. The experimental results show that the prediction rate for the SVM classifier can be increased up to 35.7% in average after the inputs to the classifier are "purified" by the learning parameter improvement mechanisms. This splendid achievement reveals that the proposed algorithms indeed produce the effective learning parameters for commonly used e-learning platforms in the literature. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Rick; Veroff, Robert			Learning and modeling biosignatures from tissue images	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						automated disease classification; computational biology; statistical models of infection; computer vision; feature extraction; pattern recognition; machine learning; Bayesian networks	PROBABILISTIC NETWORKS	Ideally biosignatures can be detected at the early infection phase and used both for developing diagnostic patterns and for prognostic triage. Such biosignatures are important for vaccine validation and to provide risk stratification to a population such as for the identification of individuals who are exposed to biological or chemical agents and who are at high risk for developing an infection. The research goal is to detect broad based biosignature models and is initially focused on developing effective computer-augmented pathology tied to animal models developed at the University of New Mexico (UNM). Using lung tissue from infected and naive mice, feature extraction from images of the tissue under a specialized microscope, and Bayesian networks to analyze the data sets of features, we were able to differentiate normal from diseased samples and viral from bacterial samples in mid to late stages of infection. This effort has shown the potential effectiveness of computer-augmented pathology in this application. The extended research intends to couple analysis of serum, microarray analysis of organs, proteomic data and the pathology. The rational for the current invasive procedure on animal models is to facilitate the development of data analysis and machine learning techniques that can eventually be generalized to the task of discovering non-invasive and early stage biosignatures for human models.

J	Gibson, L; Barrett, B; Burbidge, A				Gibson, Lesley; Barrett, Brent; Burbidge, Allan			Dealing with uncertain absences in habitat modelling: a case study of a rare ground-dwelling parrot	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS			English	Article						Akaike Information Criterion (AIC); generalized linear model (GLM); western ground parrot; MAXENT; presence-only data; species distribution models	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; PRESENCE-ONLY DATA; PEZOPORUS-WALLICUS; SPATIAL PREDICTION; SUITABILITY MODELS; COASTAL HEATHLAND; ECOLOGICAL THEORY; MICROHABITAT USE; SAMPLE-SIZE; DISTRIBUTIONS	In the development of a species distribution model based on regression techniques such as generalized linear or additive modelling (GLM/GAM), a basic assumption is that records of species presence and absence are real. However, a common concern in many studies examining species distributions is that absences cannot be inferred with certainty. This is particularly the case where the species is rare, difficult to detect and/or does not occupy all available habitat considered suitable. The western ground parrot (Pezoporus wallicus flaviventris) of southern Western Australia, Australia, is a case in point, as not only is it rare and difficult to detect, but it is also unlikely to occupy all available suitable habitat. A recent survey of ground parrots provided the opportunity to develop a predictive distribution model. As the data were susceptible to false absences, these were replaced with randomly selected ` pseudo' absences and modelled using GLM. As a comparison, presence-only information was modelled using a relatively new approach, MAXENT, a machine-learning technique that has been shown to perform comparatively well. The predictive performance of both models, as assessed by the receiver operating characteristic plot (ROC) was high (AUC > 0.8), with MAXENT performing only marginally better than the GLM. These approaches both indicated that the ground parrot prefers areas relatively high in altitude, distant from rivers, gently sloping to level habitat, with an intermediate cover of vegetation and where there is a mosaic of vegetation ages. In this case, the use of presence-only information resulted in the identification of important environmental attributes defining the occurrence of the ground parrot, but additional factors that account for the inability of the bird to occupy all suitable habitat should be a component of model refinement.

Random forests for classification in ecology	ECOLOGY			English	Article						additive logistic regression; classification trees; LDA; logistic regression; machine learning; partial dependence plots; random forests; species distribution models	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION; MODELS; LANDSCAPE	Classification procedures are some of the most widely used statistical methods in ecology. Random forests (RF) is a new and powerful statistical classifier that is well established in other disciplines but is relatively unknown in ecology. Advantages of RF compared to other statistical classifiers include (1) very high classification accuracy; (2) a novel method of determining variable importance; (3) ability to model complex interactions among predictor variables; (4) flexibility to perform several types of statistical data analysis, including regression, classification, survival analysis, and unsupervised learning; and (5) an algorithm for imputing missing values. We compared the accuracies of RF and four other commonly used statistical classifiers using data on invasive plant species presence in Lava Beds National Monument, California, USA, rare lichen species presence in the Pacific Northwest, USA, and nest sites for cavity nesting birds in the Uinta Mountains, Utah, USA. We observed high classification accuracy in all applications as measured by cross-validation and, in the case of the lichen data, by independent test data, when comparing RF to other common classification methods. We also observed that the variables that RF identified as most important for classifying invasive plant species coincided with expectations based on the literature.

Today's dominant modeling approach is to replicate experimental input/output data by performing parameter estimation on an assumed topology. In contrast, we propose that modeling some complex biomechanical systems requires the explicit and simultaneous exploration of model topology (i.e., the type, number, and organization of physics-based functional building blocks) and parameter values. In this paper, we use the example of modeling the notoriously complex tendon networks of the fingers to present three critical advances towards the goal of implementing this extended modeling paradigm. First, we describe a novel computational environment to perform quasi-static simulations of arbitrary topologies of elastic structures undergoing large deformations. Second, we use this form of simulation to show that the assumed topology for the tendon network of a finger plays an important role in the propagation of tension to the finger joints. Third, we demonstrate the use of a novel inference algorithm that simultaneously explores the topology and parameter values for hidden synthetic tendon networks. We conclude by discussing critical issues of observability, separability, and uniqueness of topological features inferred from input/output data, and outline the challenges that need to be overcome to apply this novel modeling paradigm to extract causal models in real anatomical systems.

J	Zhou, ZH; Li, M				Zhou, Zhi-Hua; Li, Ming			Semisupervised regression with cotraining-style algorithms	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						machine learning; data mining; learning with unlabeled data; semisupervised learning; semisupervised regression; cotraining	UNLABELED DATA; EM	The traditional setting of supervised learning requires a large amount of labeled training examples in order to achieve good generalization. However, in many practical applications, unlabeled training examples are readily available, but labeled ones are fairly expensive to obtain. Therefore, semisupervised learning has attracted much attention. Previous research on semisupervised learning mainly focuses on semisupervised classification. Although regression is almost as important as classification, semisupervised regression is largely understudied. In particular, although cotraining is a main paradigm in semisupervised learning, few works has been devoted to cotraining-style semisupervised regression algorithms. In this paper, a cotraining-style semisupervised regression algorithm, that is, COREG, is proposed. This algorithm uses two regressors, each labels the unlabeled data for the other regressor, where the confidence in labeling an unlabeled example is estimated through the amount of reduction in mean squared error over the labeled neighborhood of that example. Analysis and experiments show that COREG can effectively exploit unlabeled data to improve regression estimates.

J	Okabe, M; Yamada, S				Okabe, Masayuki; Yamada, Seiji			Semisupervised query expansion with minimal feedback	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						information search and retrieval; query formulation; relevance feedback; machine learning		Query expansion is an information retrieval technique in which new query terms are selected to improve search performance. Although useful terms can be extracted from documents whose relevance is already known, it is difficult to get enough of such feedback from a user in actual use. We propose a query expansion method that performs well even if a user makes practically minimum effort, that is, chooses only a single relevant document. To improve searches in these conditions, we made two refinements to a well-known query expansion method. One uses transductive learning to obtain pseudorelevant documents, thereby increasing the total number of source documents from which expansion terms can be extracted. The other is a modified parameter estimation method that aggregates the predictions of multiple learning trials to sort candidate terms for expansion by importance. Experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional methods and is comparable to a state-of-the-art method.

J	Li, M; Zhou, ZH				Li, Ming; Zhou, Zhi-Hua			Improve computer-aided diagnosis with machine learning techniques using undiagnosed samples	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS			English	Article						computer-aided diagnosis (CAD); co-training; ensemble learning; machine learning; microcalcification cluster detection; random forest; semisupervised learning	NEURAL-NETWORK ENSEMBLES; UNLABELED DATA; CLASSIFIERS; EM	In computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), machine learning techniques have been widely applied to learn a hypothesis from diagnosed samples to assist the medical experts in making a diagnosis. To learn a well-performed hypothesis, a large amount of diagnosed samples are required. Although the samples can be easily collected from routine medical examinations, it is usually impossible for medical experts to make a diagnosis for each of the collected samples. If a hypothesis could be learned in the presence of a large amount of undiagnosed samples, the heavy burden on the medical experts could be released. In this paper, a new semisupervised learning algorithm named Co-Forest is proposed. It extends the co-training paradigm by using a well-known ensemble method named Random Forest, which enables Co-Forest to estimate the labeling confidence of undiagnosed samples and easily produce the final hypothesis. Experiments on benchmark data sets verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Case studies on three medical data sets and a successful application to microcalcification detection for breast cancer diagnosis show that undiagnosed samples are helpful in building CAD systems, and Co-Forest is able to enhance the performance of the hypothesis that is learned on only a small amount of diagnosed samples by utilizing the available undiagnosed samples.

This paper provides a survey of the up-to-date methods for content-based 3-D model retrieval. First, the new challenges encountered in 3-D model retrieval are discussed. Then, the system framework and some key techniques of content-based 3-D model retrieval are identified and explained, including canonical coordinate normalization and preprocessing, feature extraction, similarity match, query representation and user interface, and performance evaluation. In particular, similarity measures using semantic clues and machine learning methods, as well as retrieval approaches using nonshape features, are given adequate recognition as improvements and complements for traditional shapematching techniques. Typical 3-D model retrieval systems and search engines are also listed and compared. Finally, future research directions are indicated, and an extensive bibliography is provided.

A main advantage of such an RFID-based localization system is the availability of landmark ID measurement, which trivially solves the data association problem. While the main drawback of an RFID system is its low spatial accuracy. The result in this paper is an improvement of the localization accuracy for a standard short-range RFID sensor. One of the main contributions is a proposal of a machine learning approach in which multiple classifiers are trained to distinguish RFID-signal features of each location. Another contribution is a design tool for tag arrangement by which the tag configuration needs not be manually designed by the user, but can be automatically recommended by the system. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is evaluated experimentally with a real mobile robot and an RFID system.

J	Purwarianti, A; Tsuchiya, M; Nakagawa, S				Purwarianti, Ayu; Tsuchiya, Masatoshi; Nakagawa, Seiichi			A machine learning approach for an Indonesian-English cross language question answering system	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						cross language question answering; Indonesian-English CLQA; limited resource language; machine learning		We have built a CLQA (Cross Language Question Answering) system for a source language with limited data resources (e.g. Indonesian) using a machine learning approach. The CLQA system consists of four modules: question analyzer, keyword translator, passage retriever and answer finder. We used machine learning in two modules, the question classifier (part of the question analyzer) and the answer finder. In the question classifier, we classify the EAT (Expected Answer Type) of a question by using SVM (Support Vector Machine) method. Features for the classification module are basically the output of our shallow question parsing module. To improve the classification score, we use statistical information extracted from our Indonesian corpus. In the answer finder module, using an approach different from the common approach in which answer is located by matching the named entity of the word corpus with the EAT of question, we locate the answer by text chunking the word corpus. The features for the SVM based text chunking process consist of question features, word corpus features and similarity scores between the word corpus and the question keyword. In this way, we eliminate the named entity tagging process for the target document. As for the keyword translator module, we use an Indonesian-English dictionary to translate Indonesian keywords into English. We also use some simple patterns to transform some borrowed English words. The keywords are then combined in boolean queries in order to retrieve relevant passages using IDF scores. We first conducted an experiment using 2,837 questions (about 10% are used as the test data) obtained from 18 Indonesian college students. We next conducted a similar experiment using the NTCIR (NII Test Collection for IR Systems) 2005 CLQA task by translating the English questions into Indonesian. Compared to the Japanese-English and Chinese-English CLQA results in the NTCIR 2005, we found that our system is superior to others except for one system that uses a high data resource employing 3 dictionaries. Further, a rough comparison with two other Indonesian-English CLQA systems revealed that our system achieved higher accuracy score.

J	Nomoto, T				Nomoto, Tadashi			Discriminative sentence compression with conditional random fields	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						sentence compression; machine learning; RSS; sequence alignment; conditional random fields; natural language syntax		The paper focuses on a particular approach to automatic sentence compression which makes use of a discriminative sequence classifier known as Conditional Random Fields (CRF). We devise several features for CRF that allow it to incorporate information on nonlinear relations among words. Along with that, we address the issue of data paucity by collecting data from RSS feeds available on the Internet, and turning them into training data for use with CRF, drawing on techniques from biology and information retrieval. We also discuss a recursive application of CRF on the syntactic structure of a sentence as a way of improving the readability of the compression it generates. Experiments found that our approach works reasonably well compared to the state-of-the-art system [Knight, K., & Marcu, D. (2002).

J	Ercan, G; Cicekli, Y				Ercan, Gonenc; Cicekli, Yas			Using lexical chains for keyword extraction	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						keyword extraction; lexical chains; natural language processing; machine learning		Keywords can be considered as condensed versions of documents and short forms of their summaries. In this paper, the problem of automatic extraction of keywords from documents is treated as a supervised learning task. A lexical chain holds a set of semantically related words of a text and it can be said that a lexical chain represents the semantic content of a portion of the text. Although lexical chains have been extensively used in text summarization, their usage for keyword extraction problem has not been fully investigated.

Instead of using hand-coded templates or other methods manually customized for each given document format, it uses example-based machine learning to adapt to customer-defined document and meta-data types. We provide results from experiments on the recognition of document information in two document corpuses: a set of scanned journal articles and a set of scanned legal documents. The first set is semi-structured, as the different journals use a variety of flexible layouts. The second set is largely free-form text based on poor quality scans of FAX-quality legal documents. We demonstrate accuracy on the semi-structured document set roughly comparable to hand-coded systems, and much worse performance on the legal documents.

Researchers have approached this problem using various techniques such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and state machine modeling. In this paper, we first review these anomaly detection methods and then describe in detail an adaptive anomaly detection paradigm based on an artificial immune system. The paradigm is referred as AIPAD. The implementation of paradigm includes: first, an initial antibody set is created; then, through the learning of each training antigen, the artificial immune system is evolved and updated by optimal antibodies; and finally, detection is accomplished by the majority vote of k nearest to the antibody in the network. The experiments use the famous Hepatitis Domain dataset in our study, which is taken from the UCI machine learning database. The obtained detection accuracy of AIPAD is 93.5%, which is very promising with regard to the other classification applications in the literature for this problem. In addition to its nonlinear classification properties, AIPAD possesses biological immune system properties such as clonal selection, immune network, and immune memory, which can be used to pattern recognition, classification, etc.	[Peng, Lingxi; Li, Tao; Liu, Xiaojie; Liu, Caiming; Liu, Sunjun] Sichuan Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China; [Peng, Lingxi; Chen, Yuefeng] Guangdong Ocean Univ, Sch Informat, Zhanjiang 524025, Peoples R China	Peng, LX (reprint author), Sichuan Univ, Coll Comp Sci, Chengdu 610065, Peoples R China.

Currently the performance of the most popular methods, machine learning techniques, still have much room for improvement. This paper presents a Conditional Random Fields-based bio-entity name recognition approach and studies the methods of improving the performance by exploiting contextual cues and other post-processing methods. Experiment results show that these methods improve Conditional Random Fields-based recognition performance.

J	Havukkala, I; Vanderlooy, S				Havukkala, Ilkka; Vanderlooy, Stijn			On the reliable identification of plant sequences containing a polyadenylation site	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						dimensionality reduction; guaranteed classification performance; k-mer frequencies; machine learning; plant polyA sites; sequence analysis	RNA; PREDICTION; SIGNALS; DNA; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; SELECTION; MACHINE; MOTIFS	It is a challenging task to predict with high reliability whether plant genomic sequences contain a polyadenylation (polyA) site or not. In this paper, we solve the task by means of a systematic machine-learning procedure applied on a dataset of 1000 Arabidopsis thaliana sequences flanking polyA sites. Our procedure consists of three steps. In the first step, we extract informative features from the sequences using the highly informative k-mer windows approach. Experiments with five classifiers show that the best performance is approximately 83%. In the second step, we improve performance to 95% by reducing the number of features using linear discriminant analysis, followed by applying the linear discriminant classifier. In the third step, we apply the transductive confidence machines approach and the receiver operating characteristic isometrics approach. The resulting two classifiers enable presetting any desired performance by dealing carefully with sequences for which it is unclear whether they contain polyA sites or not. For example, in our case study, we obtain 99% performance by leaving 26% of the sequences unclassified, and 100% performance by leaving 40% of the sequences unclassified. This is clearly useful for experimental verification of putative polyA sites in the laboratory. The novel methods in our machine-learning procedure should find applications in several areas of bioinformatics.

Recognition of a person from their gait is a biometric of increasing interest. The proposed work introduces a nonlinear machine learning method, kernel Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to extract gait features from silhouettes for individual recognition. Binarized silhouette of a motion object is first represented by four 1-D signals which are the basic image features called the distance vectors. Fourier transform is performed to achieve translation invariant for the gait patterns accumulated from silhouette sequences which are extracted from different circumstances. Kernel PCA is then used to extract higher order relations among the gait patterns for future recognition. A fusion strategy is finally executed to produce a final decision. The experiments are carried out on the CMU and the USF gait databases and presented based on the different training gait cycles.

The research emphasizes the use of causality verbs because they make explicit in a certain way the consequent events of a cause, e.g., "Aphids suck the sap from rice leaves. Then leaves will shrink. Later, they will become yellow and dry.". A verb can also be the causal-verb link between cause and effect within EDU(s), e.g., "Aphids suck the sap from rice leaves causing leaves to be shrunk" ("causing" is equivalent to a causal-verb link in Thai). The research confronts two main problems: identifying the interesting causality events from documents and identifying their boundaries. Then, we propose mining on verbs by using two different machine learning techniques, Naive Bayes classifier and Support Vector Machine. The resulted mining rules will be used for the identification and the causality extraction of the multiple EDUs from text. Our multiple EDUs extraction shows 0.88 precision with 0.75 recall from Naive Bayes classifier and 0.89 precision with 0.76 recall from Support Vector Machine.

Machine learning approaches for predicting compounds that interact with therapeutic and ADMET mated proteins	JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES			English	Review						computer aided drug design; pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models; neural networks; in silico modeling; high throughput technologies	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; DIRECT THROMBIN INHIBITORS; BINARY KERNEL DISCRIMINATION; COX-2 SELECTIVE INHIBITORS; K-NEAREST-NEIGHBOR; MOLECULAR DESCRIPTORS; QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE; DRUG DISCOVERY; CYTOCHROME-P450 3A4; P-GLYCOPROTEIN	Computational methods for predicting compounds of specific pharmacodynamic and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) property are useful for facilitating drug discovery and evaluation. Recently, machine learning methods such as neural networks and support vector machines have been explored for predicting inhibitors, antagonists, blockers, agonists, activators and substrates of proteins related to specific therapeutic and ADMET property. These methods are particularly useful for compounds of diverse structures to complement QSAR methods, and for cases of unavailable receptor 3D structure to complement structure-based methods. A number of studies have demonstrated the potential of these methods for predicting such compounds as substrates of P-glycoprotein and cytochrome P450 CYP isoenzymes, inhibitors of protein kinases and CY-P isoenzymes, and agonists of serotonin receptor and estrogen receptor. This article is intended to review the strategies, current progresses and underlying difficulties in using machine learning methods for predicting these protein binders and as potential virtual screening tools. Algorithms for proper representation of the structural and physicochemical properties of compounds are also evaluated. (C) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association.

J	Evgeniou, T; Pontil, M; Toubia, O				Evgeniou, Theodoros; Pontil, Massimiliano; Toubia, Olivier			A convex optimization approach to modeling consumer heterogeneity in conjoint estimation	MARKETING SCIENCE			English	Article						Bayesian analysis; data mining; econometric models; estimation and other statistical techniques; hierarchical Bayes analysis; marketing research; regression and other statistical techniques	KERNEL LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; MULTIPLE TASKS; VECTOR MACHINE	We propose and test a new approach for modeling consumer heterogeneity in conjoint estimation based on convex optimization and statistical machine learning. We develop methods both for metric and choice data. Like hierarchical Bayes (HB), our methods shrink individual-level partworth estimates towards a population mean. However, while HB samples from a posterior distribution that is influenced by exogenous parameters (the parameters of the second-stage priors), we minimize a convex loss function that depends only on endogenous parameters. As a result, the amounts of shrinkage differ between the two approaches, leading to different estimation accuracies. In our comparisons, based on simulations as well as empirical data sets, the new approach overall outperforms standard HB (i.e., with relatively diffuse second-stage priors) both with metric and choice data.

J	Fernandez-Escribano, G; Kalva, H; Cuenca, P; Orozco-Barbosa, L				Fernandez-Escribano, Gerardo; Kalva, Hari; Cuenca, Pedro; Orozco-Barbosa, Luis			A first approach to speeding-up the inter mode selection in MPEG-2/H.264 transcoders using machine learning	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						video transcoding; MPEG-2; H.264; inter prediction; data mining		The H.264 standard achieves much higher coding efficiency than the MPEG-2 standard, due to its improved inter and intra prediction modes which come with a cost of higher computation complexity. Transcoding MPEG-2 video to H.264 is important to enable gradual migration to H.264. However, given the significant differences between the MPEG-2 and the H.264 coding algorithms, transcoding is much more complex and new approaches to transcoding are necessary. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a low complexity macroblock partition mode decision algorithm, to be used as part of a high-efficient inter-frame prediction in MPEG-2 to H.264 transcoder. The proposed tools are used to compute an optimal MB coding mode decision with significantly reduced computational complexity. Specifically, we achieve the computational savings by using the following MB information coming from MPEG-2: the MB coding modes, the coded block pattern (CBPC) in MPEG-2, and the mean and variance of the 16 4x4 sub blocks of the MPEG-2 residual MBs. We use data mining algorithms to develop a decision tree for H.264 coding mode decisions. The decision trees are built using RD optimized mode decisions and result in highly efficient mode decisions, with significantly reduced computational complexity. The proposed transcoder is 35% faster than the RD optimized H.264 reference transcoder without a significant PSNR degradation (0.05 dB on average). The proposed transcoder performs over 0.4 dB better on average than the SAE cost based H.264 transcoding.

Semi-supervised learning for peptide identification from shotgun proteomics datasets	NATURE METHODS			English	Article							PROTEIN IDENTIFICATIONS; DATABASE SEARCH; YEAST PROTEOME; ALGORITHM; MS/MS	Shotgun proteomics uses liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify proteins in complex biological samples. We describe an algorithm, called Percolator, for improving the rate of confident peptide identifications from a collection of tandem mass spectra. Percolator uses semi-supervised machine learning to discriminate between correct and decoy spectrum identifications, correctly assigning peptides to 17% more spectra from a tryptic Saccharomyces cerevisiae dataset, and up to 77% more spectra from non-tryptic digests, relative to a fully supervised approach.

Minimax Probability Machine (MPM) and its extension, Minimum Error Minimax Probability Machine, have shown advantages in the machine learning literature. In this paper, we incorporate the MPM-based approaches into our face recognition system for further study. To test the performance of our new system, we compare the MPM-based approaches with SVM, a PCA-based and a LDA-based algorithms on the FERET database for both verification and identification. The experimental results demonstrate that MPM-based approaches are promising for automatic face recognition. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Nanni, L; Lumini, A				Nanni, Loris; Lumini, Alessandra			RegionBoost learning for 2D+3D based face recognition	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						face recognition; machine learning; classification	PCA	This paper describes an improved boosting algorithm, named RegionBoost, and its application in developing a fast and robust invariant Local Binary Pattern histogram based face recognition system. We propose to use a multi-classifier where each classifier, an AdaBoost of feed-forward back-propagation network, is trained using a single Sub-Window of the whole image, the classifiers are finally combined using the "Sum Rule". Only the best matchers, selected by running the Sequential Forward Floating Selection (SFFS), are exploited in the fusion step. In our opinion our method (based on local AdaBoost) partially solves the problem of redundancy among global AdaBoost selected features, with a manageable computational requirement. Finally, we propose a systematic framework for fusing 2D and 3D face recognition systems. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

They have so far shown efficacies in many practical classification problems. However, for electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification with application to brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), there are almost no studies investigating their feasibilities. The present study systematically evaluates the performance of the three ensemble methods for EEG signal classification of mental imagery tasks. With the base classifiers of k-nearest-neighbor, decision tree and support vector machine, classification experiments are carried out upon real EEG recordings. Experimental results suggest the feasibilities of ensemble classification methods, and we also derive some valuable conclusions on the performance of ensemble methods for EEG signal classification.

In this paper, we explore subspace ensembles for classification by manipulating different feature subspaces. Commencing with the nature of ensemble efficacy, we probe into the microcosmic meaning of ensemble diversity, and propose to use region partitioning and region weighting to implement effective subspace ensembles. Individual classifiers possessing eminent performance on a partitioned region reflected by high neighborhood accuracies are deemed to contribute largely to this region, and are assigned large weights in determining the labels of instances in this area. A robust algorithm "Sena" that incarnates the mechanism is presented, which is insensitive to the number of nearest neighbors chosen to calculate neighborhood accuracies. The algorithm exhibits improved performance over the well-known ensembles of bagging, AdaBoost and random subspace. The difference of its effectivity with varying base classifiers is also investigated. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Activation of inflammation/NF-kappa B signaling in infants born to arsenic-exposed mothers	PLOS GENETICS			English	Article							TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; GENE-EXPRESSION; GROWTH-FACTORS; CHRONIC STIMULATION; SKIN NEOPLASIA; IN-UTERO; MICE; CELLS; PROFILES; CANCER	The long-term health outcome of prenatal exposure to arsenic has been associated with increased mortality in human populations. In this study, the extent to which maternal arsenic exposure impacts gene expression in the newborn was addressed. We monitored gene expression profiles in a population of newborns whose mothers experienced varying levels of arsenic exposure during pregnancy. Through the application of machine learning-based two-class prediction algorithms, we identified expression signatures from babies born to arsenic-unexposed and - exposed mothers that were highly predictive of prenatal arsenic exposure in a subsequent test population. Furthermore, 11 transcripts were identified that captured the maximal predictive capacity to classify prenatal arsenic exposure. Network analysis of the arsenic-modulated transcripts identified the activation of extensive molecular networks that are indicative of stress, inflammation, metal exposure, and apoptosis in the newborn. Exposure to arsenic is an important health hazard both in the United States and around the world, and is associated with increased risk for several types of cancer and other chronic diseases. These studies clearly demonstrate the robust impact of a mother's arsenic consumption on fetal gene expression as evidenced by transcript levels in newborn cord blood.

Proteomic patterns for classification of ovarian cancer and CTCL serum samples utilizing peak pairs indicative of post-translational modifications	PROTEOMICS			English	Article						bioinformatics; post-translational modifications; proteomic patterns	DIAGNOSIS; IDENTIFICATION; BIOMARKERS; DISCOVERY	Proteomic patterns as a potential diagnostic technology has been well established for several cancer conditions and other diseases. The use of machine learning techniques such as decision trees, neural networks, genetic algorithms, and other methods has been the basis for pattern determination. Cancer is known to involve signaling pathways that are regulated through PTM of proteins. These modifications are also detectable with high confidence using high-resolution MS. We generated data using a prOTOF (TM) mass spectrometer on two sets of patient samples: ovarian cancer and cutaneous t-cell lymphoma (CTCL) with matched normal samples for each disease. Using the knowledge of mass shifts caused by common modifications, we built models using peak pairs and compared this to a conventional technique using individual peaks. The results for each disease showed that a small number of peak pairs gave classification equal to or better than the conventional technique that used multiple individual peaks. This simple peak picking technique could be used to guide identification of important peak pairs involved in the disease process.

J	Stone, K; Colagrosso, M				Stone, Kerri; Colagrosso, Michael			Efficient duty cycling through prediction and sampling in wireless sensor networks	WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING			English	Article						wireless sensor networks; machine learning; medium access control; energy efficiency; ultra-low; duty cycle; adaptation		We present BoostMAC, a CSMA-based MAC layer protocol for wireless sensor networks that provides an adjustable interface to achieve ultra-low power operation. To reach low power operation, we adaptively set two radio parameters. First, BoostMAC implements a preamble sampling scheme that allows a mote to dynamically set the length of its duty cycles. Second, we apply machine learning such that a sender can predict its destination's channel polling time and set each outgoing packet's preamble length accordingly. Our two improvements require no extra communication overhead, and each mote in the network implements simple, local models. Energy conservation is one of the most fundamental problems in sensor networks, and by optimizing low-level operation at the MAC layer, sensor network applications realize an increase in overall performance. We choose habitat monitoring as a motivating sensor network application because it has unique MAC layer demands, such as fluctuating levels of network traffic. Static configuration at the MAC layer inhibits optimal energy conservation within habitat monitoring applications. We implemented BoostMAC in TinyOS simulator (TOSSIM), and we compare its performance to B-MAC, a well-known low power MAC protocol with static behavior. We found that BoostMAC saves energy relative to B-MAC in bursty networks without affecting latency. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Shen, YQ; Burger, G				Shen, Yao Qing; Burger, Gertraud			'Unite and conquer': enhanced prediction of protein subcellular localization by integrating multiple specialized tools	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; AMINO-ACID-COMPOSITION; LOCATION PREDICTION; TRANSMEMBRANE TOPOLOGY; MITOCHONDRIAL PROTEINS; ENSEMBLE CLASSIFIER; TARGETING SEQUENCES; MEMBRANE; DATABASE; SITES	Background: Knowing the subcellular location of proteins provides clues to their function as well as the interconnectivity of biological processes. Dozens of tools are available for predicting protein location in the eukaryotic cell. Each tool performs well on certain data sets, but their predictions often disagree for a given protein. Since the individual tools each have particular strengths, we set out to integrate them in a way that optimally exploits their potential. The method we present here is applicable to various subcellular locations, but tailored for predicting whether or not a protein is localized in mitochondria. Knowledge of the mitochondrial proteome is relevant to understanding the role of this organelle in global cellular processes. Results: In order to develop a method for enhanced prediction of subcellular localization, we integrated the outputs of available localization prediction tools by several strategies, and tested the performance of each strategy with known mitochondrial proteins. The accuracy obtained (up to 92%) surpasses by far the individual tools. The method of integration proved crucial to the performance. For the prediction of mitochondrion-located proteins, integration via a two-layer decision tree clearly outperforms simpler methods, as it allows emphasis of biologically relevant features such as the mitochondrial targeting peptide and transmembrane domains. Conclusion: We developed an approach that enhances the prediction accuracy of mitochondrial proteins by uniting the strength of specialized tools. The combination of machine-learning based integration with biological expert knowledge leads to improved performance. This approach also alleviates the conundrum of how to choose between conflicting predictions. Our approach is easy to implement, and applicable to predicting subcellular locations other than mitochondria, as well as other biological features. For a trial of our approach, we provide a webservice for mitochondrial protein prediction (named YimLOC), which can be accessed through the AnaBench suite at http://anabench.bcm.umontreal.ca/anabench/.

In this study, we created populations of expression profiles from publicly available microarray datasets of cancer ( breast, lymphoma and renal) samples linked to clinical information with an iterative machine learning algorithm. ROC curves were used to assess the prediction error of each profile for classification. We compared the prediction error of profiles correlated with molecular phenotype against profiles correlated with relapse-free status. Prediction error of profiles identified with supervised univariate feature selection algorithms were compared to profiles selected randomly from a) all genes on the microarray platform and b) a list of known disease-related genes ( a priori selection). We also determined the relevance of expression profiles on test arrays from independent datasets, measured on either the same or different microarray platforms. Results: Highly discriminative expression profiles were produced on both simulated gene expression data and expression data from breast cancer and lymphoma datasets on the basis of ER and BCL-6 expression, respectively. Use of relapse-free status to identify profiles for prognosis prediction resulted in poorly discriminative decision rules. Supervised feature selection resulted in more accurate classifications than random or a priori selection, however, the difference in prediction error decreased as the number of features increased. These results held when decision rules were applied across-datasets to samples profiled on the same microarray platform. Conclusion: Our results show that many gene sets predict molecular phenotypes accurately. Given this, expression profiles identified using different training datasets should be expected to show little agreement. In addition, we demonstrate the difficulty in predicting relapse directly from microarray data using supervised machine learning approaches.

Module-Based Outcome Prediction Using Breast Cancer Compendia	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Background. The availability of large collections of microarray datasets (compendia), or knowledge about grouping of genes into pathways (gene sets), is typically not exploited when training predictors of disease outcome. These can be useful since a compendium increases the number of samples, while gene sets reduce the size of the feature space. This should be favorable from a machine learning perspective and result in more robust predictors. Methodology. We extracted modules of regulated genes from gene sets, and compendia. Through supervised analysis, we constructed predictors which employ modules predictive of breast cancer outcome. To validate these predictors we applied them to independent data, from the same institution (intra-dataset), and other institutions (inter-dataset). Conclusions. We show that modules derived from single breast cancer datasets achieve better performance on the validation data compared to gene-based predictors. We also show that there is a trend in compendium specificity and predictive performance: modules derived from a single breast cancer dataset, and a breast cancer specific compendium perform better compared to those derived from a human cancer compendium. Additionally, the module-based predictor provides a much richer insight into the underlying biology. Frequently selected gene sets are associated with processes such as cell cycle, E2F regulation, DNA damage response, proteasome and glycolysis. We analyzed two modules related to cell cycle, and the OCT1 transcription factor, respectively. On an individual basis, these modules provide a significant separation in survival subgroups on the training and independent validation data.

It is designed for either numerical or categorical data. Like the Ward agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm and the k-means partitioning algorithm, it is based on the minimization of the inertia criterion. However, unlike Ward and k-means, it provides a simple and natural interpretation of the clusters. The price paid by construction in terms of inertia by DIVCLUS-T for this additional interpretation is studied by applying the three algorithms on six databases from the UCI Machine Learning repository.

A self-adaptive migration model genetic algorithm for data mining applications	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						adaptive genetic algorithms; optimization; data mining; machine learning	PARAMETER; CONVERGENCE	Data mining involves nontrivial process of extracting knowledge or patterns from large databases. Genetic Algorithms are efficient and robust searching and optimization methods that are used in data mining. In this paper we propose a Self-Adaptive Migration Model GA (SAMGA), where parameters of population size, the number of points of crossover and mutation rate for each population are adaptively fixed. Further, the migration of individuals between populations is decided dynamically. This paper gives a mathematical schema analysis of the method stating and showing that the algorithm exploits previously discovered knowledge for a more focused and concentrated search of heuristically high yielding regions while simultaneously performing a highly explorative search on the other regions of the search space. The effective performance of the algorithm is then shown using standard testbed functions and a set of actual classification datamining problems. Michigan style of classifier was used to build the classifier and the system was tested with machine learning databases of Pima Indian Diabetes database, Wisconsin Breast Cancer database and few others. The performance of our algorithm is better than others. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Traditional analytic models are difficult and time consuming to construct, and are often unable to capture full system and application complexity. To address these challenges, we automatically build models based on execution samples. We use multilayer neural networks, because they can represent arbitrary functions and handle noisy inputs robustly. In this paper we focus on two well-known parallel applications whose variations in execution times are not well understood: SMG 2000, a semicoarsening multigrid solver, and HPL, an open-source implementation of LINPACK. We sparsely sample performance data on two radically different platforms across large, multidimensional parameter spaces and show that our models based on these data can predict performance within 2% to 7% of actual application runtimes.

In this study, two statistical techniques are evaluated: (i) the widely used multiple logistic regression technique in the generalized linear modelling framework, and (ii) a recently developed machine learning technique called 'random forests'. The latter is an ensemble learning technique that generates many classification trees and aggregates the individual results. The two different techniques are used to develop distribution models to predict the vegetation type occurrence of 11 groundwater-dependent vegetation types in Belgian lowland valley ecosystems based on spatially distributed measurements of environmental conditions. The spatially distributed data set under investigation consists of 1705 grid cells covering an area of 47.32 ha. After model construction and calibration, both models are applied to independent test data sets using two-fold cross-validation and resulting probabilities of occurrence are used to predict vegetation type distributions within the study area. Predicted vegetation types are compared with observations, and the McNemar test indicates an overall better performance of the random forest model at the 0.001 significance level. Comparison of the modelling results for each individual vegetation type separately by means of the F-measure, which combines precision and recall, also reveals better predictions by the random forest model. Inspection of the probabilities of occurrence of the different vegetation types for each grid cell demonstrates that correct predictions in central areas of homogeneous vegetation sites are based on high probabilities, whereas the confidence decreases towards the margins of these areas. Threshold-independent evaluation of the model accuracy by means of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirms good performances of both models, but with higher values for the random forest model. Therefore, the incorporation of the random forest technique in distribution models has the ability to lead to better model performances. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Unsupervised morphing by conjugate image processing	ELECTRONICS LETTERS			English	Article							NONLINEAR DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; MANIFOLD	Unsupervised image morphing is a very challenging task in machine learning, whereas it is relatively easy and common for the human brain. Even a simple deformation of an object such as a translation or scaling operation follows a complex curved trace in a high-dimensional image space. The learning of such a complex curved manifold needs human assistance or sufficiently dense intermediate data points. Presented is a novel transformation framework with which a curved manifold describing the deformation of images turns into a simple linear structure in the transformed space. Therefore, image morphing can be achieved by simple linear superposition using the conjugate image representation.

Super learner	STATISTICAL APPLICATIONS IN GENETICS AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						cross-validation; loss-based estimation; machine learning; prediction	REGRESSION	When trying to learn a model for the prediction of an outcome given a set of covariates, a statistician has many estimation procedures in their toolbox. A few examples of these candidate learners are: least squares, least angle regression, random forests, and spline regression. Previous articles (van der Laan and Dudoit (2003); van der Laan et al. (2006); Sinisi et al. (2007)) theoretically validated the use of cross validation to select an optimal learner among many candidate learners. Motivated by this use of cross validation, we propose a new prediction method for creating a weighted combination of many candidate learners to build the super learner. This article proposes a fast algorithm for constructing a super learner in prediction which uses V-fold cross-validation to select weights to combine an initial set of candidate learners. In addition, this paper contains a practical demonstration of the adaptivity of this so called super learner to various true data generating distributions. This approach for construction of a super learner generalizes to any parameter which can be defined as a minimizer of a loss function.

Predicting which peptides can bind to a specific MHC molecule is indispensable to minimizing the number of peptides required to synthesize, to the development of vaccines and immunotherapy of cancer, and to aiding to understand the specificity of T-cell mediated immunity. At present, although predictions based on machine learning methods have good prediction performance, they cannot acquire understandable knowledge and prediction performance can be further improved. Thereupon, the Rule Sets ENsemble (RSEN) algorithm, which takes advantage of diverse attribute and attribute value reduction algorithms based on rough set (RS) theory, is proposed as the initial trial to acquire understandable rules along with enhancement of prediction performance. Finally, the RSEN is applied to predict the peptides that bind to HLA-DR4(B1(*) 0401). Experimentation results show: (1) prepositional rules for predicting the peptides that bind to HLA-DR4 (B1(*)0401) are obtained; (2) compared with individual RS-based algorithms, the RSEN has a significant decrease (13%-38%) in prediction error rate; (3) compared with the Back-Propagation Neural Networks (BPNN), prediction error rate of the RSEN decreases by 4%-16%. The acquired rules have been applied to help experts make molecules modeling.

J	Kim, K; Ryoo, HS				Kim, Kwangsoo; Ryoo, Hong Seo			Nonlinear separation of data via mixed 0-1 Integer and Linear Programming	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						supervised learning; binary classification; mixed 0-1 integer and linear program; global optimization	MULTISURFACE METHOD; PATTERN SEPARATION; CLASSIFICATION	This paper presents a new mathematical programming-based learning methodology for separation of two types of data. Specifically, we develop a new l(1)-norm error distance metric and use it to develop a Mixed 0-1 Integer and Linear Programming ( MILP) model that optimizes the interplay of user-provided discriminant functions, including kernel functions for support vector machines, to implement a nonlinear, nonconvex and/or disjoint decision boundary for the best separation of data at hand. With the concurrent optimization of discriminant functions, the MILP-based learning can be used for finding the optimal and least complex classification rule for noise-free data and for implementing a most robust classification rule for real-life data with noise. With extensive experiments on separation of two dimensional artificial datasets that are clean and noisy, we graphically illustrate the aforementioned advantages of the new MILP-based learning methodology. With experiments on real-life benchmark datasets from the UC Irvine Repository of machine learning databases, in comparison with the multisurface method and the support vector machines, we demonstrate the advantage of using and concurrently optimizing more than a single discriminant function for a robust separation of real-life data, hence the utility of the proposed methodology in supervised learning.

J	Chen, ZY; Li, JP; Wei, LW				Chen, Zhenyu; Li, Jianping; Wei, Liwei			A multiple kernel support vector machine scheme for feature selection and rule extraction from gene expression data of cancer tissue	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						multiple kernel learning; support vector machine; feature selection; rule extraction; gene expression data	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; ADAPTIVE RESONANCE THEORY; FEATURE SUBSET-SELECTION; MICROARRAY DATA; CLASS DISCOVERY; DNA MICROARRAY; SVM HYPERPARAMETERS; BREAST-CANCER; DECISION TREE; CLASSIFICATION	Objective: Recently, gene expression profiling using microarray techniques has been shown as a promising tool to improve the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Gene expression data contain high level. of noise and the overwhelming number of genes relative to the number of available samples. It brings out a great challenge for machine learning and statistic techniques. Support vector machine (SVM) has been successfully used to classify gene expression data of cancer tissue. In the medical field, it is crucial to deliver the user a transparent decision process. How to explain the computed solutions and present the extracted knowledge becomes a main obstacle for SVM. Material and methods: A multiple kernel support vector machine (MK-SVM) scheme, consisting of feature selection, rule extraction and prediction modeling is proposed to improve the explanation capacity of SVM. In this scheme, we show that the feature selection problem can be translated into an ordinary multiple parameters learning problem. And a shrinkage approach: 1-norm based linear programming is proposed to obtain the sparse parameters and the corresponding selected features. We propose a novel rule extraction approach using the information provided by the separating hyperplane and support vectors to improve the generalization capacity and comprehensibility of rules and reduce the computational complexity. Results and conclusion: Two public gene expression datasets: leukemia dataset and colon tumor dataset are used to demonstrate the performance of this approach. Using the small number of selected genes, MK-SVM achieves encouraging classification accuracy: more than 90% for both two datasets. Moreover, very simple rules with linguist labels are extracted. The rule sets have high diagnostic power because of their good classification performance. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Solubility is an individual trait of proteins which, under a given set of experimental conditions, is determined by their amino acid sequence. Accurate theoretical prediction of solubility from sequence is instrumental for setting priorities on targets in large-scale proteomics projects. Results: We present a machine-learning approach called PROSO to assess the chance of a protein to be soluble upon heterologous expression in Escherichia coli based on its amino acid composition. The classification algorithm is organized as a two-layered structure in which the output of primary support vector machine (SVM) classifiers serves as input for a secondary Naive Bayes classifier. Experimental progress information from the TargetDB database as well as previously published datasets were used as the source of training data. In comparison with previously published methods our classification algorithm possesses improved discriminatory capacity characterized by the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.434 between predicted and known solubility states and the overall prediction accuracy of 72% (75 and 68% for positive and negative class, respectively).

Here we describe a noble energy-based CSSP method implemented on dual artificial neural networks that rapidly and accurately estimate the potential for the non-native secondary structure formation in local regions of protein sequences. In this method, we attempted to quantify long-range interaction patterns in diverse secondary structures by potential energy calculations and decomposition on a pairwise per-residue basis. The calculated energy parameters and seven-residue sequence information were used as inputs for artificial neural networks (ANN's) to predict sequence potential for secondary structure conversion. The trained single ANN using the >(i, i +/- 4) interaction energy parameter exhibited 74% accuracy in predicting the secondary structure of test sequences in their native energy state, while the dual ANN-based predictor using (i, i +/- 4) and >(i, i +/- 4) interaction energies showed 83% prediction accuracy. The present method provides a simple and accurate tool for predicting sequence potential for secondary structure conversions without using 3D structural information. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Sajn, L; Kononenko, I; Milcinski, M				Sajn, Luka; Kononenko, Igor; Milcinski, Metka			Computerized segmentation and diagnostics of whole-body bone scintigrams	COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS			English	Article						whole-body bone scan; automatic segmentation; image processing; machine learning	DISEASE	Bone scintigraphy or whole-body bone scan is one of the most common diagnostic procedures in nuclear medicine. Since expert physicians evaluate images manually some automated procedure for pathology detection is desired. A robust knowledge based methodology for segmenting body scans into the main skeletal regions is presented. The algorithm is simultaneously applied on anterior and posterior whole-body bone scintigrams. Expert knowledge is represented as a set of parameterized rules, used to support standard image processing algorithms. The segmented bone regions are parameterized with algorithms for classifying patterns so the pathologies can be classified with machine learning algorithms. This approach enables automatic scintigraphy evaluation of pathological changes, thus in addition to detection of point-like high-uptake lesions also other types can be discovered. Our study includes 467 consecutive, non-selected scintigrams. Automatic analysis of whole-body bone scans using our segmentation algorithm gives more accurate and reliable results than previous studies. Preliminary experiments show that our expert system based on machine learning closely mimics the results of expert physicians. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Whereas the obtained rule set is usually evaluated by measuring its accuracy on a number of unseen examples, there are several other evaluation criteria, such as comprehensibility and consistency, that are often overlooked. In this paper we focus on the aspect of consistency: if a rule learner is applied several times on the same data set, will it provide rule sets that are similar over the different runs? A new measure is proposed and various examples show how this new measure can be used to decide between different algorithms and rule sets or to find out whether the rules in a knowledge base need to be updated.

J	Nahar, J; Ali, S; Chen, YPP				Nahar, Jesmin; Ali, Shawkat; Chen, Yi-Ping Phoebe			Microarray data classification using automatic SVM kernel selection	DNA AND CELL BIOLOGY			English	Article								Microarray data classification is one of the most important emerging clinical applications in the medical community. Machine learning algorithms are most frequently used to complete this task. We selected one of the state-of-the-art kernel-based algorithms, the support vector machine (SVM), to classify microarray data. As a large number of kernels are available, a significant research question is what is the best kernel for patient diagnosis based on microarray data classification using SVM? We first suggest three solutions based on data visualization and quantitative measures. Different types of microarray problems then test the proposed solutions. Finally, we found that the rule- based approach is most useful for automatic kernel selection for SVM to classify microarray data.

J	Ben-David, A				Ben-David, Arle			A lot of randomness is hiding in accuracy	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						accuracy; kappa; "chance driven" hits; machine learning; AUC	KAPPA; COEFFICIENT; AGREEMENT	The proportion of successful hits, usually referred to as "accuracy", is by far the most dominant meter for measuring classifiers' accuracy. This is despite of the fact that accuracy does not compensate for hits that can be attributed to mere chance. Is it a meaningful flaw in the context of machine learning? Are we using the wrong meter for decades? The results of this study do suggest that the answers to these questions are positive. Cohen's kappa, a meter that does compensate for random hits, was compared with accuracy, using a benchmark of fifteen datasets and five well-known classifiers. It turned out that the average probability of a hit being the result of mere chance exceeded one third (!). It was also found that the proportion of random hits varied with different classifiers that were applied even to a single dataset. Consequently, the rankings of classifiers' accuracy, with and without compensation for random hits, differed from each other in eight out of the fifteen datasets. Therefore, accuracy may well fail in its main task, namely to properly measure the accuracy-wise merits of the classifiers themselves. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Semantically relevant images may exhibit various visual characteristics and may be scattered in several classes in the feature space due to the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level semantics in the user's mind. To find the semantic classes through relevance feedback the proposed method reduces the burden of completely re-clustering the classes at iterations and classifies multiple classes. Experimental results show that the proposed method is more effective and efficient than the two-class SVM and multi-class relevance feedback methods.

Standard machine learning techniques like support vector machines and related large margin methods have been successfully applied for this task, albeit the fact is that they ignore the inter-class relationships. Unfortunately, in the context of document categorization, we face a large number of classes and a huge number of relevant features needed to distinguish between them. The computational cost of training a classifier for a problem of this size is prohibitive. It has also been observed that obtaining a classifier that discriminates between two groups of classes is much easier than distinguishing simultaneously among all classes. This has prompted substantial research in using hierarchical classifiers to address single multi-class problems. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical classification method that generalizes support vector machine learning that is based on the results of support vector clustering method, and are structured in a way that mirrors the class hierarchy. Compared to previous non-hierarchical SVM classifier and famous documents categorization systems, the proposed hierarchical SVM classification has a better improvement in classification accuracy in the standard Reuters corpus.

In this study, diagnosis of lymph diseases, which is a very common and important disease, was conducted with such a machine learning system. In this study, we have detected on lymph diseases using principles component analysis (PCA), fuzzy weighting pre-processing and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The approach system has three stages. In the first stage, dimension of lymph diseases dataset that has 18 features is reduced to four features using principles component analysis. In the second stage, a new weighting scheme based on fuzzy weighting method was utilized as a pre-processing step before the main classifier. Then, in the third stage, ANFIS was our used classifier. We took the lymph diseases dataset used in our study from the UCI machine learning database. The obtained classification accuracy of our system was 88.83% and it was very promising with regard to the other classification applications in the literature for this problem. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

While using the standard least-squares criterion as a performance index, we pose the regression problem as a gradient-descent optimisation. The separation of the evaluation of the gradient and the update of the regression variables makes it possible to avoid undue complication of analytical formulae for multiple regression with fuzzy data. The origins of fuzzy input data are traced back to the fundamental concept of information granulation and an example FCM-based granulation method is proposed and illustrated by some numerical examples. The proposed multiple regression algorithm is applied to one-, three- and nine-dimensional synthetic data sets as well as the 13-dimensional Boston Housing dataset from the machine learning repository. The algorithm's performance is illustrated by the corresponding plots of convergence of regression parameters and the values of the prediction error of the resulting regression model. General comments on the numerical complexity of the proposed algorithm are also provided. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Inferring adaptive regulation thresholds and association rules from gene expression data through combinatorial optimization learning	IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						combinatorial optimization; genetic regulatory networks; machine learning; gene expression data; decision trees	YEAST-CELL CYCLE; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; BUDDING YEAST; S-PHASE; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; G1 CYCLINS; NETWORKS; ALGORITHM; INFERENCE; REVEALS	There is a need to design computational methods to support the prediction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Such models should offer both biologically meaningful and computationally accurate predictions which, in combination with other techniques, may improve large-scale integrative studies. This paper presents a new machine-learning method for the prediction of putative regulatory associations from expression data which exhibit properties never or only partially addressed by other techniques recently published. The method was tested on a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene expression data set. The results were statistically validated and compared with the relationships inferred by two machine-learning approaches to GRN prediction. Furthermore, the resulting predictions were assessed using domain knowledge. The proposed algorithm may be able to accurately predict relevant biological associations between genes. One of the most relevant features of this new method is the prediction of adaptive regulation thresholds for the discretization of gene expression values, which is required prior to the rule association learning process. Moreover, an important advantage consists of its low computational cost to infer association rules.

Recent advances in cognitive communications	IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE			English	Article								This article describes recent advances in cognitive communications. We combine the concepts of signal processing, communications, pattern classification, and machine learning to make dynamic use of the spectrum, such that the emanated signals do not interfere with the existing ones. Unlike other programs such as neXt Generation communications of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, where radio scene analysis is performed to find the spectrum holes or the white space, we make use of the white, as well as the gray space for noninterfering signal transmission. We examine the possibility of employing machine perception and autonomous machine learning technologies to the autonomous design and analysis of air interfaces. The underlying premise is that a learning module will facilitate adaptation in the standard classification process so that the presence of new types of waveforms can be detected, features that best facilitate classification of the previously and newly identified signals can be determined, and waveforms can be generated by using the basis-set orthogonal to the ones present in the environment. Incremental learning and prediction allows knowledge enhancement as more snapshots of data are processed, resulting in improved decisions. Some of the contributions of this project include technological advances in signal detection, feature identification, signal classification, sub-space tracking, adaptive waveform design, machine learning, and prediction.

The EST is defined in terms of the eigenvectors of the difference correlation matrix (DCOR) obtained using the data from the two classes. Using ideas found in the machine learning literature (i.e., the kernel trick), a nonlinear version-kernel EST (KEST)-is achieved by expressing the DCOR in terms of dot products in feature space and replacing all dot products with a Mercer kernel function that is defined in terms of input data space. Experimental results indicate that KEST outperforms many other commonly used subspace anomaly detection algorithms.

The task addressed here concerns data-driven synthesis of recognition procedures for real-world object recognition. The method uses linear genetic programming to encode potential solutions expressed in terms of elementary operations, and handles the complexity of the learning task by applying cooperative coevolution to decompose the problem automatically at the genotype level. The training coevolves feature extraction procedures, each being a sequence of elementary image processing and computer vision operations applied to input images. Extensive experimental results show that the approach attains competitive performance for three-dimensional object recognition in real synthetic aperture radar imagery.

J	Wei, JG; Lu, XG; Dang, JW				Wei, Jianguo; Lu, Xugang; Dang, Jianwu			A model-based learning process for modeling coarticulation of human speech	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						machine learning; optimization; human mechanism; speech physiological articulatory model	NEURAL-NETWORK MODEL; OPTIMIZATION; PARAMETERS; ALGORITHMS	Machine learning techniques have long been applied in many fields and have gained a lot of success. The purpose of learning processes is generally to obtain a set of parameters based on a given data set by minimizing a certain objective function which can explain the data set in a maximum likelihood or minimum estimation error sense. However, most of the learned parameters are highly data dependent and rarely reflect the true physical mechanism that is involved in the observation data. In order to obtain the inherent knowledge involved in the observed data, it is necessary to combine physical models with learning process rather than only fitting the observations with a black box model. To reveal underlying properties of human speech production. we proposed a learning process based on a physiological articulatory model and a coarticulation model, where both of the models are derived from human mechanisms. A two-layer learning framework was designed to learn the parameters concerned with physiological level using the physiological articulatory model and the parameters in the motor planning level using the coarticulation model. The learning process was carried out on an articulatory database of human speech production. The learned parameters were evaluated by numerical experiments and listening tests. The phonetic targets obtained in the planning stage provided an evidence for understanding the virtual targets of human speech production. As a result, the model based learning process reveals the inherent mechanism of the human speech via the learned parameters with certain physical meaning.

J	Lee, J; Xiang, Y				Lee, J.; Xiang, Y.			Complexity measurement of fundamental pseudo-independent models	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th International Florida Artificial Intelligence Reseach Symposium (FLAIRS)	MAY, 2005	Clearwater Beach, FL			Probabilistic reasoning; knowledge discovery; data mining; machine learning; belief networks; model complexity	NETWORKS	Pseudo-independent (PI) models are a special class of probabilistic domain model (PDM) where a set of marginally independent domain variables shows collective dependency, a special type of dependency associated with the scope of a set of variables in a probabilistic domain. Due to this property, common probabilistic learning methods based on a single-link lookahead search cannot learn PI models. To learn PI models, a learning algorithm should be equipped with a search with its scope beyond a single link, which is called a multi-link lookahead search. An improved result can be obtained by incorporating model complexity into a scoring metric to explicitly trade off model accuracy for complexity and vice versa during selection of the best model among candidates at each learning step. To implement this scoring metric for learning PI models, the complexity formula for every class of PI models is required. Previous studies found the complexity formula for full PI models, one of the three major types of PI models (the other two are partial and mixed PI models). This study presents the complexity formula for atomic partial P1 models, partial PI models that contain no embedded PI submodels. This paper shows the complexity can be acquired by arithmetic operation with the cardinality of the space of domain variables in an atomic partial PI model. The new formula provides the basis for further characterizing the complexity of non-atomic PI inodels, which contain embedded PI submodels in their domains. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

A putative gene located at the MHC class I region around the D6S105 marker contributes to the setting of CD8+T-lymphocyte numbers in humans	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMMUNOGENETICS			English	Article							MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX; AUSTRALIAN HEMOCHROMATOSIS PATIENTS; T-CELL RATIO; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; IRON-OVERLOAD; HEREDITARY HEMOCHROMATOSIS; HAPLOTYPE RECONSTRUCTION; CLINICAL EXPRESSION; HLA HAPLOTYPES; POPULATION	Significant associations between human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-A and -B alleles and CD8+ T-lymphocyte numbers have been reported in the literature in both healthy populations and in HFE-haemochromatosis patients. In order to address whether HLA alleles themselves or alleles at linked genes are responsible for these associations, several genetic markers at the MHC class I region were typed on a population of 147 apparently healthy unrelated subjects phenotypically characterized for their CD8+ and CD4+ T-lymphocyte numbers. By using a machine learning approach, a set of rules was generated that predict the number of CD8+ T-lymphocyte numbers on the basis of the information of the D6S105 microsatellite alleles only. We demonstrate that the previously reported associations with HLA-A and -B alleles are due to the presence of common long (up to 4 megabases long) haplotypes that increased in frequency recently due to positive selection and that encompass a region where a putative gene contributing to the setting of CD8+ T lymphocytes is located, in the neighbourhood of microsatellite locus D6S105, in the 6p21.3 region.

J	Jin, HJ; Liu, CH; Lu, ZM				Jin, Hai-Jun; Liu, Chun-He; Lu, Zhe-Ming			Image retrieval based on fuzzy semantic relevance matrix	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						content-based image retrieval; semantic gap; machine learning; relevance feedback; Fuzzy Semantic Relevance Matrix		The semantic gap, between the low-level visual features and the high-level perceptive or semantic concepts, is a big hurdle in content-based image retrieval. To bridge the semantic gap, segmentation, machine-learning, clustering and classification techniques have been widely used in the preprocessing stages or during the relevance feedback. However, in these techniques, there are some problems such as long training or learning time, high computational complexity, some bad singular results occurring after feedback; and relearning required in the retrieval process for new queries. According to the fuzzy characteristic of the human's semantic knowledge, this paper presents a novel Fuzzy Semantic Relevance Matrix (FSRM) to bridge the gap between low-level features and semantic concepts. The updating of FSRM imitates the human's brain to search the similar images in the knowledge network and improve retrieval results continuously by memorizing the semantic concepts learned in previous relevance feedback processes. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed retrieval scheme.

J	Pateritsas, C; Stafylopatis, A				Pateritsas, Christos; Stafylopatis, Andreas			Memory-based classification with dynamic feature selection using self-organizing maps for pattern evaluation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS			English	Article						classification; memory-based learning; self-organizing maps; feature weighting; hybrid systems	FEATURE SUBSET-SELECTION; NEAREST-NEIGHBOR RULE; LEARNING ALGORITHMS	Memory-based learning is one of the main fields of machine learning. We Propose a new methodology for addressing the classification task that relies on the main idea of the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, which is the most important representative of this field. In the proposed approach, given an unclassified pattern, a set of neighboring patterns is found, not necessarily using all input feature dimensions. Also, following the concept of the naive Bayesian classifier, we adopt the assumption of independence of input features in the outcome of the classification task. The two concepts are merged in an attempt to take advantage of their good performance features. In order to further improve the performance of our approach, we propose a novel weighting scheme of the memory-base. Using the self-organizing maps model during the execution of the algorithm, dynamic weights of the memory-base patterns are produced. Experimental results have shown improved performance of the proposed method in comparison with the aforementioned algorithms and their variations.

J	Zhu, M; Chen, W; Hirdes, JP; Stolee, P				Zhu, Mu; Chen, Wenhong; Hirdes, John P.; Stolee, Paul			The K-nearest neighbor algorithm predicted rehabilitation potential better than current Clinical Assessment Protocol	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Bayes' theorem; clinical decision making; diagnostic likelihood ratio; interRAI; machine learning; rehabilitation	HOME-CARE; MDS-HC; COMMUNITY	Objective: There may be great potential for using computer-modeling techniques and machine-learning algorithms in clinical decision making, if these can be shown to produce results superior to clinical protocols currently in use. We aim to explore the potential to use an automatic, data-driven, machine-learning algorithm in clinical decision making. Study Design and Setting: Using a database containing comprehensive health assessment information (the interRAI-HC) on home care clients (N = 24,724) from eight community-care regions in Ontario, Canada, we compare the performance of the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm and a Clinical Assessment Protocol (the "ADLCAP") currently used to predict rehabilitation potential. For our purposes, we define a patient as having rehabilitation potential if the patient had functional improvement or remained at home over a follow-up period of approximately 1 year. Results: The KNN algorithm has a lower false positive rate in all but one of the eight regions in the sample, and lower false negative rates in all regions. Compared using likelihood ratio statistics, KNN is uniformly more informative than the ADLCAP. Conclusion: This article illustrates the potential for a machine-learning algorithm to enhance clinical decision making. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Many methods of analysis of interaction networks have been proposed, mainly concentrating on node degree distribution or aiming to discover clusters of agents that are very strongly connected between themselves. These methods are principally based on graph-theory or machine learning. We present a mathematically simple formalism for modelling context-specific information propagation in interaction networks based on random walks. The context is provided by selection of sources and destinations of information and by use of potential functions that direct the now towards the destinations. We also use the concept of dissipation to model the aging of information as it diffuses from its source.

J	Gabrilovich, E; Markovitch, S				Gabrilovich, Evgeniy; Markovitch, Shaul			Harnessing the expertise of 70,000 human editors: Knowledge-based feature generation for text categorization	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Review						feature generation; text classification; background knowledge	INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL	Most existing methods for text categorization employ induction algorithms that use the words appearing in the training documents as features. While they perform well in many categorization tasks, these methods are inherently limited when faced with more complicated tasks where external knowledge is essential. Recently, there have been efforts to augment these basic features with external knowledge, including semi-supervised learning and transfer learning. In this work, we present a new framework for automatic acquisition of world knowledge and methods for incorporating it into the text categorization process. Our approach enhances machine learning algorithms with features generated from domain-specific and common-sense knowledge. This knowledge is represented by ontologies that contain hundreds of thousands of concepts, further enriched through controlled Web crawling. Prior to text categorization, a feature generator analyzes the documents and maps them onto appropriate ontology concepts that augment the bag of words used in simple supervised learning. Feature generation is accomplished through contextual analysis of document text, thus implicitly performing word sense disambiguation. Coupled with the ability to generalize concepts using the ontology, this approach addresses two significant problems in natural language processing-synonymy and polysemy. Categorizing documents with the aid of knowledge-based features leverages information that cannot be deduced from the training documents alone. We applied our methodology using the Open Directory Project, the largest existing Web directory built by over 70,000 human editors. Experimental results over a range of data sets confirm improved performance compared to the bag of words document representation.

The need for open source software in machine learning	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						machine learning; open source; reproducibility; creditability; algorithms; software	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES	Open source tools have recently reached a level of maturity which makes them suitable for building large-scale real-world systems. At the same time, the field of machine learning has developed a large body of powerful learning algorithms for diverse applications. However, the true potential of these methods is not used, since existing implementations are not openly shared, resulting in software with low usability, and weak interoperability. We argue that this situation can be significantly improved by increasing incentives for researchers to publish their software under an open source model. Additionally, we outline the problems authors are faced with when trying to publish algorithmic implementations of machine learning methods. We believe that a resource of peer reviewed software accompanied by short articles would be highly valuable to both the machine learning and the general scientific community.

Application of artificial intelligence to the management of urological cancer	JOURNAL OF UROLOGY			English	Review						bladder; bladder neoplasms; prostate; prostatic neoplasms; neural networks (computer)	NEURAL-NETWORK ANALYSIS; LOCALIZED PROSTATE-CANCER; BAYESIAN BELIEF NETWORK; BLADDER-CANCER; RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY; PROGNOSTIC MARKERS; PATHOLOGICAL STAGE; EXPERT-SYSTEM; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION	Purpose: Artificial intelligence techniques, such as artificial neural networks, Bayesian belief networks and neuro-fuzzy modeling systems, are complex mathematical models based on the human neuronal structure and thinking. Such tools are capable of generating data driven models of biological systems without making assumptions based on statistical distributions. A large amount of study has been reported of the use of artificial intelligence in urology. We reviewed the basic concepts behind artificial intelligence techniques and explored the applications of this new dynamic technology in various aspects of urological cancer management. Materials and Methods: A detailed and systematic review of the literature was performed using the MEDLINE (R) and Inspec (R) databases to discover reports using artificial intelligence in urological cancer. Results: The characteristics of machine learning and their implementation were described and reports of artificial intelligence use in virological cancer were reviewed. While most researchers in this field were found to focus on artificial neural networks to improve the diagnosis, staging and prognostic prediction of urological cancers, some groups are exploring other techniques, such as expert systems and neuro-fuzzy modeling systems. Conclusions: Compared to traditional regression statistics artificial intelligence methods appear to be accurate and more explorative for analyzing large data cohorts. Furthermore, they allow individualized prediction of disease behavior. Each artificial intelligence method has characteristics that make it suitable for different tasks. The lack of transparency of artificial neural networks hinders global scientific community acceptance of this method but this can be overcome by neuro-fuzzy modeling systems.
