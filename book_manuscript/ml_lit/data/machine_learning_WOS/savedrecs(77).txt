These limitations are clarified using three case studies: predicting the activity of chemical compounds from their structure; link mining, where properties of websites are discovered; and learning a simple natural language interface for a database. After sketching how logical and relational learning works, the chapter ends with a short sketch of the history of this subfield of machine learning and data mining as well as a brief overview of the rest of this book.

S		DeRaedt, L				DeRaedt, L		An Introduction to Logic	LOGICAL AND RELATIONAL LEARNING	Cognitive Technologies		English	Editorial Material; Book Chapter								The data mining and machine learning approaches discussed in this book employ relational or logical representations. This chapter introduces relational database representations and their formalization in logic. Logic is employed because it is an expressive, well-understood and elegant formalism for representing knowledge. We focus on definite clause logic, which forms the basis of computational logic and logic programming. The chapter introduces the syntax as well as the model-theoretic and proof-theoretic semantics of definite clause logic. Throughout this book an attempt is made to introduce all the necessary concepts and terminology in an intuitive and yet precise manner, without resorting to unnecessary formal proof or theory. The reader interested in a more detailed theoretical account of clausal logic may want to consult [Lloyd, 1987, Genesereth and Nilsson, 1987. Flach, 1994, Hogger, 1990, Kowalski, 1979], and for a more detailed introduction to the programming language Prolog we refer him to [Flach, 1994, Bratko, 1990, Sterling and Shapiro, 1986].									0	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	1611-2482	978-3-540-20040-6	COGN TECHNOL			2008							17	39				23	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence	Computer Science	BKD74	WOS:000267840900002	
S		DeRaedt, L				DeRaedt, L		An Introduction to Learning and Search	LOGICAL AND RELATIONAL LEARNING	Cognitive Technologies		English	Editorial Material; Book Chapter								In this chapter, we introduce machine learning and data mining problems, and argue that they can be viewed as search problems. Within this view, the goal is to find those hypotheses in the search space that satisfy a given quality criterion or minimize a loss function. Several quality criteria and loss functions, such as consistency (as in concept learning) and frequency (in association rule mining) are presented, and we investigate desirable properties of these criteria, such as monotonicity and anti-monotonicity. These properties are defined w.r.t. the is more general than relation and allow one to prune the search for solutions. We also outline several algorithms that exploit these properties.									0	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	1611-2482	978-3-540-20040-6	COGN TECHNOL			2008							41	70				30	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence	Computer Science	BKD74	WOS:000267840900003	
S		DeRaedt, L				DeRaedt, L		Representations for Mining and Learning	LOGICAL AND RELATIONAL LEARNING	Cognitive Technologies		English	Article; Book Chapter								Choosing the right representation to model the problem is essential in artificial intelligence, and machine learning and data mining are not different in this respect. Since the early days of machine learning, researchers such as Gordon Plotkin; Stephen Vere, and Ryszard Michalski have considered the use of expressive representations to model complex learning problems. In this chapter, we introduce a hierarchy of representations used to represent machine learning and data mining problems. The hierarchy includes boolean, attribute value, multi-instance, multi-relational and program representations. The various representations are formulated using the Prolog programming language and illustrated using various applications. We also show how sequences, trees and graphs can be formulated within the sketched relational and logical representations. Because the relations amongst and the need for the various representations are essential for understanding logical and relational learning, we present an integrated framework addressing these issues. This framework also leads us to advanced issues such as propositionalization and aggregation, the subjects of the last sections of this chapter.									0	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	1611-2482	978-3-540-20040-6	COGN TECHNOL			2008							71	114				44	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence	Computer Science	BKD74	WOS:000267840900004	
S		DeRaedt, L				DeRaedt, L		Probabilistic Logic Learning	LOGICAL AND RELATIONAL LEARNING	Cognitive Technologies		English	Article; Book Chapter								So far, this book has focused on logical aspects of learning and on learning in logic. Logic has, however, severe limitations for representing and reasoning about uncertainty. Therefore, this chapter adds another dimension to logic and learning: probability. Probability theory provides us with an elegant and formal basis for reasoning about uncertainty. In the past few decades, several probabilistic knowledge representation formalisms have been developed to cope with uncertainty, and many of these formalisms can be learned from data. Unfortunately, most such formalisms are propositional, and hence they suffer from the same limitations as traditional propositional learning systems. This chapter studies how to alleviate these problems by introducing probabilistic logic learning, sometimes also called probabilistic inductive logic programming or statistical relational learning. This is a newly emerying area in artificial intelligence lying at the intersection of reasoning about uncertainty, machine learning and knowledge representation. Our presentation of probabilistic logic learning starts from an inductive logic programming perspective and extends logical learning with probabilistic methods. In this regard, it follows the upgrading approach of Chapter 6. The chapter will also show how the frameworks of learning from interpretations and learning from entailment can be upgraded to a probabilistic context, yielding representational formalisms such as stochastic logic programs (SLPs) [Eisele, 1994, Muggleton, 1996, Cussens, 2000], PRISM [Sato, 1995] and ICL [Poole, 1993b], Markov logic networks [Richardson and Domingos, 2006], and Bayesian logic programs [Kersting and De Raedt, 2007]. While the chapter provides a brief review of probabilistic models, it does not contain an elaborate overview of probabilistic methods in artificial intelligence, as this by itself is an important topic of study. Such overviews can be found, for instance, in [Russell and Norvig, 2004, Jensen, 2001, Cowell et al., 1999, Baldi et al., 2003]. At the same time, the chapter is not intended as a complete survey of statistical relational learning (see [De Raedt and Kersting, 2003, Getoor and Taskar, 2007, De Raedt et al., 2008]), but rather focuses on the principles that underlie this new and exciting subfield of artificial intelligence.									0	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	1611-2482	978-3-540-20040-6	COGN TECHNOL			2008							223	288				66	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence	Computer Science	BKD74	WOS:000267840900008	
S		DeRaedt, L				DeRaedt, L		Kernels and Distances for Structured Data	LOGICAL AND RELATIONAL LEARNING	Cognitive Technologies		English	Article; Book Chapter								Many contemporary machine learning approaches employ kernels or distance metrics, and in recent years there has been a significant interest in developing kernels and distance metrics for structured and relational data. This chapter provides an introduction to these developments, starting with a brief review of basic kernel- and distance-based machine learning algorithms, and then providing an introduction to kernels and distance measures for structured data, such as vectors, sets, strings, trees, atoms and graphs. While doing so, we focus on the principles used to develop kernels and distance measures rather than on the many variants and variations that exist today. At the same time, an attempt is made to draw parallels between the way kernels and distance measures for structured data are designed. Convolution and decomposition can be used to upgrade kernels for simpler data structures to more complex ones; cf. [Haussler, 1999]. For distances, decomposition is important, as is the relationship between the generality relation and the size of the data; cf. [De Raedt and Ramon, 2008].									0	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	1611-2482	978-3-540-20040-6	COGN TECHNOL			2008							289	324				36	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence	Computer Science	BKD74	WOS:000267840900009

Feature selection via sensitivity analysis of SVM probabilistic outputs	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						feature selection; feature ranking; support vector machines; sensitivity	CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHMS	Feature selection is an important aspect of solving data-mining and machine-learning problems. This paper proposes a feature-selection method for the Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning. Like most feature-selection methods, the proposed method ranks all features in decreasing order of importance so that more relevant features can be identified. It uses a novel criterion based on the probabilistic outputs of SVM. This criterion, termed Feature-based Sensitivity of Posterior Probabilities (FSPP), evaluates the importance of a specific feature by computing the aggregate value, over the feature space, of the absolute difference of the probabilistic outputs of SVM with and without the feature. The exact form of this criterion is not easily computable and approximation is needed. Four approximations, FSPP1-FSPP4, are proposed for this purpose. The first two approximations evaluate the criterion by randomly permuting the values of the feature among samples of the training data. They differ in their choices of the mapping function from standard SVM output to its probabilistic output: FSPP1 uses a simple threshold function while FSPP2 uses a sigmoid function. The second two directly approximate the criterion but differ in the smoothness assumptions of criterion with respect to the features. The performance of these approximations, used in an overall feature-selection scheme, is then evaluated on various artificial problems and real-world problems, including datasets from the recent Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) feature selection competition. FSPP1-3 show good performance consistently with FSPP2 being the best overall by a slight margin. The performance of FSPP2 is competitive with some of the best performing feature-selection methods in the literature on the datasets that we have tested. Its associated computations are modest and hence it is suitable as a feature-selection method for SVM applications.

Monotonicity may also be an important model requirement with a view toward explaining and justifying, decisions, Such as acceptance/rejection decisions. We propose a modified nearest neighbour algorithm for the construction of monotone classifiers from data. We start by making the training, data monotone with as few label changes as possible. The relabeled data set can he viewed as a monotone classifier that has the lowest possible error-rate on the training data. The relabeled data is subsequently used as the training sample by a modified nearest neighbour algorithm. This modified nearest neighbour rule produces predictions that are guaranteed to satisfy the monotonicity constraints. Hence, it is Much more likely to be accepted by the intended users. Our experiments show that monotone kNN often outperforms standard kNN in problems where the monotonicity constraints are applicable.

To select models with the best future classification performance measured by a goal metric, an evaluation metric is often used to select the best classification model among the competing ones. A common practice is to use the same goal and evaluation metric. However, in several recent it is claimed that using an evaluation metric (such as AUC) other than the goal metric (such as accuracy) results in better selection of the correct models. In this paper, we point out a flaw in the, experimental design of those studies, and propose all improved method to test the claim. Our extensive experiments show convincingly that only Me goal metric itself can most reliably select; the correct Classification models.

In this paper, we show that the existing Laplacian Eigenmaps method suffers from the distortion problem, and propose a new distortion-free dimensionality reduction method by adopting a local linear model to encode the local information. We introduce a new loss function that can be seen as a different way to construct the Laplacian matrix, and a new way to impose scaling constraints under the local linear model. Better low-dimensional embeddings are obtained via constrained concave convex procedure. Empirical studies and real-world applications have shown the effectiveness of our models.

Initial approaches were purely logical and brittle. More recently, the availability of large quantities of text on the Web has led to the development of machine learning approaches. however, to date these have mainly extracted ground facts, as opposed to general knowledge. Other learning approaches can extract logical forms, but require supervision and do not scale. In this paper we present an unsupervised approach to extracting semantic networks from large volumes of text. We use the TextRunner system [1] to extract tuples from text, and then induce general concepts and relations from them by jointly clustering the objects and relational strings in the tuples. Our approach is defined in Markov logic using four simple rules. Experiments on a dataset of two million tuples show that it outperforms three other relational clustering approaches, and extracts meaningful semantic networks.

This work is an application of incremental learning of definite clause grammars (DCGs) and syntax directed translation schema (SDTS), which is implemented in the Synapse system. The main experimental result is that Synapse synthesized a set of SDTS rules for translating extended arithmetic expressions with function calls and assignment operators into object codes from positive and negative samples of the translation. The object language is a simple intermediate language based on inverse Polish notation. These rules contain an unambiguous context free grammar for the extended arithmetic expressions, which specifies the precedence and associativity of the operators. This approach can be used for designing and implementing a new programming language by giving the syntax and semantics in the form of the samples of the translation.

We model the normal behavior of a host's traffic from its signature logs, and flag suspicious traces differing from this norm. In particular, we use continuous time Bayesian networks learned from historic non-attack data and flag future event sequences whose likelihood under this normal model is below a threshold. Our method differs from previous approaches in explicitly modeling temporal dependencies in the network traffic. Our model is therefore more sensitive to subtle variations in the sequences of network events. We present two simple extensions that allow for instantaneous events that do not result in state changes, and simultaneous transitions of two variables. Our approach does not require expensive labeling or prior exposure to the attack type. We illustrate the power of our method in detecting attacks with comparisons to other methods on real network traces.

This method relies on supervised classification techniques that are trained on data annotated according to a hierarchical notion of dialogue structure; data which are expensive and time-consuming to produce. In [3], we presented a meeting browser which allows users to view a set of automatically-produced action item summaries and give feedback on their accuracy. In this paper, we investigate methods of using this kind of feedback as implicit supervision, in order to bypass the costly annotation process and enable machine learning through use. We investigate, through the transformation of human annotations into hypothetical idealized user interactions, the relative utility of various modes of user interaction and techniques for their interpretation. We show that performance improvements are possible, even with interfaces that demand very little of their users' attention.

This study presents a hybrid approach that uses different detection techniques for this task where each of these techniques is specialized within its own disfluency domain. A thorough investigation of the used disfluency scheme, which was developed by [1], led us to a detection design where basic rule-matching techniques are combined with machine learning approaches. The aim was both to reduce computational overhead and processing time and also to increase the detection performance. In fact, our system works with an accuracy of 92.9% and an F-Score of 90.6% while working faster than real-time.

Most of the studies on document image understanding have targeted the specific problem of associating layout components with logical labels, while less attention has been paid to the problem of extracting relationships between logical components, such as cross-references. In this chapter, we investigate the problem of detecting the reading order relationship between components of a logical structure. The domain specific knowledge required for this task is automatically acquired from a set of training examples by applying a machine learning method. The input of the learning method is the description of "chains" of layout components defined by the user. The output is a logical theory which defines two predicates, first to read/1 and succ in reading/2, useful for consistently reconstructing all chains in the training set.

Decision-Based Specification and Comparison of Table Recognition Algorithms	MACHINE LEARNING IN DOCUMENT ANALYSIS AND RECOGNITION	Studies in Computational Intelligence		English	Article; Book Chapter							SOURCE TRANSFORMATION	Recognition algorithms are difficult to write and difficult to maintain. There is need for better tools to support the creation, debugging, optimization, and comparison of recognition algorithms. We propose an approach that centers on a process-oriented description. The approach is implemented using a new scripting language called RSL (Recognition Strategy Language), which captures the recognition decisions an algorithm makes as it executes. This semi-formal process-oriented description provides a powerful basis for developing and comparing recognition algorithms. Based on this description, we describe new metrics related to the sequence of decisions an algorithm makes during recognition. The capture of intermediate decision outputs and these new process-oriented metrics greatly extend the limited information available from final results and traditional results-oriented metrics such as recall and precision. Using a simple example, we illustrate how these new metrics can be used to understand and improve decisions within a recognition strategy. We believe these new metrics may also be applied in machine learning algorithms that construct optimal decision sequences from sets of decisions and/or strategies.

A.; Di Mauro, Nicola			Machine Learning for Digital Document Processing: from Layout Analysis to Metadata Extraction	MACHINE LEARNING IN DOCUMENT ANALYSIS AND RECOGNITION	Studies in Computational Intelligence		English	Article; Book Chapter							RECTANGLES	In the last years, the spread of computers and the Internet caused a significant amount of documents to be available in digital format. Collecting them in digital repositories raised problems that go beyond simple acquisition issues, and cause the need to organize and classify them in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the retrieval procedure. The success of such a process is tightly related to the ability of understanding the semantics of the document components and content. Since the obvious solution of manually creating and maintaining an updated index is clearly infeasible, due to the huge amount of data under consideration, there is a strong interest in methods that can provide solutions for automatically acquiring such a knowledge. This work presents a framework that intensively exploits intelligent techniques to support different tasks of automatic document processing from acquisition to indexing, from categorization to storing and retrieval. The prototypical version of the system DOMINUS is presented, whose main characteristic is the use of a Machine Learning Server, a suite of different inductive learning methods and systems, among which the more suitable for each specific document processing phase is chosen and applied. The core system is the incremental first-order logic learner INTHELEX. Thanks to incrementality, it can continuously update and re. ne the learned theories, dynamically extending its knowledge to handle even completely new classes of documents. Since DOMINUS is general and flexible, it can be embedded as a document management engine into many different Digital Library systems. Experiments in a real-world domain scenario, scientific conference management, confirmed the good performance of the proposed prototype.	[Esposito, Floriana; Ferilli, Stefano; Basile, Teresa M.

This kind of methods include statistical methods, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, multiple classifier combination, etc. In this chapter, we briefly review the learning-based classification methods that have been successfully applied to character recognition, with a special section devoted to the classification of large category set. We then discuss the characteristics of these methods, and discuss the remaining problems in character recognition that can be potentially solved by machine learning methods.

Context in document classification conventionally refers to language context, i.e., deterministic or statistical constraints on the sequence of letters in syllables or words, and on the sequence of words in phrases or sentences. We show how to exploit other types of statistical dependence, specifically the dependence between the shape features of several patterns due to the common source of the patterns within a. eld or a document. This type of dependence leads to. eld classification, where the features of some patterns may reveal useful information about the features of other patterns from the same source but not necessarily from the same class. We explore the relationship between. eld classification and the older concepts of unsupervised learning and adaptation. Human interaction is often more effective interspersed with algorithmic processes than only before or after the automated parts of the process. We develop a taxonomy for interaction during training and testing, and show how either human-initiated and machine-initiated interaction can lead to human and machine learning. In a section on new technologies, we discuss how new cameras and displays, web-wide access, interoperability, and essentially unlimited storage provide fertile new approaches to document analysis.

Machine Learning for Signature Verification	MACHINE LEARNING IN DOCUMENT ANALYSIS AND RECOGNITION	Studies in Computational Intelligence		English	Article; Book Chapter							IDENTIFICATION; RECOGNITION; FEATURES	Signature verification is a common task in forensic document analysis. It's aim is to determine whether a questioned signature matches known signature samples. From the viewpoint of automating the task it can be viewed as one that involves machine learning from a population of signatures. There are two types of learning tasks to be accomplished: person-independent (or general) learning and person-dependent (or special) learning. General learning is from a population of genuine and forged signatures of several individuals, where the differences between genuines and forgeries across all individuals are learnt. The general learning model allows a questioned signature to be compared to a single genuine signature. In special learning, a person's signature is learnt from multiple samples of only that person's signature - where within-person similarities are learnt. When a sufficient number of samples are available, special learning performs better than general learning (5% higher accuracy). With special learning, veri. cation accuracy increases with the number of samples. An interactive software implementation of signature veri. cation involving both the learning and performance phases is described.

In this chapter we look at the mathematical and philosophical basis for Bayesian methods and how they relate to machine learning problems in multimedia. We also discuss the notion of decision theory, for making decisions under uncertainty, that is closely related to Bayesian methods. The numerical methods needed to implement Bayesian solutions are also discussed. Two specific applications of the Bayesian approach that are often used in machine learning - naive Bayes and Bayesian networks - are then described in more detail.

The defining characteristic of supervised learning is the availability of annotated training data. The name invokes the idea of a 'supervisor' that instructs the learning system on the labels to associate with training examples. Typically these labels are class labels in classification problems. Supervised learning algorithms induce models from these training data and these models can be used to classify other unlabelled data. In this chapter we ground or analysis of supervised learning on the theory of risk minimization. We provide an overview of support vector machines and nearest neighbour classifiers - probably the two most popular supervised learning techniques employed in multimedia research.

Dimension reduction can be beneficial not only for reasons of computational efficiency but also because it can improve the accuracy of the analysis. The set of techniques that can be employed for dimension reduction can be partitioned in two important ways; they can be separated into techniques that apply to supervised or unsupervised learning and into techniques that either entail feature selection or feature extraction. In this chapter an overview of dimension reduction techniques based on this organization is presented and the important techniques in each category are described.

The most expressive way humans display emotions is through facial expressions. Humans detect and interpret faces and facial expressions in a scene with little or no effort. Still, development of an automated system that accomplishes this task is rather difficult. There are several related problems: detection of an image segment as a face, extraction of the facial expression information, and classification of the expression (e.g., in emotion categories). A system that performs these operations accurately and in real time would be a major step forward in achieving a human-like interaction between the man and machine. In this chapter, we present several machine learning algorithms applied to face analysis and stress the importance of learning the structure of Bayesian network classifiers when they are applied to face and facial expression analysis.

Manual annotation and categorization is not feasible for massive collections of music. In the research domain of music information retrieval (MIR) a number of algorithms for the content-based description of music were developed, which perform the extraction of relevant features for the computation of similarity between pieces of music. This fundamental step enables a great range of applications for music retrieval and organization. With supervised machine learning, music can be classified into different kinds of categories, such as genres, artists or moods. Using unsupervised approaches such as the self-organizing map music can be clustered by similar style and visualized in a way that enables direct retrieval of similar music at a glance. In this chapter, we will review the most common audio feature extraction techniques, which serve as a basis for subsequent classification and clustering tasks. As an example, we will show how music is classified into a set of genres and how genre classification can be used for benchmarking. Moreover, the creation of the so-called "music maps" and their various visualizations is demonstrated, and an interactive application called "PlaySOM" is presented, with an interface which allows direct access to similar sounding pieces in a large music collection. Its mobile counterpart "PocketSOM-Player" allows direct playback from a music map on a mobile device without having to browse lists. Both allow the convenient interactive creation of situation-based playlists.

Such parameterizations are appropriate for use with gradient-based algorithms applied to, for example, history-matching or uncertainty propagation. It is known that the standard Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) expansion, also called linear principal component analysis or PCA, can be used as a differentiable parameterization of input random fields defining the geological model. The standard K-L model is, however, limited in two respects. It requires an eigen-decomposition of the covariance matrix of the random field, which is prohibitively expensive for large models. In addition, it preserves only the two-point statistics of a random field, which is insufficient for reproducing complex structures. In this work, kernel PCA is applied to address the limitations associated with the standard K-L expansion. Although widely used in machine learning applications, it does not appear to have found any application for geological model parameterization. With kernel PCA, an eigen-decomposition of a small matrix called the kernel matrix is performed instead of the full covariance matrix. The method is much more efficient than the standard K-L procedure. Through use of higher order polynomial kernels, which implicitly define a high-dimensionality feature space, kernel PCA further enables the preservation of high-order statistics of the random field, instead of just two-point statistics as in the K-L method. The kernel PCA eigen-decomposition proceeds using a set of realizations created by geostatistical simulation (honoring two-point or multipoint statistics) rather than the analytical covariance function. We demonstrate that kernel PCA is capable of generating differentiable parameterizations that reproduce the essential features of complex geological structures represented by multipoint geostatistics. The kernel PCA representation is then applied to history match a water flooding problem. This example demonstrates that kernel PCA can be used with gradient-based history matching to provide models that match production history while maintaining multipoint geostatistics consistent with the underlying training image.

Here, a fuzzy membership value is assigned to each pattern, and points are classified by assigning them to the nearest of two non parallel planes that are close to their respective classes. Fuzzy Twin Support Vector Machines determine two non-parallel planes by solving two related support vector machines-type problems, each of which is smaller than conventional fuzzy support vector machines. The approach can be used to obtain an improved classification when one has an estimate of the fuzziness of samples in either class.

In fact, spoilage of meat depends on an even smaller fraction of SSO, called ephemeral spoilage organisms (ESO). These ESO are the consequence of factors that dynamically persist or imposed during, e.g., processing, transportation and storage in the market. Meanwhile spoilage is a subjective judgment by the consumer, which may be influenced by cultural and economic considerations and background as well as by the sensory acuity of the individual and the intensity of the change. Indeed, when spoilage progresses, most consumers would agree that gross discoloration, strong off-odors, and the-development of slime would constitute the main qualitative criteria for meat rejection. On the other hand, meat industry needs rapid analytical methods or tools for quantification of these indicators to determine the type of processing needed for their raw material and to predict remaining shelf life of their products. The need of an objective evaluation of meat spoilage is of great importance. The use of metabolomics as a potential tool for the evaluation of meat spoilage can be of great importance. The microbial association of meat should be monitored in parallel with the estimation of changes occurring in the production and/or assimilation of certain compounds would allow us to evaluate spoilage found or produced during the storage of meat under different temperatures as well as packaging conditions.

Pseudo-local Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) of vibration signals raised oil the tool holder, coupled to a pass-band filter allowed the definition and the extraction of features which are very sensitive to the tool wear. These features are defined from sums of Fourier coefficients of the signals reconstructed by SSA and of their residues, in judiciously selected frequency bands. The rates of recognition of wear are very good and exceed 80%. This study highlights two important aspects: strong relevance of information in high frequency vibration components and benefits of the combination of SSA and pass-band filtering to get rid of useless components (noise).

The method uses fMRI-based statistical modeling to characterize colorectal hepatic metastases and follow their early hemodynamical changes. Changes in hepatic hemodynamics are evaluated from T(2)*-W fMRI images acquired during the breathing of air, air-CO(2), and carbogen. A classification model is build to differentiate between tumors and healthy liver tissues. To validate our method, a model was built from 29 mice datasets, and used to classify suspicious regions in 16 new datasets of healthy subjects or subjects with metastases in earlier growth phases. Our experimental results on mice yielded an accuracy of 78% with high precision (88%). This suggests that the method can provide a useful aid for early detection of liver metastases.

Automatic Subcortical Segmentation Using a Contextual Model	MEDICAL IMAGE COMPUTING AND COMPUTER-ASSISTED INTERVENTION - MICCAI 2008, PT I, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI2008)	SEP 06-10, 2008	New York, NY	Rutgers Univ, New York Univ, Robarts Res Inst, NE Digital Inc, Medtron Inc, Siemens Corp Res, Philips, GE			REGISTRATION; BRAIN	Automatically segmenting subcortical structures in brain images has the potential to greatly accelerate drug trials and population studies of disease. Here we propose an automatic subcortical segmentation algorithm using the auto context model. Unlike many segmentation algorithms that separately compute a shape prior and an image appearance model, we develop a framework based on machine learning to learn a unified appearance and context model. We trained our algorithm to segment the hippocampus and tested it on 83 brain MRIs (of 35 Alzheimer's disease patients. 22 with mild cognitive impairment, and 26 normal healthy controls). Using standard distance and overlap metrics, the auto context model method significantly outperformed simpler learning-based algorithms (using AdaBoost alone) and the FreeSurfer system. In tests on a public domain dataset designed to validate segmentation [1], our new algorithm also greatly improved upon a recently-proposed hybrid discriminative/generative approach [2], which was among the top three that performed comparably in a recent head-to-head competition.

Kinetic curves measured for each lesion voxel allow to infer information about the state of the local tissue. As a whole, they reflect the heterogeneity of the vascular structure within a lesion, an important criterion for the preoperative classification of lesions. Current clinical practice in analysis of tissue kinetics however is mainly based on the evaluation of the "most-suspect curve", which is only related to a small, manually or semi-automatically selected region-of-interest within a lesion and does not reflect any information about tissue heterogeneity. We propose a new method which exploits the full range of kinetic information for the automatic classification of lesions. Instead of breaking down the large amount of kinetic information to a single curve, each lesion is considered as a probability distribution in a space of kinetic features, efficiently represented by its kinetic signature obtained by adaptive vector quantization of the corresponding kinetic curves. Dissimilarity of two signatures can be objectively measured using the Mallows distance, which is a metric defined on probability distributions. The embedding of this metric in a suitable kernel function enables us to employ modern kernel-based machine learning techniques for the classification of signatures. In a study considering 81 breast lesions, the proposed method yielded an A(z) value of 0.89 +/- 0.01 for the discrimination of benign and malignant lesions in a nested leave-one-lesion-out evaluation setting.

We have developed an image processing and machine learning based computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) method to support such decisions by estimating the likelihood of malignancy of pulmonary nodules. The system computes 192 image features which are combined with patient age to comprise the feature pool. We constructed an ensemble of 1000 linear discriminant classifiers using 1000 feature subsets selected from the feature pool using a random subspace method. The classifiers were trained on a dataset of 125 pulmonary nodules. The individual classifier results were combined using a majority voting method to form an ensemble estimate of the likelihood of malignancy. Validation was performed on nodules in the Lung Imaging Database Consortium (LIDC) dataset for which radiologist interpretations were available. We performed calibration to reduce the differences in the internal operating points and spacing between radiologist rating and the CADx algorithm. Comparing radiologists with the CADx in assigning nodules into four malignancy categories, fair agreement was observed (kappa=0.381) while binary rating yielded an agreement of (kappa=0.475), suggesting that CADx can be a promising second reader in a clinical setting.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the ensemble approach with a knowledge-based (KB) CAD system for the detection of masses in screening mammograms. The system is designed to determine the presence of a mass in a query mammographic region of interest (ROI) based on its similarity with previously acquired examples of mass and normal cases. Similarity between images is assessed using normalized mutual information. Two different approaches of knowledge database decomposition were investigated to create the ensemble. The first approach was random division of the knowledge database into a pre-specified number of equal size, separate groups. The second approach was based on k-means clustering of the knowledge cases according to common texture features extracted from the ROIs. The ensemble components were fused using a linear classifier. Based on a database of 1820 ROIs (901 masses and 919 and the leave-one-out crossvalidation scheme, the ensemble techniques improved the performance of the original KB-CAD system (A(z) = 0.86 +/- 0.01). Specifically, random division resulted in ROC area index of A(z) = 0.90 +/- 0.01 while k-means clustering provided further improvement (A(z) = 0.91 +/- 0.01). Although marginally better, the improvement was statistically significant. The superiority of the k-means clustering scheme was robust regardless of the number of clusters. This study supports the idea of incorporation of ensemble techniques with knowledge-based systems in mammography.

This method takes advantage of multi-parametric imaging to provide a set of discriminative features for classifier construction by using a regional feature extraction method which takes into account joint correlations among different image parameters; in the experiments herein, MRI and PET images of the brain are used. Support vector machine classifiers are then trained based on the most discriminative features selected from the feature set. To facilitate robust classification and optimal selection of parameters involved in classification, in view of the well-known "curse of dimensionality", base classifiers are constructed in a bagging (bootstrap aggregating) framework for building an ensemble classifier and the classification parameters of these base classifiers are optimized by means of maximizing the area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve estimated from their prediction performance on left-out samples of bootstrap sampling. This classification system is tested on a sex classification problem, where it yields over 90% classification rates for unseen subjects. The proposed classification method is also compared with other commonly used classification algorithms, with favorable results.

The method utilizes a lumen segmentation and AdaBoost, a fast and robust machine learning algorithm, to initially classify (mark) regions outside and inside the vessel wall using the distance from the lumen and intensity profiles sampled radially from the gravity center of the lumen. A similar method using the distance from the lumen and the image intensity as features is used to classify calcium regions. Subsequently, an ellipse shaped deformable model is fitted to the classification result. The method achieves smaller detection error than the inter observer variability, and the method is robust against variation of the training data sets.

When one of the dual-energy images is obtained at a low dose, a bone image generated with a dual-energy subtraction technique is degraded due to noise, especially high frequency noise. Our method restores the degraded bone image using a regression filter trained by support vector regression. The regression filter is trained based on the input of degraded bone images against an output of corresponding noiseless bone images. Due to strong correlation between the high frequency and low frequency signals of bone, the high frequency signal can be accurately generated based on the observed low frequency signal. However, learning such correlation directly is generally difficult. Therefore our technique first generates a "2-class bone model" that explicitly expresses a bone structure that should be restored. Then while utilizing this model, regression filtering is applied. The accuracy of regression learning is largely improved with this approach. Verification tests show that our method works well: a soft-tissue image obtained by subtracting a restored bone image from a standard radiograph reveals that the rib structure has been thoroughly removed and that the sharpness of the soft-tissue signal is improved in general and among the fine vessels. In conclusion ' the proposed method can provide superior dose reduction as well as a better reflection of the anatomical structures in an image. With these advantages, the proposed method can offer high clinical value for the detection of lung lesions.

The US volume is sampled into 72 slices which go through the center of the prostate gland and are separated at a uniform angular spacing of 2.5 degrees. The approach requires the user to select four points from slices (at 0, 45, 90 and 135 degrees) which are used to initialize a discrete dynamic contour (DDC) algorithm. 4 Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are trained over the output of the DDC and classify the rest of the slices. The output of the SVMs is refined using binary morphological operations and DDC to produce the final result. The algorithm was tested on seven ex vivo 3D US images of prostate glands embedded in an agar mold. Results show good agreement with manual segmentation.

In this paper, we propose the semi-automatic matching of two promising and complementary intravascular imaging techniques, Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), with the ultimate goal of producing hybrid images with increased diagnostic value for assessing arterial health. If no ECG gating has been performed on the IVUS and OCT pullbacks, there is typically an anatomical shuffle (displacement in time and space) in the image sequences due to the catheter motion in the artery during the cardiac cycle, and thus, this is not possible to perform a 3D registration. Therefore, the goal of our work is to detect semi-automatically the corresponding images in both modalities as a preprocessing step for the fusion. Our method is based on the characterization of the lumen shape by a set of Gabor Jets features. We also introduce different correction terms based on the approximate position of the slice in the artery. Then we train different support vector machines based on these features to recognize these correspondences. Experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, which achieves up to 95% matching accuracy for our data.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach that can recognize which body part a slice image belongs to robustly. We focus on how to effectively express and use the unique statistical information of the correlation between the CT value and the position information of each body part. We apply the machine learning method AdaBoost to express and use this statistical information. Our approach consists of a training process and a recognition process. In the training process, we first define the whole body using a set of specific classes to ensure that training images in the same class have a high similarity, and prepare a training image set (positive samples and negative samples) for each class. Second, the training images are normalized to a fixed size and rotation in each class. Third, features are calculated for each normalized training image. Finally, AdaBoosted histogram classifiers are trained. After the training process, each class has its own classifiers. In the recognition process, given a series of CT images, the scores of all classes for each slice image are calculated based on the classifiers obtained in the training process. Then, based on the scores of each slice and a simple model of body part sequence continuity, we use dynamic programming (DP) to eliminate false recognition results. Experimental results on 440 unknown series including lesions show that our approach has high a recognition rate.

We specifically target the segmentation of precancerous lesions in a NCI/NLM archive of 60,000 cervigrams. Due to large variations in image appearance in the archive, color and texture features of a tissue type in one image often overlap with that of a different tissue type in another image. This makes reliable tissue segmentation in a large number of images a very challenging problem. In this paper, we propose the use of powerful machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) to learn, from a database with ground truth annotations, critical visual signs that correlate with important tissue types and to use the learned classifier for tissue segmentation in unseen images. In our experiments, SVM performs better than un-supervised methods such as Gaussian Mixture clustering, but it does not scale very well to large training sets and does not always guarantee improved performance given more training data. To address this problem, we combine SVM and clustering so that the features we extracted for classification are features of clusters returned by the mean-shift clustering algorithm. Compared to classification using individual pixel features, classification by cluster features greatly reduces the dimensionality of the problem, thus it is more efficient while producing results with comparable accuracy.

The proposed method constructs classifiers that output anatomical names of bronchial branches by employing the machine-learning approach. We also present its application to a bronchoscopy guidance system. Since the bronchus has a complex tree structure, bronchoscopists easily tend to get disoriented and lose the way to a target location. A bronchoscopy guidance system is strongly expected to be developed to assist bronchoscopists. In such guidance system, automated presentation of anatomical names is quite useful information for bronchoscopy. Although several methods for automated ALBB were reported, most of them constructed models taking only variations of branching patterns into account and did not consider those of running directions. Since the running directions of bronchial branches differ greatly in individuals, they could not perform ALBB accurately when running directions of bronchial branches were different from those of models. Our method tries to solve such problems by utilizing the machine-learning approach. Actual procedure consists of three steps: (a) extraction of bronchial tree structures from 3D CT datasets, (b) construction of classifiers using the multi-class AdaBoost technique, and (c) automated classification of bronchial branches by using the constructed classifiers. We applied the proposed method to 51 cases of 3D CT datasets. The constructed classifiers were evaluated by leave-one-out scheme. The experimental results showed that the proposed method could assign correct anatomical names to bronchial branches of 89.1% up to segmental lobe branches. Also, we confirmed that it was quite useful to assist the bronchoscopy by presenting anatomical names of bronchial branches on real bronchoscopic views.

A method for automated ALBB plays an important role for realizing an augmented display of anatomical names of bronchial branches. The ALBB problem can be considered as a problem that, each bronchial branch is classified into the bronchial name to which it belongs. Therefore, the proposed method constructs classifiers that output anatomical names of bronchial branches by employing the machine-learning approach. The proposed method consists of four steps: (a) extraction of bronchial tree structures from 3D CT datasets, (b) construction of classifiers using the multi-class AdaBoost technique, (c) automated classification of bronchial branches by using the constructed classifiers, and (d) an augmented display of anatomical names of bronchial branches. We applied the proposed method to 71 cases of 3D CT datasets. We evaluated the ALBB results by leave-one-out scheme. The experimental results showed that the proposed method could assign correct anatomical names to bronchial branches of 90.1 % up to segmental lobe branches. Also, we confirmed that an augmented display of the ALBB results was quite useful to assist bronchoscopy.

Decision tree is a typical model for symbolic learning, and neural network is a model for sub-symbolic learning. For pattern recognition, decision trees are more efficient than neural networks for two reasons. First, the computations in making decisions are simpler. Second, important features can be selected automatically during the design process. This paper introduces a neural network tree that is a decision free with each node being an expert neural network.

The main difference between web mining and data mining is nature of data mined. The web mining data is semi-structured and in a pretty large amounts. The logs generated by web servers provide a good example of the type of data used in web mining. A rough set is a formal approximation of a crisp set, which give the lower and the upper approximation of the original set. In this paper we present an approach to extract association rules from web usage data using rough sets. We describe how we convert the web usage data into a decision table and then use rough set approximation to generate association rules.

We developed a set of functional semantic categories to classify text extracts that describe images. Each semantic category names a functional relation between an image depicting a work of art historical significance, and expository text associated with the image. This includes description of the image, discussion of the historical context in which the work was created, and so on. We present interannotator agreement results on human classification of text extracts, and accuracy results from initial machine learning experiments. In our pilot studies, human agreement varied widely, depending the labeler's expertise, the image-text pair under consideration, the number of labels that could be assigned to one text, and the type of training, if any, we gave labelers. Initial machine learning results indicate the three most relevant categories are machine learnable. Based on our pilot work, we implemented a labeling interface that we are currently using to collect a large dataset of text that will be used in training and testing machine classifiers.

The tuning of hyperparameters is assessed as part of the methods by nested-loop cross-validation. Methods: We assess the ability of 18 statistical and machine learning classifiers to detect glaucoma. The training data set is one case-control study consisting of confocol scanning loser ophthalmoscopy measurement values from 98 glaucoma patients and 98 healthy controls. We compare bootstrap estimates of e classification error by the Wilcoxon signed rank test and box-plots of a bootstrap distribution of the estimate Results: The comparison of out-of-bag bootstrap estimators of classification errors is assessed by Spearman's rank correlation, Wilcoxon signed rank tests and box-plots of a bootstrap distribution of the estimate. The classification methods random forests 15.4%, support vector machines 15.9%, bundling 16.3% to 17.8%, and penalized discriminant analysis 16.8% show the best results. Conclusions: Using nested-loop cross-validation we account for the tuning of hyperparameters and demonstrate the assessment of different classifiers. We recommend a block design of the bootstrap simulation to allow a statistical assessment of the bootstrap estimates of the misclassification error.

Anomaly detection using temporal data mining in a smart home environment	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						machine learning; smart homes; anomaly detection; temporal relations		Objectives: To many people, home is a sanctuary. With the maturing of smart home technologies, many people with cognitive and physical disabilities can lead independent lives in their own homes for extended periods of time. In this paper, we investigate the design of machine learning algorithms that support this goal. We hypothesize that machine learning algorithms can be designed to automatically learn models of resident behavior in a smart home, and that the results can be used to perform automated health monitoring and to detect anomalies. Methods: Specifically, our algorithms draw upon the temporal nature of sensor data collected in a smart home to build a model of expected activities and to detect unexpected, and possibly health-critical, events in the home. Results: We validate our algorithms using synthetic data and real activity data collected from volunteers in an automated smart environment. Conclusions: The results from our experiments support our hypothesis that a model can be learned from observed smart home data and used to report anomalies, as they occur, in a smart home.

In our approach we use the subdivision of Discourse Relations into four subsets - CONTRAST, CAUSE, CONDITION ELABORATION, proposed by [1] in their paper where they report results obtained with a machine-learning approach from a similar experiment against which we compare our results. Our approach is fully symbolic and is partially derived from the system called GETARUNS, for text understanding, adapted to a specific task: recognition of Discourse Causal Relations in free text. We show that in order to achieve better accuracy both in the general task and in the specific one, semantic information needs to be used besides syntactic structural information. Our approach outperforms results reported in previous papers [2].

Although, some approaches claim being domain and language independent, they use high dependence knowledge like key-phrases or golden samples for machine-learning approaches. In this work, we propose a language- and domain-independent automatic text summarization approach by sentence extraction using an unsupervised learning algorithm. Our hypothesis is that an unsupervised algorithm can help for clustering similar ideas (sentences). Then, for composing the summary, the most representative sentence is selected from each cluster. Several experiments in the standard DUC-2002 collection show that the proposed method obtains more favorable results than other approaches.

Unfortunately, some data sets may contain a large number of features making, in some cases, the learning process tune consuming and the generalization capability of machine learning poor. To make a data set easy to learn and understand, it is typically recommended to remove the most irrelevant features from the set. However, choosing what data should be kept or eliminated may be performed by complex selection algorithms, and optimal feature selection may require an exhaustive search of all possible subsets of features which is computationally expensive. This paper proposes a simple method to perform feature selection using artificial neural networks. It is shown experimentally that genetic algorithms in combination with artificial neural networks can easily be used to extract those features that are required to produce a desired result. Experimental results show that very few hidden neurons are required for feature selection as artificial neural networks are only used to assess the quality of an individual, which is a chosen subset of features.

In many cases, using a skin color detection scheme is related to a proper representation of the color space chosen to interpret image information. In this work, we propose a fuzzy system for detecting skin in the RGB color space, so that each color plane is modeled using fuzzy sets. As a consequence, the development of the membership functions, the inference system and the defuzzifying process are described throughout this paper. The experiments have been performed with the XM2VTS and VALID face databases and the results show that our system has high detection rates and low false positive rates compared to other similar skin color detectors.

In the current state-of-the-art bundle there is a lack of "software mining" techniques. This term denotes the process of extracting knowledge out of source code. In this paper we approach the software mining task with a combination of text mining and link analysis techniques. We discuss how each instance (i.e. a programming construct such as a class or a method) can be converted into a feature vector that combines the information about bow the instance is interlinked with other instances, and the information about its (textual) content. The so-obtained feature vectors serve as the basis for the construction of the domain ontology with OntoGen, an existing system for semi-automatic data-driven ontology construction.

Thus, a great number of work is carried out on the classifiers aggregation methods in order to improve generally, by voting techniques, the performance of a single classifier. Among these methods of aggregation, we find the Boosting which is most practical thanks to the adaptive update of the distribution of the examples aiming at increasing in an exponential way the weight of the badly classified examples. However, this method is blamed because of overfitting, and the convergence speed especially with noise. In this study, we propose a new approach and modifications carried out on the algorithm of AdaBoost. We will demonstrate that it is possible to improve the performance of the Boosting, by exploiting assumptions generated with the former iterations to correct the weights of the examples. An experimental study shows the interest of this new approach, called hybrid approach.

The transcription of patient records from paper charts and subsequent manipulation of data often results in high volumes of noise as well as a loss of other important information. In addition, such datasets often fail to represent expert medical knowledge and reasoning in any explicit manner. In this research we describe applying data mining methods to retrospective clinical data to build a prediction model for asthma exacerbation severity for pediatric patients in the emergency department. Difficulties in building such a model forced us to investigate alternative strategies for analyzing and processing retrospective data. This paper describes this process together with an approach to mining retrospective clinical data by incorporating formalized external expert knowledge (secondary knowledge sources) into the classification task. This knowledge is used to partition the data into a number of coherent sets, where each set is explicitly described in terms of the secondary knowledge source. Instances from each set are then classified in a manner appropriate for the characteristics of the particular set. We present our methodology and outline a set of experiential results that demonstrate some advantages and some limitations of our approach.

This technique, called PARADIS, leverages minute imperfections of transmitter hardware that are acquired at manufacture and are present even in otherwise identical NICs. These imperfections are transmitter-specific and manifest themselves as artifacts of the emitted signals. In PARADIS, we measure differentiating artifacts of individual wireless frames in the modulation domain, apply suitable machine-learning classification tools to achieve significantly higher degrees of NIC identification accuracy than prior best known schemes. We experimentally demonstrate effectiveness of PARADIS in differentiating between more than 130 identical 802.11 NICs with accuracy in excess of 99%. Our results also show that the accuracy of PARADIS is resilient against ambient noise and fluctuations of the wireless channel. Although our implementation deals exclusively with IEEE 802.11, the approach itself is general and will work with any digital modulation scheme.

We describe a system and associated algorithms to monitor this important civil infrastructure using a collection of sensor-equipped vehicles. This system, which we call the Pothole Patrol (P(2)), uses the inherent mobility of the participating vehicles, opportunistically gathering data from vibration and GPS sensors, and processing the data to assess road surface conditions. We have deployed P(2) on 7 taxis running in the Boston area. Using a simple machine-learning approach, we show that we are able to identify potholes and other severe road surface anomalies from accelerometer data. Via careful selection of training data and signal features, we have been able to build a detector that misidentifies good road segments as having potholes less than 0.2% of the time. We evaluate our system on data from thousands of kilometers of taxi drives, and show that it can successfully detect a number of real potholes in and around the Boston area. After clustering to further reduce spurious detections, manual inspection of reported potholes shows that over 90% contain road anomalies in need of repair.

First, we propose an efficient representation of malware behaviors based on a key observation that the logical ordering of an application's actions over time often reveals the malicious intent even when each action alone may appear harmless. Then, we generate a database of malicious behavior signatures by studying more than 25 distinct families of mobile viruses and worms targeting the Symbian OS-the most widely-deployed handset OS-and their variants. Next, we propose a two-stage mapping technique that constructs these signatures at run-time from the monitored system events and API calls in Symbian OS. We discriminate the malicious behavior of malware from the normal behavior of applications by training a classifier based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Our evaluation on both simulated and real-world malware samples indicates that behavioral detection can identify current mobile viruses and worms with more than 96% accuracy. We also find that the time and resource overheads of constructing the behavior signatures from low-level API calls are acceptably low for their deployment in mobile devices.

These performances are, to a certain degree, robust against perturbations, and it often suffices to present a new pattern a few times only until it can be "picked up". From an abstract mathematical perspective, this implies that the brain, as a dynamical system, (1) hosts a very large number of cyclic attractors, such that (2) if the system is driven by external input with a cyclic motif, it can entrain to a closely corresponding attractor in a very short time. This chapter proposes a simple recurrent neural network architecture which displays these dynamical phenomena. The model builds on echo state networks (ESNs), which have recently become popular in machine learning and computational neuroscience.

SDPP promotes the use of both fixed and mobile directories co-existing in a hybrid setting comprised of devices with different memory availability. Our proposed system is based on a heuristic approach, whose performance is optimized by formulating the directory-placement problem as a Semi-Markov Decision Process solved by Q-Learning. Performance evaluations reveal typical performance gains ranging between 15% and 75% of SDPP compared with a default broadcast approach for MANETs comprised of hosts moving at pedestrian speeds. A two-step process for practical implementation based on "off-line" computer simulations is also described.	[Gonzalez-Valenzuela, Sergio; Leung, Victor C.

Fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) has become the focus of research in machine learning. And it greatly improves the capabilities of fault-tolerance and generalization of standard support vector machine. The hybrid model of RS-FSVM inherits the merits of RS and FSVM, and is applied into fused image quality evaluation in this paper. RST is used as preprocessing step to improve the performances of FSVM. A large number of experimental results show that when the number training samples are enough RS-SVM can achieve higher precision of classification than methods of FSVM and SVM.

In the field of classification rule mining, classifiers are designed through the following two phases: rule discovery and rule selection. In the rule discovery phase, a large number of classification rules are extracted from training data. This phase is based on two rule evaluation criteria: support and confidence. An association rule mining technique such as Apriori is usually used to extract classification rules satisfying pre-specified threshold values of the minimum support and confidence. In some studies, EMO algorithms were used to search for Pareto-optimal rules with respect to support and confidence. On the other hand, a small number of rules are selected from the extracted rules to design an accurate and compact classifier in the rule selection phase. A heuristic rule sorting criterion is usually used for rule selection. In some studies, EMO algorithms were used for multi-objective rule selection to maximize the accuracy of rule sets and minimize their complexity. In this chapter, first we explain the above-mentioned two phases in classification rule mining. Next we explain the search for Pareto-optimal rules and the search for Pareto-optimal rule sets. Then we explain evolutionary multi-objective rule selection as a post processing procedure in the second phase of classification rule mining. A number of Pareto-optimal rule sets are found from a large number of candidate rules, which are extracted from training data in the first phase. Finally we show experimental results on some data sets from the UCI machine learning repository. Through computational experiments, we demonstrate that evolutionary rule selection can drastically decrease the number of extracted rules without severely degrading their classification accuracy. We also examine the relation between Pareto-optimal rules and Pareto-optimal rule sets.

This paper presents a computational approach for ranking keyworded images in order of relevance to a given keyword. Our approach uses machine learning to attempt to learn what visual features within an image are most related to the keywords, and then provide ranking based on similarity to a visual aggregate. To evaluate the technique, a Web 2.0 application has been developed to obtain a corpus of user-generated ranking information for a given image collection that can be used to evaluate the performance of the ranking algorithm.

The importance of feature selection drops dramatically if classification is used for retrieval (e.g. if Support Vector Machines are used) and only little user feedback is available. In this situation simple image, features and even random features perform equally well as sophisticated signal processing-based features (e.g. the content-based MPEG-7 image descriptors). Practically relevant applications for these findings are retrieval on mobile devices and in heterogeneous (e.g. ad hoc generated) media collections.

After an introduction to the nature and the interest of learning within IMO, we consider two complementary aspects of learning: individual learning, i.e., what the decision maker can learn, and model or machine learning, i.e., what the formal model can learn in the course of an IMO procedure. Finally, we discuss how one might investigate learning experimentally, in order to understand how to better support decision makers. Experiments involving a human decision maker or a virtual decision maker are considered.

Risk assessment of atmospheric emissions using machine learning	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORK; MODEL; PARAMETERIZATION; DIFFUSION	Supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used to perform statistical and logical analysis of several transport and dispersion model runs which simulate emissions from a fixed source under different atmospheric conditions. First, a clustering algorithm is used to automatically group the results of different transport and dispersion simulations according to specific cloud characteristics. Then, a symbolic classification algorithm is employed to find complex non-linear relationships between the meteorological input conditions and each cluster of clouds. The patterns discovered are provided in the form of probabilistic measures of contamination, thus suitable for result interpretation and dissemination. The learned patterns can be used for quick assessment of the areas at risk and of the fate of potentially hazardous contaminants released in the atmosphere.

One of the reasons is that the task lies in between several areas of specialization. In this extended abstract we review some of the ideas we have been investigating while approaching this problem. First, we present how we understand semantic search, the Web and the current challenges. Second, how to use shallow semantics to improve Web search. Third, how the usage of search engines can capture the implicit semantics encoded in the queries and actions of people.

However, they are not always explicitly defined and in many cases they are ambiguous. In this research, we present a process that attempts to solve the problem of abbreviation ambiguity. Various features have been explored, including context-related methods and statistical methods. The application domain is Jewish Law documents written in Hebrew, which are known to be rich in ambiguous abbreviations. Various variants of the one sense per discourse hypothesis (by varying the scope of discourse) have been implemented. Several common machine learning methods have been tested to find a successful integration of these variants. The best results have been achieved by SVM, with 96.09% accuracy.

Despite this, little progress has been made in developing an interface that any untrained user can use to query very large databases using natural language. In this research, the design of a novel system is discussed. Tree-like structures are built for every question and each query, and a tree kernel, which represents trees in terms of their substructures, is used to define feature spaces. A machine learning algorithm is proposed that takes pairs of trees as training input and derives the unknown final SQL query by matching propositional and relational substructures.

One has to balance between personal needs and tastes, financial limitations, latest trends and social assessment of products. On the other hand, designing the "perfect" product for a given category of users is a difficult task for any company, involving extensive market studies and complex analysis. This paper presents a method to gather the attributes that make up the "perfect" product within a given category and for a specified community. The system built employing this method can be useful for two purposes: firstly, it can recommend products to a user based on the similarity of the feature attributes that most users in his/her community see as important and positive for the product type and the products the user has to opt from. Secondly, it can be used as a practical feedback for companies as to what is valued and how, for a product, within a certain community. For the moment, we will consider the community level as being the country, and thus we will apply and compare the method proposed for English and Spanish. For each product class, we first automatically extract general features (characteristics describing any product, such as price, size, and design), for each product we then extract specific features (as picture resolution in the case of a digital camera) and feature attributes (adjectives grading the characteristics, as modem or faddy for design). Further on, we use "social filtering" to automatically assign a polarity (positive or negative) to each of the feature attributes, by using a corpus of "pros and cons"-style customer reviews. Additional feature attributes are classified depending on the previously assigned polarities using Support Vector Machines Sequential Minimal Optimization [1] machine learning with the Normalized Google Distance [2]. Finally, recommendations are made by computing the cosine similarity between the vector representing the "perfect" product and the vectors corresponding to products a user could choose from.

In GTSP, we are given a partition of cities into groups and we are required to find a minimum length tour that includes exactly one city from each group. The aim of this paper is to present a new memetic algorithm for GTSP which clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art memetic algorithm of Snyder and Daskin [21] with respect to the quality of solutions. Computational experiments conducted to compare the two heuristics also show that our improvements come at a cost of longer running times, but the running times still remain within reasonable bounds (at most a few minutes). While the Snyder-Daskin memetic algorithm is designed only for the Symmetric GTSP, our algorithm can solve both symmetric and asymmetric instances. Unlike the Snyder-Daskin heuristic, we use a simple machine learning approach as well.

This paper seeks to identify, for the first time, the level at which Greek listed companies from several sectors provide environmental information through their financial statements. Moreover, we intent to discover the level at which environmental reporting is determined by the information position as explained by Information Cost variables, Proprietary Cost, Control Variables and Media Visibility variable. For this reason, we compared a number of different machine learning models and came to the conclusion that an ensemble of models gave more accurate results.

So we developed XMAS(X multimedia analysis system). XMAS consists of two service applications - One is a detecting solution objectionable multimedia for clean internet and another is a retrieval solution of illegal movies for digital rights. XMAS uses feature extraction method based on the MPEG-7 visual descriptors and machine learning and decision based on multi-class SVM (support vector machine). The experimental accuracy of XMAS is about 0.91 similar to 0.93 for images of objectionable multimedia and about 0.93 for retrieval of illegal movies.

Unlike most previous studies, PDCA puts emphasis on architectural adaptation as well as function level adaptation. The architectural adaptation is done by determining automatically the number of hidden layers in an ANN and of neurons in hidden layers. The function level adaptation, is done by training each hidden neuron with a different training set. PDCA uses a constructive approach to achieve both the architectural as well as function level adaptation. It has been tested on a number of benchmark classification problems in machine learning and ANNs. The experimental results show that PDCA can produce ANNs with good generalization ability in comparison with other algorithms.	[Sattar, Md. Abdus; Islam, Md.

However, this assumption cannot hold in many practical cases, e.g., brain-computer interfacing, bioinformatics, etc. Especially, changing input distribution in the regression problem often occurs, and is known as the covariate shift. There are a lot of studies to adapt the change, since the ordinary machine learning methods do not work properly under the shift. The asymptotic theory has also been developed in the Bayesian inference. Although many effective results are reported on statistical regular ones, the non-regular models have not been considered well. This paper focuses on behaviors of non-regular models under the covariate shift. In the former study [1], we formally revealed the factors changing the generalization error and established its upper bound. We here report that the experimental results support the theoretical findings. Moreover it is observed that the basis function in the model plays an important role in some cases.

Whereas SVM associates properties of the imaging data with simple specific categorical labels, KCCA replaces these simple labels with a label vector for each stimulus containing details of the features of that stimulus. We have compared KCCA and SVM analyses of an fMRI data set involving responses to emotionally salient stimuli. This involved first training the algorithm ( SVM, KCCA) on a subset of fMRI data and the corresponding labels/label vectors, then testing the algorithms on data withheld from the original training phase. The classification accuracies of SVM and KCCA proved to be very similar. However, the most important result arising from this study is that KCCA in able in part to extract many of the brain regions that SVM identifies as the most important in task discrimination blind to the categorical task labels.

In this paper, the circle-segments method is proposed as a feature selection rnethod to identify important input features before the entire data set is provided for learning with machine learning systems. Specifically, four machine learning systems are deployed for classification, viz. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM), and k-Nearest Neighbour(kNN). The integration between the circle-segments method and the machine learning systems has been applied to two case studies comprising one benchmark and one real data sets. Overall, the results after feature selection using the circle-segments method demonstrate improvements in performance even with more than 50% of the input features eliminated from the original data sets.

The Cournot-Nash equilibrium is an important problem in economic models. The two problems can be formulated as linear variational inequalities (LVIs). In the paper, a linear case of the general projection neural network (GPNN) is applied for solving the resulting LVIs, and consequently the two practical problems. Compared with existing recurrent neural networks capable of solving these problems, the designed GPNN is superior in its stability results and architecture complexity.

Some manifolds (e.g. the manifold of an exponential family) have natural connections (e.g. e- and m-connections) with which the manifold is dually-flat. Conversely, a dually-flat structure can be introduced into a manifold from a potential function. This paper shows the case of quasi-additive algorithms as an example. Information theory is another important tool in machine learning. Many of its applications consider information-theoretic quantities such as the entropy and the mutual information, but few fully recognize the underlying essence of them. The asymptotic equipartition property is one of the essence in information theory. This paper gives an example of the property in a Markov decision process and shows how it is related to return maximization in reinforcement learning.

This view is especially useful when applying variational Bayes (VB) to models outside the conjugate-exponential family. For them, variational Bayesian expectation maximization (VB EM) algorithms are not easily available, and gradient-based methods are often used as alternatives. Traditional natural gradient methods use the Riemannian structure (or geometry) of the predictive distribution to speed up maximum likelihood estimation. We propose using the geometry of the variational approximating distribution instead to speed up a conjugate gradient method for variational learning and inference. The computational overhead is small due to the simplicity of the approximating distribution. Experiments with real-world speech data show significant speedups over alternative learning algorithms.

The age classification task, however, cannot be solved in the same way because the age-related face features go through gradual, or rather continuous, changes over the ages. From the machine learning viewpoint, age groups in terms of face images do not have clear borders, and it can be said that they can form 'continuous category'. Therefore we think that we should add the continuousness of face features to the learning process for enhancing the performance of age estimation. In this paper, we propose a model of age classification using one dimensional Self-Organizing Map, which can train the classifiers without preparing complete age information and reinforce the classifier's performance. We show the effectiveness of our model and compare the performance to that of using discrete category machine learning. In conclusions, we clarify our future directions.

HIERARCHICAL DECOMPOSITION OF MULTICLASS PROBLEMS	NEURAL NETWORK WORLD			English	Article						Classification; multiclass classification problems; hierarchical classification structures	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; CLASSIFICATION; SVM	Several popular Machine Learning techniques are originally designed for the solution of two-class problems. However, several classification problems have more than two classes. One approach to deal with multiclass problems using binary classifiers is to decompose the multiclass problem into multiple binary sub-problems disposed in a binary tree. This approach requires a binary partition of the classes for each node of the tree, which defines the tree structure. This paper presents two algorithms to determine the tree structure taking into account information collected from the used dataset. This approach allows the tree structure to be determined automatically for any multiclass dataset.	[Lorena, Ana C.] Univ Fed Abc, CMCC, BR-09090400 Santo Andre, SP, Brazil; [de Carvalho, Andre C. P.

The unimodal model for the classification of ordinal data	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						classification; ordinal data; feedforward neural networks; measures of association; support vector machines	REGRESSION	Many real life problems require the classification of items into naturally ordered classes. These problems are traditionally handled by conventional methods intended for the classification of nominal classes where the order relation is ignored. This paper introduces a new machine learning paradigm intended for multi-class classification problems where the classes are ordered. The theoretical development of this paradigm is carried out under the key idea that the random variable class associated with a given query should follow a unimodal distribution. In this context, two approaches are considered: a parametric, where the random variable class is assumed to follow a specific discrete distribution; a nonparametric, where the random variable class is assumed to be distribution-free. In either case, the unimodal model can be implemented in practice by means of feedforward neural networks and support vector machines, for instance. Nevertheless, our main focus is on feedforward neural networks. We also introduce a new coefficient, r(int), to measure the performance of ordinal data classifiers. An experimental study with artificial and real datasets is presented in order to illustrate the performances of both parametric and nonparametric approaches and compare them with the performances of other methods. The superiority of the parametric approach is suggested, namely when flexible discrete distributions, a new concept introduced here, are considered. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The model of the controller could be considered as a very simplified clone of the biological controller. External control that we advocate uses a hierarchical model that interfaces the biological systems at the level of command, and the level of execution. At the top level discrete sequential model of movement is implemented and relies on temporal synergies typical for biological control and sensors information. At the coordination level the decomposition to lower centers is implemented based on spatial synergies. At the actuator level customized biomechanical models need to be used in order to match the performances of the system. The top and coordination levels could be best understood as sets of rules having IF-TREN- ELSE form, therefore the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) seem to be the most promising technique for their determination. In this review we describe the essence of the method, and list many of the applications of ANN for designing of the external control for NP. In addition, five presentations that follow discuss the mapping of the sensors information to the control of individual muscles, mapping of the sensors information for the synthesis of gait phases, use of ANN for determination of optimal electrode, application of wavelet to extract the important component of biological signals for control of movement) [41-45].

Almost all the models at hand are not applicable online, although online prediction, especially for air quality parameters forecasting, has very important significance for real-world applications. A support vector machine (SVM), as a novel and powerful machine learning tool, can be used for time-series prediction and has been reported to perform well by some promising results. This paper develops an online SVM model to predict air pollutant levels in an advancing time-series based on the monitored air pollutant database in Hong Kong downtown area. The experimental comparison between the online SVM model and the conventional SVM model (non-online SVM model) demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency in predicting air quality parameters with different time series.

Human intelligence in organizing companies in a civic society has been adopted in this framework. In the HGFNN framework, an FNN is regarded as a company and fuzzy rules are considered as employees of the company. Analogous to the management of a company, three criteria, namely client satisfaction, performance evaluation and cost minimization, have been proposed. Simulation studies on mobile robot control demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to other existing approaches. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Novelty detection with constructive probabilistic neural networks	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						novelty detection; anomaly detection; probabilistic neural networks; constructive training; dynamic decay adjustment	DYNAMIC DECAY ADJUSTMENT	This paper investigates the use of probabilistic neural networks trained with the dynamic decay adjustment algorithm (PNN-DDA) for novelty detection tasks. PNN-DDA is a fast, constructive neural model originally developed and investigated for standard classification tasks. The training algorithm is controlled by two parameters. theta(+) and theta(-). Simulations employing four data sets from the UCI machine learning repository are reported. The results show that parameter theta(-) considerably influences the performance of PNN-DDA for novelty detection, and furthermore, that PNN-DDA achieves performance comparable to NNDD with the advantage of producing much smaller classifiers.

Registration and machine learning-based automated segmentation of subcortical and cerebellar brain structures	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						brain segmentation; registration-based segmentation; artificial neural networks; support vector machine; MRI	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE IMAGES; MR-IMAGES; MODEL; CLASSIFICATION; MIXTURE	The large amount of imaging data collected in several ongoing multi-center studies requires automated methods to delineate brain structures of interest. We have previously reported on using artificial neural networks (ANN) to define subcortical brain structures. Here we present several automated segmentation methods using multidimensional registration. A direct comparison between template, probability, artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM)-based automated segmentation methods is presented. Three metrics for each segmentation method are reported in the delineation of subcortical and cerebellar brain regions. Results show that the machine learning methods outperform the template and probability-based methods. Utilization of these automated segmentation methods may be as reliable as manual raters and require no rater intervention. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

GCS is a new model of Learning Classifier Systems in which the population of classifiers has a form of a context-free grammar rule set in a Chomsky Normal Form. GCS has been proposed to address both the natural language grammar induction and also learning formal grammar for DNA sequence. In both cases near-optimal solutions or better than reported in the literature were obtained.

Our choice of closed patterns as a user preference representation is based on both theoretical and practical considerations supported by Formal Concept Analysis. We simulated interaction with a calendar application using 16 months of real data from a user's calendar to evaluate the accuracy and consistency of suggestions, in order to determine the best data mining and solution generation techniques from a range of available methods. The best performing data mining method was then compared with decision tree learning, the best machine learning algorithm in this domain. The results show that our data mining method based on closed patterns converges faster than decision tree learning, whilst generating only consistent solutions. Thus closed pattern mining is a better technique for generating appointment attributes in the calendar domain.

This paper investigates and proposes strategies for the generalization of SVMs to problems with more than two classes. The focus of this work is on strategies that decompose the original multiclass problem into binary subtasks, whose outputs are combined. The proposed strategies aim to investigate the adaptation of the decompositions for each multiclass application considered, using information of the performance obtained in its solution or extracted from its examples. The implemented algorithms were evaluated using benchmark datasets and real applications from the Bioinformatics domain. Among the benefits observed is the obtainment of simpler decompositions, which require less binary classifiers in the multiclass solution.

If the observed content is identical, then the task is easy. But if the content is even slightly changed, the task to identify the duplicate can be difficult and time consuming. In this paper we develop a fast, two-step algorithm for detecting image duplicates. The algorithm finds also slightly changed images with added noise, translated or scaled content, or images having been compressed and decompressed by various algorithms. The time needed to detect duplicates is kept low by implementing image feature-based searches. To detect all similar images for a given reference image, the feature extraction based on convex layers is deployed. The correlation coefficient between two features gives the first hint of similarity to the user, who creates a learning set for support vector machines by simple on-screen selection.

The intelligence is not incorporated just in a segmentation method, which is controlled by 11 parameters, but mostly in a routine for easier parameters' values determination. Three different approaches are implemented: 1) manual parameter value selection, 2) interactive step-by-step parameter value selection based on visual image content, and 3) fast and intelligent parameter value determination based on machine learning. Intelligence of second and third approach is introduced by end-users in the repeated interaction with our prototype in attempts to correctly segment out the structures from image. Fast and intelligent parameter determination predicts a new set of parameters' values for current image being processed based on knowledge models constructed from previous successful (positive samples) and unsuccessful (negative samples) parameter selections. Such approach pointed out to be very efficient and fast, especially if we have many positive and negative samples in the learning set.

However, for large document collections it is difficult for the user to direct effective queries from the beginning of his/her search, since accurate query terms may not be known in advance. In this paper we describe a system that applies a hybrid approach to assist a user identify the most relevant documents: at the beginning it applies dynamic personalization techniques based on user modeling to initiate the search on a large document and multimedia content collection; next the query is further refined using a clustering based approach which after processing a sub-collection of documents presents the user with more categories to select from a list of new keywords. We analyze the most prominent implementation choices for the modular components of the proposed architecture: a machine learning approach for personalized services, a clustering based approach towards a user directed query refinement and a parallel processing module that supports document clustering in order to decrease the system's response times.

This study presents an overview of the application of neural networks in the field of biosignal classification (especially in anomaly detection problems), and, in addition, results of adaptations of conventional neural classifiers are presented. Statistical techniques based on pattern recognition analysis (like Principal Components Analysis and Clustering) might be use to evaluate the proposed methodology. Finally we will illustrate advantages and drawbacks of neural systems in biosignal analysis and catch a glimpse of forthcoming developments in machine learning models for the real clinical environment.

In particular, what players have to face nowadays in terms of AI is not far from what was available at the beginning of the video games era. Even nowadays, the AI of almost all games is based on a finite set of actions/reactions whose sequence can be easily predicted by expert players. As a result, the game soon becomes too obvious to still be fun. Instead, machine learning techniques could be employed to classify a player's behavior and consequently adapt the game's AI; the competition against the AI would become more stimulant and the fun of the game would last longer. To this aim, we consider a game where both the player and the AI have a limited information about the current game state and where it is part of the game to guess the information hidden by the opponent. We demonstrate how machine learning techniques could be easily implemented in this context to improve the AI by making it adaptive with respect to the strategy of a specific player.

The working focus of programmers is revealed by means of their interactions with a software repository that receives a set of cohesive artifact changes within one commit transaction. This implicit knowledge of interdependent changes can be exploited in order to recommend likely further changes, given a set of already changed artifacts. We suggest a hybrid approach based on Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and machine learning methods to recommend software development artifacts, that is predicting a sequence of configuration items that were committed together. As opposed to related approaches to repository mining that are mostly based on symbolic methods like Association Rule Mining (ARM), our connectionist method is able to generalize onto unseen artifacts. Text analysis methods are employed to consider their textual attributes. We applied our technique to three publicly available datasets from the PROMISE Repository of Software Engineering Databases. The evaluation showed that the connectionist LSI-approach achieves a significantly higher recommendation accuracy than existing methods based on ARM. Even when generalizing onto unseen artifacts, our approach still provides an accuracy of up to 72.7% on the given datasets.

SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS; CLIMATE; PREDICTION; SURFACES; MEXICO	Potential distribution modelling has been widely used to predict and to understand the geographical distribution of species. These models are generally produced by retrieving the environmental conditions where the species is known to be present or absent and feeding this data into a modelling algorithm. This paper investigates the use of Machine Learning techniques in the potential distribution modelling of plant species Stryphnodendron obovatum Benth (MIMOSACEAE). Three techniques were used: Support Vector Machines, Genetic Algorithms and Decision Trees. Each technique was able to extract a different representation of the relations between the environmental conditions and the distribution profile of the species being considered.

The new approach applies to any classification problem with large feature sets. Data is partitioned using clusters on a subset of the features. A multi-label classifier is then trained individually on each cluster, using automatic feature selection to customize the larger feature set for the cluster. This algorithm is applied to the Semantic Role Labeling problem and achieves improvements in accuracy for both the argument identification classifier and the argument labeling classifier.

The data reduction procedures are of vital importance to machine learning and data mining. To solve the data reduction problems the agent-based population learning algorithm was used. The proposed approach has been used to reduce the original dataset in two dimensions including selection of reference instances and removal of irrelevant attributes. To validate the approach the computational experiment has been carried out. Presentation and discussion of experiment results conclude the paper.

This correspondence also reveals the difference between the two and raises new problems to be solved in both of algebra and machine learning. In this article we solve the problem of providing a concrete form of the characteristic set of a union of two polynomial ideals. Our previous work showed that the finite basis of every polynomial ideal is its characteristic set, which ensures that the class of ideals of polynomials is identifiable from positive data. Union or set-theoretic sum is a basic set operation, and it could be conjectured that there is some effective method which produces a characteristic set of a union of two polynomial ideals if both of the basis of ideals are given. Unfortunately, we cannot find a previous work which gives a general method for how to find characteristic sets of unions of languages even though the languages are in a class identifiable from positive data. We give methods for computing a characteristic set of the union of two polynomial ideals.

Hot spots are residues comprising only a small fraction of interfaces yet accounting for the majority of the binding energy. HotSprint contains data for 35 776 protein interfaces among 49 512 protein interfaces extracted from the multi-chain structures in Protein Data Bank (PDB) as of February 2006. The conserved residues in interfaces with certain buried accessible solvent area (ASA) and complex ASA thresholds are flagged as computational hot spots. The predicted hot spots are observed to correlate with the experimental hot spots with an accuracy of 76. Several machine-learning methods (SVM, Decision Trees and Decision Lists) are also applied to predict hot spots, results reveal that our empirical approach performs better than the others. A web interface for the HotSprint database allows users to browse and query the hot spots in protein interfaces. HotSprint is available at http://prism.ccbb.ku.edu.tr/hotsprint; and it provides information for interface residues that are functionally and structurally important as well as the evolutionary history and solvent accessibility of residues in interfaces.

We propose a, new approach to combining matchers into ensembles, called Schema Matcher Boosting (SMB). This approach is based on a well-known machine learning technique, called boosting. We present a boosting algorithm for schema matching with a unique ensembler feature, namely the ability to choose the matchers that participate in an ensemble. SMB introduces a, new promise for schema matcher designers. Instead of trying to design a perfect schema matcher that is accurate for all schema pairs, a designer call focus on finding better than random schema matchers. We provide a thorough comparative empirical results where we show that SMB out;performs, on average, any individual matcher. In our experiments we have compared SMB with more than 30 other matchers over a real world data of 230 schemata and several ensembling approaches, including the Meta Learner of LSD. Our empirical analysis shows that; SMB improves, on average, over the performance of individual matchers. Moreover, SMB is shown to be consistently dominant, far beyond ally other individual matcher. Finally, we observe that SMB performs better than the Meta-Learner in terms of precision, recall and F-Measure.

In our experiments we populate a part of our ontology of Named Entities. We considered two high level categories - geographical locations and person names and ten sub-classes for each category. For each sub-class we automatically learn a syntactic model from a list of training examples and a parsed corpus. A novel syntactic indexing method allowed us to use large quantities of syntactically annotated data. The syntactic model for each named entity sub-class is a set of weighted syntactic features, i.e. words which typically co-occur with the members of the class in the corpus. The method is weakly supervised, since no manually annotated corpus is used in the learning process. The syntactic models are used to classify the unknown Named Entities in the test set. The method achieved promising results, i.e. 65% accuracy, and outperforms significantly the other two approaches.

In model based OPC, masks are systematically modified to compensate for the non-ideal optical and process effects of optical lithography system. The polygons in the layout are fragmented, and simulations are performed to determine the image intensity pattern on the wafer. Then the mask is perturbed by moving the fragments to match the desired wafer pattern. This iterative process continues until the pattern on the wafer matches the desired one. Although OPC increases the fidelity of pattern transfer to the wafer, it is quite CPU intensive; OPC for modern IC designs can take days to complete on computer clusters with thousands of CPU. In this paper, techniques from statistical machine learning are used to predict the fragment movements. The goal is to reduce the number of iterations required in model based OPC by using a fast and efficient solution as the initial guess to model based OPC. To determine the best model, we train and evaluate several principal component regression models based on prediction error. Experimental results show that fragment movement predictions via regression model significantly decrease the number of iterations required in model based OPC.

Reservoir computing is a new learning method from the field of machine learning. This has already led to impressive results in software but integrated photonics with its large bandwidth and fast nonlinear effects would be a high-performance hardware platform. Therefore we developed a simulation model which employs a network of coupled Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers (SOA) as a reservoir. We show that this kind of photonic reservoir performs even better than classical reservoirs on a benchmark classification task.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm model for k-class multi-class classification problem based on p-class (2 <= p <= k) support vector ordinal regression machine (SVORM). A series of algorithms can be generated by selecting the different parameters p, L and the code matrix. When p = 2, they reduce to the popular algorithms based on 2-class SVMs. When p = 3, they improve K-SVCR in [1] and v-K-SVCR in [18]. The algorithms based on p- class SVORM in this algorithm model are more interesting because our preliminary numerical experiments show that then are promising. At last, some problems for further study are suggested.

Our predictive model simultaneously incorporates (1) the ability to classify any number of distinct groups; (2) the ability to incorporate heterogeneous types of attributes as input: (3) a high-dimensional data transformation that eliminates noise and errors in biological data; (4) tire ability to incorporate constraints to limit the rate of misclassification, and a reserved-judgment region that provides a safeguard against over-training (which tends to lead to high misclassification rates from tire resulting predictive rule); and (5) successive multi-stage classification capability to handle data points placed in the reserved judgment region. Application of the predictive model to a broad class of biological and medical problems is described. Applications include: the differential diagnosis of the type of erythemato-squamous diseases; genomic analysis and prediction of aberrant CpG island meythlation in human cancer; discriminant analysis of motility and morphology data in human lung carcinoma; prediction of ultrasonic cell disruption for drug delivery; identification of tumor shape and volume in treatment: of sarcoma; multistage discriminant analysis of biomarkers for predict, ion of early atherosclerosis; fingerprinting of native and angiogenic microvascular networks for early diagnosis of diabetes, aging, macular degeneracy and tumor metastasis, and prediction of protein localization sites. In all these applications, the predictive model yields correct classification rates ranging from 80% to 100%. This provides motivation for pursuing its use as a medical diagnostic, monitoring and decision-making tool.

Typically, the hyper-parameters are selected to minimize the cross-validated estimates of the out-of-sample classification error of the model. This cross-validation optimization problem can be formulated as a bilevel program in which the outer-level objective minimizes the average number of misclassified points across the cross-validation folds, subject to inner-level constraints such that the classification functions for each fold are (exactly or nearly) optimal for the selected hyper-parameters. Feature selection is included in the bilevel program in the form of bound constraints in the weights. The resulting bilevel problem is converted to a mathematical program with linear equilibrium constraints, which is solved using state-of-the-art optimization methods. This approach is significantly more versatile than commonly used grid search procedures, enabling, in particular, the use of models with many hyper-parameters. Numerical results demonstrate the practicality of this approach for model selection in machine learning.	[Kunapuli, G.; Bennett, K.

However, the training complexity of SVM is highly dependent on the size of a data set. A cluster Support Vector Machines (C-SVM) method for large-scale data set classification is presented to accelerate the training speed. By calculating cluster mirror radius ratio and representative sample selection in each cluster, the original training data set can be reduced remarkably without losing the classification information.

Feature Selection and Policy Optimization for Distributed Instruction Placement Using Reinforcement Learning	PACT'08: PROCEEDINGS OF THE SEVENTEENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PARALLEL ARCHITECTURES AND COMPILATION TECHNIQUES			English	Proceedings Paper	17th International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques	OCT 25-29, 2008	Toronto, CANADA	ACM SIGARCH, IEEE CS TCCA, IFIP, IEEE CS TCCP		Instruction Scheduling; Machine Learning; Genetic Algorithms; Neural Networks; Compiler Heuristics	NEURAL-NETWORKS	Communication overheads are one of the fundamental challenges in a multiprocessor system. As the number of processors on a chip increases, communication overheads and the distribution of computation and data become increasingly important performance factors. Explicit Dataflow Graph Execution (EDGE) processors, in which instructions communicate with one another directly on a distributed substrate, give the compiler control over communication overheads at a fine granularity. Prior work shows that compilers can effectively reduce fine-grained communication overheads in EDGE architectures using a spatial instruction placement algorithm with a heuristic-based cost function. While this algorithm is effective, the cost function must be painstakingly tuned. Heuristics tuned to perform well across a variety of applications leave users with little ability to tune performance-critical applications, yet we find that the best placement heuristics vary significantly with the application. First, we suggest a systematic feature selection method that reduces the feature set size based on the extent to which features affect performance. To automatically discover placement heuristics, we then use these features as input to a reinforcement learning technique, called Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), that uses a genetic algorithm to evolve neural networks. We show that NEAT outperforms simulated annealing, the most commonly used optimization technique for instruction placement. We use NEAT to learn general heuristics that are as effective as hand-tuned heuristics, but we find that improving over highly hand-tuned general heuristics is difficult. We then suggest a hierarchical approach to machine learning that classifies segments of code with similar characteristics and learns heuristics for these classes. This approach performs closer to the specialized heuristics. Together, these results suggest that learning compiler heuristics may benefit from both improved feature selection and classification.

'Human readable' models are often necessary to enable understanding, potentially leading to further insight, and also inducing trust in the user. Rules, or decision trees (if not too numerous or large) are readable, unlike, for example SVM models. However, descriptiveness and accuracy normally conflict; a challenge is to find algorithms that have both high accuracy and high readability. We introduce ORGA (Optimized Ripper using Genetic Algorithm) which hybridizes evolutionary search with the RIPPER ruleset algorithm. RIPPER is effective at producing accurate and readable rulesets, and we show that ORGA provides significant further improvement. ORGA outperforms of RIPPER, C4.5 and PART. On a majority of the datasets, ORGA's outperformance of the other algorithms is spectacular, and it is rarely dominated in terms of both accuracy and readability.

Unfortunately, user feedback often suffers from sparsity and possible inconsistencies. Here we present an algorithm that exploits feedback for learning only when it is consistent. The user provides feedback on a small subset of the data. Based on the data representation alone, our algorithm employs a statistical criterion to trigger learning when user feedback is significantly different from random. We evaluate our algorithm in a challenging audio classification task with relevance to hearing aid applications. By restricting learning to an informative subset, our algorithm substantially improves the performance of a recently introduced classification algorithm.

However, due to the presence of surface scanning noise, accumulative registration errors, and improper data fusion, reconstructed object surfaces using range images captured from multiple viewpoints are often distorted with thick patches, false connections, blurred features and artefacts. Moreover, the existing integration methods are often expensive in the sense of both computational time and data storage. These shortcomings limit the wide applications of 3D modelling using the latest laser scanning systems. In this paper, the k-means clustering approach (from the pattern recognition and machine learning literatures) is employed to minimize the integration error and to optimize the fused point locations. To initialize the clustering approach, an automatic method is developed, shifting points in the overlapping areas between neighbouring views towards each other, so that the initialized cluster centroids are in between the two overlapping surfaces. This results in more efficient and effective integration of data. While the overlapping areas were initially detected using a single distance threshold, they are then refined using the k-means clustering method. For more accurate integration results, a weighting scheme reflecting the imaging principle is developed to integrate the corresponding points in the overlapping areas. The fused point set is finally triangulated using an improved Delaunay method, guaranteeing a watertight surface. A comparative study based on real images shows that the proposed algorithm is efficient in the sense of either running time or memory usage and reduces significantly the integration error, while desirably retaining geometric details of 3D object surfaces of interest.

We have developed a classification rule generator using the information about wild-type, mutant, three neighboring residues and experimentally observed stability data. Utilizing the rules, we have developed a method based on decision tree for discriminating the stabilizing and destabilizing mutants and predicting protein stability changes upon single point mutations, which showed an accuracy of 82% and a correlation of 0.70, respectively. In addition, we have systematically analyzed the characteristic features of amino acid residues in 3075 mesophilic and 1609 thermophilic proteins belonging to 9 and 15 families, respectively, and developed methods for discriminating them.

Determining whether a protein contains a, SUMOylation site or not thus provides essential clues about a substrate's intra-nuclear spatial association and function. Previous SUMOylation predictors are largely based on a degenerate and functionally unreliable consensus motif description, not rendering satisfactory accuracy to confidently map the extent of this essential class of regulatory modifications. This paper embarks on an exploration of predictive dependencies among SUMOylation site amino acids, non-local and structural properties (including secondary structure, solvent accessibility and evolutionary profiles). An extensive examination of two main machine learning paradigms, Support-Vector-Machine and Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks, demonstrates that (I) with careful attention to generalization issues both methods achieve comparable performance and, that (2) local features enable best generalization, with structural features having little to no impact. The predictive model for SUMOylation sites based on the primary protein sequence achieves an area tinder the ROC of 0.92 using 5-fold cross-validation, and 96% accuracy on an independent hold-out test set. However, similar to other predictors, the new predictor is unable to generalize beyond the simple consensus motif.

In particular, it is a challenge to predict beta-sheet structures since they range over several discontinuous regions in an amino acid sequence. In this paper, we propose a dynamic programming algorithm for some kind of antiparallel beta-sheet, where the proposed approach can be extended for more general classes of beta-sheets. Experimental results for real data show that our prediction algorithm has good performance in accuracy. We also show a relation between the proposed algorithm and a grammar-based method. Furthermore, we prove that prediction of planar beta-sheet structures is NP-hard.

One of them is classification of genomic and proteomic data that is known as a problem with extremely high dimensionality and therefore demands suited classification techniques. In this domain they are usually combined with gene selection techniques to provide optimal classification accuracy rates. Another reason for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets is their interpretability. It is much easier to interpret a small set of ranked genes than 20 or 30 thousands of unordered genes. In this paper we present a classification ensemble of decision trees called Rotation Forest and evaluate its classification performance on small subsets of ranked genes for 14 genomic and proteomic classification problems. An important feature of Rotation Forest is demonstrated - i.e. robustness and high classification accuracy using small sets of genes.

Transcription factor (TF) binding to a specific DNA sequence depends on at least two factors: A protein-level DNA-binding domain and a nucleotide-level specific sequence serving as a TF binding site. TFs have been classified into families based on these factors. TFs within each family bind to specific nucleotide sequences in a very similar fashion. Identification of the TF family that might bind at a particular nucleotide sequence requires a machine learning approach. Here we considered two sets of features based on DNA sequences and their physicochemical properties and applied a one-versus-all SVM (OVA-SVM) with class-wise optimized features to identify TF family-specific features in DNA sequences. Using this approach, a mean prediction accuracy of similar to 80% was achieved, which represents an improvement of similar to 7% over previous approaches on the same data.

J	Waegeman, W; De Baets, B; Boullart, L				Waegeman, Willem; De Baets, Bernard; Boullart, Luc			ROC analysis in ordinal regression learning	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						ROC analysis; ranking; ordinal regression; unbalanced learning problems; performance measures; machine learning	CURVE; AREA	Nowadays the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, which corresponds to the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test statistic, is increasingly used as a performance measure for binary classification systems. In this article we present a natural generalization of this concept for more than two ordered categories, a setting known as ordinal regression. Our extension of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic now corresponds to the volume under an r-dimensional surface (VUS) for r ordered categories and differs from extensions recently proposed for multi-class classification. VUS rather evaluates the ranking returned by an ordinal regression model instead of measuring the error rate, a way of thinking which has especially advantages with skew class or cost distributions. We give theoretical and experimental evidence of the advantages and different behavior of VUS compared to error rate, mean absolute error and other ranking-based performance measures for ordinal regression. The results demonstrate that the models produced by ordinal regression algorithms minimizing the error rate or a preference learning based loss, not necessarily impose a good ranking on the data.

By monitoring soil, crop and climate in a field and providing a decision Support system that is able to learn, it is possible to deliver treatments, such as irrigation, fertilizer and pesticide application, for specific parts of a field in real time and proactively. In this context, we have applied machine learning techniques to automatically extract new knowledge in the form of generalized decision rules towards the best administration of natural resources like water. The machine learning application model suggested in this paper is based oil ail inductive and iterative process of discovering knowledge oil the basis of which, patterns and associations having arisen initially are re-examined to expand the pre-existing knowledge. The result of this study was the creation of ail effective set of decision rules used to predict the plants' state and the prevention of unpleasant impacts front the water stress in plains.

The proposed model can distinguish problematic from non-problematic calls after only five caller turns with an accuracy of over 90%. Based on a corpus of more than 69,000 dialogs we further employ the classifier's decision to given business models and present the cost savings that can be achieved by deploying classification techniques to Interactive Voice Response systems.

Combining Machine Learning and Domain Knowledge in Modular Modelling	PRACTICAL HYDROINFORMATICS: COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN WATER APPLICATIONS	Water Science and Technology Library		English	Proceedings Paper	General Assembly of the European-Union-of-Geosciences	APR 24-29, 2005	Vienna, AUSTRIA	European Geosci Union		Local models; modular models; committees; neural networks; flood forecasting	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; RIVER; UNCERTAINTY; FORECASTS; SYSTEM; TREES	Data-driven models based on the methods of machine learning have proven to be accurate tools in predicting various natural phenomena. Their accuracy, however, can be increased if several learning models are combined. A modular model is comprised of a set of specialized models each of which is responsible for particular sub-processes or situations, and may be trained on a subset of the training set. This paper presents the typology of such models and refers to a number of approaches to build them. An issue of combining machine learning with domain expert knowledge is discussed, and new approaches are presented.

Many interesting and useful details about the process of precipitation interception by the forest in the Dragonja River basin were found. The resulting classification and regression tree models clearly show the degree of influence and interactions between different climatic factors, which importantly influence the process of precipitation interception.

In the recent literature, corresponding problems appear in various guises. After a brief overview of the field, this work focuses on a particular learning scenario called label ranking, where the problem is to learn a mapping from instances to rankings over a finite number of labels. Our approach for learning such a ranking function, called ranking by pairwise comparison (RPC), first induces a binary preference relation from suitable training data, using a natural extension of pairwise classification. A ranking is then derived from this relation by means of a ranking procedure. This paper elaborates on a key advantage of such an approach, namely the fact that our learner can be adapted to different loss functions by using different ranking procedures on the same underlying order relations. In particular, the Spearman rank correlation is minimized by using a simple weighted voting procedure. Moreover, we discuss a loss function suitable for settings where candidate labels must be tested successively until a target label is found. In this context, we propose the idea of "empirical conditioning" of class probabilities. A related ranking procedure, called "ranking through iterated choice", is investigated experimentally.

Yet, when collecting all these past experiments in experiment; databases, they call readily be reused for additional and possibly much broader investigation. In this paper, we make use of such a database to answer various interesting research questions about learning algorithms and to verify a number of recent studies. Alongside performing elaborate comparisons of algorithms, we also investigate the effects of algorithm parameters and data, properties, and seek deeper insights into the behavior of learning algorithms by studying their learning curves and bias-variance profiles.

A feature can be a simple attribute-value test or a test of the validity of a complex domain knowledge relationship. Most existing concept learning systems generate features in the rule construction process. However, the separation of feature generation and rule construction processes has several theoretical and practical advantages. In particular, the proposed transformation from the attribute to the feature space motivates a novel, theoretically justified procedure for handling of unknown attribute values. This approach suggests also a novel procedure for handling imprecision of numerical attributes. The possibility of controlling the expected imprecision of numerical attributes during the induction process is a novel machine learning concept which has a high application potential for solving real world problems.

Learning systems tend to be biased towards the majority class and thus have poor performance in classifying the minority class instances. This paper analyzes the imbalance problem in accuracy-based learning classifier system XCS. XCS has shown excellent performance on some data mining tasks, but as other classifiers, it also performs poorly on imbalance data problems. We analyze XCS's behavior on various imbalance levels and propose an appropriate parameter tuning to improve performance of the system. Particularly, XCS is adapted to eliminate over-general classifiers(1) and protect accurate classifiers of minority class. Experimental results in Boolean function problems show that. with proposal adaptations, XCS is robust to class imbalance.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of enabling multiple parties to perform model selection on their distributed data in a privacy-preserving fashion without revealing their data to each other. We specifically study cross validation, a standard method of model selection, in the setting in which two parties hold a vertically partitioned database. For a specific kind of vertical partitioning, we show how the participants can carry out privacy-preserving cross validation in order to select among a number of candidate models without revealing their data to each other.

The classic form of ROC curve is applicable only to the two-state classification. Nevertheless, it covers a broad spectrum of applications (clinical diagnostics in medicine, computational linguistics, machine learning, data mining, etc.) In this contribution we will derive a test of equivalence of two ROC curves in biexponential ROC model for unpaired design of data. The result will be illustrated on real data coming from a sociological research.

A method that can accurately predict corporate rating is greatly needed and good prediction techniques can help to rate corporate more accurately. One powerful classifier, the support vector machine (SVM), was successfully applied to a wide range of domains. In recent years, researchers have applied the SVM-based in the corporate rating, and the results have been shown it to be effective. In this study, SVM and a new classifier, clustering-launched classification (CLC), were employed to the corporate rating. The advantages of using CLC are that It can classify data efficiently and only need one parameter needs to be decided. In Substance, the results show that CLC is better than SVM. Therefore, CLC is an effective tool to the corporate rating.

Other proposed circuits include simple current mirrors and log-domain filters. Neither resistors nor amplifiers are employed. Therefore it is suitable for large-scale neural network implementations. We show the measurement results of the bump circuit and verify the resulting analog signal processing system on the transistor level by using a SPICE simulator. The same approach can also be applied to the support vector regression. With these analog signal processing techniques, a low-power adaptive analog system without any analog-to-digital convertor but with the capability of learning, classifying, and regressing becomes feasible.

Current algorithms that emerge from CANDECOW or PARAFAC formalisms rely on the basic definition of tensor decomposition that describes rank as the minimum number of vectors that are needed to reconstruct the tensor using outer product linear combinations, which is an extension of the same property of matrix rank. In this paper, we reinterpret the orthogonality condition of symmetric matrix eigenvectors as a geometric constraint on the coordinate frame formed by the eigenvectors and relaxing the orthogonality, we develop a set of structured-bases that can be utilized to decompose any symmetric tensor into its sum-of-rank-one (canonical) decomposition. The eigenvectors of order-p tensors are observed to form a frame where the angle between various pairs of eigenvectors are integer multiples of pi/p.

Conventional methods including linear discriminant analysis, K-means clustering and BP-neural network flaw in capture the nonlinear structure. The use of support vector machine (SVM) has been shown to be a cost-effective technique, But it is used as a non-preprocessing way for a classification task. This paper extended SVM with kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) for extract valuable discriminatory information. The method is then applied to classify tobacco leaves quality of the Wulong country, one of the most important tobacco planting areas of Chongqing. The classification performance of the proposed method is proven superior compared with other statistical and machine learning methods.

This paper proposed a new fast parallel classification method for imbalanced classes. Considering imbalanced distributions, the approach adopted a fast simple classifier with less features input working parallel with a complicated one. Most samples would be correctly recognized by the first classifier, and the second relatively slower classifier could be ended. The second one was only trained and worked for less difficult samples. Experimental results in machine vision quality inspection showed that the approach could effectively improve classification speed and decrease total risk for imbalanced classes' classification.

The paper discusses why classical mathematical logic, its various classical conservative extensions, and its non-classical alternatives are not suitable candidates for the right fundamental logic to underlie knowledge discovery / machine learning, and shows that strong relevant logic is a more hopeful candidate for the purpose.

At present, there are many algorithms of generating decision tree, but when the database which we rely on exists noise, high quality knowledge is hard to obtain by ID3 algorithm. In this paper, we propose the data mining method based on second learning in case of ID3 algorithm, and analyze the performance of our method by a concrete database. Theory analysis and simulation indicate that this method posses the feature of strong operability, and it can improve the reliability of obtained knowledge.

Our empirical evaluation shows that, when time constraints are present, our algorithm outperforms other similar strategies.

This paper proposed a new feature selection method for classification, named SD, which is based on scatter matrix used in linear discriminant analysis. The main feature of SD is its simplicity and independency of learning algorithms. High-dimensional data samples are first projected into a lower dimensional subspace of the original feature space by means of a linear transformation matrix, which can be attained according to the scatter degree of each feature, and then the scatter degree is used to measure the importance of each feature. A comparison of SD and some popular feature selection methods (information gain and X-2-test) is conducted, and the results of experiment carried out on 19 data sets show the advantages of SD.

In this paper we present a method of training virtual human that bridges the gap between designing and building of a virtual human's action as well as its autonomous learning ability to adapt a certain task. With our approach, we integrate reinforcement learning to the action of virtual human's path planning to achieve fast policy acquisition. The result of the approach is illustrated in the case of successfully instructing virtual human to cross a terrain with pyramid and a number of obstacles to reach a certain target.

This paper addresses the importance of reliability and confidence for classification, and presents a novel method based on a combination of the unexcelled ensemble method, random forest (RF), and transductive confidence machine (TCM) which we call TCM-RF. The new algorithm hedges the predictions of RF and gives a well-calibrated region prediction by using the proximity matrix generated with RF as a nonconformity measure of examples. The new method takes advantage of RF and possesses a more precise and robust nonconformity measure. It can deal with redundant and noisy data with mixed types of variables, and is less sensitive to parameter settings. Experiments on benchmark datasets show it is more effective and robust than other TCMs. Further stud), on a real-world lymphoma microarray dataset shows its superiority over SVM with the ability of controlling the risk of error.

Recently, the ranking methods based on machine learning approaches, called learning to rank, become the focus for researchers and practitioners. The main idea of these methods is to apply the various existing and effective algorithms on machine learning to ranking. However, as a learning problem, ranking is different from other classical ones such as classification and regression. In this paper, we investigate the important papers in this direction; the cons and pros of the recent-proposed framework and algorithms for ranking are analyzed, and the relationships among them are discussed. Finally, the promising directions in practice are also pointed out.

As a powerful machine learning approach for function approximation and regression estimation problems, support vector regression (SNIR) is known to have good generalization ability. In this paper, we adopt the FCM clustering algorithm to group data patterns into clusters, after FCNI clustering, the membership grade are applied to generate fuzzy kernel. Then, the support vector learning with fuzzy kernel provides a fuzzy IF-THEN rules architecture. In terms of fuzzy rules, the overall fuzzy inference system can be calculated by weighting the inferred output values from each cluster with their corresponding membership values. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve good approximation performance.

But in the aspect of discrimination domain and non-domain text category, domain knowledge relations haven't been taken account of in these methods. A domain text classification model was presented in this paper. This model used the support vector machine learning algorithm, gained domain classification feature words through statistic and union domain words, structured domain classification feature space. With the help of domain knowledge relations, computed relevance between domain concepts, got domain classification feature weight. Finally domain text classification was realized. An experiment in the Yunnan tourism domain was carried on to confirm that domain knowledge relations have a good influence on the domain text classification. The classification accuracy rate has been increased 0.04 than improved TFIDF method.

This paper uses the pruning scheme to optimize neural network structure. The genetic algorithm is used to rind out (he optimum node pruning. In the conventional researches, the input and hidden layers were optimized separately. On the contrary we attempted to optimize the two layers simultaneously by encoding two layers in a chromosome. The offspring networks inherit the weights from the parent. For learning, we used the existing error back-propagation algorithm. In our experiment with various databases from UCI Machine Learning Repository, we could get the peak performance when the network size was reduced by about 8-25%. As a result of t-test the proposed method was shown to have a better performance, compared with other pruning or construction methods.

This paper also integrates a multi-preprocessing sequence to develop the classification system which contains features generated from an image dataset including steganographic and clean images, feature ranking and selection, feature extraction, and data standardization. Neural networks using radial basis functions train the classifier to accomplish the decision making progress. The analyzed image is labeled as either a steganographic or a clean image. The computer simulations have shown that classification accuracy increases by 40% when using feature preprocessing within the complete detection system over a system without feature preprocessing. In addition, alpha-trimmed mean (including mean and median) statistics approach results in higher classification accuracy.	[Chen, Mei-Ching; Agaian, Sos S.; Chen, C. L.

Although for a large number of animals' miRNAs have been defined, only a few targets have been known. Here we present a naive microRNA target prediction algorithm based on machine learning approach. SVM was used twice in our algorithm in order to make prediction for binding site and mRNA respectively. In order to avoid the loss of sensitivity, a set of seed match rules were defined base on observing experimentally validated targets to locate potential sites in 3'UTR sequences. TarBase and microarray data were used to build up database for training and evaluation of our algorithm. TargetScan and miRanda were implemented for comparison. The result shows that the performance of our algorithm is better than TargetScan and miRanda.

TAPs are used in a learning framework to enable inter-agent adaptation in team-based games but suffer from the curse of dimensionality when team size increases. This paper presents TAPIR, the improved adaptation framework which introduces a dimension reduction mechanism that provides a fast convergence rate to enable a wider applicability to larger agent teams as well as produce better adaptation performance. The TAPIR based learning framework is implemented in an RPG scenario which is shown to outperform the previous framework in a setting with large team sizes. An analysis of execution times is also performed which shows that actual adaptation time is almost constant with increasing number of agents.

The main challenge in video retrieval remains bridging the semantic gap. Thus, the effectiveness or video retrieval is based on the result of the interaction between query selection and a goal-oriented human user. The system exploits the human capability for rapidly scanning imagery augmenting it with an active learning loop, which tries to always present the most relevant material based on the current information. We describe in this paper, a machine learning system for interactive video retrieval. The core of this system is a kernel-based SVM classifier. The video retrieval uses the core as an active learning classifier. We perform an experiment against the 2005 NIST TRECVID benchmark in the high-level task.

Decision-tree is one of the well-known data mining methods that are used in classification problems. But sometimes the data set for classification contains vectors missing one or more of the feature values, and is called as incomplete data. Generally, the existence of incomplete data will degrade the learning quality of classification models. If the incomplete data can be dealt well, the classifier can be used to real life applications. So handling incomplete data is important and necessary for building a high quality classification model. In this paper a new decision tree is proposed to solve the incomplete data classification problem and it has a very good performance. At the same time, the new method solves two other important problems: rule refinement problem and importance preference problem, which ensures the outstanding advantages of the proposed approach. Significantly, this is the first classifier which can deal with all these problems at the same time.

Financial data have been widely used by researchers to predict financial crisis, but few studies exploit the use of non-financial indicators in corporate governance to construct financial crisis prediction model. This article introduces a prediction model based on a relatively new machine learning technique, support vector machines (SVM) with XBRL financial reporting. This study indicates that the prediction model considering both financial and non-financial information outperforms those models based on only one type of information. Two well-known prediction models, regression model and genetic algorithm, are compared with SVM.

Machine learning or data mining methods can identify new or unknown malicious executables with some degree of success. Feature selection is a key to apply data mining or machine learning to successfully detect malicious executables. We propose a method to extract features which are most representative of viral properties. We show that our classifier, based on strings, achieves high detection rates and can be expected to perform as well in real-world conditions.

Standard machine learning techniques like support vector machines(SVM) and related large margin methods have been successfully applied for this task. Unfortunately, the high dimensionality of input feature vectors impacts on the classification speed The kernel parameters setting for SVM in a training process impacts on the classification accuracy. Feature selection is another factor that impacts classification accuracy. The objective of this work is to reduce the dimension of feature vectors, optimizing the parameters to improve the SVM classification accuracy and speed In order to improve classification speed we spent rough sets theory to reduce the feature vector space. We present a genetic algorithm approach for feature selection and parameters optimization to improve classification accuracy. Experimental results indicate our method is more effective than traditional SVM methods and other traditional methods.

We use the information extracted from the cluster analysis to identify customer calling patterns. Customers calling patterns are then given to a classification algorithm to generate a classifier model for predicting the calling communities of a customer. We apply two different classification methods: Support vector machine and fuzzy-genetic classifier. The latter method is used for possibly assigning a customer to different classes with different degrees of membership. The reported test results demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

However, testing for, specs such as EVM incurs significant test time due to the large numbers of symbols that need to be transmitted. In our approach, EVM is modeled as a Junction of the system static non-idealities (IQ mismatch, gain, IIP3 parameters) and dynamic non-idealities (VCO phase noise). Using a multi-tone test stimulus, the static and dynamic non-idealities are estimated first. The data generated is used to predict EVM using machine learning methods with high accuracy while incurring minimal test time.

A number of genes in a mammal are regulated developmental-specifically or tissue-specifically by the methylation. Mammalian DNA methylation contributes to regulation of gene expression, repression of parasitic sequences, inactivation of X chromosome in female, genomic imprinting, etc. Aberrant methylation results in a cancer or a part of genetic diseases in human. Therefore it is required that methylation status on human genome is comprehensively revealed in each kind of cells. However, since comprehensive methylation analyses require a lot of times and large labor, methylation status on only a part of genomic regions is revealed in mammals. Because of this, machine learning using already known methylation data and prediction of methylation status on other genomic regions are important. Moreover, since sequence differences between unmethylated and methylated DNA regions also remain unclear, those differences should be also determined. Therefore we conducted machine learning by support vector machine using our previously reported methylation data, and predicted methylation status on DNA sequences from DNA sequence features. Furthermore we explored different sequence features between unmethylated and methylated DNA sequences using random forest.

Aiming at improving users' conceptual understanding of course material, a navigation structure was built among concepts, and each concept is presumed to have at least one concept instance which is provided by a web answer system based on natural language which was integrated in this system. Then users would browse through the linked resources under those particular concepts as well as related concepts and get a better understanding of the material in the course. The kernel of such function was a domain knowledge base which was composed of concepts and relationship between them. Ontology was introduced as a mechanism to guide the establishment of this base. At last, a method of extracting concepts and relationship between them by using machine learning algorithms were presented.

So is data mining - time and hardware resources consuming process of building analytical models of data. Authors propose methodology of combining local analytical models (build parallely in nodes of distributed computer system) into a global one without necessary to construct distributed version of data mining algorithm. Basic assumptions for proposed solution is (i) a complete horizontal data fragmentation and (ii) a model form understood for human being. All steps of combining methodology are presented with classification model example inform of a rule set.

We present a new base classifier that utilizes Oblique Decision Tree technology based on Support Vector Machines for the construction or oblique (non-axis parallel) tests on the nodes of the decision tree inducted. We describe a number of heuristic techniques for enhancing the tree construction process by better estimation of the gain obtained by an oblique split at any tree node. We then show how embedding the new classifier in an ensemble of classifiers using the classical Hedge(beta) algorithm boosts performance of the system. Testing 10-fold cross validation on UCI machine learning repository data sets shows that the new hybrid classifiers outperforms on average by more than 2.1% both the WEKA implementation or C4.5 (J48) and the SMO implementation of SVM in WEKA. The application of the particular ensemble algorithm is an excellent fit for online-learning applications where one seeks to improve performance of self-healing dependable computing systems based on reconfiguration by gradually and adaptively learning what constitutes good system configurations.

This method, based on machine learning, maps nonlinearly patterns in input space into a higher-dimensional feature space by kernel functions, then performs PCA in feature space to realize pattern denoising. The key difficulty for this method is to seek the pre-image or an approximate pre-image in input space corresponding to the pattern after denoising in feature space. This paper proposes to utilize particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms to find pre-images in input space. Some nearest training patterns from the pre-image are selected as the initial group of PSO, then PSO algorithm performs an iterative process to find the pre-image or a best approximate pre-image. Experimental results based on the USPS dataset show that our proposed method outperforms some traditional techniques. Additionally, the PSO-based method is straightforward to understand, and is also easy to realize.

In this paper, we propose a content-based semantic indexing method which annotates images automatically using concepts and textual description. In order to bridge the "semantic gap" between the low-level descriptors and the high-level semantic concepts of an image, we introduce a 3-level pyramid and combine the color, texture and edge features for each level. Fuzzy Support Vector Machine (FSVM) is employed for building the concept model and calculates the likelihood of an image to a model. We index the images with concepts according to the likelihood between an image and the concept model. Experiments show that our method has good accuracy in semantic indexing of images.

This paper puts forward a novel algorithm to detect soccer highlights, which is made up of three phases. In the first stage, slow motion replay segments are located through the analysis of visual rhythm and the structure tensor histogram; In the second stage, we concentrate on the detection of the goal net according to its edge projection in the vertical direction; In the end, a set of heuristic rules are employed to identify the goal shots or near-miss shots from the soccer video based on the recognition result of the previous stage. Experimental results show that our method is effective and efficient.

For the first time, this paper proposed a way using computer image processing and pattern recognition for beauty assessment, and proposed a method based on the beauty-related feature points and the smoothness of the face skin. And by using the method of machine learning and pattern recognition, the paper formulates a standard to evaluate the beauty. The evaluation system proves to be simple, feasible and objective with regard to various testing samples.

Some journals divide an abstract into several sections so that readers can easily identifiy those parts, but others do not. We propose a method that can automatically identify the result and conclusion sections of any biomedical abstracts by formulating this identification problem as a sequence labeling task. Three feature sets (Position, Named Entity, and Word Frequency) are employed with Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) as the underlying machine learning model. Experimental results show that the combination of our proposed feature sets can achieve F-measure, precision, and recall scores of 92.50%, 95.32% and 89.85%, respectively.	[Lin, Ryan T.

Machine learning algorithms have been successfully applied in mining data patterns. However, one of the main obstacles of applying them for design pattern detection is the difficulty of collecting training examples. Unlike other applications, a design pattern instance typically includes a group of classes with certain relationships. Thus, the possible combinations of the group of classes can be enormous which results in huge training sets making the application of machine learning algorithms impracticable. In this paper, we propose an innovative method using matrix transformations to cluster the training examples. Our method can significantly reduce the size of training examples, thus making it possible to be efficiently applied in machine learning algorithm.

Researchers have shown that for many tasks like webpage classification, image classification, and pattern recognition, combining data from multiple information sources yields significantly better results than using a single source. In these tasks each of the multiple data sources can be thought of as providing one view of the underlying object. However in many domains not all of the views are available for the available instances; some of the views would be missing. This problem of missing views affects the performance of the machine learning task. In this paper we provide a method of view completion to heuristically predict the missing views. We show that with view completion we are able to achieve significantly better results. We also show that by considering the information at a higher level in terms of views rather than considering them at a lower level in terms of features we are able to achieve better results.

One way to describe anomalies is by saying that anomalies are not concentrated. It leads to the problem of finding level sets for the data generating density. This learning problem may be converted as a binary classification problem. In this paper, we propose a new method to design RBF classifier based on multiple granularities immune network, and apply this algorithm to detection the data density level set. Experimental results on the real network data set showed that the new classifier has higher detection rate and lower false positive rate than traditional RBF classifier.

This algorithm can retain minimal attributes in the basic style of information system, i.e. reduce as many attributes as possible. That can save much time for the system's later disposal. The algorithm's lime complexity hasn't been improved, but attributes after reduction are reduced greatly. The original information system has a certain loss, but this can be accepted under a certain significance level. Lastly, the reduction strategy is compared with approximate reduction strategy by nine attributes which belong to the information system.

Because of the high dimensionality of hyperspectral data, the process of cross-validation will cost more time. For reducing the time of cross-validation and improving classification accuracy, a new combination method of improving sequential minimal optimization (SMO), independent component analysis (ICA) and mixture kernels is proposed. It can be described as follows: first use the improving SMO method to optimize the model of SVM, and then use ICA method to do dimensionality reduction before cross-validation, at last use mixture kernels to do classification of unknown samples. By the experiments, it is proved that this method can guarantee the accuracy of unknown samples classification while reducing the time of cross-validation.

However, manually creating, maintaining and utilizing a preference set is no easy task for a user, requiring continued time and effort. A more desirable approach is to implicitly build and maintain the preference set by using monitoring and learning mechanisms and apply such preferences when required on behalf of the user. This paper introduces the Daidalos Personalization and Learning system which monitors user behaviour and context to not only build and maintain dynamic preferences but also to apply them in a dynamic fashion. An example scenario is presented to demonstrate how such mechanisms are used to adapt a pervasive environment on a user's behalf.

As a first step, we analyze the packet traffic of a simulated sensor network in order to find relevant features that distinguish normal network operation from misbehaving nodes. This kind of data analysis is often missing in previous studies. Using these features acquired by the systematic data analysis we study the suitability of classical machine learning algorithms as well its bio-inspired learning algorithms for the given classification problem. We conclude which algorithms perform best in this special scenario, considering classification success and resource-friendliness of the algorithms. As result we can say that classical algorithms have equal or even better detection capabilities compared to some bio-inspired algorithms. It turns out that it is even possible to detect different levels of misbehavior with nearly 100% accuracy.

Then, it is highly desirable to assess the severity of blood loss and predict the occurrence of hemorrhagic shock (HS) from biomedical signals. In this study, Transcranial Doppler (TCD) signal is used to predict and classify the degree of severity of blood loss either as mild, moderate, and severe or as severe and non-severe. The data for this study were generated using the human simulated model of hemorrhage which is called lower body negative pressure (LBNP). The analysis is done by applying discrete wavelet transformation (DWT). The wavelet-based features are defined using the detail and approximate coefficients and machine learning algorithms. The objective of this study is to assess our methods of processing TCD signal for predicting the hemorrhagic. The results of this study show the prediction accuracy of 84.2% achieved by support vector machine for predicting severe/non-severe states.

When examples of one class greatly outnumber examples of the other class(es), traditional machine learning algorithms can perform poorly. Random undersampling is a technique that has shown great potential for alleviating the problem of class imbalance. However, undersampling leads to information loss which can hinder classification performance in some cases. To overcome this problem, repetitive undersampling techniques have been proposed. These techniques generate an ensemble of models, each trained on a different, undersampled subset of the training data. In doing so, less information is lost and classification performance is improved. In this study, we evaluate the performance of several repetitive undersampling techniques. To our knowledge, no study has so thoroughly compared repetitive undersampling techniques.

It can be obtained in a variety of techniques usually belonging with either statistical analysis or machine learning methodologies and in this latter category there is included classical rough set theory and its elements. In the paper there is presented rough set-based approach to the problem of authorship attribution that falls within the scope of automated text categorisation.

For using machine learning based approaches for any task of text mining, documents should be encoded into numerical vectors; it causes two problems: huge dimensionality and sparse distribution. Although there are various tasks of text mining such as text categorization, text clustering, and text summarization, the scope of this research is restricted to text categorization. The idea of this research is to avoid the two problems by encoding a document or documents into a table, instead of numerical vectors. Therefore, the goal of this research is to develop a scheme which is free from the two problems for categorizing on-line news article automatically.

However the samples are often imbalanced Therefore, it is a great challenge for machine learning on imbalanced data sets. In order to reduce the effects of uneven distribution of training sets on text classification performance, a series of tests for constructing even training sets are made which are separately based on random oversampling, random undersampling, directed oversampling, directed undersampling, as well as combined sampling methods. Experimental results show that re-sampling methods are effective in improving classification performance. After comparing and analyzing the effects of various re-sampling methods based on the experiments, this paper gets expressly some useful conclusions for some key issues, such as sampling methods, sampling mode, sampling numbers of text and the formulation of the sampling rules.			lyling998@163.com; Chooyexing@yahoo.cn					Chawla NV, 2004, SIGKDD EXPLORATIONS, V6, P1; FAN XH, 2006, CHINESE J COMPUTERS, V29, P6; LI YL, 2006, TEXT TENDENCY CATEGO, V27, P2194; LUO KM, 2005, THESIS ZHONGSHAN U; Sebastiani F, 2002, ACM COMPUT SURV, V34, P1, DOI 10.1145/505282.505283; [苏金树 SU JinShu], 2006, [软件学报, Journal of Software], V17, P1848, DOI 10.1360/jos171848; Tan SB, 2005, EXPERT SYST APPL, V28, P667, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2004.12.023; ZHAN L, 2006, COMPUTER ENG APPL, P145; Zheng En-hui, 2006, Journal of Zhejiang University, V40	9	0	0	PUBLISHING HOUSE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY	BEIJING	PO BOX 173 WANSHOU ROAD, BEIJING 100036, PEOPLES R CHINA		978-7-121-07437-0				2008							473	478				6	Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Industrial	Computer Science; Engineering	BIR61	WOS:000262289600066

Identifying an emerging research paradigm and monitoring changes in an existing paradigm have been a challenging task due to the scale and complexity involved. In this article, we describe a method for analyzing transient patterns of a subject domain. The co-citation network of a subject is first derived using graph-theoretical approaches as implemented in CiteSpace. The paper select the journals of ARTIF INTELL, COMPUT INTELL, MACH LEARN, MIND MACH, COMMUN ACM as the data resource. From the knowledge mapping tailored by the software CiteSpace2.1, it reveals that the Machine Learning, knowledge became the overwhelming research domain in the artificial intelligence, that the Carnegie Mellon Unversity, Maryland University, Kyoto University, Stanford Unverity, Calabria University, Vienna Technology University, are the main Institutions which have certain collaboration relationships, that J.Pearl, R.Reiter J.Mccarthy, B.Selman, JR.Quinlan, RA.

Two characteristics: trial-and-error search and delayed reward are the two most important features of reinforcement learning. RL is different from supervised learning, the kind of learning studied in most current research in machine learning, statistical pattern recognition, and artificial neural networks. A learning problem can be solved by an intelligent agent in the context of reinforcement learning. In this case, to obtain a lot of reward, a reinforcement learning agent must prefer actions that it has tried in the past and found to be effective in producing reward. In our paper we present our investigation of Q-learning (Reinforcement Learning) in the context of Virtual Learning Environment.

The goal is to find a partition S(1), ..., S(k) of {1,...n} which maximizes the quantity (k)Sigma(i,j) (Sigma((i,j)is an element of SixSj) aij)bij. We study the computational complexity of this generic clustering problem which originates in the theory of machine learning. We design a constant factor polynomial time approximation algorithm for this problem, answering a question posed by Song, Smola, Gretton and Borgwardt. In some cases we manage to compute the sharp approximation threshold for this problem assuming the Unique Games Conjecture (UGC). In particular when B is the 3 x 3 identity matrix the UGC hardness threshold of this problem is exactly 16 pi/27. We present and study a geometric conjecture of independent interest which we show would imply that the UGC threshold when B is the k x k identity matrix is 8 pi/9 (1 - 1/k) for every k >= 3.			khot@cims.nyu.edu; naor@cims.nyu.edu					Alon N, 2006, SIAM J COMPUT, V35, P787, DOI 10.1137/S0097539704441629; Alon N, 2006, INVENT MATH, V163, P499, DOI 10.1007/s00222-005-0465-9; Arora S, 2005, ANN IEEE SYMP FOUND, P206, DOI 10.1109/SFCS.2005.57; Charikar M., 2006, STOC'06.

Today's signature-based anti-viruses can detect accurately known malicious code but are very limited in detecting new malicious code. New malicious codes are being created every day, and their number is expected to increase in the coming years. Recently, machine learning methods, such as classification algorithms, were used successfully for the detection of unknown malicious code. These studies were based on a test collection with a limited size of less than 3,000 files, and the proportions of malicious and benign files in both the training and test sets were identical. These test collections do not correspond to real life conditions, in which the percentage of malicious files is significantly lower than that of the benign files. In this study we present a methodology for the detection of unknown malicious code. The executable binary code is represented by n-grams. We performed an extensive evaluation using a test collection of more than 30,000 files, in which we investigated the imbalance problem. Five levels of Malicious Files Percentage (MFP) in the training set (16.7, 33.4, 50, 66.7 and 83.4%) were used to train classifiers. 17 levels of MFP (5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 85, 87.5, 90, 92.5 and 95%) were set in the test set to represent various benign/malicious files ratio during the detection. Our evaluation results suggest that varying classification algorithms react differently to the various benign/malicious files ratio. For 10% MFP in the test set, representing real life conditions, in general the highest performance achieved for the use of less than 33.3% MFP in the training set, and in specific classifiers was above 95% of accuracy was achieved. Additionally we present a chronological evaluation, in which the dataset from 2000 to 2007 was divided to training sets and tests sets. Evaluation results show that an update in the training set is needed.

Handwriting samples from twelve native speakers of Arabic were obtained. Analyzing differences in handwriting was done by using computer algorithms for extracting features front scanned images of handwriting. Attributes characteristic of the handwriting were obtained, e.g., line separation, slant, character shapes, etc. These attributes, which are a subset of attributes used by forensic document examiners (FDEs), were used to quantitatively establish individuality by using machine learning approaches. Using global attributes of handwriting, the ability to determine the writer with a high degree of confidence was established. The work is a step towards providing scientific support for admitting handwriting evidence in court.

They are effective and well-known and their base algorithms and main ideology are published. In this paper we present a new approach for machine learning (ML) task solution based on Monotone Systems Theory, an inductive learning algorithm named by the authors as MONSIL (MONotone Systems in Inductive Learning). It has some advantages compared with several ML algorithms as rules overlapping, it can use several pruning techniques etc. The base algorithm of MONSIL usually produces more rules than other ML algorithms and it means that it is more work-consuming. We have several effective developments of MONSIL, but to understand them, we must at first present a base algorithm MONSIL. In this paper we define main terms of Monotone Systems Theory, describe a base algorithm, prove that concept description found by MONSIL is complete and consistent, explain algorithm's main steps on an example and also describe the main advantages and disadvantages of this approach.

However, with the rapid evolution of Internet applications the effectiveness of the port-based or payload-based identification approaches has been greatly diminished in recent years. And many researchers begin to turn their attentions to an alternative machine learning based method. This paper presents a novel machine learning-based classification model, which combines ensemble learning paradigm with co-training techniques. Compared to previous approaches, most of which only employed single classifier, multiple classifiers and semi-supervised learning are applied in our method and it mainly helps to overcome three shortcomings: limited flow accuracy rate, weak adaptability and huge demand of labeled training set. In this paper, statistical characteristics of IP flows are extracted from the packet level traces to establish the feature set, then the classification model is created and tested and the empirical results prove its feasibility and effectiveness.

A framework of designing and implementing a vertical spider TSearch with basic general search spider architecture and functions is also showed TSearch uses SNBC to filter HTML pages and relies on LQNBC to defect unknown travel related Web sites with high precision. The recall and the precision for the classification of texts crawled by TSearch were measured experimentally. These experiments indicate that using LQNBC and SNBC, TSearch can produce promising travel related information for search.

In this paper, an entropy-based improved k-TSP method (Ik-TSP) is proposed We calculate the entropy for each gene based on the gene expression profile, and then find the best threshold of entropy depending on LOOCV accuracy for each gene expression dataset. Finally we select key genes for each gene expression dataset according to the best threshold and use them to implement Ik-TSP method to classify the cancer. Compared to 7 cancer classifiers mentioned in this paper in 9 binary public gene expression datasets of human cancers, the Ik-TSP method achieves an average LOOCV accuracy of 95.39%, and improves 3% better than the k-TSP method. Simulated experimental results show that the proposed Ik-TSP method is applicable to classify human cancers.

Testing is now an essential phase in software development life cycle. Test execution becomes an activity in the critical path of project development. In this case, a good test execution effort estimation approach can benefit both tester managers and software projects. This paper proposes an experience-based approach for test execution effort estimation. In the approach, we characterize a test suite as a 3-dimensions vector which combines test case number, test execution complexity and its tester together. Based on the test suite execution vector model, we set up an experience database, and then a machine learning algorithm is applied to estimate efforts for given test suite vectors. We evaluate the approach through an empirical study on projects from a financial software company.

Rough set theory is a new effective tool in dealing with vagueness and uncertainty information. Attribute reduction is one of the most important concepts in rough set theory and application research. Once it gets the whole reduction set, the reasoning capability with multi attributes absent can behave well. There are few research papers on whole reduction set of knowledge system. Thus how to get the whole reduction set is worth a problem to research. In this paper, we first get the rough core, then calculate superset of rough reduction, finally get the whole really rough reduction set with back elimination. Experiment shows that the attribute reduction algorithm based on core and back elimination is effective.

Focusing on its ignorance of different effects of various translation units upon translation quality, this paper extends proper weights to different words and n-grams in the framework of BLEU. The linear regression method is adopted to capture the human perception on translation quality via word types and n-gram length. Compared with other linguistic-rich metrics based on machine learning, the proposed approach is simple and largely preserves BLEU's advantage of language independence. Experimental results indicate that this method brings a much better evaluation performance for both human translation and machine translation than original BLEU.

However, parameter-free clustering algorithms are still quite weak which makes their potential generalization to a lot of promising applications rather difficult. A parameter-free clustering algorithm based on density model is proposed in this paper. This algorithm explores in a dynamically constructed nearest neighbor graph to defect which points are of the same density model, and then agglomerates them into the same cluster. It requires neither previously nor interactively setting of pivotal parameters via range scaling and proportional criterion technique. Its overall computational complexity is O(n log n). And the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can correctly recognize the arbitrary shaped clusters.

Several step forwards have been described in the last years; however still the prediction is not enough accurate to allow a reliable reconstruction of the 3D structure from the contact map and improvements on previous result are required. Here we focus on the prediction of a specific structural class of proteins, the so-called alpha proteins since specifically for these proteins the prediction accuracy of the contact maps is still lower than those of the other classes. In this paper we address the prediction of the helical residue contacts in all-alpha proteins in order to improve the existing methods on this specific task. Using a non redundant set of 300 all-alpha proteins we achieve an accuracy of 22% and a coverage of 19%, a result that overpasses by 7 percentage points those obtained by the best performing contact map predictors, presently available.

Assess team Q-learning algorithm in a purely cooperative multi-robot task	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION 2007, VOL 9, PTS A-C: MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND CONTROL			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition	NOV 11-15, 2007	Seattle, WA	Amer Soc Mech Engineers			ROBOTS	Multi-robot systems have received more and more attentions in the robotics community in the past decade. The most important issue in this area is multi-robot coordination, which focuses on how to make multiple autonomous robots cooperate or compete with each other to complete a common task. Due to its complexity, the conventional planning-based or behavior-based approaches can not work well in multi-robot coordination, especially in a dynamic unknown environment. Therefore, machine learning is becoming a promising method to help robots work in an unknown dynamic environment and improve their performance increasingly. The Q-learning algorithm was selected by most of multi-robot researchers to accomplish the above objective because of its simplicity and low computational requirements. However, directly extending the single-agent Q-learning algorithm will violate its Markov assumption and result in a low convergence speed and failing to learn a good cooperative policy In this paper, the team Q-learning algorithm, which was originally designed for the framework of Stochastic Games (SG), is proposed to make decisions for a multi-robot purely cooperative project: Multi-robot object transportation. Firstly, the basic idea of the framework of Stochastic Games and the team Q-learning algorithm are introduced. Next, the algorithm is extended to a multi-robot object transportation task, and the implementation details are presented. Some computer simulation results are presented to demonstrate that the team Q-learning algorithm works well to make decisions for the proposed multi-robot system. Finally, effects of some parameters of team Q-learning are assessed and some interesting conclusions are drawn. In particular, the simulation results show that training is helpful for improving the performance of multi-robot decision-making, but its effect is very limited. In addition, it is also pointed out that the team Q-learning will result in a huge learning space when the robot number is bigger than ten, which indicates that a new Q-learning algorithm integrating single-agent Q-learning and Team Q-learning is urgent to be developed for multi-robot systems.

The location information is one of the most important and frequently-used contexts in ubiquitous networking. However, a system can use the changes of location to adapt its behavior such. as computation and communication, without the user intervention. In this paper we introduce a Bayesian sensor framework for solving the location estimation errors problem, in Radio Frequency identification (RFID) environments. In our model the physical properties of the signal propagation are not taken into account directly. Instead, the location estimation is regarded as machine learning problem in which the task is to model how the location estimation error is distributed indoors based on a sample of measurements collected at several known locations and stored in RFID tags. Results obtained by simulations demonstrate the suitability of the proposed model to provide high performance level in terms of accuracy and scalability.

Learning to extract these types of data is called Named Entity Recognition (NER) task. Proper named entity recognition and extraction is important to solve most problems in hot research area such as Question Answering and Summarization Systems, Information Retrieval and Information Extraction, Machine Translation, Video Annotation, Semantic Web Search and Bioinformatics. In this paper we have improved the precision in NER from text using the new proposed method that calls FSVM. In our method we have employed Support Vector Machine as one of the best machine learning algorithm for classification and contribute a new fuzzy membership function thus removing the Support Vector Machine's weakness points in NER precision and multi classification. The design of our method is a kind of One-Against-All multi classification technique to solve the traditional binary classifier in SVM.

It can be reduced to solving large-scale quadratic programming problem. The Sequential Minimal Optimisation(SMO) algorithm is the best training algorithm for SVM, it optimizes a minimal subset of just two points at each iteration. This paper proposes an improved training algorithm on the premise of the optimization problem admits an analytical solution. The improved algorithm optimizes three points at each iteration.

Different approaches are illustrated by the results obtained by their application on a large medical domain of heart failure patients. Random Forest algorithm, based on voting of manY relatively non-correlated classifiers, is accepted as the most reliable approach to attribute ranking. Additionally, it is demonstrated that rule-based machine learning algorithms can be used for feature ranking and that application of rule quality measures with different generality may be very useful for human understanding of the domain.

Synchronized chaos in geophysical fluid dynamics and in the predictive Modeling of natural systems	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL SOCIETY OF BLACK PHYSICISTS	AIP CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS		English	Proceedings Paper	Joint Annual Conference of the 30th Annual Meeting of the National-Society-of-Black-Physicists/4th Meeting of the National-Society-of-Hispanic-Physicists	FEB 21-24, 2007	Boston, MA	Nat Soc Black Phys, Nat Soc Hispanic Phys		data assimilation; chaos synchronization; parameter estimation; machine learning	TELECONNECTIONS	The ubiquitous phenomenon of synchronization among regular oscillators in Nature has been shown, in the past two decades, to extend to chaotic systems. Despite sensitive dependence on initial conditions, two chaotic systems will commonly fall into synchronized motion along their strange attractors when only some of the many degrees of freedom of one system are coupled to corresponding variables in the other. In geophysical fluid models, synchronization can mediate scale interactions, so that coupling of degrees of freedom that describe medium-scale components of the flow can result in synchronization, or partial synchronization, at all scales. Chaos synchronization has been used to interpret non-local "teleconnection" patterns in the Earth's climate system and to predict new ones. In the realm of practical meteorology, the fact that two PDE systems, conceived as "truth" and "model", respectively, can be made to synchronize when coupled at only a discrete set of points, explains how observations at a discrete set of weather stations can be sufficient for weather prediction by a synchronously coupled model. Minimizing synchronization error leads to general recipes for assimilation of observed data into a running model that systematize the treatment of nonlinearities in the dynamical equations. Equations can generally be added to adapt parameters as well as states as the model is running, so that the model "learns". The synchronization view of predictive modelling extends to any translationally-any PDE with constant coefficients, the general form of physical theories. The reliance on synchronicity as an organizing principle in Nature, alternative to causality, has philosophical roots in the collaboration of Carl Jung and Wolfgang Pauli, on the one hand, and in traditions outside of European science, on the other.

We propose algorithms based on (1) the geometric mean estimator, for all 0 < alpha <= 2, and (2) the harmonic mean estimator, only for small alpha (e.g., alpha < 0.344). Compared with the previous classical work [27], our main contributions include: The general sample complexity bound for alpha not equal 1, 2. For alpha = 1, [27] provided a nice argument based on the inverse of Cauchy density about the median, leading to a sample complexity bound, although they did not provide the constants and their proof restricted to be "small enough." For general alpha = 1, 2, however, the task becomes much more difficult. [27] provided the "conceptual promise" that the sample complexity bound similar to that for alpha = 1 should exist for general alpha, if a "non-uniform algorithm based on t-quantile" could be implemented. Such a conceptual algorithm was only for supporting the arguments in [27], not a real implementation. We consider this is one of the main problems left open in [27]. In this study, we propose a practical algorithm based on the geometric mean estimator and derive the sample complexity bound for all 0 < alpha <= 2. The practical and optimal algorithm for alpha = 0+ The l(0) norm is an important case. Stable random projections can provide an approximation to the l(0) norm using alpha -> 0+. We provide an algorithm based on the harmonic mean estimator, which is simple and statistically optimal. Its tail bounds are sharper than the bounds derived based on the geometric mean. We also discover a (possibly surprising) fact: in boolean data, stable random projections using alpha = 0+ with the harmonic mean estimator will be about twice as accurate as (l(2)) normal random projections. Because high-dimensional boolean data are common, we expect this fact will be practically quite useful. The precise theoretical analysis and practical implications We provide the precise constants in the tail bounds for both the geometric mean and harmonic mean estimators. We also provide the variances (either exact or asymptotic) for the proposed estimators. These results can assist practitioners to choose sample sizes accurately.

We focus on a game-theoretic regression learning setting where private information is elicited from multiple agents with different, possibly conflicting, views on how to label the points of an input space. This conflict potentially gives rise to untruthfulness on the part of the agents. In the restricted but important case when every agent cares about a single point, and under mild assumptions, we show that agents are motivated to tell the truth. In a more general setting, we study the power and limitations of mechanisms without payments. We finally establish that, in the general setting, the VCG mechanism goes a long way in guaranteeing truthfulness and economic efficiency.

Coresets, Sparse Greedy Approximation, and the Frank-Wolfe Algorithm	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NINETEENTH ANNUAL ACM-SIAM SYMPOSIUM ON DISCRETE ALGORITHMS			English	Proceedings Paper	19th ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms	JAN 20-22, 2008	San Francisco, CA	ACM SIGACT, SIAM			VECTOR MACHINES; SETS	The problem of maximizing a concave function f(x) in a simplex S can be solved approximately by a. simple greedy algoritlun. For given k, the algorithm can find a point x(k) on a k-dimensional face of S, such that f(x(k)) >= f (x*) 0(1/k). Here f(x) is the maximum value of f in S. This algorithm and analysis were known before, and related to problems of statistics and machine learning, such as boosting, regression, and density mixture estimation. In other work, coming from computational geometry, the existence of epsilon-eoresets was shown for the minimum enclosing ball problem, by means of a simple greedy algorithm. Similar greedy algorithms, that are special cases of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, were described for other enclosure problems. Here these results are tied together, stronger convergence results are reviewed, and several coreset bounds are generalized or strengthened.

The central challenge of computational advertising is to find the "best match" between a given user in a given context and a suitable advertisement. The context could be a user entering a query in a search engine ("sponsored search"), a user reading a web page ("content match" and "display ads"), a user watching a movie on a portable device, and so on. The information about the user can vary from scarily detailed to practically nil. The number of potential advertisements might be in the billions. Thus, depending on the definition of "best match" this challenge leads to a variety of massive optimization and search problems, with complicated constraints.									0	1	1	SIAM	PHILADELPHIA	3600 UNIV CITY SCIENCE CENTER, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19104-2688 USA		978-0-898716-47-4				2008							992	992				1	Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematics, Applied	Computer Science; Mathematics	BQR16	WOS:000281596900108

The approach is based on rough set theory and support vector machine, which is derived from statistical learning theory. Statistical learning theory is designed to solve small sample learning problems, so the approach is suitable for small and medium-sized businesses. Firstly, an attribute reduction algorithm based on rough set is adopted to find out key attributes which affect employee performance. Then a support vector machine classifier that supports decision making for personnel selection is built with key attributes. The experiment results show that the new approach obtains a better accuracy than some existing ones in small sample situation.

Traditional supply chains must change to adaptive supply networks. It is very important to deeply investigate the characters of adaptive supply networks including modelling, analysis and optimization. A modelling framework for adaptive supply networks is proposed based on the complex adaptive system theory. The supply chain dynamic configuration problem is studied under this framework. Simulation results show the validity of the method.

And in Support Vector Machine (SVM), the characteristics of kernels have great impacts on learning and predictive results of SVM. In this paper, considering the characteristics for fitting and generalization of two kinds of typical kernels-global kernel (polynomial kernel) and local kernel (RBF kernel), a kind of SVM modeling method based on mixtures of kernels was proposed. And a hybrid optimization method based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was used to obtain the optimal feature subset and automatically tune parameters in SVM. Both of the problems can be considered as a combination optimization problem. In the evolution, the suitable feature subset and optimal parameters were obtained simultaneously by optimizing the prediction performance of SVM. This method has been applied in a real time series prediction, the results show that the SVM with mixtures of kernels has a better performance than with a single kernel, and to the same kernel, the model with feature selection has a better performance of generalization and higher rate of convergence than with full features.

Many algorithms have been developed in the Machine Learning, Statistical Data Mining, and Pattern Classification communities that perform such tasks with remarkable accuracy. Many of these algorithms, however, when implemented in software, suffer poor frame rates due to the amount and complexity of the computation involved This paper presents an FPGA friendly implementation of a Gaussian Radial Basis SVM well suited to classification of grayscale images. We identify a novel optimization of the SVM formulation that dramatically reduces the computational inefficiency of the algorithm. The implementation achieves 88.6% detection accuracy in gender classification which is to the same degree of accuracy of software implementations using the same classification mechanism.

Ivakhnenko is an evolutionary machine learning algorithm, which allows selecting a model of optimal complexity that describes or explains a limited number of observation data when any a priori information is absent or is highly insufficient. In this paper, we study the performance of IMMSO to reveal it model in a given class with different volumes of data, contributions of class with clef unaccounted components, and levels of noise. As a simple case study we consider artificial observation data: the sum of a quadratic parabola and cosine; model class under consideration is a polynomial series. The results are interpreted in the terms of signal-noise ratio.

We develop approaches for this well known problem based on two machine learning algorithms: Weighted Majority of Warmuth and Littlestone, and Follow the Perturbed Leader of Kalai and Vempala. With some modified analysis, it isn't hard to show theoretical bounds for our modified versions of these algorithms. More importantly, we test the algorithms in a variety of simulated conditions, and compare the results to those given by traditional stochastic approaches which assume more information about the demands than is typically known. Our tests indicate that such online learning algorithms can perform well in comparison to stochastic approaches even when the stochastic approaches are given perfect information.

Passive RFID tag position greatly influences RFID tag detection by the RFID reader antenna. In this paper, we propose a method for a carton box object on a wooden pallet by an experimental approach based on tag signal strength, and propose a method for predicting detection directly related to the strength of tag signal using an intelligent machine learning technique called support vector machine. The proposed intelligent method is capable of saving time and costs by quick prediction of tag detection. Experiment shows that the proposed approach predicts tag recognition for a carton box object as accurately as around 95% for various reader heights and read field length values. The proposed approach is effective for determining the best tag detection influence factor condition on the target object by using the predicted detectability.

The performance results of a set of experiments conducted using binary and multi-class SVM with increasing training data sizes are examined. The NER domain chosen for these experiments is the biomedical publications domain, especially selected due to its importance and inherent challenges. A simple machine learning approach is used that eliminates prior language knowledge such as part-of-speech or noun phrase tagging thereby allowing for its applicability across languages. No domain-specific knowledge is included. The accuracy measures achieved are comparable to those obtained using more complex approaches, which constitutes a motivation to investigate ways to improve the scalability of multi-class SVM in order to make the solution more practical and useable. Improving training time of multi-class SVM would make support vector machines a more viable and practical machine learning solution for real-world problems with large datasets. An initial prototype results in great improvement of the training time at the expense of memory requirements.

Estimation of the concentrations of the components is also performed for a volatile organic compound (VOC) constituted by methanol and acetone, for the ranges 40-400 and 22-220 ppm (parts-per-million), respectively. Our system contains 8 sensors, 5 of them being gas sensors (of the class TGS from FIGARO USA, INC., whose sensing element is a tin dioxide (SnO(2)) semiconductor), the remaining being a temperature sensor (LM35 from National Semiconductor Corporation), a humidity sensor (HIH-3610 from Honeywell), and a pressure sensor (XFAM from Fujikura Ltd.). Our integrated hardware-software system uses some machine learning principles and least square regression principle to identify at first a new gas sample, or a mixture, and then to estimate the concentrations. In particular we adopt a training model using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach with linear kernel to teach the system how discriminate among different gases. Then we apply another training model using the least square regression, to predict the concentrations. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multiclassification and regression scheme is effective in the identification of the tested VOCs of methanol and acetone with 96.61% correctness. The concentration prediction is obtained with 0.979 and 0.964 correlation coefficient for the predicted versus real concentrations of methanol and acetone, respectively.

In some occasions, there may be few software modules having fault data and therefore, prediction models using only labeled data can not provide accurate results. Semi-supervised learning approaches which benefit from unlabeled and labeled data may be applied in this case. In this paper, we propose an artificial immune system based semi-supervised learning approach. Proposed approach uses a recent semi-supervised algorithm called YATSI (Yet Another Two Stage Idea) and in the first stage of YATSI, AIRS (Artificial Immune Recognition Systems) is applied. In addition, AIRS, RF (Random Forests) classifier, AIRS based YATSI, and RF based YATSI are benchmarked. Experimental results showed that while YATSI algorithm improved the performance of AIRS, it diminished the performance of RF for unbalanced datasets. Furthermore, performance of AIRS based YATSI is comparable with RF which is the best machine learning classifier according to some researches.

In recent years, a number of learning algorithms for regression have been introduced. Unfortunately, there are few projects that compared the performance of these methods by experiment. In this paper, we present a empirical comparison between ten algorithms used for regression: k-nearest neighbor (KNN), k-nearest-neighbor with distance weighted (KNNDW), linear regression (LR), locally weighted linear regression (LWLR), model trees (M5P), reduced error pruning tree (REPTree), naive Bayes (NB), genetic programming (GP), back propagation (BP), and support vector machine (SVM). We test these ten different regression algorithms on the whole 36 data sets recommended by Weka. The ten-folds cross validation (CV) criteria is used to compare these algorithms. Finally we test the experimental results via two-tailed t-test with significantly different probability of 95% to compare the performance of each pair of algorithms in terms of the relative absolute error.

This paper proposes an automatic ongoing learning system, which is able to incorporate new knowledge from the experience obtained when classifying new objects and correspondingly, to improve the efficiency of the system. We employ a stochastic rule for classifying and editing, along with a condensing algorithm based on local density to forget superfluous data (and control the sample size). The effectiveness of the algorithm is experimentally evaluated using a number of data sets taken from the UCI Machine Learning Database Repository.

To understand the effects of these changes, it is often essential to apply bioinformatics tools. Where there is a lack of homologous sequences or a three-dimensional structure, it becomes essential to predict the effects of mutations based solely on protein sequence information. Several computational methods utilizing machine learning techniques have been developed. These predictions generally use the 20-alphabet amino acid code to train the model. With limited available data, the 20-alphabet amino acid features may introduce so many parameters that the model becomes over-fitted. To decrease the number of parameters, we propose a physicochemical feature-based method to forecast the effects of amino acid substitutions on protein stability. Protein structure alterations caused by mutations can be classified as stabilizing or destabilizing. Based on experimental folding-unfolding free energy (Delta Delta G) values, we trained a support vector machine with a cleaned data set. The physicochemical properties of the mutated residues, the number of neighboring residues in the primary sequence and the temperature and pH were used as input attributes. Different kernel functions, attributes and window sizes were optimized. An average accuracy of 80% was obtained in cross-validation experiments.

This paper provides a brief overview of the state of the art and reports on a number of novel applications I was involved with in the area of software testing. Reflecting on this personal experience, I draw lessons learned and argue that more research should be performed in that direction as machine learning has the potential to significantly help in addressing some of the long-standing software testing problems.

We refer to this process as the re-engineering of test suites. It is important to provide both methodological and tool support to help people understand the limitations of test suites and their possible redundancies, so as to be able to refine them in a cost effective manner. To address this problem in the case of black-box testing, we propose a methodology based on machine learning that has shown promising results on a case study.

The classification method exploits machine learning algorithms and several morphological as well as semantical text processing tools. In contrast to general text document classification, in the web document classification there are often problems with short web pages. In this paper we proposed two approaches to eliminate the lack of information. In the first one we consider a wider context of a web page. That means we analyze web pages referenced from the investigated page. The second approach is based on sophisticated term clustering by their similar grammatical context. This is done using statistic corpora tool the Sketch Engine.

Evading Anomaly Detection through Variance Injection Attacks on PCA (Extended Abstract)	RECENT ADVANCES IN INTRUSION DETECTION, RAID 2008	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Symposium on Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection	SEP 15-17, 2008	Cambridge, MA	Inst Informat Infrastructure Protect, Symantec Corp, IBM	MIT Lincoln Lab			Whenever machine, learning is applied to security problems, it is important to measure vulnerabilities to adversaries who poison the training data. We demonstrate the impact of variance, injection schemes on PCA-based network-wide volume anomaly detectors, when a single compromised PoP injects chaff into the network. These schemes can increase the chance of evading detection by sixfold, for DoS attacks.	[Rubinstein, Benjamin I. P.; Nelson, Blaine; Joseph, Anthony D.; Lau, Shing-hon; Tygar, J.

Nuclear Hormone Response Elements (NHRE) are among the most important response elements adopted by Eukaryotic regulation of genetic expression. An NHRE is a DNA sequence characterized by its palindromic structure with 3 specific features: the sequence of the base pairs in the half-site, the number of base pairs between the half-sites, the relative orientation of the two half-sites. These sequences can be predicted through different methods such as Weight Matrix (WM), Markov Model (MM) and Bayesian Networks (BN). Although MM has been shown to be the best methods to predict DNA motifs in general, their application to NHRE prediction was not very successful due to the particular properties of the NHRE. In this work, we first outline the performance of the three methods and how they can be adapted to NHRE prediction. Then we present two programs that implement WM and BN methods. We used these programs to perform a genome wide search of NHRE in the human genome. This allowed us to evaluate the performance of the two methods and to compare them to each other. We finally propose a combination of BN and WM to improve the precision of the prediction.

Part of speech (POS) tagging is the process of labeling automatic annotation of syntactic categories for each word in a corpus. SVMTool is developed by Jesus Gim'enez and Lluis M'arquez for POS tagging. The tagset used here (Amrita Tagset) has been developed based on our experience in the creation of annotated corpus for Tamil. The present one consists of 32 tags. We have trained our corpus of two hundred and twenty five thousand words with SVMTool by tuning the parameters and feature patterns based on Tamil language. We have also used various tools like WEKA, MBT and TNT to compare our result. The output result is very encouraging.	[Dhanalakshmi, V; Anandkumar, M.; Vijaya, M. S.; Loganathan, R.; Soman, K.

This classifier is constructed by machine learning algorithms using as classification features the word-alignment distributions between native-speakers'/learners' Japanese sentences and parallel English sentences. We show that our method can effectively classify L2 learners' sentences into native-like or non-native-like sentences, by examining not only the classification accuracy but also the dependency relation of the classification accuracy on L2 learners' writing proficiency. In addition, we compare our classifiers with classifiers constructed with classification features proposed by the previous studies (Lee et al. 2007, Baroni & Bernardini 2006, Tomokiyo & Jones 2001), and found that our classifiers marked higher classification accuracy.

The Web 2.0 (r)evolution and the advent of user generated content have changed the game for personalization, since the role of people has evolved from passive consumers of information to that of active contributors. One of the forms of user generated content that has drawn more attention from the research community is folksonomy, a taxonomy generated by users who collaboratively annotate and categorize resources of interests with freely chosen keywords called tags. In this paper, we investigate whether folksonomies might be a valuable source of information about user interests. The main contribution is a strategy that enables a content-based recommender to infer user interests by applying machine learning techniques both on the "official" item descriptions provided by a publisher, and on tags which users adopt to freely annotate relevant items. Static content and tags are preventively analyzed by advanced linguistic techniques in order to capture the semantics of the user interests often hidden behind keywords. The proposed approach has been evaluated in the context of cultural heritage personalization. Preliminary experiments involving 30 real users show an improvement in the predictive accuracy of the tag-augmented recommender compared to the pure content-based one.

This subfield of machine learning has gained a lot of popularity with the Netflix Prize competition started in October 2006. Two major approaches for this problem are matrix factorization (MF) and the neighbor based approach (NB). In this work, we propose various variants of MF and NB that can boost the performance of the usual ensemble based scheme. First, we investigate various regularization scenarios for MF. Second, we introduce two NB methods: one is based on correlation coefficients and the other on linear least squares. At the experimentation part, we show that the proposed approaches compare favorably with existing ones in terms of prediction accuracy and/or required training time. We present results of blending the proposed methods.

Information on current environmental conditions is combined with observations of current storms and derived indications of the onset of rapid change. Predictor data include satellite radiances and rates of change, satellite-derived cloud type, ground weather station measurements, land surface and climatology data, numerical weather prediction model fields, and radar-derived storm intensity and morphology. The machine learning methodology creates an ensemble of decision trees that can serve as a forecast logic to provide both deterministic and probabilistic estimates of thunderstorm intensity. It also provides evaluation of predictor importance, facilitating selection of a minimal skillful set of predictor variables and providing a tool to help determine what weather regimes may require specialized forecast logic. The aim of this work is to contribute to the development of the Consolidated Storm Prediction for Aviation (CoSPA) system, sponsored by the Federal Aviation Administration's Aviation Weather Research Program and developed in collaboration between NCAR, the MIT Lincoln Laboratory and the NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory's Global Systems Division. CoSPA is scheduled to become part of the NextGen Initial Operating Capability by 2012.

In-cloud turbulence is measured with the NEXRAD Turbulence Detection Algorithm (NTDA) using extensively quality-controlled, ground-based Doppler radar data. A real-time demonstration of the NTDA includes generation of a 3-D turbulence mosaic covering the CONUS east of the Rocky Mountains, a web-based display, and experimental uplinks of turbulence maps to en-route commercial aircraft. Near-cloud turbulence is inferred from thunderstorm morphology, intensity, growth rate and environment data provided by (1) satellite radiance measurements, rates of change, winds, and other derived features, (2) lightning strike measurements, (3) radar reflectivity measurements and (4) weather model data. These are combined via a machine learning technique trained using a database of in situ turbulence measurements from commercial aircraft to create a predictive model. This new capability is being developed under FAA and NASA funding to enhance current U.S. and international turbulence decision support systems, allowing rapid-update, high-resolution, comprehensive assessments of atmospheric turbulence hazards for use by pilots, dispatchers, and air traffic controllers. It will also contribute to the comprehensive 4-D weather information database for NextGen.

It uses methods from a diverse spectrum of fields such as Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning. However, a crucial challenging issue is to quantitatively evaluate the usefulness and accuracy of both techniques and combinations of techniques, when applied to ontology learning. It is an interesting problem because there are no published comparative studies. We are developing a flexible framework for ontology learning from text which provides a cyclical process that involves the successive application of various NLP techniques and learning algorithms for concept extraction and ontology modelling. The framework provides support to evaluate the usefulness and accuracy of different techniques and possible combinations of techniques into specific processes, to deal with the above challenge. We show our framework's efficacy as a workbench for testing and evaluating concept identification. Our initial experiment supports our assumption about the usefulness of our approach.

We present our current work on the construction of a new novelty detector based on a dynamical version of predictive coding. We compare three evolutionary algorithms, a simple genetic algorithm, NEAT and FS-NEAT, for the task of optimising the structure of an illustrative dynamic predictive coding neural network to improve its performance over stimuli from a number of artificially generated visual environments. We find that NEAT performs more reliably than the other two algorithms in this task and evolves the network with the highest fitness. However, both NEAT and FS-NEAT fail to evolve a network with a significantly higher fitness than the best network evolved by the simple genetic algorithm. The best network evolved demonstrates a more consistent performance over a broader range of inputs than the original network. We also examine the robustness of this network to noise and find that it handles low levels reasonably well, but is outperformed by the illustrative network when the level of noise is increased.

The automated system was used to measure the inclinations of 141 vertebral endplates in spine radiographs of patients with scoliosis. The resulting dataset was divided into training and test set. The training set was used to configure three classifiers: a support vector classifier (SVC), a decision tree classifier (DT) and a logistic regression classifier (LR). Their performance was evaluated on the test set. The SVC had an accuracy of 86% discriminating Good Results (those in which the error was less than 3 degrees) from Bad Results. This accuracy was better than that of the LR (76%) and DT (68%). The differentiation between Good and Bad Results using the proposed machine learning approach was achieved successfully.

Multivariate linear discriminant analysis, however, continues to be one of the main reference methods principally because it is easy to apply and interpret. AdaBoost is a machine learning technique which works by combining a large number of simple classifiers to achieve a high level of accuracy in classification problems. Although the efficiency of this method has been proved in various application fields, it is unknown in the economic-business area. The aim of this study is to present AdaBoost as a classification technique which can be successfully used in failure forecasting. Correspondingly, it has been applied to a sample of 1.180 Spanish firms and has proved to be more accurate than discriminant analysis.

In recent years, these techniques have been used to find optimal parameter sets for many behaviors. In particular, layered learning has been proposed to improve learning rate in robot learning tasks. In this paper, we consider a layered learning approach for learning optimal parameters of basic control routines, behaviours and strategy selection. We compare three different methods in the different layers: genetic algorithm, Nelder-Mead, and policy gradient. Moreover, we study how to rise a 3D simulator for speeding up robot learning. The results of our experimental work on AIBO robots are useful not only to state differences and similarities between different robot learning approaches used within the layered learning framework, but also to evaluate a more effective learning methodology that makes use of a simulator.

This paper introduces a novel approach using rule based expert system towards opponent modeling in RoboCup Soccer Coach Simulation. In this scene, an autonomous coach agent is able to identify the patterns of the opponent by analyzing the opponent's past games and advising own players. For this purpose, the main goal of our research comprises two complementary parts: (a) developing a 3-tier learning architecture for classifying opponent behaviors. To achieve this objective, sequential events of the game are identified using environmental data. Then the patterns of the opponent are predicted using statistical calculations. Eventually, by comparing the opponent patterns with the rest of team's behavior, a model of the opponent is constructed. (b) designing a rule based expert system containing provocation strategies to expedite detection of opponent patterns. These items mentioned are used by coach, to model the opponent and generate an appropriate strategy to play against the opponent. This structure is tested in RoboCup Soccer Coach Simulation and MRLCoach was the champion at RoboCup 2006 in Germany.

Learning algorithms for such objects usually display high complexity and typically require a priori assumptions on the subject domain. Hierarchical learning is designed to alleviate many problems associated with structured object recognition. It helps steer searches for solutions toward more promising paths in the otherwise computationally prohibitive search spaces by breaking the original task into simpler, more manageable subtasks.

By introducing weightiness into a fuzzy approximation space, a new rule induction algorithm is proposed, which combines three types of uncertainty: weightiness; fuzziness and roughness. We first define the key concepts of block, minimal complex and local covering in a weighted fuzzy approximation space, then a weighted fuzzy approximation space based rule learner; and finally a weighted certainty factor for evaluating fuzzy classification rules. The tune complexity of proposed rule learner is theoretically analyzed. Furthermore, in order to estimate the performance of the proposed method on class unbalanced and hybrid datasets, we compare our method with classical methods by conducting experiments on fifteen datasets. Comparative studies indicate that rule sets extracted by this method get a better performance on minority class than other approaches. It is therefore concluded that the proposed rule learner is an effective method for class imbalanced and hybrid data learning.

It creates unprecedented opportunities for large-scale knowledge discovery from huge database. Data mining (DM) technology has emerged as a means of performing this discovery. There are countless researchers working on designing efficient data mining techniques, methods, and algorithms. Many data mining methods and algorithms have been developed and applied in a lot of application fields [1]. Unfortunately, most data mining researchers pay much attention to technique problems for developing data mining models and methods, while little to basic issues of data mining [2]. In this talk, some basic issues of data mining are addressed. What is data mining? What is the product of a data mining process? What are we doing in a data mining process? What is the rule we should obey in a data mining process? Through analyzing existing data mining methods, and domain-driven (or user-driven) data mining models [3-5], we find that we should take a data mining process as a process of knowledge transformation. Based on this understanding of data mining, a conceptual data mining model of domain-oriented data-driven data mining (3DM) is proposed [2]. The relationship between traditional domain-driven (or user-driven) data mining models and our proposed 3DM model is also analyzed. Some domain-oriented data-driven data mining algorithms for mining such knowledge as default rule [61, decision tree [7], and concept lattice [8] from database are proposed. The experiment results for these algorithms are also shown to illustrate the efficiency and performance of the knowledge acquired by our 3DM data mining algorithms.

This method selects all training examples to construct a kernel-based functions dictionary. Then redundant functions are removed iteratively from the dictionary, according to their weights magnitudes, which are determined by linear support vector machines (SVMs). During the reduction process, the parameters of the functions in the dictionary can be adjusted dynamically. Similarities and differences between KMRA and several other machine learning algorithms are also addressed. Experimental results show KMRA can have sparser solutions than SVMs, and can still obtain comparable classification accuracies to SVMs.	[Li, Jianwu; Deng, Xiaocheng] Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing Inst Technol, Beijing Key Lab Intelligent Informat, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China	Li, JW (reprint author), Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing Inst Technol, Beijing Key Lab Intelligent Informat, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.

However, it has not been feasible to gain insight into the reasons why a certain prediction is made. Due to this limitation, the use of machine learning techniques in the capital market has met a critical hurdle. This chapter outlines a method based on pedagogical learning for extracting rules from support vector machines. To the best of our knowledge, the experiments reported here are the first attempt to utilize learning based rule extraction from support vector machines for financial data mining. The experiments use predictions from support vector machines for extracting rules associated with the first-day returns of "initial public offerings" (IPOs) in the US stock market. A novel feature of the experiments is the simultaneous application of fundamental and technical analysis in the context of predicting the success of IPOs. Cross-industry IPOs covering the period from 1974 to 1984 and software and services IPOs launched between 1996 and 2000 are utilized.

However, the existing methods lack the ability to explain the process of how a learning result is reached and why a prediction decision is made. The explanation of a decision is important for the acceptance of machine learning technology in bioinformatics applications such as protein structure prediction. The support vector machines (SVMs) have shown better performance than most traditional machine learning approaches in a variety of application areas. However, the SVMs are still black box models. They do not produce comprehensible models that account for the predictions they make. To overcome this limitation, in this chapter, we present two new approaches of rule generation for understanding protein structure prediction. Based on the strong generalization ability of the SVM and the interpretation of the decision tree, one approach combines SVMs with decision trees into a new algorithm called SVM_DT. Another method combines SVMs with association rule (AR) based scheme called SVM_PCPAR. We also provide the method of rule aggregation for a large number of rules to produce the super rules by using conceptual clustering. The results of the experiments for protein structure prediction show that not only the comprehensibility of SVM_DT and SVM_PCPAR are much better than that of SVMs, but also that the test accuracy of these rules is comparable. We believe that SVM_DT and SVM_PCPAR can be used for protein structure prediction, and understanding the prediction as well. The prediction and its interpretation can be used for guiding biological experiments.

A prototype is described towards the application of credit analysis. The focus of this system is to define a higher level of inference that will guide preestablished object-level rule constructs. This architecture is supported by the incorporation of machine-learning (ML) techniques to support the acquisition of business rule-based knowledge. This knowledge is applied to specific parameters that ultimately guide an object level decision making process. By developing this process of automated knowledge acquisition, we are interested in up front actions including validation and support of intended responses. We also intend to further classify and categorize this acquired knowledge to support future policy modifications.

Although many efforts have been performed, they usually pre-process data and then use classic machine learning algorithm. Another problem that machine learning algorithm have to face is the intrinsic uncertainty of data, where in such situations classic algorithm do not have the means to handle them. In this work a novel neuro-fuzzy model for structured data is presented that exploits both neural and fuzzy methods. The proposed model called Fuzzy Graph Neural Network (F-GNN) is based on GNN, a model able to handle structure data. A proof of F-GNN approximation properties is provided together with a training algorithm.

The inability to gain insight into complex scientific phenomena using current software tools is a bottleneck facing virtually all endeavors of science. In this paper, we introduce Sunfall, a collaborative visual analytics system developed for the Nearby Supernova Factory, an international astrophysics experiment and the largest data volume supernova search currently in operation. Sunfall utilizes novel interactive visualization and analysis techniques to facilitate deeper scientific insight into complex, noisy, high-dimensional, high-volume, time-critical data. The system combines novel image processing algorithms, statistical analysis, and machine learning with highly interactive visual interfaces to enable collaborative, user-driven scientific exploration of supernova image and spectral data. Sunfall is currently in operation at the Nearby Supernova Factory; it is the first visual analytics system in production use at a major astrophysics project.

It provides a fuzzy traffic signal control approach based on Particle Swarm Optimization for intersection signal control. Through fuzzy classing traffic flow in under control intersection and adjacent intersection, this paper puts decision schemes of signal control in different conditions as rule-set into knowledge-database. It applies PSO to improve the rule-sets in traffic signal control process, so the control model has the self-learning ability. After programming the simulation program of this control model and simulating, this paper compares the control effect of this new approach with the traditional fuzzy control method The result of simulating illustrates that the effect of the model is obviously better than the traditional ones.

It can capture up to 3,000 images per day, equating to almost I million images per year. It is used to aid memory by creating a personal multi-media lifelog, or Visual recording of the wearer's life. However the sheer volume of image data captured within a visual lifelog creates a number of challenges, particularly for locating relevant content. Within this work, we explore the applicability of semantic concept detection, a method often used within video retrieval, on the novel domain of visual lifelogs. A concept detector models the correspondence between low-level visual features and high-level semantic concepts (such as indoors, outdoors, people, buildings, etc.) using supervised machine learning. By doing so it determines the probability of a concept's presence. We apply detection of 27 everyday semantic concepts on a lifelog collection composed of 257,5 19 SenseCam images from 5 users. The results were then evaluated on a subset of 95,907 images, to determine the precision for detection of each semantic concept and to draw some interesting inferences on the lifestyles of those 5 users. We additionally present future applications of concept detection within the domain of lifelogging.	[Byrne, Daragh; Doherty, Aiden R.; Jones, Gareth G.

In this paper we propose the "Classification-Based Learning of Subsumption Relations for the Alignment of Ontologies" (CSR) method. Given a pair of concepts from two ontologies, the objective of CSR is to identify patterns of concepts' features that provide evidence for the subsumption relation among them. This is achieved by means of a classification task, using state of the art supervised machine learning methods.

The strategies for matchmaking that we developed and evaluated can make use of a plethora of similarity measures and combination functions from SimPack-our library of similarity measures. We show how our combination of structured and imprecise querying can be used to perform hybrid Semantic Web service matchmaking. We analyze our approach thoroughly on a large OWL-S service test collection and show how our initial strategies can be improved by applying machine learning algorithms to result in very effective strategies for matchmaking.

NAWMS: Nonintrusive Autonomous Water Monitoring System	SENSYS'08: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 6TH ACM CONFERENCE ON EMBEDDED NETWORKED SENSOR SYSTEMS			English	Proceedings Paper	6th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems	NOV 05-07, 2008	Raleigh, NC	ACM SIGCOMM, SIGMobile, SIGARCH, SIGBED, SIGMetrics, SIGOPS		Adaptive Sensor Calibration; Machine Learning; Water Flow Rate Estimation; Nonintrusive and Spatially Distributed Sensing; Tiered Information Architecture; Parameter Estimation via Optimization		Water is nature's most precious resource and growing demand is pushing fresh water supplies to the brink of non-renewability. New technological and social initiatives that enhance conservation and reduce waste are needed. Providing consumers with fine-grained real-time information has yielded benefits in conservation of power and gasoline. Extending this philosophy to water conservation, we introduce a novel water monitoring system, NAWMS, that similarly empowers users. The goal of our work is to furnish users with an easy-to-install self-calibrating system that provides information on when, where, and how much water they are using. The system uses wireless vibration sensors attached to pipes and, thus, neither plumbing nor special expertise is necessary for its installation. By implementing a non-intrusive, autonomous, and adaptive system using commodity hardware, we believe it is cost-effective and widely deployable. NAWMS makes use of the existing household water flow meter, which is considered accurate, but lacks spatial granularity, and adds vibration sensors on individual water pipes to estimate the water flow to each individual outlet. Compensating for manufacturing, installation, and material variabilities requires calibration of these low cost sensors to achieve a reasonable level of accuracy. We have devised an adaptive auto-calibration procedure, which attempts to solve a two phase linear programming and mixed linear geometric programming problem. We show through experiments on a three pipe testbed that such a system is indeed feasible and adapts well to minimize error in the water usage estimate. We report an accuracy, over likely domestic flow-rate scenarios, with long-term stability and a mean absolute error of 7%.

This is challenge in large grid- and saas based networks that are managed by numerous entities. This paper is about supporting multi agent systems that operate in the network and support its management by learning actual structures from life observed logging data. We focus on a collaborative grammar induction mechanism in which agents share local models in order to retrieve a model of the structure of the total service network. We studied the performance of groups of agents while varying the size and degree of communication. We motivate the application of the mechanism in the domain of service oriented system and show the results of experiments using a distributed agent-based monitoring system. We promote further research in the overlapping scientific disciplines of multi agent systems and machine learning in the application domain of service oriented systems.	[Mulder, W.; Meijer, G.

The objective of the corrective bandwidth learning algorithm is to minimize the expected error-rate. It utilizes a gradient descent technique to obtain the appropriate bandwidths. The proposed classifier is called the "Empirical Mixture Model" (EMM) classifier. Experiments were conducted on a set of multivariate multi-class classification problems with various data sizes. The proposed classifier has an error-rate closer to the true model compared to conventional KDE-based classifiers for both small and large data sizes. Additional experiments on standard machine learning datasets showed that the proposed bandwidth learning algorithm performed very well in general.

The collaboration was formed to study the problem of open ocean biome classification. Biomes are regions on Earth with similar climate (e.g., temperature and rainfall) and vegetation structure (e.g., grasslands, coniferous forests, and deserts). To discover biomes in the open ocean, we apply leading methods in high dimensional data analysis, clustering, and visualization to oceanographic measurements culled from multiple existing databases. We compare traditional approaches, such as k-means clustering and principal component analysis, to newer approaches such as Isomap and maximum variance unfolding. Our work provides the first quantitative classification of open ocean biomes from an automated statistical analysis of multivariate data. It also provides a valuable case study in the use (and misuse) of recently developed algorithms for high dimensional data analysis.

In this work, we describe a technique for gene selection and classification of microarray data based on the recently proposed potential support vector machine (P-SVM) for feature selection and a v-SVM for classification. The P-SVM expands the decision function in terms of a sparse set of "support features". Based on this novel technique for feature selection, we suggest a fully automated method for gene selection, hyper-parameter optimization and microarray classification. Benchmark results are given for the two datasets provided by the ICMLA '08 Automated Micro-Array Classification Challenge.

Tumor Targeting for Lung Cancer Radiotherapy Using Machine Learning Techniques	SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING AND APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications	DEC 11-13, 2008	San Diego, CA	IEEE SMC, Calif State Univ Bakersfield, Assoc Machine Learning & Applicat			MARKERS	Accurate lung tumor targeting in real time plays a fundamental role in image-guide radiotherapy of lung cancers. Precise tumor targeting is required for both respiratory gating and tracking. Gating is considered as the current state of the art for precise lung cancer radiotherapy, which irradiates the tumor when it moves into a predefined gating window. Tracking seems to be a next-generation technique, and it operates in a more aggressive fashion by following the tumor position with radiation beam in real time. Existing methods for gating and tracking often rely on observed motion patterns of external surrogates or implanted fiducial markers. However external surrogates suffer from certain degrees of inaccuracy, and implanted fiducial markers are in limited uses due to the risk of pneumothorax. Therefore, direct tumor targeting techniques without implanting fiducial markers are desired. Previous studies in fluoroscopic markerless targeting are mainly based on template matching methods, which may fail when tumor boundary is unclear in fluoroscopic images. In this paper we propose a novel framework of markerless gating and tracking based on machine learning algorithms. Specifically, gating is treated as a two-class classification problem, which is solved by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Further we formulate the tracking problem as a regression task, which employs the correlation between the tumor position and nearby surrogate anatomic features in the image. Four regression methods were tested in this study:1-degree and 2-degree linear regression, artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector machine (SVM). Finally, we demonstrate the superb performance of the proposed markerless gating and tracking algorithms on 10 fluoroscopic image sequences of 9 patients. For gating, the target coverage (the precision) ranges from 90% to 99%, with mean of 96.5%. For tracking, the mean localization error is about 2.1 pixels and the maximum error at 95% confidence level is about 4.6 pixels (pixel size is about 0.5 mm).

Decision Fusion of Machine Learning Models to Predict Radiotherapy-induced Lung Pneumonitis	SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING AND APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications	DEC 11-13, 2008	San Diego, CA	IEEE SMC, Calif State Univ Bakersfield, Assoc Machine Learning & Applicat			RADIATION-INDUCED PNEUMONITIS; DOSE-ESCALATION; CANCER PATIENTS; CLASSIFICATION	Combining different machine learning models (decision fusion) has been shown to be an effective method for estimating the underlying physical mechanism by allowing the models to reinforce each other when consensus exists, or, conversely, negate each other when there is no consensus. To be effective, decision fusion requires that the different models provide some degree of complementary information. In this work, we fuse the results of four different machine learning models (Boosted Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Self Organizing Maps) to predict the risk of lung pneumonitis in patients undergoing thoracic radiotherapy. Fusion was achieved by simple averaging of the 10-fold cross validated predictions for each patient from all four models. To reduce prediction dependence on the manner in which the data set was split, 10-fold cross-validation was repeated 100 times for random data splitting. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for the fused cross-validated results was 0.79, higher than the individual models and with (generally) lower variance. The fusion extracted three important features as the consensus among all four models in predicting radiation pneumonitis risk: chemotherapy prior to radiotherapy, equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD) for exponent a = 1.2 to 3, and female gender. The results show great promise for machine learning in radiotherapy outcomes modeling.

Hypofractionated lung radiotherapy has high precision requirement, and it is essential to effectively monitor the target making sure the tumor is within beam aperture. We model the treatment verification problem as a two-class classification problem and apply Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify the cine EPID images acquired during the treatment into corresponding classes-tumor inside or outside of the beam aperture. Training samples of ANN are generated using digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) with artificially added shifts in tumor location-to simulate cine EPID images with different tumor locations. Principal Component Analysis (PICA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the training samples and cine EPID images acquired during the treatment. The proposed treatment verification algorithm has been tested on six hypofractionated lung patients in a retrospective fashion. On average, our proposed algorithm achieved 94.66% classification accuracy, 94.50% recall rate, and 99.79% precision rate.

During the last few years, many algorithms have been proposed for this task. In this paper we review different supervised machine learning techniques for classification of a novel dataset and perform a methodological comparison of these. We used the C4.5 tree classifier a Multilayer Perceptron and a naive Bayes classifier over a large set of tumour markers. We found good performance of the Multilayer Perceptron even when we reduced the number of features to be classified. We found naive Bayes achieved a competitive performance even though the assumption of normality of the data is strongly violated.

The goal is to identify both TF target genes and their binding motifs. Subspace-valued weak learners (formed from an ensemble of different motif finding algorithms) combine candidate motifs as probability weight matrices (PWM), which are then translated into subspaces of a DNA k-mer (string) feature space. Assessing and then integrating highly informative subspaces by machine methods gives more reliable target classification and motif prediction. We compare these target identification methods with probability weight matrix (PWM) rescanning and use of support vector machines on the full k-mer space of the Yeast S. cerevisiae. This method, SVMotif-PWM, can significantly improve accuracy in computational identification of TF targets.

Survival prediction is often accomplished by the TNM system that involves only three factors: tumor extent, lymph node involvement, and metastasis. This prediction from the TNM has been limited, mainly because other potential prognostic factors are not used in the system. Based on availability of large cancer datasets, it is possible to establish powerful prediction systems by using machine learning procedures and statistical methods. In this paper, we present a clustering based approach to develop prognostic systems of cancer patients. Our method starts with grouping combinations that are formed using levels of factors recorded in the data. The dissimilarity measure between combinations is obtained through a sequence of data Partitions produced by multiple clusterings. This dissimilarity measure is then used with a hierarchical clustering method in order to find clusters of combinations. Prediction of survival is made simply by using the survival function derived from each cluster Our approach admits multiple factors and provides a practical and useful toot in outcome prediction of cancer patients. A demonstration of use of the proposed method is given for lung cancer patients.

Typical linguistic structures such as morphology, syntax and semantic are completely ignored in the learning process. This paper examines the role of these structures on the classifier construction applying the study to the Portuguese language. Classifiers are built using the SVM algorithm on a newspaper's articles dataset. The results show that syntactic structure is not useful for text classification (as initially expected), but a novel structured representation that uses document's semantic information has the same discriminative power over classes as the traditional bag-of-words one.

We induce morphological information using stemmed features. Ontological information, on the other hand, has been induced in the form of WordNet hypernyms. We form text representations based on stemming and hypernyms. Those representations are evaluated using four different machine learning algorithms on the Reuters 21578 dataset. We report average F1 measures as the results. The results show that stemming-based text representation gives better performance than hypernym-based text representation even though we used a novel hypernym formation approach. We also combine the stemming based representation with the hypernym based representation. The combined representation does not produce any significant improvement in performance.

However, the current generation has started to access richer multimedia content such as video, increasing the diversity of devices accessing the Web. Then, a problem arises as some of those devices characteristics like memory capacity or screen resolution turn the access to a content restricted. The present work considers the use of machine learning techniques as part of a dynamic video adaptation process, comparing the results from two of the most used approaches for data analysis, Multilayer Perceptron and Bayesian Inference, as part of a Decision Engine, analyzing data like device's capabilities, user's preferences and network condition in order to take the most appropriate way to adapt a video stream.			robson@adapmedia.com; rafrance@icmc.usp.br; rudinei@icmc.usp.br	Goularte, Rudinei/E-2441-2011; Romero, Roseli/B-6277-2008				Abowd G.

A model of transformer diagnosis based on SVM is present in this paper in which it uses the grid search method based on cross-validation to determine model parameters. Taking into account the compactness characteristics of DGA data, the fuzzy C.-means (FCM) clustering method is adopted to pre-select samples achieved. It solves the problem of long time expended on model parameters determined, and enhances a certain promotion of the model extension ability. Practical analysis shows that this model has a good classification results and extension ability.

Prominent examples of this problem include Min-DNF, which asks whether a given Boolean function presented as a truth table has a k-term disjunctive normal form (DNF), and Min-Circuit (also called the minimum circuit size problem (MCSP)), which asks whether a Boolean function presented as a truth table has a size k Boolean circuit. We present a new reduction proving that Min-DNF is NP-complete. It is significantly simpler than the known reduction of Masek [Some NP-Complete Set Covering Problems, manuscript, 1979], which is from Circuit-SAT. We then give a more complex reduction, yielding the result that Min-DNF cannot be approximated to within a factor smaller than (logN)(gamma), for some constant gamma > 0, assuming that NP is not contained in quasi-polynomial time. The standard greedy algorithm for Set Cover is often used in practice to approximate Min-DNF. The question of whether Min-DNF can be approximated to within a factor of o(logN) remains open, but we construct an instance of Min-DNF on which the solution produced by the greedy algorithm is Omega(logN) larger than optimal. Finally, we turn to the question of approximating circuit size for slightly more general classes of circuits. DNF formulas are depth-two circuits of AND and OR gates. Depth-d circuits are denoted by AC(d)(0). We show that it is hard to approximate the size of AC(d)(0) circuits (for large enough d) under cryptographic assumptions.

When the domain is Boolean (i.e., restricted to {0, 1}), the maximum solution problem is identical to the well-studied MAX ONES problem, and the approximability is completely understood for all restrictions on the underlying constraints [S. Khanna, M. Sudan, L. Trevisan, and D. P. Williamson, SIAM J. Comput., 30 (2001), pp. 1863-1920]. We continue this line of research by considering domains containing more than two elements. We present two main results: a complete classification for the approximability of all maximal constraint languages over domains of cardinality at most 4, and a complete classification of the approximability of the problem when the set of allowed constraints contains all permutation constraints. Under the assumption that a conjecture due to Szczepara [Minimal Clones Generated by Groupoids, Ph. D. thesis, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, 1996] holds, we give a complete classification for all maximal constraint languages. These classes of languages are well studied in universal algebra and computer science; they have, for instance, been considered in connection with machine learning and constraint satisfaction. Our results are proved by using algebraic results from clone theory, and the results indicate that this approach is very powerful for classifying the approximability of certain optimization problems.

We consider the game of choosing x from a convex set, to maximize the function, and choosing (a, B) from a convex set, to minimize it. We prove the existence of a saddle point and describe an efficient method, based on convex optimization, for computing it. We describe applications in machine learning (robust Fisher linear discriminant analysis), signal processing (robust beamforming and robust matched filtering), and finance (robust portfolio selection). In these applications, x corresponds to some design variables to be chosen, and the pair (a, B) corresponds to the statistical model, which is uncertain.

In this paper, I describe an undergraduate course in Data Mining offered at the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John's University in Spring of 2007 as a CSCI-317-upper-division "Topics in Computer Science"- course, entitled "Data Intelligence." One of the main objectives of the course was to engage students in experimental computing research through a number of carefully planned research activities resulting in better understanding of the course contents and deeper insights into the challenges faced by the data mining community.

This approach provides detailed insight into processor performance, power consumption and complexity. However, only configurations in a subspace can be simulated in practice due to long simulation time and limited resource, leading to suboptimal conclusions which might not be applied in a larger design space. In this paper, we propose an automated performance prediction approach which employs state-of-the-art techniques from experiment design, machine learning and data mining. Our method not only produces highly accurate estimations for unsampled points in the design space, but also provides interpretation tools that help investigators to understand performance bottlenecks. According to our experiments, by sampling only 0.02% of the full design space with about 15 millions points, the median percentage errors, based on 5000 independent test points, range from 0.32% to 3.12% in 12 benchmarks. Even for the worst-case performance, the percentage errors are within 7% for 10 out of 12 benchmarks. In addition, the proposed model can also help architects to find important design parameters and performance bottlenecks.

Today, especially variants of Wilson's extended Classifier System (XCS) are widely applied for machine learning. Despite their widespread application, LCSs have drawbacks: The number of reinforcement cycles an LCS requires for learning largely depends on the complexity of the learning task. A straightforward way to reduce this complexity is to split the task into smaller sub-problems. Whenever this can be done, the performance should lie improved significantly. In this paper, a nature-inspired multi-agent scenario is used to evaluate and compare different distributed LCS variants. Results show that improvements in learning speed can be achieved by cleverly dividing a problem into smaller learning sub-problems.

Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), based on vector space allows the coding of the words semantics by specific statistical computations applied to a large corpus of text. We illustrate how the creation and the use of this emotional conceptual space can provide a framework upon which to build "Latent Semantic Behavior" because it simulates the emotional-associative capabilities of human beings. This approach integrates traditional knowledge representation with intuitive capabilities provided by geometric and sub-symbolic information modeling. To validate the effectiveness of our approach we have simulated an Humanoid Robot Robovie-M on dInfoBots a linux based framework developed in Our Mobile Robot Lab.

We use an array of simple binary switch floor sensors to detect footsteps. Feature analysis and recognition are performed with a fully discriminative Bayesian approach using a Gaussian Process (GP) classifier. We show the usefulness of our probabilistic approach on a large data set consisting of walking sequences of nine different subjects. In addition, we extract novel features and analyse practical issues such as the use of different shoes and walking speeds, which are usually missed in this kind of experiment. Using simple binary sensors and the large nine-person data set, we were able to achieve promising identification results: a 64% total recognition rate for single footstep profiles and an 84% total success rate using longer walking sequences (including 5 - 7-footstep profiles). Finally, we present a context-aware prototype application. It uses person identification and footstep location information to provide reminders to a user.

Using a standard Geiger-Muller counter as sensor, we fingerprint the natural levels of gamma radiation with the aim of then roughly pinpointing the position of a client in terms of interfloor, intrafloor, and in door-versus-outdoor locations. We find that the performance of a machine-learning algorithm in detecting position varies with the building, and is highest for interfloor detection in the case of an old domestic house, while it is highest for intrafloor detection if the floor spans building segments made from different construction materials. Altogether, the technique has lower performance than infrastructure-based localization techniques.

In this paper we propose a novel approach in Opinion Mining which combines Machine Learning models based on traditional textual and graphical clues as well. By examining subjective messages in a given forum topic dealing with a specific voting question, our system makes a prediction about the opinion of unknown people, which can be utilized to predict the forthcoming result of a referendum. The novelty of the work is that beside the regular textual clues (i.e. uni-bigrams), decisions are enhanced by using knowledge derived from a so-called response graph, which represents the interactions between the forum members. Our experimental results showed that with the help of such a graph we were able to achieve better results and significantly outperform the baseline accuracy.

Soft Computing in Intelligent Tutoring Systems and Educational Assessment	SOFT COMPUTING APPLICATIONS IN BUSINESS	Studies in Fuzziness and Soft Computing		English	Article; Book Chapter								The need for soft computing technologies to facilitate effective automated tutoring is pervasive - from machine learning techniques to predict content significance and generate appropriate questions, to interpretation of noisy spoken responses and statistical assessment of the response quality, through user modeling and determining how best to respond to the learner in order to optimize learning gains. This chapter focuses primarily on the domain-independent semantic analysis of learner responses, reviewing prior work in intelligent tutoring systems and educational assessment. We present a new framework for assessing the semantics of learner responses and the results of our initial implementation of a machine learning approach based on this framework.

The proposed relearning and combining ensemble computations are an effective technique for improving accuracy. We develop a new approach to combine kNN classifier based on weighted distance function with relearning and ensemble computations. The combining algorithm shows higher generalization accuracy, compared to other conventional algorithms. First, to improve classification accuracy, a relearning method with genetic algorithm is developed. Second, ensemble computations are followed by the relearning. Experiments have been conducted on some benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The model is appropriate for a Bayesian network implementation and intended as a step toward machine learning of spatial language. It takes its structure from the necessary steps a listener must take in utilising spatial communication and contains as variables parameters derived from the literature concerning characteristics of landmarks for wayfinding as well as reference objects in general. Practical limitations on the implementation and training of the model are discussed.

As a matter of fact, object representation by means of graphs has a number of advantages over feature vectors. Therefore, various algorithms for graph based machine learning have been proposed in the literature. However, in contrast with the emerging interest in graph based representation, a lack of standardized graph data sets for benchmarking can be observed. Common practice is that researchers use their own data sets, and this behavior cumbers the objective evaluation of the proposed methods. In order to make the different approaches in graph based machine learning better comparable, the present paper aims at introducing a repository of graph data sets and corresponding benchmarks, covering a wide spectrum of different applications.

An important aspect of these systems is the reliability against forgery that is surely improved when using multiple sources of biometric information. In such cases combination rules can be applied to fuse the different scores thus obtaining a multibiometric system. In this paper we analyze a method based on margin maximization for building a linear combination of biometric scores. The margin is a central concept in machine learning research and several theoretical results exist which show that improving the, margin on the training set is beneficial for the generalization error of an ensemble of classifiers. Experiments performed on real biometric data and comparisons with other commonly employed fusion rules show that a combination based on margin maximization is particularly effective with respect to other established fusion methods.

The efficiency of any additive modeling technique relies significantly on the choice of the weak learner and the, form of the loss function. In this papers we propose a novel scale-space kernel based approach for additive modeling. Our method applies a. few insights from the well-studied scale-space theory for choosing the optimal learners during different, iterations of the boosting algorithms, which are simple Yet powerful additive modeling met. hods. For each iteration oft, lie additive modeling, weak learners that can best fit the current resolution of the data are chosen and then increase the resolution systematically We demonstrate the result's of the proposed framework oil both synthetic and real datasets taken from the UCI machine learning repository. Though demonstrated specifically in the context of boosting algorithms, our approach is generic enough to be accommodated in general additive modeling techniques. Similarities and distinctions of the proposed algorithm with the popularly used radial basis function networks and wavelet decomposition method are also discussed.

In fact, graphs offer a powerful alternative to feature vectors in pattern recognition, machine learning and related fields. However, the domain of graphs contains very little mathematical structure, and consequently, there is only a limited amount of classification algorithms available. In this paper we survey recent work on graph embedding using dissimilarity representations. Once a population of graphs has been mapped to a vector space by means of this embedding procedure, all classification methods developed in statistical pattern recognition become, directly available. In an experimental evaluation we show that the proposed methodology of first embedding graphs in vector spaces and then applying a statistical classifier has significant potential to outperform classifiers that directly operate in the graph domain. Additionally, the proposed framework can be considered a, contribution towards unifying the domains of structural and statistical pattern recognition.

B		Steinwart, I; Christmann, A				Steinwart, I; Christmann, A		Surrogate Loss Functions (*)	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES	Information Science and Statistics		English	Article; Book Chapter								Overview. In many cases, the loss describing a learning problem is not suitable when designing a learning algorithm. A common approach to resolve this issue is to use a surrogate loss in the algorithm design. For example, we saw in the introduction that SVMs use the convex hinge loss instead of the discontinuous classification loss. The goal of this chapter is to systematically develop a theory that makes it possible to identify suitable surrogate losses for general learning problems. Prerequisites. Besides Chapter 2 and Section A.3.3, only basic mathematical knowledge is required. Usage. Sections 3.1-3.3 and 3.6 provide the theoretical framework required for Sections 3.4, 3.5, and 3.7-3.9, which deal with surrogate losses for common learning scenarios. These examples are important but not essential for classification, regression, and robustness, discussed in Chapters 8, 9, and 10, respectively. On the other hand, most of the material in this chapter is of general interest for machine learning and hence relatively independent of the rest of this book.									0	0	0	SPRINGER	NEW YORK	233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES		978-0-387-77241-7	INFORM SCI STAT			2008							49	110				62	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Mathematics, Applied; Statistics & Probability	Computer Science; Mathematical & Computational Biology; Mathematics	BJX05	WOS:000267334600003

Like many other design departments. we are faced with the challenge to teach machine learning to design students, who often do not have an inherent affinity towards technology. We successfully used the Embodied Intelligence method to teach machine learning to our students. By embodying the learning system into the Lego Mindstorm NXT platform we provide the student with a tangible tool to understand and interact with a learning system. The resulting behavior of the tangible machines in combination with the positive associations with the Lego system motivated all the students. The students with less technology affinity successfully completed the course, while the students with more technology affinity excelled towards solving advanced problems. We believe that our experiences may inform and guide other teachers that intend to teach machine learning, or other computer science related topics. to design students.

However, designing Such algorithms in the framework of kernel methods has proven to be challenging. In this paper, we address AUC maximization with the regularized least-squares (RLS) algorithm also known as the least-squares Support vector machine. First. we introduce RLS-type binary classifier that maximizes all approximation of AUC and has a closed-form solution. Second, we show that this AUC-RLS algorithm is computationally as efficient as the standard RLS algorithm that maximizes an approximation of the accuracy. Third, we compare the performance of these two algorithms in the task of assigning topic labels for newswire articles in terms of AUC. Our algorithm outperforms the standard RLS in every classification experiment conducted. The performance gains are most substantial when the distribution of the class labels is unbalanced. In conclusion, modifying the RLS algorithm to maximize the approximation of AUC does not increase the computational complexity, and this alteration enhances the quality of the classifier.

This talk describes a "direct modeling" approach, which does not require any hand-labeling of" prosodic events. Instead, prosodic features are extracted directly from the speech signal, based on time alignments from automatic speech recognition. Machine learning techniques then determine a prosodic model. and the model is integrated with lexical and other information to predict the target classes of interest. The talk presents a general method for prosodic feature extraction and design (including a special-purpose tool developed at SRI), and illustrates how it can he successfully applied in three different types of tasks: (1) detection of sentence or dialog act boundaries; (2) classification of emotion and affect, and (3) speaker classification.

We argue that, while the literature has suggested the use of lexical features is inappropriate for sentiment detection, a careful and thorough evaluation reveals it less clear-cut state of affairs. We present results from live classifiers using word-based features oil three tasks, and show that the variation between classifiers can often be as great as has been reported between different feature sets with a fixed classifier. We are thus led to conclude that classifier choice plays at least as important a role as feature choice, and that in many cases word-based classifiers perform well on the sentiment detection task.

This problem has various applications in bioinformatics, machine learning and databases and its (in)approximability remains open. In this paper, we show that for a wide range of choices of S, specifically when vertical bar min S/max S vertical bar is an element of Omega(eta(delta-1/2)) boolean AND O(eta(1/2-delta)) (where eta = max{vertical bar V-1 vertical bar, vertical bar V-2 vertical bar}, and delta is an element of (0, 1/2]), no polynomial time algorithm can approximate S-MWEB within a factor of n(epsilon) for some epsilon > 0 unless RP = NP. This hardness result gives justification of the heuristic approaches adopted for various applied problems in the aforementioned areas, and indicates that good approximation algorithms are unlikely to exist. Specifically, we give two applications by showing that: 1) finding statistically significant biclusters in the SAMBA model, proposed in [18] for the analysis of microarray data, is n(epsilon)-inapproximable, and 2) no polynomial time algorithm exists for the Minimum Description Length with Holes problem [4] unless RP = NP.

In this study, we propose a combined filter method (ReliefF) and a wrapper method (memetic algorithm, AM) for classification. The goal of our method is to filter the irrelevant features and select the most important feature subsets. We used the ReliefF algorithm to calculate and update the scores of every feature for each data set, and then applied a AM for feature selection. The K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) method with leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) serves as a classifier for evaluating classification accuracies. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to existing methods in terms of classification accuracy.

Although there are many studies regarding financial decision-making problems, such as bankruptcy prediction and credit scoring, there is no research, to our knowledge, about dividend prediction or dividend policy forecasting using machine learning approaches in spite of the significance of dividends. For dealing with the above issues, we suggest a knowledge refinement model that can refine the multiple rules extracted through rule-based algorithms from dividend data sets using GA. The new technique, called 'GAKR (genetic algorithm knowledge refinement), aims to combine the advantages of both knowledge consolidation and genetic algorithm. The experiments show that GAKR model always outperforms other models in the performance of dividend policy forecasting; we can predict future dividend policy more correctly than any other models. This enhancement in predictability of future dividend policy can significantly contribute to the valuation of a company, and hence from investors to financial managers to any decision makers of a company can make use of GAKR model for the better financing and investing decision makings which can lead to higher profits and firm values eventually.

With the fast developing of World Wide Web applications, sentiment classification would have huge opportunity to help people automatic analysis of customers' opinions from the web information. Automatic opinion mining will benefit to both decision maker and ordinary people. Up to now, it is still a complicated task with great challenge. There are mainly two types of approaches for sentiment classification, machine learning methods and semantic orientation methods. Though some pioneer researches explored the approaches for English reviews classification, few jobs have been done on sentiment classification for Chinese reviews. The machine learning approach Based on string kernel for sentiment classification on reviews written in Chinese was proposed in this paper. Data experiment shows the capability of this approach.

On the other hand, the challenge schemes focus on prefetching techniques. Prefetching becomes very popular to predict the possibility of which web object could be requested in near future. This paper present the prediction for web caching model, which apply web mining and machine learning techniques for prediction in prefetching and caching. Interval period time of reordering web object requested information from web logs have been analyzed and apply statistical techniques to produce useful information to predict future requested. The prediction-based model was integrated with caching management policy. Simulation experiment results show potential improvement both hit ratio and byte hit ratio.

Airborne LiDAR surveys sample forest stands at much finer spatial resolution and broader spatial extent than is practical on the ground. In this paper, we developed models that leverage spatially intensive and extensive LiDAR data and a stratified random sample of field plots across two mixed conifer forest landscapes in north-central Idaho. Our objective was to compare alternative models for producing unbiased maps of basal area per acre (BAA; ft2/acre), towards the greater goal of developing more accurate and efficient inventory techniques. We generated 60 topographic or stand structure metrics from LiDAR that were used as candidate predictor variables for modeling and mapping BAA at the scale of 30m pixels. Tree diameters were tallied in 1/10 and 1/5 acre fixed-radius plots (N = 165). Four models are presented, all based on 12 predictor variables. The first imputes BAA as an auxiliary variable from an imputation model that uses the machine learning algorithm randomForest in classification mode, and was developed in a prior study to map species-level basal areas of 11 conifer species; the second uses randomForest in regression mode to predict BAA as a single response variable from these same 12 predictor variables. The third is a linear regression model that predicts In-transformed BAA using a best subset of 12 different predictor variables; the fourth again uses randomForest in regression mode, based on the same best subset of 12 variables selected for the linear regression model. We aggregated the pixel-level predictions within industrial forest stand boundaries, and then used equivalence plots to evaluate how well the aggregated predictions matched independent stand exams (having projected the tree growth in FVS and updated the stand tables to July 2003, the time of the LiDAR acquisition). All four models overpredicted BAA, but the bias was significant only in the case of the regression model. Predictions from the two randomForest models run in regression mode were very similar, despite using different predictor variables. We conclude that randomForest can be used to impute or predict canopy structure information from LiDAR-derived topographic and structural metrics with sufficient accuracy for operational management of conifer forests. In the future, tree lists could be imputed from LiDAR-derived canopy structure metrics empirically related to plot-level tree measurements. This will allow projections of tree growth at the pixel level across forested landscapes, instead of at the stand level as is the current norm.

Characteristics of genomic signatures derived using univariate methods and mechanistically anchored functional descriptors for predicting drug- and xenobiotic-induced nephrotoxicity	TOXICOLOGY MECHANISMS AND METHODS			English	Article						canonical pathway maps; enrichment analysis; feature selection; functional; Descriptors; Multivariate analysis; out-of-bag validation; renal tubular toxicity; signatures; univariate analysis	GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; MICROARRAY DATA; TOXICITY; ONTOLOGY; TOXICOGENOMICS; CLASSIFICATION; MECHANISMS; PROFILES; IDENTIFICATION; BIOCONDUCTOR	The ideal toxicity biomarker is composed of the properties of prediction (is detected prior to traditional pathological signs of injury), accuracy (high sensitivity and specificity), and mechanistic relationships to the endpoint measured (biological relevance). Gene expression-based toxicity biomarkers ("signatures") have shown good predictive power and accuracy, but are difficult to interpret biologically. We have compared different statistical methods of feature selection with knowledge-based approaches, using GeneGo's database of canonical pathway maps, to generate gene sets for the classification of renal tubule toxicity. The gene set selection algorithms include four univariate analyses: t-statistics, fold-change, B-statistics, and RankProd, and their combination and overlap for the identification of differentially expressed probes. Enrichment analysis following the results of the four univariate analyses, Hotelling T-square test, and, finally out-of-bag selection, a variant of cross-validation, were used to identify canonical pathway maps - sets of genes coordinately involved in key biological processes - with classification power. Differentially expressed genes identified by the different statistical univariate analyses all generated reasonably performing classifiers of tubule toxicity. Maps identified by enrichment analysis or Hotelling T-square had lower classification power, but highlighted perturbed lipid homeostasis as a common discriminator of nephrotoxic treatments. The out-of-bag method yielded the best functionally integrated classifier. The map "ephrins signaling" performed comparably to a classifier derived using sparse linear programming, a machine learning algorithm, and represents a signaling network specifically involved in renal tubule development and integrity. Such functional descriptors of toxicity promise to better integrate predictive toxicogenomics with mechanistic analysis, facilitating the interpretation and risk assessment of predictive genomic investigations.

J	Xiao, J; Borgnat, P; Flandrin, P				Xiao, Jun; Borgnat, Pierre; Flandrin, Patrick			On a time-frequency test of stationarity	TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL			French	Article						Time-frequency; stationarity; test; surrogates	SURROGATE DATA; NONLINEARITY; SPECTRUM	Introduction Whereas the usual concept of stationarity is a stochastic one that is well-defined (as the strict invariance of statistical properties with respect to some absolute time), its practical use is somewhat different, taking often into account though implicitly - observation scales or frequency bands, as well as accommodating for periodicities in deterministic signals. As for the notion of dimension that may vary depending on the observation scale [3], it thus turns out that the very same signal can be considered as stationary or not, depending on the way we look at it. A typical example is given by speech that is usually considered as nonstationary (resp. stationary) at the scale of some seconds (resp, tens of milliseconds), while turning again to nonstationary at the scale of a few milliseconds within voiced segments. Recognizing this situation calls therefore for an operational framework aimed at making of stationarity a relative concept by incorporating the observation scale in its definition, while encompassing in a common perspective stochastic and deterministic descriptions. Revisiting this way the concept of stationarity, the purpose of this paper is to go further by designing a meaningful test for its assessment. General framework The rationale of the proposed approach is based on the fact that, in both stochastic and deterministic contexts, a signature of ''stationarity'' is that a well-defined time-varying spectrum just reduces to the the ordinary spectrum at all time instants [1]. Time-frequency The first ingredient is therefore a suitable time-varying spectrum, here chosen as the Wigner-Ville spectrum estimated by means of multitaper spectrograms, see eq.(1), for a sake of variance reduction without some extra time averaging that would possibly smooth out nonstationarities [6,7]. Surrogates Given an observation scale, the basic idea is to characterize stationarity as the identity between local features (frequency slices) of the time-varying spectrum and global ones obtained by marginalization [2,4,5]. In practice, the difference will never be zero and, to give it a statistical significance, it is proposed to create from the data itself a stationarized reference. This is achieved by the technique of surrogate data [8,9,10] that essentially amounts to scramble the spectrum phase (in which possible nonstationarities are coded) of the signal under test while keeping its magnitude unchanged, see Figure 1. Distances Differences between local and global spectral properties are quantified by means of a dissimilarity measure [11], see eq.(2). A companion study has evidenced that a good choice is to mix a Kullback-Leibler divergence with a log-spectral deviation [12]. Stationarity test Principle The stationarity test itself is described in eqs.(3)-(6), with the threshold 7 derived from the empirical distribution attached to the surrogates features. Null hypothesis of stationarity An experimental study shows that the above mentioned distribution can be fairly well approximated by a Gamma distribution (see Figure 2), allowing for a parametric approach. As evidenced in Figures 3 and 4 for various window lengths, the maximum likelihood estimation of the two Gamma parameters converge quickly to an asymptotic value-of-thumb, the value J similar to 50 can be retained for a good when the number of surrogates J is increased. As a rule trade-off between complexity and accuracy. Recalling that surrogates are supposed to define the null hypothesis of stationarity, it is worth checking that, in a stationary situation, the test behaves as expected from the viewpoint of the imposed false alarm rate fixed by the threshold. This is illustrated in Figure 5 (Monte-Carlo simulation with an AR(2) model), with a result that is slightly pessimistic, the observed false alarm being of about 6.5% for a confidence level fixed to 5%. Index and scale of nonstationarity Beyond its binary nature, the test defined in eq.(6) also allows for a quantified measure of a degree of nonstationarity according to eq.(7). Moreover, since the overall procedure is dependent on the spectrogram window length, it is also possible to conduct the test for a family of such window lengths, ending up with a typical scale of nonstationarity as in eq. (8). Example Figure 6 provides an example aimed at supporting the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The analyzed signal consists in the superimposition of two components, one of which being a tone that can be considered as stationary whatever the observation scale is whereas the second one is a sinus FM whose (non) stationary character depends on the observation scale. Running the test in the two corresponding subbands as a function of both the observation length N(x) and the relative analysis scale N(h)/N(x) ends up with results in clear agreement with physical interpretation. Conclusion A new approach has been proposed for testing stationarity relatively to an observation scale. The approach operates in the time-frequency plane by comparing local and global features, the null hypothesis of stationarity being characterized by surrogate data directly derived from the data under test. The method reported here is basically based on distances but it allows for a number of variations, such as the recourse to machine learning methods (one-class SVM [13]) by considering the family of surrogates as a learning set.

J	Honeine, P; Richard, C				Honeine, Paul; Richard, Cedric			Optimizing time-frequency representations for signal classification using radially Gaussian kernels	TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL			French	Article						Time-frequency analysis; classification; radially Gaussian kernel; kernel-target alignment; machine learning	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES	Time-frequency and time-scale distributions offer a broad class of tools for nonstationary signal analysis. The price to pay is however the choice of a well-adapted, possibly signal-dependent, representation. Time-frequency distributions with radially Gaussian kernel (RGK) provide tunable representations for a large class of applications. This parameterization was initially introduced by Baraniuk and Jones in [1] for reducing interference terms in time-frequency distributions. The RGK has attracted the attention of many researchers since this pioneering work, for instance [3] where it is optimized for a given classification problem. However, all these works do not necessarily take advantage of the recent developments in pattern recognition with kernel machines. This paper provides a connection between the optimization of RGK for classifying non-stationary signals and some criteria coming from the machine learning literature. We consider more specifically the kernel-target alignment, a criterion that allows to select optimal reproducing kernels. We show that this criterion leads to an optimization problem similar to that initially proposed by Baraniuk and Jones for signal analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the relevance of our approach. Over the last decade, a wide class of pattern recognition algorithms based on the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces have been proposed, with improved performance and low computational complexity. The latter is mainly due to the kernel trick, a key idea that allows to transform any conventional linear technique into a nonlinear one if it can be expressed only in terms of inner products. It suffices to replace them by a reproducing kernel, since it corresponds to an inner product between data mapped (implicitly) into a nonlinearly transformed space. Most popular kernel machines include the Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification and regression [9], kernel principal component analysis [9] and kernel Fisher discriminant analysis [10]. Recently, we have presented in [13, 14] a new framework for nonstationary signal classification and analysis based on machine learning considerations. For this purpose, we considered the Cohen's class of time-frequency distributions as a natural choice for nonlinear transformations to be applied to nonstationary signals. It can be shown that the reproducing kernel associated to these spaces of representations can be written as (17). Here Pi is the parameterizing function of the time-frequency distribution, expressed in polar coordinates, and A(x) the ambiguity function. The cumbersome optimization of the two-dimensional function Pi can be overcome by using the RGK, which is of the form Pi sigma (r,theta) = e(-r2/2 sigma 2(theta)). By injecting this expression into the general form of the reproducing kernel defined in (17), we get (18). Equivalently, by considering the discretization recommended in [16] that involves polar coordinates, we get (19) where Delta(r) = 2 root pi/l with l the signal length. By considering such a reproducing kernel, we can therefore use the most effective and innovative kernel machines to process time-frequency representations. We can also take advantage of the large spectrum of kernel selection criteria in the machine learning literature to optimize time-frequency representations. In what follows, we study one particular criterion, the kernel-target alignment. Introduced by Cristianini et al. in [30], the alignment is a measure of similarity between two reproducing kernels, or between a reproducing kernel and a target function. Given a learning set, the alignment between two kernels kappa(1) and kappa(2) is defined by (20) where <. , .>(F) is the Frobenius inner product, and K(1) and K(2) the Gram matrices with (i, j)-th entries kappa(1)(x(i), x(j)) and kappa(2)(x(i), x(j)). In [20, 30], Cristianini et al. suggest to determine the optimal reproducing kernel for a given classification problem as the one that maximizes the alignment with an ideal kernel. The ideal kernel for a bi-class problem is the one that transforms each x(i) into its label y(i). The (i,j)-th entry of the resulting ideal Gram matrix then is y(i)y(j). Therefore the kernel-target alignment criterion applied to a sigma-tunable kernel is given by (22), namely, sigma* = arg max(sigma) (K(sigma),K*)(F/n) parallel to K(sigma)parallel to(F) where K(sigma) denotes the Gram matrix of the tunable kernel and K* the ideal target matrix. By considering the reproducing kernel associated with the RGK time-frequency distribution, we can further simplify the resulting optimization problem. For this purpose, we can write it as an optimization problem that consists of maximizing the numerator of the objective function in (22) subject to setting its denominator to a constant. This optimization problem is given by (23) subject to (24), where nu(0) is a normalization parameter. By injecting the RGK-based reproducing kernel, we can write the objective function as (25). We get an objective function similar to the one proposed in [1] within a signal analysis context. The signal-dependent entry in the latter, say vertical bar A(x)(r,theta)vertical bar(2), is substituted here by the so-called equivalent representation defined by vertical bar A(eq)(r,theta)vertical bar(2) = Sigma(i,j) y(i)y(j) A(xi)(r, theta) (A) over barx(j) (r, theta). We can therefore take advantage of the alternate-projection technique proposed in [1]. In particular, we relax the constraint (24) and replace it with a low-cost computation constraint on the volume of the parameter function as follows: integral sigma(2)(theta)d theta = upsilon(0)'. Compared with [1], it is worth noting that the computational complexity of the technique remains unchanged once we have evaluated the equivalent representation. In order to solve the optimization problem, we consider an alternate-projecting technique inspired from [1] with two updating rules at each iteration. Let sigma(k) be the bandwidth parameter at iteration k. At iteration k + 1, we perform a gradient ascent update using expression (28), where mu(k) is the step-size parameter controlling the convergence of the algorithm, and f the objective function to be maximized in (26). The gradient of f is defined by the vector of entries given by expression (29) for theta = 0, 1, ... ,l - 1. In order to take into account the constraint in the optimization problem, we project the solution onto the set of admissible functions. This can be implemented by normalizing sigma(k+1)(theta) at each iteration step with parallel to sigma(k+1) (theta)parallel to/upsilon(0)'. In order to illustrate the relevance of our approach, we propose to study two classification problems. Each one consists of two classes of two hundred 64-sample signals with a linear frequency modulation embedded in a white Gaussian noise. The signal-to-noise ratio is approximately -8 dB. In the first problem, signals are characterized by an increasing frequency modulation, from 0.1 to 0.25 for the first class, and from 0.25 to 0.4 for the second one. In the second problem, signals are characterized by an increasing frequency modulation from 0.1 to 0.4, and by a decreasing one from 0.4 to 0.1. Figure 1 shows the resulting RGK parameterization function. We observe that the regions in the Doppler-lag plan are relevant for the classification problems we have considered. The convergence of the algorithm is illustrated in Figure 2 where we show, at each iteration, the value of the alignment, averaged over 20 trials. In order to illustrate the relevance of the proposed method, we estimate the generalization error of an SVM classifier associated with the reproducing kernel resulting from our approach, and we compare it with the one associated with the Wigner distribution. Table 1 shows that not only the classification error is reduced compared to the Wigner distribution, but also the number of Support Vectors which is divided by two.

New forms of mathematics are sought, collectively known as denotational mathematics, in order to deal with complex mathematical entities emerged in cognitive informatics, computational intelligence, software engineering, and knowledge engineering. The domain and architecture of denotational mathematics are presented in this paper. Three paradigms of denotational mathematics, known as concept algebra, system algebra, and Real-Time Process Algebra (RTPA), are introduced. Applications of denotational mathematics in cognitive informatics and computational intelligence are elaborated. A set of case studies is presented on the modeling of iterative and recursive systems architectures and behaviors by RTPA, the modeling of autonomic machine learning by concept algebra, and the modeling of granular computing by system algebra.

An algorithm typically selects attributes based solely on their statistical characteristics, without considering their semantic interpretations. In order to resolve difficulties associated with this unrealistic assumption, many researchers attempted to introduce user judgements of the importance of attributes into machine learning. However, there is still a lack of formal framework. Based on decision theory and measurement theory, a model of user-oriented reduct construction is proposed for machine learning by considering the user preference of attributes. It seamlessly combines internal information and external information. User preferences of attributes are extended to user preferences of attribute sets. Accordingly, user preferred reducts can be constructed.

The primary form of context for this system is the user's Propulsion pattern. The contexts of self vs. external propulsion and the surface over which propulsion is occurring can be used to improve the accuracy of the system's propulsion pattern classifications. To obtain these forms of context, we explore the use of both wearable and wheelchair-mounted accelerometers. We show achievable accuracy rates of up to 80-90% for all desired contextual information using two common machine learning techniques: k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

We first consider an important class of machine learning algorithms - large margin classifiers, such as Support Vector Machines. The notion of margin complexity quantifies the extent to which a given class of functions can be learned by large margin classifiers. We prove that up to a small multiplicative constant, margin complexity is equal to the inverse of discrepancy. This establishes a strong tie between seemingly very different notions from two distinct areas. In the same way that matrix rigidity is related to rank, we introduce the notion of rigidity of margin complexity. We prove that sign matrices with small margin complexity rigidity are very rare. This leads to the question of proving lower bounds on the rigidity of margin complexity. Quite surprisingly, this question turns out to be closely related to basic open problems in communication complexity, e.g., whether PSPACE can be separated from the polynomial hierarchy in communication complexity. There are numerous known relations between the field of learning theory and that of communication complexity [6, 9, 25, 15], as one might expect since communication is an inherent aspect of learning.

Multi-objects recognition for distributed intelligent sensor networks - art. no. 69630R	UNATTENDED GROUND, SEA, AND AIR SENSOR TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS X	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE)		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Unattended Ground, Sea, and Air Sensor Technologies and Applications X	MAR 17-20, 2008	Orlando, FL	SPIE		multi-objects recognition; mobile sensor networks; feature extraction; data mining; machine learning		This paper proposes an innovative approach for multi-objects recognition for homeland security and defense based intelligent sensor networks. Unlike the conventional way of information analysis, data mining in such networks is typically characterized with high information ambiguity/uncertainty, data redundancy, high dimensionality and real-time constrains. Furthermore, since a typical military based network normally includes multiple mobile sensor platforms, ground forces, fortified tanks, combat flights, and other resources, it is critical to develop intelligent data mining approaches to fuse different information resources to understand dynamic environments, to support decision making processes, and finally to achieve the goals. This paper aims to address these issues with a focus on multi-objects recognition. Instead of classifying a single object as in the traditional image classification problems, the proposed method can automatically learn multiple objectives simultaneously. Image segmentation techniques are used to identify the interesting regions in the field, which correspond to multiple objects such as soldiers or tanks. Since different objects will come with different feature sizes, we propose a feature scaling method to represent each object in the same number of dimensions. This is achieved by linear/nonlinear scaling and sampling techniques. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) based learning algorithms are developed to learn and build the associations for different objects, and such knowledge will be adaptively accumulated for objects recognition in the testing stage. We test the effectiveness of proposed method in different simulated military environments.

The Semantic Web provides standardized formats for the representation of both data and ontological background knowledge. Semantic Web standards are used to describe meta data but also have great potential as a general data format for data communication and data integration. Within a broad range of possible applications machine learning will play an increasingly important role: Machine learning solutions have been developed to support the management of ontologies, for the semi-automatic annotation of unstructured data, and to integrate semantic information into web mining. Machine learning will increasingly be employed to analyze distributed data sources described in Semantic Web formats and to support approximate Semantic Web reasoning and querying. In this paper we discuss existing and future applications of machine learning on the Semantic Web with a strong focus on learning algorithms that are suitable for the relational character of the Semantic Web's data structure. We discuss some of the particular aspects of learning that we expect will be of relevance for the Semantic Web such as scalability, missing and contradicting data. and the potential to integrate ontological background knowledge. In addition we review some of the work on the learning of ontologies and on the population of ontologies, mostly in the context of textual data.

It is inherent to the ontology learning process that the acquired ontologies represent uncertain and possibly contradicting knowledge. From a logical perspective, the learned ontologies are potentially inconsistent knowledge bases, that as such do not allow for meaningful reasoning. In this paper, we present an approach to generating consistent OWL ontologies from automatically generated or enriched ontology models, which takes into account the uncertainty of the acquired knowledge. We illustrate and evaluate the application of our approach with two experiments in the scenarios of consistent evolution of learned ontologies and enrichment of ontologies with disjointness axioms.

Management of the requisite number of degrees of freedom, however, remains a challenge, as does the ability of an operator to transfer behavioral intent from human to robot. This paper reviews American Android research funded by NASA, DARPA, and the U.S. Army that attempts to address these issues. Limb coordination technology, an iterative form of inverse kinematics, provides a fundamental ability to control balance and posture independently in highly redundant systems. Goal positions and orientations of distal points of the robot skeleton, such as the hands and feet of a humanoid robot, become variable constraints, as does center-of-gravity position. Behaviors utilize these goals to synthesize full-body motion. Biped walking, crawling and grasping are illustrated, and behavior parameterization, layering and portability are discussed. Robotic skill acquisition enables a show-and-tell approach to behavior modification. Declarative rules built verbally by an operator in the field define nominal task plans, and neural networks trained with verbal, manual and visual signals provide additional behavior shaping. Anticipated benefits of the resultant adaptive collaborative controller for unmanned ground vehicles include increased robot autonomy, reduced operator workload and reduced operator training and skill requirements.

The machine perception lab at UC San Diego has developed a system based on machine learning for fully automated detection of 30 actions from the facial action coding system (FACS). The system, called Computer Expression Recognition Toolbox (CERT), operates in real-time and is robust to the video conditions in real applications. This paper describes two experiments which are the first applications of this system to analyzing spontaneous human behavior: Automated discrimination of posed from genuine expressions of pain, and automated detection of driver drowsiness. The analysis revealcd information about facial behavior during these conditions that were previously unknown, including the coupling of movements. Automated classifiers were able to differentiate real from fake pain significantly better than na:fve human subjects, and to detect critical drowsiness above 98% accuracy. Issues for application of machine learning systems to facial expression analysis are discussed.

Error Correcting Output Codes technique (ECOC) represents a general framework capable to extend any binary classification process to the multi-class case. In this work, we present a novel decoding strategy that takes advantage of the ECOC coding to outperform the up to now existing decoding strategies. The novel decoding strategy is applied to the state-of-the-art coding designs, extensively tested on the UCI Machine Learning repository database and in two real vision applications: tissue characterization in medical images and traffic sign categorization. The results show that the presented methodology considerably increases the performance of the traditional ECOC strategies and the state-of-the-art multi-classifiers.

However a little is known about the visual influence of the traffic sign environment on how it will be perceived. Computer estimation of the conspicuity from images using a camera mounted on a vehicle is thus of importance in order to be able to quickly make a diagnosis regarding conspicuity of traffic signs. Unfortunately, our knowledge about the human visual processing system is rather incomplete and thus conspicuity visual mechanisms remain poorly understood. A complete model for conspicuity is not known, only specific features are known to be of importance. It makes sense to assume that an important task for drivers is to search for traffic signs. We therefore propose a new paradigm for conspicuity estimation in search tasks based on statistical learning of the visual features of the object of interest.

However, the final results are often obtained from the alarms produced by the classifiers through a post-processing which typically relies on ad hoe heuristics. Spatially close alarms are assumed to be triggered by the same target and grouped together. Here we replace those heuristics by a principled Bayesian approach, which uses knowledge about both the classifier response model and the scene geometry to combine multiple classification answers. We demonstrate its effectiveness for multi-view pedestrian detection. We estimate the marginal probabilities of presence of people at any location in a scene, given the responses of classifiers evaluated in each view. Our approach naturally takes into account both the occlusions and the very low metric accuracy of the classifiers due to their invariance to translation and scale. Results show our method produces one order of magnitude fewer false positives than a method that is representative of typical state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, the framework we propose is generic and could be applied to any detection-by-classification task.

One of the bottlenecks of such application is a robust real-time optical markerless tracking strategy. In this paper we focus on the development of tracking by detection for plane homography estimation. Feature or keypoint matching is a critical task in such approach. We propose to apply machine learning techniques to solve this problem. We present an evaluation of an optical tracking implementation based on Random Forest classifier. The implementation has been successfully applied to indoor and outdoor augmented reality design review application.

Here, we present a learning model that automatically extracts measurements of facial features from raw images and obtains human-level performance in predicting facial attractiveness ratings. The machine's ratings are highly correlated with mean human ratings, markedly improving on recent machine learning studies of this task. simulated psychophysical experiments with virtually manipulated images reveal preferences in the machine's judgments that are remarkably similar to those of humans. Thus, a model trained explicitly to capture a specific operational performance criteria, implicitly captures basic human psychophysical characteristics. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

At high levels of quantization, block-wise motion compensation and transform produces blocking artifacts in the decoded video, a form of distortion to which the human visual system is very sensitive. The latest video coding standard, H.264/AVC, introduces a deblocking filter to reduce the blocking artifacts. However, there is still visible distortion after the filtering when compared to the original video. In this paper, we propose a non-conventional filter to further reduce the distortion and to improve the decoded picture quality. Different from conventional filters, the proposed filter is based on a machine learning algorithm (decision tree). The decision trees are used to classify the filter's inputs and select the best filter coefficients for the inputs. Experimental results with 4 x 4 DCT indicate that using the filter holds promise in improving the quality of H.264/AVC video sequences.

In this talk, I will point out a few important directions for advancing the visualization technology, which include parallel visualization, knowledge-assisted visualization, intelligent visualization, and in situ visualization. I will use some of the projects we have done at UC Davis in my discussion.

This paper describes the top-level view (time series 3D AlertGraph) with the integration of alert classification to visualise Snort alerts. The advantages of using this view are (1) It summarised the alerts into different colours to indicate the quantity of alerts from (SRCIP, DPORT) pairs; (2) It used alert classification to highlight the true alerts; (3) Through interaction tools, the alerts can be highlighted according to the source IP, destination IP or destination port;. (4) A large numbers of alerts can be viewed in a single display and (5) A temporal characteristic of attacks can be discovered.

Unlike conventional diagnostic approaches, in this method instead of focusing on system residuals at one or a few operating points, diagnosis is done by analyzing system behavior patterns over a window of operation. It is shown how this approach can loosen the dependency of diagnostic methods on precise system modeling while maintaining the desired characteristics of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) tools (fault isolation, robustness, adaptability, and scalability) at a satisfactory level. As an example, the method is applied to fault diagnosis in HVAC systems, an area with considerable modeling and sensor network constraints.

The paper reports on experimental work concerning testing various benchmark machine-learning algorithms and attribute preprocessing techniques in the context of behavioural targeting. Our final goal is to build a system which automatically learns and subsequently decides which on-fine advertisements to present to a user visiting a web page, based on his previous recorded behaviour, in order to maximise the revenue of the ad-network and the web site hosting the ad, and, at the same time, to minimise the user's annoyance caused by potentially inappropriate advertisements. We present a general adaptive model which makes it possible to test various machine-learning algorithms in a plug-in mode and its implementation. We also report our experimental work concerning comparison of the performance of various machine-learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques on a real dataset. The performance of our experiments is evaluated by some objective metrics such as the click-through rate (CTR) or related. Our experimental results clearly indicate that the presented adaptive system can significantly increase the CTR. metric by 40% for some settings. All the experiments are performed on a real industrial dataset concerning on-line ads emitted in the Polish Web during a 1-month period in 2007. Up to the authors' best knowledge this is the first and largest evaluation made on this kind of real industrial data in Poland, at the time of writing.

Rule-based misuse detection systems use a set of rules or signatures to detect attacks that exploit a particular vulnerability. These rules have to be hand-coded by experts to properly identify vulnerabilities, which results in misuse detection systems having limited extensibility. This paper proposes a machine learning layer on top of a rule-based misuse detection system that provides automatic generation of detection rules, prediction verification and assisted classification of new data. Our system offers an overall good performance, while adding an heuristic and adaptive approach to existing rule-based misuse detection systems.

While there are many tools that can be used for learning domain ontologies for English, when learning domain specific ontologies for Romanian, we face a lack of available tools and resources. Moreover, due to the complexity of the Romanian grammar, processing of Romanian text corpora is also difficult. This paper focuses on building a domain specific ontology for the Romanian language using machine learning techniques. The taxonomy learning process is based on an unsupervised neural network. The resulting modules are intended to be used for semantic annotations of traceability services in meat industry.

In this paper. we propose an in-network optimization algorithm based oil Nelder-Mead simplex to incrementally do regression analysis over distributed data. Then, we improve the resulted regressor by the application of boosting concept from machine learning theory. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm not only increases accuracy but is also more efficient in terms of communication compared to its gradient based counterparts.

Original time-domain samples are normalized and pre-processed by applying discrete Fourier transformation for speech feature extraction. In frequency domain, high degree of correlation was found for the same words spoken by different speakers. This helped produce models with high recognition accuracy. Details of model realization in MATLAB are included in this paper. Current work is being extended using linear predictive coding for efficient hardware implementation.

Several modeling techniques including Boolean, settheoretic, vector space, and probabilistic models studied. In this paper, we first describe the concept of "LSA" and then present the preliminary results of an exploratory study. We carried out a small-scale bibliometric analysis to find out the impact of LSA on various scientific and technological fields. We downloaded bibliographic records with "Latent Semantic Analysis" in their titles from Thomson's Science Citation Index Expanded and used Bibexcel and Pajek to perform several bibliometric and network analyses such as co-citation, co-authorship and co-word. It appears that LSA has had an impact on a wide variety of scientific disciplines from discourse analysis to cognitive science to machine learning.

The ability of missing data handling has become a fundamental requirement for pattern classification because an inappropriate treatment may cause large errors or false results on classification. The absence of certain values for relevant data attributes can seriously affect the accuracy of classification results. The goal of this paper is to analyze the missing data problem in pattern classification, and to make a descriptive survey of machine learning solutions for performing incomplete pattern classification tasks.

Machine learning or data mining methods can identify new or unknown malicious executables with some degree of success. Feature set is a key to apply data mining or machine learning to successfully detect malicious executables. In this paper, we present an approach that conducts an exhaustive feature search on a set of malicious executables and strives to obviate over-fitting. To improve the performance of Bayesian classifier, we present a novel algorithm called Half Increment Naive Bayes(HIB), which selects the features by carrying an evolutional search. We also evaluate the predictive power of a classifier, and we show that our classifier yields high detection rates and learning speed.

The first procedure is a filter method and the second is a hybrid method that combines the former method with a sequential forward selection (SFS), which is a wrapper method. Three classifiers; LDA, KNN and RPART, are used along with the wrapper method. Comparisons with the RELIEF and the usual SFS method are carried out on twelve well-known Machine Learning datusets. The experimental results show that our filter method outperforms the RELIEF, regarding both the misclassification error rate and the running time. Our hybrid method is faster than the SITS and it gives misclassification error rates quite similar to those given by the SFS.

Some of these correlations no longer hold when there is an error in the system, potentially enabling error detection and fault diagnosis. However existing approaches are inefficient, requiring a large number of metrics to be monitored and ignoring the relative discriminative properties of different metric correlations. In enterprise-software systems, similar faults tend to reoccur It is therefore possible to significantly improve existing correlation-analysis approaches by learning the effects of common recurrent faults on correlations. We present methods to determine the most significant correlations to track for efficient error detection, and the correlations that contribute the most to diagnosis accuracy. We apply machine learning to identify the relevant correlations, removing the need for manually configured correlation thresholds, as used in the prior approaches. We validate our work on a multi-tier enterprise-software system. We are able to detect and correctly diagnose 8 of 10 injected faults to within three possible causes, and to within two in 7 out of 8 cases. This compares favourably with the existing approaches whose diagnosis accuracy is 3 out of 10 to within 3 possible causes. We achieve a precision of at least 95%.

However, manual construction of domain ontology is very labour intensive and time consuming. This paper illustrates a novel ontology population method for semi-automatic business knowledge acquisition from text. In particular, the proposed method is underpinned by the effective SM-struct algorithm which treats ontology population as a sequence labelling problem. By automatically exploring taxonomy knowledge captured in domain ontology, our ontology population method can effectively classify objects to multiple categories. The initial experimental results show that the SVM-struct based ontology population method which utilizes taxonomy knowledge outperforms other traditional methods in a benchmark ontology population task.

The proposed majority undersampling technique mimics evolution for selectivety removing fault-prone instances from the training dataset; thus, working toward reducing class imbalance between the fault-prone and not-fault-prone classed of program modules. Software measurement and defect data of a real-world mission software project is used to evaluate the benefits of software quality modeling in conjunction with the proposed data sampling approach. Practical merit is provided by comparing our proposed technique with random undersampling, an existing and commonly used data sampling technique for addressing class imbalance. In the context of three different classifier-performance measures, the proposed approach is shown to outper-form both modeling with random undersampling and modeling without any data sampling.

With respect to a static strong classifier the on-line algorithm updates the ensemble using new incoming samples. This idea has been successfully exploited in tasks such as detection and tracking as a classification problem with good results. Our purpose is to provide an efficient and robust framework to build a cascade of on-line updated classifiers that, speeding up the application time, allows the employment of a higher number of features, thus achieving better detection performance.

It has been shown that associative classifiers often outperform traditional classifiers. Associative classifiers usually find only rules with high support values, because reducing the minimum support to be satisfied increases computational cost. However, rules with low support but high confidence may contribute to classification. We have proposed an approach to build a classifier composed of almost all consistent (100% confident) rules. The proposed classifier was extended by introducing item reduction and bagging in order to relax the constraint of consistency, which resulted in slightly increased performance for 26 datasets from the UCI machine learning repository.

Well-known examples are second order networks, the 3D structure tensor for motion estimation, and the Harris corner detector. A subset of second order operators are quadratic operators. It is lesser known that every second order operator can be written as a weighted quadratic operator The contribution of this paper is to propose an algorithm for converting an arbitrary second order operator into a quadratic operator We apply the method to several examples from image processing and machine learning. The advantages of the alternative implementation by quadratic operators is two-fold: The underlying linear operators allow new insights into the theory of the respective second order operators and replacing second order networks with sums of squares of linear networks reduces significantly the computational burden when the trained network is in operation phase.

We propose an effective machine learning based scheme to distinguish between double and single JPEG compressed images. Firstly, difference JPEG 2-D arrays, i.e., the difference between the magnitude of JPEG coefficient 2-D array of a given JPEG image and its shifted versions along various directions, are used to enhance double JPEG compression artifacts. Markov random process is then applied to modeling difference 2-D arrays so as to utilize the second-order statistics. In addition, a thresholding technique is used to reduce the size of the transition probability matrices, which characterize the Markov random processes. All elements of these matrices are collected as features for double JPEG compression detection. The support vector machine is employed as the classifier. Experiments have demonstrated that our proposed scheme has outperformed the prior arts.

User feedback is a crucial step in image retrieval to maximise retrieval performance as was shown in recent image retrieval evaluations. Machine learning is expected to be able to learn how to rank images according to users needs. Most image retrieval systems incorporate user feedback using rather heuristic means and only few groups have formally investigated how to maximise the benefit from it using machine learning techniques. We incorporate our distance-learning method into our new relevance feedback scheme and into two different approaches from the literature. The methods are compared on two publicly available databases, one which is purely content-based and one which uses additional textual information. It Is shown that the new relevance feedback scheme outperforms the other methods and that all methods benefit from weighted distance learning.

However, in real worlds, the labeled examples, especially gene expression data examples are often very difficult and expensive to obtain. The traditional supervised methods can not work well when lack of training examples. So in this paper we propose to use the semi-supervised learning algorithms which learning with both labeled and unlabeled data to do classification for microarray data. We perform experiments on four public microarray data sets and the results showed the semi-supervised method holds a much higher classification accuracy than the supervised methods and is much more stable when the labeled examples are very few.

A variety of machine learning methods have been applied to address these two issues, including feature selection, instance selection, and clustering. Most existing methods either compromise computational complexity or prediction precision. Two novel, scalable memory-based CF algorithms are proposed, namely BS1, BS2, which combine the strengths of existing techniques while discarding their weaknesses. Experiments show that both the efficiency and performance have been improved when compared to three classical techniques: VSIM, FCBF and PD.	[Song, Yang; Giles, C.

The presented method directly fuses both approaches, effectively allowing to fully exploit the advantages of both. The fusion of SVMs and GMDs is done by representing SVMs in the framework of GMDs without changing the training and without changing the decision boundary. The new classifier is evaluated on four tasks from the UCI machine learning repository It is shown that for the relatively rare cases where SVMs have problems, the combined method outperforms both individual ones.

Through a deep investigation on the non-parametric density estimation, we find that minimizing/maximizing the distances between each data sample and its nearby similar/dissimilar samples is equivalent to minimizing an upper bound of the Bayesian error rate. Based on this theoretical analysis, we define our criterion as maximizing the average local dissimilarity scatter with respect to a fixed average local similarity scatter. All local scatters are calculated in fixed size local regions, resembling the idea of Parzen estimation. Experiments in UCI machine learning database show that our method impressively outperforms other related neighbor based non-parametric methods.

We have developed a novel approach that uses a classic machine learning technique to predict this expected type from an ink sample. With this approach, we can create a "dynamic dispatch interpreter" by biasing interpretation differently according to the predicted expected types of the ink samples. When evaluated in the domain of introductory computer science, our interpreter achieves high interpretation accuracy (87%), an improvement from Microsoft's default interpreter (62%), and comparable with other previous interpreters (87-89%), which, unlike ours, require additional user-specified expected type information for each ink sample.

A critical step in automatic shoe-print identification is extraction of the shoe-print pattern. It involves isolating the shoe-print foreground (impressions made by the shoe)from the remaining elements (background and noise). The problem is formulated as one of labeling the regions of a shoeprint image as foreground/background. It is formulated as a machine learning task which is approached using a probabilistic model, i.e., Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). Since the model exploits the inherent long range dependencies that exist in the shoe-print it is more robust than other approaches, e.g., neural networks and adaptive thresholding of grey-scale images into binary. This was demonstrated using a data set of 45 shoeprint image pairs representing latent and known shoe-print images.

A kernel in the set of signatures can be defined in different ways and it is impossible to choose the most appropriate kernel a priori. We propose a principle of fusing several on-line and off-line kernels into an entire training and verification technique. Experiments with signature database SVC2004 have shown that the multi-kernel approach essentially decreases the error rate in comparison with verification based on single kernels.

SVM uses kernel mapping to map the non-linear data in input space to a high-dimensional feature space where the data is linearly separable. A hybrid wavelet kernel construction for support vector machine is introduced in this paper Construction of an admissible support vector (SV) kernel using multidimensional sinc wavelet is presented. The hybrid kernels are proved to be Mercer kernel. The hybrid kernels thus constructed are used for the automated detection of temporal bone abnormalities. Front High Resolution, Computed Tomography (HRCT) images features are extracted and fed to the learning machine for classification. Hybrid kernels provide better classification of the signal points in the mapped feature space. The experimental results indicate promising generalization performance with the hybrid kernels.

Both these issues have not yet been thoroughly studied. This paper presents an incremental first-order logic learning framework for automatically dealing with various kinds of evolution in digital repositories content: evolution in the definition of class definitions, evolution in the set of known classes and evolution by addition of new unknown classes. Experiments show that the approach can be applied to real-world.	[Ferilli, S.; Biba, M.; Basile, T. M.

Learning a Discriminative Sparse Tri-value Transform	19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION, VOLS 1-6	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION		English	Proceedings Paper	19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2008)	DEC 08-11, 2008	Tampa, FL	IEEE			FACE RECOGNITION	Simple binary patterns have been successfully used for extracting feature representations for visual object classification. In this paper we present a method to learn a set of discriminative tri-value patterns for projecting high dimensional raw visual inputs into a low dimensional subspace for tasks such as face detection. Unlike previous methods that use predefined simple transform bases to generate tens of thousands features first and then use machine learning to select the most useful features, our method attempts to learn discriminative transform bases directly. Since it would be extremely hard to develop analytical solutions, we define an objective function that can be solved using simulated annealing. To reduce the search space, we impose sparseness and smoothness constraints on the transform bases. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is effective and provides an alternative approach to effective visual object classification.

The feature space comprises a multi-value histogram which characterizes the local geometry around a query point, is pose and sampling density invariant, and can cope well with noisy sensor data. We characterize 3D geometric primitives of interest and describe methods for obtaining discriminating features used in a machine learning algorithm. To validate our approach, we perform an in-depth analysis using different classifiers and show results with both synthetically generated datasets and real-world scans.

The proposed gSVMT achieves to discover data subregions with principal discriminant knowledge through a recursive SVM-supervised data partitioning procedure. For each subregion, an individual SVM is allocated to extract the subregion knowledge. A set of such SVMs are aggregated in a specific order, resulting in a globally reliable decision rule to predict new coming samples. Experiments on a synthetic Gaussian data set and 13 benchmark machine learning data sets, have highlighted the usability of the gSVMT on its competitive classification capability. In particular, the proposed gSVMT is found to have better generalization performance than SVM classifiers for data sets with high sparseness and/or class-imbalance.

It's very important that the security mechanisms for an information system should be designed to prevent unauthorized access of system resources and data. Last few years, many intelligent learning techniques of machine learning applied to the large volumes of complex and dynamic audit data for the construction of efficient intrusion detection systems (IDS). This paper presents, theoretical overview of intrusion detection and a new approach for intrusion detection based on adaptive Bayesian algorithm. This algorithm correctly classify different types of attack of KDD99 benchmark intrusion detection dataset with high detection accuracy in short response time. The experimental result also shows that, this algorithm maximize the detection rate (DR) and minimized the false positive rate (FPR) for intrusion detection.

It can help to cluster a large number of data into several categories without requiring any additional information about the dataset or the categories, so that people can find information by categories easily. In this paper, we parallelize the algorithm proposed by Andrew Y. Ag, Michael I. Jordan and Yair Weiss. We provide two versions of implementation: one is parallelized in Openmp; the other is programmed in the NVIDIA CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), which is the environment provided by NVIDIA to program on its CUDA-Enabled GPGPUs (General-Purpose Graphic Processing Unit). We can achieve about three times speedup in OpenMP and around ten times speedup using CUDA in our experiments.

The successful detection of both gradual and abrupt transitions is necessary to this end. In this paper a new gradual transition detection algorithm is proposed, that is based on novel criteria such as color coherence change that exhibit less sensitivity to local or global motion than previously proposed ones. These criteria, each of which could serve as a standalone gradual transition detection approach, are then combined using a machine learning technique, to result in a meta-segmentation scheme. Besides significantly improved performance, advantage of the proposed scheme is that there is no need for threshold selection, as opposed to what would be the case if any of the proposed features were used by themselves and as is typically the case in the relevant literature. Performance evaluation and comparison with four other popular algorithms reveals the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

Since relations among the coefficients are specific to the signal, SVM regularization removes the noise, which does not share this property. Moreover, due to its non-parametric nature, the method can eventually cope with different noise sources. The results show that: (1) the proposed non-parametric method outperforms conventional methods that assume coefficient independence, and (2) its performance is similar to state-of-the-art parametric methods that do explicitly include these relations. Therefore, the proposed machine learning approach can be seen as a more flexible (model-free) alternative to the explicit description of wavelet coefficient relations in Bayesian approaches.

Classical pixel labeling methods utilize machine learning algorithms that induce a mapping from pixel features to individual pixel labels. In contrast we propose to first extract features from both images and labels. Subsequently we induce a mapping from pixel features to label features and synthesize the final output by combining the newly derived label components. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by applying log-Gabor filters to both input and ground truth images of mineral ore. Subsequently we train perceptrons and regression trees to produce individual output components that are combined in frequency space to create the final segmentation. Experimental results show significant improvements over contextual pixel labeling and over ensemble methods.

The uses of a feedback channel between the encoder and the decoder require an interactive decoding procedure which is a limitation for applications such as offline processing. On the other hand, the decoder needs an efficient way to estimate the probability of error without assuming the availability of the original video at the decoder. In this paper we continue with our previous works into a more practical DVC architecture which solves both problems based on the use of machine learning. The proposed approach is based on extracting the relationships that exist between the residual frame and the number of requests over this feedback channel. We apply these concepts to pixel-domain Wyner-Ziv coding demonstrating significant savings in bitrates with a little loss of quality	[Martinez, J.

Experiments using synthetic and Multiple Sclerosis (MS) textures show the success of the classifiers. Experiments using the contouring tool reveal significant improvement in accuracy and inter/intra-operator variability over freehand delineation in synthetic images. We do not see the same improvement for MS lesions, which are small and their true boundaries undefined. The approach goes some way toward achieving perfect segmentation and extends naturally to other medical applications.	[Shepherd, T.; Alexander, D.

So it is difficult to design effective classifier for this problem. In this paper, we address these variations in detection via multiple instance learning, specifically logistic multiple instance boosting (LMIB). In LMIB, a example is represented as a set of instances, which implicitly encode the variations. Giving different confidence to the instances in a bag, the LMIB will automatically reduce the influence of the variations at training stage. To obtain rapid detection speed, the LMIBs are grouped into the cascaded structure. The proposed detection algorithm is tested on MIT and INRIA human datasets where promising detection results are comparable with the baseline algorithms.

A two-class Bayesian scheme is used as a framework, and the likelihood is derived from the real-valued classification of machine learning algorithm Gentle AdaBoost, whose output is transformed to a probabilistic distribution using either of two models investigated; Log-Sigmoid or Bi-Gaussian. The main contribution is a novel scheme for the injection of prior contextual spatial information. This occurs on a uniquely designed Markov Random Field defined by Delaunay Triangulation of the feature points. Our experiments show that this framework is useful for object detection and segmentation, and we achieve good, mostly invariant results in these tasks.

Indeed a generic model must be able to describe the huge variability of pedestrians. We propose a learning based approach using a training set composed by positive and negative samples. A simple description of each candidate image provides a huge feature vector from which can be built weak classifiers. We select a subset of relevant weak classifiers using a classic AdaBoost algorithm. The resulting subset is then used as binary vectors in a kernel based machine learning classifier (like SVM, RVM, ...). The major contribution of the paper is the original association of an AdaBoost algorithm to select the relevant weak classifiers, followed by a SVM like classifier for which input data are given by the selected weak classifiers. Kernel based machine learning provides non-linear separator into the weak classifier space while standard AdaBoost gives a linear one. Performances of this method are compared to a classical AdaBoost method.

Traditionally HRI research was more interested in investigating adaptation of the robot to the human using machine. learning techniques but the possibility of utilizing the natural ability of humans to adapt to other humans and artifacts including robots is recently becoming increasingly attractive. This paper presents some of the results from an experiment conducted to investigate the interaction patterns and effectiveness of motion cues as a feedback modality between a human operator and a miniature robot in a confined collaborative navigation task. The results presented in this paper show evidence of human adaptation to the robot and moreover suggest that the adaptation rate is not constant or continuous in time but is discontinuous and nonlinear. The results also show evidence of a starting exploration stage before the adaptation with duration dependent on the expectations of the human regarding the capabilities of the robot in the given task. The paper investigates how to utilize these and related findings for building robots not only capable of adapting to human operators but can also help those operators adapt to them.

In contrast to most learning algorithms applied in machine learning today, which mainly work with offline learning on training samples, such learning mechanisms need to be performed autonomously and through interaction with the environment or with other agents/humans. In this paper we describe a learning algorithm as a dialogue approach for learning semantic categories and object description in object learning. New objects are introduced to the robot and learning dialogues are conducted as a means of information acquisition. In dialogue, the robot can acquire semantic categories, type and properties of objects, learn new words for object descriptions and learn and association to visual identification from object recognition. In contrast to existing work, this approach combines recognition of real objects, new words learning and semantic categories in one learning dialogue. The presented approach has been implemented in a dialogue system and evaluated on the humanoid robot Armar III.

Nevertheless, how will be negotiated these networks services? This article propose a solution to the negotiation of network services using autonomous agents based on simple machine learning techniques combined to economic theories which provides a rationality, even limited, in an autonomous behavior. The results obtained demonstrate that services negotiation done in indiscriminate ways may cause network resources loss of quality and productivity and that measuring actions avoid these problems.

We compare this approach against three other approaches. Results show trade-offs for two of the approaches on the precision-recall curves. While no approach surpassed the performance of the linear kernel support vector machine (SVM) classifier, the performance of the PSO was comparable to that of a feature selected SVM.

Our objective in addressing the case of JPEG image adaptation was to find computationally efficient algorithms to accurately predict the compressed file size of images subject to simultaneous changes in quality factor (QF) and resolution. In this paper, we present two new prediction algorithms which use only information readily available from the file header. The first algorithm, QF Scaling-Aware Prediction, predicts file size based on the QF of the original picture, as well as as a target QF and scaling. The second algorithm, Clustered QF Scaling-Aware Prediction, also takes into account the resolution of the original picture for improved prediction accuracy. As both algorithms rely on machine-learning strategies, a large corpus of representative JPEG images was assembled, We show that both prediction algorithms lead to acceptably small relative prediction errors in adaptation scenarios of interest.

Our approach is based on neural networks and interval neutrosophic sets which are used to classify the input patterns into one of the two binary class outputs. The comparison is based on several classical benchmark problems from UCI machine learning repository. We have found that the performance of our approaches are comparable to the existing classifiers.

In this paper, a personalized information retrieval paradigm is proposed which not only implicitly creates user profile by learning users' search history, search preferences, and desktop information by kNN algorithm; but also intends to deal with the problem of search concepts drift through adjusting the weight of category which represents users' search preference. By comparing the cosine similarities between vectors represent personal valued search concepts in user profiles, and vectors represent search concepts in the retrieved search results, the search results will be tailed to better match users' information needs.

It emphasizes body/environment interactions and is equipped with some elementary sets of action rules and appropriate initial conditions of the neural states that correspond to elementary survival reflexes. Along this line, we propose a new scheme of neural computation based on compound control which represents a typical feature of biological controls. This scheme is based on a classical neuron model where macroscopic purposeful behavior emerges as the result of the interaction of local rules. This scheme is applied to a bipedal robot and generates the rhythm of walking without any model of robot dynamics and environments.

However, the identification of DOVI today by bare eyes is not reliable. In this paper we investigate the recognition of DOVI with machine learning method, and five kinds of algorithms, namely quadratic discriminate analysis (QDA), linear discriminate analysis (LDA), regularized discriminate analysis (RDA), leave-one-out covariance matrix estimate (LOOC), and Kullback-Leibler information measure based method (KLIM) are applied to the recognition of DOVI. Considering both time cost and correct classification rate, KLIM classifier exceeds others.

The FBCSP algorithm is an autonomous and effective machine learning approach for classifying two classes of EEG measurements in motor imagery-based Brain Computer Interface (BCI). However, the problem of facial expression recognition typically involves more than just two classes of measurements. Hence, this paper proposes an extension of FBCSP to the multiclass paradigm using a decision threshold-based classifier for classifying facial expressions from EEG and EMG measurements. A study is conducted using the proposed Multiclass FBCSP on 4 subjects who performed 6 different facial expressions. The results show that the Multiclass FBCSP is effective in classifying multiple facial expressions from the EEG and EMG measurements.

There exists a vast number of different classification algorithms that can be used for this purpose In the machine learning literature. Unfortunately, the computational and space requirements of these methods are often too high for the current mobile devices. In this paper we study it simple linear classifier and find, automatically with SFS and SFFS feature selection methods, a suitable set of features to be used with the classification method. The results show that the simple classifier performs comparable to more complex nonlinear k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier. This depicts great potential in Implementing the classifier in small mobile wellness devices.

Indeed, colonoscopy has contributed to a decline in the number of colorectal cancer related deaths. However, not all cancers or large polyps are detected at the time of colonoscopy, and methods to investigate why this occurs are needed. One of the main factors affecting the diagnostic accuracy of colonoscopy is the quality of bowel preparation. The quality of bowel cleansing is generally assessed by the quantity of solid or liquid stool in the lumen. Despite a large body of published data on methods that could optimize cleansing, a substantial level of inadequate cleansing occurs in 10% to 75% of patients in randomized controlled trials. In this paper, a machine learning approach to the detection of stool in images of digitized colonoscopy video files is presented. The method involves the classification based on color features using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier.

Various feature selection (or extraction) and classification algorithms have been attempted with success. However, some feature selection processes are complex and the number of features used can be quite large. We propose a new feature selection method based on level-set statistics. This procedure is simple and, when used with support vector machines (SVM), only a small number of features is needed to achieve satisfactory accuracy that is comparable to those using more sophisticated features. Therefore, the classification can be completed in much shorter time. We use multi-class support vector machines as the classification tool. Numerical results are reported to support the viability of this new procedure.

Several studies have shown the applicability of accelerometry to detect persons with a high fall risk. Most of these studies have been conducted under laboratory settings and without clear definition of 'fall risk' reference measures. The aim of our work is to provide a simple unsupervised method to assess the fall risk of elderly persons as measured by reference clinical fall risk assessment scores. Our method uses parameters computed by spectral analysis on triaxial accelerometer data recorded in a clinical setting, and is evaluated using simple logistic regression classifier models with reference to three clinical reference scores. The overall prediction accuracy of the models ranges from 65.5-89.1%, with sensitivity and specificity between 78.5-99% and 15.4-60.4%, respectively. Our results show that our simple method can be used to detect persons with a high fall risk with a fair to good predictive accuracy when tested against common clinical reference scores. Our parameters are independent of specific test procedures and therefore are suited for use in an unsupervised setting. Our future research will include the evaluation of our method in a large prospective study.

In this experiment, subjects' high-dimensional finger motions remotely controlled the joint angles of a simulated planar 2-link arm, which was used to hit targets on a computer screen. Subjects were required to move the cursor at the endpoint of the simulated arm. Between each block of targets a machine learning algorithm was applied to adaptively change the transformation between ringer motion and cursor motion. This algorithm was either a Least Mean Squares (LMS) gradient descent, or a Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse (RC) transformation. In both cases, the algorithm modified the ringer-angle map so as to reduce the endpoint errors measured in past performance. Subjects were divided into three groups, a control group and two test groups, each practicing cursor control under one of the algorithms. LMS subjects learned to reduce error significantly faster than the control group (no machine learning) while RC subjects failed to demonstrate learning, possibly due large mapping differences between RC updates. Results also indicate that subjects training with machine learning do not exhibit faster or better generalization to untrained movements.

We analyzed audio from 9 control subjects and 30 patients diagnosed with one of three subtypes of Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration. From this data, we extracted features of the audio signal and the words the patient used, which were obtained using our automated transcription technologies. We then automatically learned models that predict the diagnosis of the patient using these features. Our results show that learned models over these features predict diagnosis with accuracy significantly better than random. Future studies using higher quality recordings will likely improve these results.

These exploratory feature extraction techniques yield informative expression modes (ICA) which are considered indicative of underlying regulatory processes. Their most strongly expressed genes represent marker genes for classification of the tissue samples under investigation. Comparison with supervised gene selection methods based on statistical scores or support vector machines corroborate these findings. The method is applied to macrophages loaded/de-loaded with chemically modified low density lipids.	[Herold, D.; Schachtner, R.; Lang, E.

A typical library is used by client programs through an application programming interface (API) that hides its internals from the client. Typically, the rules governing the correct usage of the API are documented informally. In many cases, libraries may have complex API usage rules and unclear documentation. As a result, the behaviour of the library under some corner cases may not be well understood by the programmer. Formal specifications provide a precise understanding of the API behaviour. We propose a methodology for learning interface specifications using Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). Our technique runs several unit tests on the library in order to generate relations describing the operation of the library. The data collected from these tests are used by an inductive learner to obtain rich Datalog/Prolog specifications. Such specifications capture essential properties of interest to the user. They may be used for applications such as reverse engineering the library internals or constructing checks on the application code to enforce proper API usage along with other properties of interest.			srirams@nec-labs.com; ivancic@nec-labs.com; agupta@nec-labs.com					Acharya M., 2007, ESEC FSE, P25; Alur R., 2005, POPL, P98, DOI 10.1145/1040305.1040314; Ammons G., 2002, P 29 ACM SIGPLAN SIG, P4, DOI 10.1145/503272.503275; Bergadano F., 1996, INDUCTIVE LOGIC PROG; Cadar C, 2005, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V3639, P2; Christodorescu M, 2007, ESEC FSE 07, P5; COHEN WW, 1994, AAAI, P142; Csallner C, 2004, SOFTWARE PRACT EXPER, V34, P1025, DOI 10.1002/spe.602; ERNST MD, 2000, DYNAMICALLY DISCOVER; Godefroid P, 2005, ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES, V40, P213, DOI 10.1145/1064978.1065036; Henzinger T.A., 2001, ESEC SIGSOFT FSE, P109; Jiang GF, 2005, ICAC 2005: Second International Conference on Autonomic Computing, Proceedings, P111; Jones C.B., 1980, SOFTWARE DEV RIGOROU; Mitchell T, 1997, MACHINE LEARNING; MUGGLETON S, 1995, NEW GENERAT COMPUT, V13, P245; Pazzani M., 1991, P 8 INT WORKSH MACH, P432; QUINLAN JR, 1990, MACH LEARN, V5, P239, DOI 10.1023/A:1022699322624; Ramanathan MK, 2007, PLDI'07: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2007 ACM SIGPLAN CONFERENCE ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION, P123, DOI 10.1145/1250734.1250749; SEN K, 2005, ESEC FSE 05; Srinivasan A., ALEPH MANUAL; Whaley J., 2004, PLDI 04, P131, DOI 10.1145/996841.996859; Whaley J., 2002, ISSTA, P218; Yang J., 2006, P ICSE	23	4	5	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	0270-5257	978-1-4244-4486-1	PROC INT CONF SOFTW			2008							131	140		10.1145/1368088.1368107		10	Computer Science, Software Engineering	Computer Science	BKQ08	WOS:000268922500014

In other word, there may be many translations of a source text in which the most convenient one should be selected. The Holy Koran is one of the well-known books in the world which has been descended in Arabic and most of peoples would like to understand more about this book. As a result, there are more than 100 translations of Koran from Arabic to English. In this paper a system has been designed to evaluate different English translations of Koran using tools and concepts such as pos-tagging, natural language processing, computational linguistic and machine learning. To do such an evaluation, each verb process type in translated text should be compared with it's of Koran text. The system uses Halliday Grammar, which is a useful theory for analyzing a formal text, to do this. It has been assumed that each verb in the text of Koran has been tagged manually. At the other hand, to detect each verb process type in translated English texts, a tagger is used to detect and tag each verb based on Halliday grammar. The best translation is one in which the number of similar verb process type in the source and translated text is maximum. This evaluation's been performed on 5 English translations of Holy Koran (Qaraei, Pickthal, Arberry, Progressive Muslims, Yusuf Ali) in scope of Bashir and Nadhir Ayahs of Baqarah and AleImran Surahs and the results show that Yusuf Ali translation is the best. In this paper, it has been tried to create not only a new way to analyze the quality of translating a text but also take a step to discover concepts and meanings of the Koran. Although it is seemed that some of Koran words are so meaningful that it is nearly impossible to put them in one class of verb process type.

Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) are machine-learning algorithms that embody some of the principles and attempt to take advantages of the benefits of natural immune systems for use in tackling complex problem domains. Using the artificial immune algorithm in GPS data Processing can solve the GPS nonlinear models directly and avoid the ill-conditions. The principle and algorithm steps of the AIS are introduced and it's application in GPS single frequency precise point positioning (PPP) is discussed detailed. Numerical result shows that the single frequency PPP model solved by AIS can reach an accuracy of sub-meter level.

The key in the protein is DNA-binding region also called DNA-binding domain (DBD). However, it is hard to search the DBDs by means of homology search or hidden Markov models because of a wide variety of the sequences. In this work, we develop a kernel-based machine learning method by combination of multiple. "1-vs-1" binary classifiers for DNA binding domain prediction. Our result shows that 93.73% accuracy is achieved for multicategory classifier and no less than 90% accuracy for each binary classifier. By comparison, our classifier performs better than other machine learning methods.

In this term extraction system, besides five linguistic rules acquired from an available term list by some machine learning methods, two statistical strategies are involved: a termhood measure based on the term distribution variation, and a unithood measure adopting the left and right entropy method to estimate the collocation variation degree. The candidates are ranked according to the values of the former. The latter is used to filter the preposition phrases and some verb-object phrases that rarely appear as terms. By validating on a small scale corpus in the computer domain, the precision reaches 91.5% of the top 2000 outputs.

We investigate in this paper the design of support vector machine classification algorithms learning from positive and unlabeled samples only. We first find the minimum bounding sphere that enclosed all the positive samples, and then use this minimum bounding sphere to pick out the negative samples from the unlabeled samples, at last we train the support vector machine using the training set which consists of the given positive samples and the negative samples picked out from the unlabeled samples. Experiments indicate that support vector machine learning from positive and unlabeled samples achieves the desired high test precision and prediction accuracy.

Feature subset selection basically depends on selecting a criterion function for evaluation of the feature subset and a search strategy to find the best feature subset from a large number of feature subsets. Lots of techniques have been developed so far, mainly from statistical theory, still research is going on to find better solutions in terms of optimality and computational ease. Recently soft computing techniques are gaining popularity for solving real world problems for their more flexibility compared to statistical or mathematical techniques. In this work an algorithm based on particle swarm optimization with fuzzy fitness function has been proposed for getting optimal feature subset from a feature set with large number of features. Simple simulation experiments with two benchmark data sets show that the proposed method is similar in performance to the results reported earlier and is computationally less demanding in comparison to Genetic Alogrithm, another population based evolutionary search technique proposed earlier for feature subset selection by author.

However, in image classification, this assumption often does not hold, since image labels are not as sufficient as text ones. In this paper, we propose to use labeled images from relevant but different categories to take the role of training data for estimating a prediction model. Correcting sample selection bias, the 2000 Nobel Prize work in Economic, is applied to our problem. We assume that the difference between training and test data is that they are governed by different distributions. By eliminative sample selection bias in the training data, the supervisory knowledge in the training data can be effectively learned for classifying images in the test set. We present theoretical and empirical analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. The experimental results on two image corpora show that our algorithm can greatly improve several state-of-the art classifiers when the training and test images come from similar but different categories.

Drawn from physics, kernel polarization was introduced as an effective measure for selecting kernel parameters, which was previously done mostly by exhaustive search. However, it only takes between-class separability into account but neglects the preservation of within-class local structure. The 'globality' of the kernel polarization may leave less degree of freedom for increasing separability. In this paper, we propose a new quality measure called local kernel polarization, which is a localized variant of kernel polarization. Local kernel polarization can preserve the local structure of the data of the same class so the data can be embedded more appropriately, This quality measure is demonstrated with some UCI machine learning benchmark examples.

Such knowledge bases cannot be built using existed tools such as expert system shells, because these do not scale up, nor can be built in terms of existing database technology, because such technology does not support the rich representational structure and inference mechanisms required for knowledge-based systems. This paper proposes a generic architecture for a knowledge base management system intended for such applications. The software architecture assumes quotient space structure which analyses identic problem in different granularity space. A new software architecture model for knowledge base system based on quotient space is given. The atomic component, quotient component, connector and configuration are defined As an example, a knowledge base system framework for agro-meteorology is described Some components and a configuration about agro-meteorology are given. All above work sets up basic theory of software architecture for knowledge base system based on quotient space and provides new way for further research.

Existing works on classifying block functions and judging block importance have not made full use of the image factor, and only simple image features were considered. We regard image as a strong indicator of Web page blocks with various functions and propose to learn block functions using roles of images as part of block features. Blocks are generated from Web page segmentation and roles of images are automatically decided by image classification. We experiment on 140 Web pages and demonstrate that utilizing roles of images can significantly improve the classification quality of learning Web page block functions. We also measure the usefulness of different roles of images and evaluate the effect of two page segmentation methods.

In this contribution we explore the use of popular approaches for designing ensembles of classifiers in the machine learning field, bagging and random subspace, to design FRBCS multiclassifiers from a basic, heuristic fuzzy classification rule generation method, aiming to both improve their accuracy and to make them able to deal with high dimensional classification problems. Besides, a multicriteria genetic algorithm is proposed to select the component classifiers in the ensemble guided by the cumulative likelihood in order to look for an appropriate accuracy-complexity trade-off.

In this paper we suggest a machine learning approach to find a suitable bidding strategy for an auction participant using information commonly available in online auction settings. We take the electricity auction as the main application example, due to its importance as an experimental instance of the suggested approach. In previous works we evolved successful fuzzy bidding strategies. Here we introduce a coevolutionary algorithm to study how the evolving strategies react to each other in a more dynamic environment. By enabling a fuzzy system to learn trough an evolutionary algorithm one expects to find effective and transparent bidding strategies. By adopting a coevolutionary approach a more realistic representation of the agents participating in an auction based electricity market allows the evolutionary bidding strategies interact.

Timing tools attempt to model and predict the delay of all the paths on a chip, which may be in the millions. These delay predictions often have a significant error and when silicon is measured there is a large variation of path delays as compared to the prediction of the tools. This variation may be caused by process, environmental or other effects that are often unpredictable. It is therefore desirable to use early silicon data to better predict and model potential speedpaths for subsequent silicon steppings. In this paper, we present a novel machine learning-based approach that uses a small number of identified speedpaths to predict a larger set of potential speedpaths, thus significantly enhancing the traditional timing prediction flows post-silicon. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach and summarize our findings based on the analysis of silicon speedpaths from a 65nm P4 microprocessor.

In this work, we develop predictive models for estimating the performance of systems by using performance numbers from only a small fraction of the overall design space. Specifically, we first develop three models, two based on artificial neural networks and another based on linear regression. Using these models, we analyze the published Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC) benchmark results and show that by using the performance numbers of only 2% and 5% of the machines in the design space, we can estimate the performance of all the systems within 9.1% and 4.6% on average, respectively. Then, we show that the performance of future systems can be estimated with less than 2.2% error rate on average by using the data of systems from a previous year. We believe that these tools can accelerate the design space exploration significantly and aid in reducing the corresponding research/development cost and time-to-market.

In this paper, using techniques from probability on Banach Spaces, we analyze a specific architecture of random nonlinearities, provide L(infinity) and L(2) error bounds for approximating functions in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces, and discuss scenarios when these expansions are dense in the continuous functions. We discuss connections between these random nonlinear networks and popular machine learning algorithms and show experimentally that these networks provide competitive performance at far lower computational cost on large-scale pattern recognition tasks.

The classic problem can be viewed as determining the correct one-dimensional, binary-valued threshold function from a finite class of such functions based on queries taking the form of point samples of the function. The classic problem is also equivalent to a simple binary encoding of the threshold location. This paper extends binary search to learning more general binary-valued functions. Specifically, if the set of target functions and queries satisfy certain geometrical relationships, then an algorithm, based on selecting a query that is maximally discriminating at each step, will determine the correct function in a number of steps that is logarithmic in the number of functions under consideration. Examples of classes satisfying the geometrical relationships include linear separators in multiple dimensions. Extensions to handle noise are also discussed. Possible applications include machine learning, channel coding, and sequential experimental design.

Both notions are deemed desirable in designing algorithms, and are believed to lead to good generalization ability. In this paper, we show that these two notions contradict each other. That is, a sparse algorithm can not be stable and vice versa. Thus, one has to tradeoff sparsity and stability in designing a learning algorithm. In particular, our general result implies that l(1)-regularized regression (Lasso) cannot be stable, while l(2)-regularized regression is known to have strong stability properties.

Exploiting machine learning for these routing problems has received increasing attention in recent years due to its flexibility and localized mechanisms. However, with such an approach the resulting protocols often have additional memory and processing time requirements. Nevertheless, these requirements are within the reach of today's WSN hardware, however few substantial tests have been performed to clearly demonstrate this. This paper evaluates and discusses the results and experiences gained from implementing our reinforcement learning based multicast routing protocol (FROMS) in a testbed of ScatterWeb nodes. A comparison of our results is made to a well-known WSN routing scheme, namely a multicast variation of Directed Diffusion. Our evaluation includes several minor, but practical modifications to both protocols such as transmission backoffs and the use of acknowledgments. This paper offers three main contributions. First, we demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can be efficiently implemented on resource restricted devices and that they perform very well in multiple network scenarios. Second, we confirm the validity of simulation results obtained in a previous evaluation of FROMS, and at the same time gather delivery rates under realistic settings. Finally, we offer some general observations on properties and pitfalls of WSN implementations along with potential solutions.

According to the theory of artificial neural network, a stochastic time effective function is introduced in the forecasting model of the index in the present paper, which gives an improved neural network-the stochastic tame effective neural network model. In this model, a promising data mining technique in machine learning has been proposed to uncover the predictive relationships of numerous financial and economic variables. We suppose that the investors decide their investment positions by analyzing the historical data on the stock market, and the historical data is given a weight depending on it's time, in details that, the nearer the time of the historical data is to the present, the stronger impact the data has on the predictive model, and we also use the probability density functions to classifying the various variables from training samples. In the last part of the paper, the data of 16 years' period of Shenzhen Stock Index is analyzed in the stochastic time effective neural network model, and we show some analysis results for the fluctuations of the index by the model.

Many algorithms have been proposed for mining Boolean association rules, but they cannot deal with quantitative and categorical data directly. Although we can transform quantitative attributes into intervals and applying Boolean algorithms to the intervals. But this approach is not effective and is difficult to scale tip for high-dimensional cases. An efficient algorithm, DBSMiner (Density Based Sub-space Miner), is proposed by using the notion of "density- connected" to cluster the high density sub-space of quantitative attributes and gravitation between grid / cluster to deal with the low density cells which may be missed by the previous algorithms, DBSMiner not only can solve the problems of previous approaches, but also can scale up well for high-dimensional cases. Evaluations on DBSMiner have been performed using the car and the shuttle databases maintained at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The results indicate that DBSMiner is effective and can scale up quite linearly with an increasing number of attributes.

In most of these applications, one major issue is preserving privacy of individual's private information and sensitive data. In this paper, we propose two secure protocols for perceptron learning algorithm when input data is horizontally and vertically partitioned among the parties. These protocols can be applied in both linearly separable and non-separable datasets, while not only data belonging to each party remains private, but the final learning model is also securely shared among those parties. Parties then can jointly and securely apply the constructed model to predict the output corresponding to their target data. Also, these protocols can be used incrementally, i.e. they process new coming data, adjusting the previously constructed network.

One type of such fragments are promoters, Le., short regulatory DNA sequences located upstream of a gene. Detection of promoters in DNA sequences is important for successful gene prediction. In this paper, a machine learning method, called Support Vector Machine (SVM), is used for classification of DNA sequences and promoter recognition. For optimal classification, 11 rules for mapping of DNA sequences into binary SVM feature space are analyzed. Classification is performed using a power series kernel function. Kernel parameters are optimized using a modification of the Nelder-Mead (downhill simplex) optimization method. The results of classification for drosophila and human sequence datasets are presented.

Its goal is to describe the relationships between the chemical structure of chemical compounds and biological and toxicological processes. In real PT problems there is a very important topic to be considered: the huge number of the chemical descriptors. Irrelevant, redundant, noisy and unreliable data have a negative impact, therefore one of the main goals in KDD is to detect these undesirable proprieties and to eliminate or correct them. This assumes data cleaning, noise reduction and feature selection because the performance of the applied Machine Learning algorithms is strongly related with the quality of the data used. In this paper, we present some of the issues that can be taken into account for preparing data before the actual knowledge discovery is performed.

Hardware implementation of these networks, often using a backpropagation algorithm for learning, has many advantages over software implementation, the main advantage being speedup due to taking advantage of the inherent parallelism of neural networks. However, tradeoffs are often introduced with respect to speed, area, precision, and other factors. Moreover, many of the calculations involve multiplications, which can be costly and complex to implement in custom hardware. This paper proposes a piecewise linear approximation architecture that can be used to replace multiplications with a series of shifts and additions. This, combined with the same approximation for the nonlinear activation function and its derivative, results in a neural network realization in which all arithmetic and function computations are carried out using adders only.

The aim is to identify patterns of associations that can be represented using SVM learning rules to enable real-time and reliable CME predictions. The NGDC filaments catalogue and the SOHO/LASCO CMEs catalogue are processed to associate filaments with CMEs based on timing and location information. Automated systems are created to process and associate years of filaments and CME data, which are later arranged in numerical training vectors and fed to machine learning algorithms to extract the embedded knowledge and provide learning rules that can be used for the automated prediction of CMEs. Features representing the filament time, duration, type and extent are extracted from all the associated (A) and not-associated (NA) filaments and converted to a numerical format that is suitable for machine learning use. The machine learning system predicts if the filament is likely to initiate a CME. Intensive experiments are carried out to optimise the SVM. The prediction performance of SVM is analysed and recommendations for enhancing the performance are provided.

Sophisticated myoelectric controllers usually record data from multiple bipolar channels, placed on muscle groups of interest. The appropriate number of channels is a delicate question. One usually tries to minimize the amount of channels required while maintaining reasonable classification performance. This paper presents a filter approach to the channel selection problem by exploiting properties of the principal component analysis. Out of a set of channels measured on the patient, a "good" subset is selected for further processing by a pattern recognition algorithm. The method is applied to data recorded from an amputee who has undergone targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR) surgery. It is shown that the amount of channels can be reduced with only minor decrease of classification performance.

This paper develops a taxonomy of Non-Standard Words (NSW's) based on a Large-scale Chinese corpus and proposes a three-stage text normalization strategy: Finite State Automata (FSA) for initial classification, Maximum Entropy (ME) Classifier & Rules for further classification and General Rules for standard word conversion. The three-stage approach achieves Precision of 96.02% in experiments, 5.21% higher than that of simple rule based approach and 2.21% higher than that of simple machine learning method. Experiments results show that the approach of three-stage disambiguation strategy for text normalization makes considerable improvement, and works well in real TTS system.

In this paper, we propose an online ranking algorithm, referred to as PMRank. In our approach, the perceptron with margins is employed to learn a ranking model. Since margins are introduced into the training process, our approach can achieve nearly or even ranking results of the maximal margin based ranking approaches. In the meanwhile, as an online ranking algorithm, our approach is much more efficient than them. Moreover, there are degrees of freedom to set the margins in our approach, which can make the training process of our approach focused on instances from particular ranks. That is an especially favorable property in real-word applications, such as information retrieval where the errors made on relevant documents are much more serious than the errors on irrelevant documents. We discuss our approach from a theoretical point of view and provide a theoretical justification. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach is an effective and efficient ranking algorithm.

However, in many case, this assumption does not hold. To overcome this limitation, a novel adaptive spherical Gaussian kernel is utilized for nonlinear regression, and the stagewise optimization algorithm for maximizing Bayesian evidence in sparse Bayesian learning framework is proposed for model selection. Extensive empirical study shows its effectiveness and flexibility of model on representing regression problem with higher levels of sparsity and higher performance than classical RVM. The attractive ability of this approach is to automatically choose the right kernel widths locally fitting RVs from the training dataset; which could keep right level smoothing at each scale of signal.

However, the data for clustering are unlabelled and there is no commonly accepted evaluation criterion to clustering accuracy. Therefore, feature selection has been paid little attention in unsupervised learning or clustering. This paper proposed a feature selection method based on IB theory. It selected the most effective feature subset while preserved the most information. The experimental results on selected UCI datasets showed that it not only reduced the dimension but also got better clustering accuracy. So, the method is valid.

While the classical speed density relationships provide useful insight into the traffic dynamics problem and have a theoretical value to traffic flow, for such applications they are limited. This paper focuses on calibrating parameters for speed-density relationships with machine learning methods, and introduces a new algorithm called "clustering-locally weighted regression". In order to improve the precision of parametric calibration, we also preprocess sensor data, including finding missing sensor data, detecting error data, and repairing both of them. Finally, so as to fuse more information into the process of calibration, this paper utilizes densities and flows as variables to calibrate parameters for the speed-density relationships. The proposed approaches are tested with sensor data from the 3(rd) ring road in Beijing. The testing results show that the proposed algorithms have great performance on the parametric calibration and are appropriate for the simulation-based DTA models.

It contains five main components: design repository, OLAP, knowledge reduction, CBR system, and machine learning. Design repository is responsible for organizing various kinds of knowledge from different data sources by building a subject-oriented and multi-dimensional knowledge model. Users and Designers can input inquiries into the CBR system. Then OLAP drills down and finds the similar cases. Knowledge reduction techniques reduce the retrieved similar cases from OLAP, which improves the efficiency of the CBR system. Machine Learning can capture new knowledge to complement design repository. Finally, the proposed approach is demonstrated through a real application of tied bill machines.

In this paper, a new machine learning method was proposed for the information extraction TCM clinical cases based on structured templates. This method is an interactive processes with a domain expert. If we use uniform templates to describe the TCM clinical cases, they will not only result the loss of some information, but also not reflect the every expert's experience knowledge perfectly.

Electrical capacitance tomography (ECT) is a new measurement technology. It is often used to identify two-phase/multi-phase flow regime and investigate the distribution of solids. The support vector machine (SVM) is a machine-learning algorithm based on the statistical learning theory (SLT), which has desirable classification ability with fewer training samples. So, it provides a new approach for flow regime identification. The capacitance measurement data obtained from ECT system contain flow regime information. Feature parameters, which can reflect flow regime, were extracted. Using these feature parameters and SVM method, simulation experiments were done for 4 typical flow regimes. The results showed that this method is fast in speed and can identify these 4 flow regimes correctly, and prove this method is efficient and feasible.

SVM possesses high generalization ability by employing structural risk minimization to minimize the learning errors and decrease the upper bound of prediction error. Further more, SVM converts machine learning problem into quadratic programming to achieve the global optimal solution.

However high intra-class and small inter-class variations in color prevent simple but quick pixel classifiers from yielding robust results. In contrast, more elaborate classifiers consider shape or region features but they do not achieve real-time performance. In this paper we show that it definitely is possible to robustly determine the facial components and achieve far more than real-time performance. We also use quick pixel level classifiers and provide them with a set of pixel features that are adapted to the image characteristics beforehand. We do not manually select the pixel features and specify the calculation rules. In contrast, our idea is to provide a multitude of features and let the Machine Learning algorithm decide which of them are important. The evaluation draws a comparison to fixed approaches that do not adapt the computation of the features to the image content in any way. The obtained accuracy is precise enough to be used for real-world applications such as for model-based interpretation of human faces.

Although many extensions and improvements over the original AAM have been proposed, on of the main drawbacks of AAMs remains its dependence on good initial model parameters to achieve accurate fitting results. In this paper, we determine the initial model parameters for AAM fitting with ASM fitting, and use machine learning techniques to improve the scope and accuracy of ASM fitting. Combining the precision of AAM fitting with the large radius of convergence of learned ASM fitting improves the results by an order of magnitude, as our empirical evaluation on a database of publicly available benchmark images demonstrates.

Utilizing machine learning concepts, the system gives real time feedback on the user's attention, by combining information coming from eye gaze, head pose, and distance from the screen. The system is completely un-intrusive and no special hardware (such as infrared cameras or wearable devices) is needed Furthermore, it adjusts to every user, not necessitating initial calibration, and can work under real and unconstrained conditions in terms of lighting.

Experimental results have shown that such an approach can perform much better than single-task techniques, especially when few examples per task are available. However, a possible drawback may be computational complexity. For instance, when using regularization networks, complexity scales as the cube of the overall number of data associated with all the tasks. In this paper, an efficient computational scheme is derived for a widely applied class of multi-task kernels. More precisely, a quadratic loss is assumed and the multi-task kernel is the sum of a common term and a task-specific one. The proposed algorithm performs online learning recursively updating the estimates as new data become available. The learning problem is formulated in a Bayesian setting. The optimal estimates are obtained by solving a sequence of subproblems which involve projection of random variables onto suitable subspaces. The algorithm is tested on a simulated data set.

Rule based control (RBC) is a promising approach for the control of complex musculoskeletal systems using FES. In this paper, we present a method for the design of a RBC for real time control of walking. The controller uses accelerometer data as inputs while the outputs are estimated muscle activations (50 ms ahead in time). It is designed in two steps: 1) the input-output data for machine learning (ML) are generated using biomechanical gait simulations; 2) the rules are determined by applying ML based on the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system. The controller is trained and evaluated using the data recorded from an able bodied subject walking at two gait speeds. Results showed that the estimation of muscle activations was satisfactory at the gait speed for which the controller was trained. Moreover, the RBC demonstrated the ability to generalize to the gait speed that was higher/lower then the one actually used for the training.

Fuzzy confidence estimation of the parameter involving in the distribution of the total time on test for censored data	2008 ANNUAL MEETING OF THE NORTH AMERICAN FUZZY INFORMATION PROCESSING SOCIETY, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the North-American-Fuzzy-Information-Processing-Society	MAY 19-22, 2008	New York, NY	N Amer Fuzzy Informat Proc Soc			PREDICTION SUFFICIENCY	Data mining has captured the interest of researchers from many different as well as diverse fields of study such as data base systems, machine learning, statistics, cluster analysis, knowledge based systems. One of the major issues in data mining is the analysis of attribute relevance [8]. The basic idea is to come up with a measure that can be effectively used to quantify the relevance of an attribute in identifying a class or a concept. One possible application is the total failure time of censored data [5]. That is, the total time on test for censored data of a system with several components often plays an important role in the reliability theory. In some cases, all components of a system with several identical components may be put on test until an r-th smallest failure time occurs and the total time on test is subsequently calculated. The total time on test for censored data from exponentially distributed censored data has been proved to be an adequate statistic by Nair and Cheng [11] in light of the works by Skibinsky [12], Cheng and Mordeson [3], and others [1, 9, 13-15]. The test may be repeated for many times. As a result, since the total time on test until the r-th ordered failure time is observed will be recorded for each test, several total time on test (for censored data) for the same system are available for use in analyzing the reliability of the system. Fuzzy set theory was formalized by Zadeh [16]. Some fuzzy statistical techniques can found in [2, 17]. In this proposal, we are investigating the fuzzy estimation of the parameter of underlying probability distribution for total failure time of censored data.

In this paper, we consider this issue from the point of view of the order induced by the measures when comparing a set of objects to a given reference, i.e. the ranking from the most similar object to the least similar one. We introduce the notion of fuzzy order-equivalence, based on degrees that quantify the extent to which the induced orders differ. We define these degrees using the generalized Kendall's rank correlation, taking into account the number of order permutations as well as their positions. We then present an automatic and hierarchical classification of usual similarity measures that makes it possible to indicate, for a given number of tolerated variations, the measures that will yield rankings without significant changes; it thus provides a guideline for set data similarity measure selection.

MACHINE LEARNING METHODOLOGIES IN BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE SYSTEMS	2008 CAIRO INTERNATIONAL BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	Cairo International Biomedical Engineering Conference	DEC 18-20, 2008	Cairo, EGYPT			BCI; SVM; BLDA; Linear Classifiers	BCI COMPETITION 2003; DATA SET IIB; SPELLER; ENSEMBLE; SVMS	Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) is a one kind of communication system that enables control of devices or communication with others only through brain signal activities without using motor activities. The main application for BCI is to provide an alternative channel for helping disabled persons, hereafter mentioned as subjects, to communicate with the external world. This paper tries to demonstrate the performance of different machine learning algorithms based on classification accuracy. Performance has been evaluated on dataset II from BCI Competition III for the year 2004 for two subjects 'A' & 'B' and dataset IIb from BCI Competition II for the year 2003 for one subject 'C'. As a primary stage, a preprocessing was applied on the samples in order to extract the most significant features before introducing them to machine learning algorithms. The algorithms applied are Bayesian Linear Discriminant Analysis (BLDA), linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA), Generalized Anderson's Task linear classifier (GAT), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). BLDA and SVM yielded the highest accuracy for all 3 subjects. BLDA algorithm achieved classification accuracy 98%, 98% and 100%, SVM algorithm achieved 98%, 96% and 100% for subjects 'A' 'B' and 'C' respectively.			abeers@eg.ibm.com	Kadah, Yasser/B-2746-2011				Allison B.

The paper starts with the index of surrounding rock displacement which can reflect both observability and controllability of underground engineer system. The nonlinear machine learning tool -Support Vector Machine(SVM) which based on statistic learning theory is utilized to construct the time series model. Because penalty factor and kernel parameter of SVM affect the predicting accuracy evidently, and SVM has not provided the selection method, the parameters are optimized by global optimization arithmetic-particle swarm optimization. Based on the PSO-SVM evolutionary predictive model, appending the up-to-date monitoring information, multi-step extrapolating forecast model of surrounding rock displacement is constructed, and according to control criteria, the supporting scheme is adjusted, realizing the predictive control for underground engineer. An engineer sample is studied, the result states that the PSO-SVM model is feasible. The proposed predictive control method provides new approach for underground construction.

K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) is a non-parameter classifying method, which is quite effective and easy to use. KNN has been widely used in classification, regression and pattern recognition. A new algorithm that combining SVM with KNN is presented, which is called a new kernel learning method (Modified Support Vector Machine, MSVM) to be used for classification. Inspired by the intuitive geometric interpretation of SVM based on convex hulls, it maps the data in the original space to the kernel space with the kernel trick and constructs a nearest neighbor classifier in the kernel space, which takes the convex hulls of training sets as the extended classifies sets. Then, KNN will be used It's proved that the modified SVM algorithm is feasible and less sensitive to the parameter K along with better accuracy.

Sentiment classification is just a new technology concerned whether the opinion is positive or negative that reviews online express. There are two types of method in sentiment classification: semantic orientation and machine learning. In this study, we design an experimental research on horror movie reviews. The target is to test whether further classification of the products could improve the accuracy of sentiment classification by semantic orientation method. At last, experimental results of online movie reviews will be discussed which will give some new ideas about sentiment classification in Chinese.

In our earlier work [14, 17] we introduced a special kind of junction tree, based on a hypergraph structure called t-cheny tree [3, 4] and on some information theoretical concepts [10, 12]. In this paper we present a possibility for the improvement of these junction trees, by "cutting and refitting" of the junction tree's branches. Both theoretical and experimental results demonstrate the improvement of the junction tree obtained after "branch cutting and refitting".

A specific memory structure of cinematic memories is proposed to record the measurements. Cinematic memories can represent causal relations among the measurement results, offering implicit context-dependent cinematic micro-theories. Cinematic memories of real events can he used for prediction. Imagined cinematic memories can be assigned a logical value when compared to sensorial information. A logical framework emerges, based on the concepts of measurement and cinematic memories, instead of the more abstract concept of proposition.

Workload modeling is a machine learning procedure that finds the intrinsic pattern of the incoming tasks based on the observed workload attributes. Markov Decision Process (MDP) based model has been widely adopted for stochastic power management because it delivers provable optimal policy. Given a sequence of observed workload attributes, the hidden Markov model (HMM) of the workload is trained. If the observed workload attributes and states in the workload model do not have one-to-one correspondence, the MDP becomes a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). This paper presents a framework of modeling and optimization for stochastic power management using HAM and POMDP. The proposed technique discovers the HMM of the workload by maximizing the likelihood of the observed attribute sequence. The POMDP optimization is formulated and solved as a quadraticly constrained linear programming (QCLP). Compared with traditional optimization technique, which is based on value iteration, the QCLP based optimization provides superior policy by enabling stochastic control.

We develop two machine learning-based techniques for efficiently exploring the processor design space. We observe that these techniques result in multi-core processors whose performance is comparable (within 1%) to a processor design that requires an exhaustive exploration of the design space. These techniques often take orders of magnitude (a factor of 3800 at the minimum) less time for coming up with these processors. The benefits are up to 13% over intelligent search techniques that have been adapted to do multi-core design space exploration. We leverage the knowledge gained in this research to develop Magellan - a framework for accelerating multi-core design space exploration and optimization. Magellan can be used to find the highest throughput processors of a given type for a given area, power, or time budget. It can be used to aid even experienced processor designers that prefer to rely on intuition by allowing fast refinements to an input design.

The complexity of encoding is substantially higher than prior standards such as H.263 and makes H.264 video encoding on mobile devices expensive. The few existing encoding solutions on mobile devices restrict the features used there by sacrificing quality for complexity. Fast encoding algorithms are necessary to fully exploit the advanced compression features offered by H.264. In this paper we present 2 novel machine learning based approach to reducing the complexity of Intra MB coding. The results show that machine learning has a great potential and can reduce the complexity substantially with negligible Impact on quality. The results show that the proposed method reduces encoding time to about 1/3 of the reference implementation with a negligible loss in quality.
