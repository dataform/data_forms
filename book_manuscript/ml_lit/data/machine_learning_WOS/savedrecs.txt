In this paper, we propose a novel generative modelling of the Bayes' classification for the CRC problem in order to differentiate between colorectal cancer stages. The main contribution of this paper is the solution of the distinguishing problem between the critical CRC stages that remained unsolved in the published materials distinguishing the stage I with stage IV, and stage II with stage III. The Bayesian classifier enabled application of the 'smoothing procedure' over the data from the third stage, which succeeded to distinguish the probabilities of the mentioned stages. This results are obtained as a continuation of our previous work, where we proposed methodologies for statistical analysis of colorectal gene expression data obtained from the two widely used platforms, Affymetrix and Illumina. Furthermore, the unveiled biomarkers from the two platforms were used in our generative approach for modelling the gene expression probability distribution and were used in the Bayes' classification system, where we performed binary classifications. This novel approach will help in producing an accurate diagnostics system and precising the actual stage of the cancer. It is of great advantage for early prognosis of the disease and appropriate treatment.

J	Li, M; Shang, CX; Feng, SZ; Fan, JP				Li, Min; Shang, Changxing; Feng, Shengzhong; Fan, Jianping			Quick attribute reduction in inconsistent decision tables	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Rough set; Attribute reduction; Inconsistent decision table; Assignment reduct; Distribution reduct; Maximum distribution reduct	ROUGH SET-THEORY; KNOWLEDGE REDUCTION; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; COMPLEX-SYSTEMS; MODEL; RULES; APPROXIMATION	This paper focuses on three types of attribute reducts in inconsistent decision tables: assignment reduct, distribution reduct, and maximum distribution reduct. It is quite inconvenient to judge these three types of reduct directly according to their definitions. This paper proposes judgment theorems for the assignment reduct, the distribution reduct and the maximum distribution reduct, which are expected to greatly simplify the judging of these three types of reducts. On this basis, we derive three new types of attribute significance measures and construct the Q-ARA (Quick Assignment Reduction Algorithm), the Q-DRA (Quick Distribution Reduction Algorithm), and the Q-MDRA (Quick Maximum Distribution Reduction Algorithm). These three algorithms correspond to the three types of reducts. We conduct a series of comparative experiments with twelve UCI (machine learning data repository, University of California at Irvine) data sets (including consistent and inconsistent decision tables) to evaluate the performance of the three reduction algorithms proposed with the relevant algorithm QuickReduct [9,34]. The experimental results show that QuickReduct possesses weak robustness because it cannot find the reduct even for consistent data sets, whereas our proposed three algorithms show strong robustness because they can find the reduct for each data set. In addition, we compare the Q-DRA (Quick Distribution Reduction Algorithm) with the CEBARKNC (conditional entropy-based algorithm for reduction of knowledge without a computing core) [43] because both find the distribution reduct by using a heuristic search. The experimental results demonstrate that Q-DRA runs faster than CEBARKNC does because the distribution function of Q-DRA has a lower calculation cost. Instructive conclusions for these reduction algorithms are drawn from the perspective of classification performance for the C4.5 and RBF-SVM classifiers. Last, we make a comparison between discernibility matrix-based methods and our algorithms. The experimental results indicate that our algorithms are efficient and feasible. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Covering rough sets, as a generalization of classical rough sets, have attracted wide attention in both theory and application. This paper provides a novel method for attribute reduction based on covering rough sets. We review the concepts of consistent and inconsistent covering decision systems and their reducts and we develop a judgment theorem and a discernibility matrix for each type of covering decision system. Furthermore, we present some basic structural properties of attribute reduction with covering rough sets. Based on a discernibility matrix, we develop a heuristic algorithm to find a subset of attributes that approximate a minimal reduct Finally, the experimental results for UCI data sets show that the proposed reduction approach is an effective technique for addressing numerical and categorical data and is more efficient than the method presented in the paper (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

J	Balahur, A; Turchi, M				Balahur, Alexandra; Turchi, Marco			Comparative experiments using supervised learning and machine translation for multilingual sentiment analysis	COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Multilingual sentiment analysis; Opinion mining; Machine translation; Supervised learning		Sentiment analysis is the natural language processing task dealing with sentiment detection and classification from texts. In recent years, due to the growth in the quantity and fast spreading of user-generated contents online and the impact such information has on events, people and companies worldwide, this task has been approached in an important body of research in the field. Despite different methods having been proposed for distinct types of text, the research community has concentrated less on developing methods for languages other than English. In the above-mentioned context, the present work studies the possibility to employ machine translation systems and supervised methods to build models able to detect and classify sentiment in languages for which less/no resources are available for this task when compared to English, stressing upon the impact of translation quality on the sentiment classification performance. Our extensive evaluation scenarios show that machine translation systems are approaching a good level of maturity and that they can, in combination to appropriate machine learning algorithms and carefully chosen features, be used to build sentiment analysis systems that can obtain comparable performances to the one obtained for English.

J	Ghazi, D; Inkpen, D; Szpakowicz, S				Ghazi, Diman; Inkpen, Diana; Szpakowicz, Stan			Prior and contextual emotion of words in sentential context	COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE			English	Article						Sentiment analysis; Polarity; Emotion; Prior emotion; Contextual emotion; Syntactic features; Natural language processing; Machine learning	EXPRESSIONS; MODEL; TEXT	A set of words labeled with their prior emotion is an obvious place to start on the automatic discovery of the emotion of a sentence, but it is clear that context must also be considered. It may be that no simple function of the labels on the individual words captures the overall emotion of the sentence; words are interrelated and they mutually influence their affect-related interpretation. It happens quite often that a word which invokes emotion appears in a neutral sentence, or that a sentence with no emotional word carries an emotion. This could also happen among different emotion classes. The goal of this work is to distinguish automatically between prior and contextual emotion, with a focus on exploring features important in this task. We present a set of features which enable us to take the contextual emotion of a word and the syntactic structure of the sentence into account to put sentences into emotion classes. The evaluation includes assessing the performance of different feature sets across multiple classification methods. We show the features and a promising learning method which significantly outperforms two reasonable baselines. We group our features by the similarity of their nature. That is why another facet of our evaluation is to consider each group of the features separately and investigate how well they contribute to the result. The experiments show that all features contribute to the result, but it is the combination of all the features that gives the best performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Li, YY; Parker, LE				Li, YuanYuan; Parker, Lynne E.			Nearest neighbor imputation using spatial-temporal correlations in wireless sensor networks	INFORMATION FUSION			English	Article						Wireless sensor networks; kd-Tree; Missing data imputation; Nearest neighbor imputation	CLASSIFICATION	Missing data is common in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), especially with multi-hop communications. There are many reasons for this phenomenon, such as unstable wireless communications, synchronization issues, and unreliable sensors. Unfortunately, missing data creates a number of problems for WSNs. First, since most sensor nodes in the network are battery-powered, it is too expensive to have the nodes retransmit missing data across the network. Data re-transmission may also cause time delays when detecting abnormal changes in an environment. Furthermore, localized reasoning techniques on sensor nodes (such as machine learning algorithms to classify states of the environment) are generally not robust enough to handle missing data. Since sensor data collected by a WSN is generally correlated in time and space, we illustrate how replacing missing sensor values with spatially and temporally correlated sensor values can significantly improve the network's performance. However, our studies show that it is important to determine which nodes are spatially and temporally correlated with each other. Simple techniques based on Euclidean distance are not sufficient for complex environmental deployments. Thus, we have developed a novel Nearest Neighbor (NN) imputation method that estimates missing data in WSNs by learning spatial and temporal correlations between sensor nodes. To improve the search time, we utilize a kd-tree data structure, which is a non-parametric, data-driven binary search tree. Instead of using traditional mean and variance of each dimension for kd-tree construction, and Euclidean distance for kd-tree search, we use weighted variances and weighted Euclidean distances based on measured percentages of missing data. We have evaluated this approach through experiments on sensor data from a volcano dataset collected by a network of Crossbow motes, as well as experiments using sensor data from a highway traffic monitoring application. Our experimental results show that our proposed K-NN imputation method has a competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art Expectation-Maximization (EM) techniques, while using much simpler computational techniques, thus making it suitable for use in resource-constrained WSNs.

An approach to implement data fusion techniques in wireless sensor networks using genetic machine learning algorithms	INFORMATION FUSION			English	Article						Partial data fusion; Autonomic computing; Classifier systems		Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) can be used to monitor hazardous and inaccessible areas. In these situations, the power supply (e.g. battery) of each node cannot be easily replaced. One solution to deal with the limited capacity of current power supplies is to deploy a large number of sensor nodes, since the lifetime and dependability of the network will increase through cooperation among nodes. Applications on WSN may also have other concerns, such as meeting temporal deadlines on message transmissions and maximizing the quality of information. Data fusion is a well-known technique that can be useful for the enhancement of data quality and for the maximization of WSN lifetime. In this paper, we propose an approach that allows the implementation of parallel data fusion techniques in IEEE 802.15.4 networks. One of the main advantages of the proposed approach is that it enables a trade-off between different user-defined metrics through the use of a genetic machine learning algorithm. Simulations and field experiments performed in different communication scenarios highlight significant improvements when compared with, for instance, the Gur Game approach or the implementation of conventional periodic communication techniques over IEEE 802.15.4 networks.

MLMVN have demonstrated their ability to extract complex dynamic patterns from time series data for mid- and long-term predictions in several applications and benchmark studies. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first time that MLMVN are applied for reliability and degradation prediction. MLMVN are applied to a case study of predicting the level of degradation of railway track turnouts using real data. The performance of the algorithms is first evaluated using benchmark study data. The results obtained in the reliability prediction study of the benchmark data show that MLMVN outperform other machine learning algorithms in terms of prediction precision and are also able to perform multi-step ahead predictions, as opposed to the previously best performing benchmark studies which only performed up to two-step ahead predictions. For the railway turnout application, MLMVN confirm the good performance in the long-term prediction of degradation and do not show accumulating errors for multi-step ahead predictions.

Predictive modeling of addiction lapses in a mobile health application	JOURNAL OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT			English	Article						Alcoholism; Relapse; Machine learning; Lapse prediction; mHealth	ECOLOGICAL MOMENTARY ASSESSMENT; RELAPSE PREVENTION; USE DISORDERS; ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE; DRINKING; SYSTEM; VALIDATION; MOTIVATION; OUTCOMES; PEOPLE	The chronically relapsing nature of alcoholism leads to substantial personal, family, and societal costs. Addiction-comprehensive health enhancement support system (A-CHESS) is a smartphone application that aims to reduce relapse. To offer targeted support to patients who are at risk of lapses within the coming week, a Bayesian network model to predict such events was constructed using responses on 2,934 weekly surveys (called the Weekly Check-in) from 152 alcohol-dependent individuals who recently completed residential treatment. The Weekly Check-in is a self-monitoring service, provided in A-CHESS, to track patients' recovery progress. The model showed good predictability, with the area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.829 in the 10-fold cross-validation and 0.912 in the external validation. The sensitivity/specificity table assists the tradeoff decisions necessary to apply the model in practice. This study moves us closer to the goal of providing lapse prediction so that patients might receive more targeted and timely support. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

How to classify this kind of data is an important research topic for both pattern recognition and machine learning. In this paper, by analyzing the relationship between two famous traditional classification approaches, i.e., SVM and STM, a novel tensor-based method, i.e., multiple rank multi-linear SVM (MRMLSVM), is proposed. Different from traditional vector-based and tensor based methods, multiple-rank left and right projecting vectors are employed to construct decision boundary and establish margin function. We reveal that the rank of transformation can be regarded as a tradeoff parameter to balance the capacity of learning and generalization in essence. We also proposed an effective approach to solve the proposed non-convex optimization problem. The convergence behavior, initialization, computational complexity and parameter determination problems are analyzed. Compared with vector-based classification methods, MRMLSVM achieves higher accuracy and has lower computational complexity. Compared with traditional supervised tensor-based methods, MRMLSVM performs better for matrix data classification. Promising experimental results on various kinds of data sets are provided to show the effectiveness of our method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using meta-regression data mining to improve predictions of performance based on heart rate dynamics for Australian football	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Feature selection; Regression; Meta regression; Data mining; Heart rate dynamics; Australian football	RATE-VARIABILITY; MATCH PERFORMANCE; EXERCISE; RESPONSES; FITNESS	This work investigates the effectiveness of using computer-based machine learning regression algorithms and meta-regression methods to predict performance data for Australian football players based on parameters collected during daily physiological tests. Three experiments are described. The first uses all available data with a variety of regression techniques. The second uses a subset of features selected from the available data using the Random Forest method. The third used meta-regression with the selected feature subset. Our experiments demonstrate that feature selection and meta-regression methods improve the accuracy of predictions for match performance of Australian football players based on daily data of medical tests, compared to regression methods alone. Meta-regression methods and feature selection were able to obtain performance prediction outcomes with significant correlation coefficients. The best results were obtained by the additive regression based on isotonic regression for a set of most influential features selected by Random Forest. This model was able to predict athlete performance data with a correlation coefficient of 0.86 (p <0.05). Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An organ allocation system for liver transplantation based on ordinal regression	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Liver transplantation; Survival analysis; Machine learning; Support vector machines; Ordinal regression; Decision making	CLASSIFICATION; MACHINE; UTILITY; SCORE; MODEL	Liver transplantation is nowadays a widely-accepted treatment for patients who present a terminal liver disease. Nevertheless, transplantation is greatly hampered by the un-availability of suitable liver donors; several methods have been developed and applied to find a better system to prioritize recipients on the waiting list, although most of them only consider donor or recipient characteristics (but not both). This paper proposes a novel donor-recipient liver allocation system constructed to predict graft survival after transplantation by means of a dataset comprised of donor-recipient pairs from different centres (seven Spanish and one UK hospitals). The best model obtained is used in conjunction with the Model for Endstage Liver Disease score (MELD), one of the current assignation methodology most used globally. This problem is assessed using the ordinal regression learning paradigm due to the natural ordering in the classes of the problem, via a cascade binary decomposition methodology and the Support Vector Machine methodology. The methodology proposed has shown competitiveness in all the metrics selected, when compared to other machine learning techniques and efficiently complements the MELD score based on the principles of efficiency and equity. Finally, a simulation of the proposal is included, in order to visualize its performance in realistic situations. This simulation has shown that there are some determining factors in the characterization of the survival time after transplantation (concerning both donors and recipients) and that the joint use of these sets of information could be, in fact, more useful and beneficial for the survival principle. Nonetheless, the results obtained indicate the true complexity of the problem dealt within this study and the fact that other characteristics that have not been included in the dataset may be of importance for the characterization of the dependent variable (survival time after transplantation), thus starting a promising line of future work.

Various approaches have been introduced in the literature to deal with imbalanced datasets, and are typically based on oversampling, undersampling or cost-sensitive classification. In this paper, we introduce an effective ensemble of cost-sensitive decision trees for imbalanced classification. Base classifiers are constructed according to a given cost matrix, but are trained on random feature subspaces to ensure sufficient diversity of the ensemble members. We employ an evolutionary algorithm for simultaneous classifier selection and assignment of committee member weights for the fusion process. Our proposed algorithm is evaluated on a variety of benchmark datasets, and is confirmed to lead to improved recognition of the minority class, to be capable of outperforming other state-of-the-art algorithms, and hence to represent a useful and effective approach for dealing with imbalanced datasets.

It is expected to enable us to diagnose tumors precisely and systematically, and also bring the researchers of machine learning two challenges, the curse of dimensionality and the small sample size problems. We propose a manifold learning based dimensional reduction algorithm named orthogonal local discriminant embedding (O-LDE) and apply it to tumor classification. Comparing with the classical local discriminant embedding (LDE), O-LDE aims to obtain an orthogonal linear projection matrix by solving an optimization problem. After being projected into a low-dimensional subspace by O-LDE, the data points of the same class maintain their intrinsic neighbor relations, whereas the neighboring points of the different classes are far from each other. Experimental results on a public tumor dataset validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm.

One challenging problem for search-based face annotation scheme is how to effectively perform annotation by exploiting the list of most similar facial images and their weak labels that are often noisy and incomplete. To tackle this problem, we propose an effective unsupervised label refinement (ULR) approach for refining the labels of web facial images using machine learning techniques. We formulate the learning problem as a convex optimization and develop effective optimization algorithms to solve the large-scale learning task efficiently. To further speed up the proposed scheme, we also propose a clustering-based approximation algorithm which can improve the scalability considerably. We have conducted an extensive set of empirical studies on a large-scale web facial image testbed, in which encouraging results showed that the proposed ULR algorithms can significantly boost the performance of the promising SBFA scheme.

Philip			An adaptive regularization method for sparse representation	INTEGRATED COMPUTER-AIDED ENGINEERING			English	Article						Sparse representation classification; adaptive regularization parameter estimation; l(1) norm minimization	FACE RECOGNITION	Sparse representation (SR) or sparse coding (SC), which assumes the data vector can be sparse represented by linear combination over basis vectors, has been successfully applied in machine learning and computer vision tasks. In order to solve sparse representation problem, regularization technique is applied to constrain the sparsity of coefficients of linear representation. In this paper, a reconstruction-error-based adaptive regularization parameter estimation method is proposed to improve the representation ability of SR. The adaptive regularization parameter aims to balance the reconstruction error and the sparsity of coefficient vector and to minimize reconstruction error. Substantial experiments are performed on some benchmark databases. Simulation results demonstrate that this adaptive regularization parameter estimation method can find a proper parameter for each test sample, consequently, can improve the accuracy of SR and eliminate a time-consuming cross-validation process.

J	Muggleton, S				Muggleton, Stephen			Alan Turing and the development of Artificial Intelligence	AI COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Alan Turing; Artificial Intelligence; Machine Intelligence	MACHINE	During the centennial year of his birth Alan Turing (1912-1954) has been widely celebrated as having laid the foundations for Computer Science, Automated Decryption, Systems Biology and the Turing Test. In this paper we investigate Turing's motivations and expectations for the development of Machine Intelligence, as expressed in his 1950 article in Mind. We show that many of the trends and developments within AI over the last 50 years were foreseen in this foundational paper. In particular, Turing not only describes the use of Computational Logic but also the necessity for the development of Machine Learning in order to achieve human-level AI within a 50 year time-frame. His description of the Child Machine (a machine which learns like an infant) dominates the closing section of the paper, in which he provides suggestions for how AI might be achieved. Turing discusses three alternative suggestions which can be characterised as: (1) AI by programming, (2) AI by ab initio machine learning and (3) AI using logic, probabilities, learning and background knowledge. He argues that there are inevitable limitations in the first two approaches and recommends the third as the most promising. We compare Turing's three alternatives to developments within AI, and conclude with a discussion of some of the unresolved challenges he posed within the paper.

J	Cristianini, N				Cristianini, Nello			On the current paradigm in artificial intelligence	AI COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Philosophy of science; history of science; statistical artificial intelligence; data	UNREASONABLE EFFECTIVENESS; MATHEMATICS	The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has undergone many transformations, most recently the emergence of data-driven approaches centred on machine learning technology. The present article examines that paradigm shift by using the conceptual tools developed by Thomas Kuhn, and by analysing the contents of the longest running conference series in the field. A paradigm shift occurs when a new set of assumptions and values replaces the previous one within a given scientific community. These are often conveyed implicitly, by the choice of success stories that exemplify and define what a given field of research is about, demonstrating what kind of questions and answers are appropriate. The replacement of these exemplar stories corresponds to a shift in goals, methods, and expectations. We discuss the most recent such transition in the field of Artificial Intelligence, as well as commenting on some earlier ones.

Call triage is an operation that allows efficient choice of service grade and dispatching of a suitable rescue team service based on information obtained from a phone call. Call triage is now being tested in a few cities and is showing some benefit. However, there is the issue that if under-triage, in which the condition of the patient is underestimated, is eliminated, then the efficiency is degraded in the form of over-triage. In this report, in order to overcome the issue, a Bayesian network scheme is evaluated for a call triage system. The results of experiments with a real call triage data set show that the Bayesian network improves accuracy. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Distinguishing the causes of falls in humans using an array of wearable tri-axial accelerometers	GAIT & POSTURE			English	Article						Wearable sensors (accelerometers); Accidental falls (prevention and control); Posture and balance; Machine learning	ELDERLY-PEOPLE; ACCURACY; IMPACT; HOME	Falls are the number one cause of injury in older adults. Lack of objective evidence on the cause and circumstances of falls is often a barrier to effective prevention strategies. Previous studies have established the ability of wearable miniature inertial sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) to automatically detect falls, for the purpose of delivering medical assistance. In the current study, we extend the applications of this technology, by developing and evaluating the accuracy of wearable sensor systems for determining the cause of falls. Twelve young adults participated in experimental trials involving falls due to seven causes: slips, trips, fainting, and incorrect shifting/transfer of body weight while sitting down, standing up from sitting, reaching and turning. Features (means and variances) of acceleration data acquired from four tri-axial accelerometers during the falling trials were input to a linear discriminant analysis technique. Data from an array of three sensors (left ankle + right ankle + sternum) provided at least 83% sensitivity and 89% specificity in classifying falls due to slips, trips, and incorrect shift of body weight during sitting, reaching and turning. Classification of falls due to fainting and incorrect shift during rising was less successful across all sensor combinations. Furthermore, similar classification accuracy was observed with data from wearable sensors and a video-based motion analysis system. These results establish a basis for the development of sensor-based fall monitoring systems that provide information on the cause and circumstances of falls, to direct fall prevention strategies at a patient or population level.

J	Pillai, JK; Puertas, M; Chellappa, R				Pillai, Jaishanker K.; Puertas, Maria; Chellappa, Rama			Cross-Sensor Iris Recognition through Kernel Learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Sensor shift; cross-sensor matching; Kernel learning; adaptation; iris; biometrics	INTEROPERABILITY; BIOMETRICS; SYSTEMS	Due to the increasing popularity of iris biometrics, new sensors are being developed for acquiring iris images and existing ones are being continuously upgraded. Re-enrolling users every time a new sensor is deployed is expensive and time-consuming, especially in applications with a large number of enrolled users. However, recent studies show that cross-sensor matching, where the test samples are verified using data enrolled with a different sensor, often lead to reduced performance. In this paper, we propose a machine learning technique to mitigate the cross-sensor performance degradation by adapting the iris samples from one sensor to another. We first present a novel optimization framework for learning transformations on iris biometrics. We then utilize this framework for sensor adaptation, by reducing the distance between samples of the same class, and increasing it between samples of different classes, irrespective of the sensors acquiring them. Extensive evaluations on iris data from multiple sensors demonstrate that the proposed method leads to improvement in cross-sensor recognition accuracy. Furthermore, since the proposed technique requires minimal changes to the iris recognition pipeline, it can easily be incorporated into existing iris recognition systems.

The type of the target which passes between the transmitter and receiver can have significant effects on the shape of the received waveform. The signal measured by the bistatic UWB radar is related to the type of the target. From these received signals, we extract features that are representative of the target types. Then, we develop target type classification and recognition algorithm based on machine learning techniques. An improved support vector machine (SVM) classifier is developed to perform target types classification and recognition. A novel chaotic differential evolution (CDE) optimization approach using tent map is adopted to determine the parameters of SVM. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified by experiments taken in the forest. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, the possibility to transfer solifluction models within and between six study areas in subarctic and Arctic environments was examined. A generalized linear model, generalized additive model, maximum entropy and boosted regression tree methods were used in the analyses. The transferability success of the GDMs was assessed by the area under the curve of a receiver operating characteristic plot. Based on the results, slope angle, mean annual air temperature and a remote sensing based index of vegetation abundance were the most important variables contributing to the occurrence of solifluction at a landscape scale. In model extrapolation, over half of the calibrated solifluction models were transferable from one area to another. The topographical conditions of the study areas had a greater effect than climate conditions on the extrapolation potential. More precisely, it was more difficult to extrapolate the models to a high-relief environment than to an area with moderate topography. On the contrary, the models transferred within Arctic and subarctic areas were not better than the models between the Arctic and subarctic environments. In conclusion, (i) region specific geomorphological and environmental conditions may significantly affect the relative importance of variables in GDMs, (ii) solifluction models were transferable with certain limitations across areas, (iii) the range of the environmental conditions of the calibration area was a critical factor for transferability success and (iv) machine learning-based methods performed marginally better than parametric models in the model extrapolation. Extensive knowledge about the transferability of GDMs in space is needed before the models can be reliably used in climate change explorations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In view of the randomness of partitions in cross-validation, a new blocked 3x2 cross-validation is proposed to estimate generalization error in this letter. We then conduct an analysis of variance of the blocked 3x2 cross-validated estimator. A relatively conservative variance estimator that considers the correlation between any two two-fold cross-validations, and was previously neglected in 5x2 cross-validated t and F-tests is put forward. A corresponding test using this variance estimator is presented to compare the performances of algorithms. Simulated results show that the performance of our test is comparable with that of 5x2 cross-validated tests but with less computation complexity.

In recent years, SVMs have become increasingly popular for drug discovery-relevant applications such as compound classification, the search for novel active compounds and property predictions. Areas covered: The authors provide the readers with a brief introduction of SVM theory and discuss the kernel functions designed for drug discovery applications. The authors also review the different types of SVM applications in drug discovery, looking at particular case studies. Furthermore, the authors discuss the recent hybrid methods developed that incorporate SVM modeling in different ways. Expert opinion: SVMs are currently among the best-performing approaches for chemical and biological property prediction and the computational identification of active compounds. It is anticipated that their use in drug discovery will further increase. Indeed, this will also include the development of SVM-based meta-classifiers that combine different approaches and exploit their individual strengths and complementarity.

Disturbance legacies and climate jointly drive tree growth and mortality in an intensively studied boreal forest	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						boreal forest; carbon cycling; climate change; dendrology; disturbance; forest mortality; machine learning	BLACK SPRUCE CHRONOSEQUENCE; NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; COARSE WOODY DEBRIS; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; GLOBAL CONVERGENCE; CARBON STORAGE; CANADA FORESTS; CO2 EXCHANGE; FIRE; DROUGHT	Most North American forests are at some stage of post-disturbance regrowth, subject to a changing climate, and exhibit growth and mortality patterns that may not be closely coupled to annual environmental conditions. Distinguishing the possibly interacting effects of these processes is necessary to put short-term studies in a longer term context, and particularly important for the carbon-dense, fire-prone boreal forest. The goals of this study were to combine dendrochronological sampling, inventory records, and machine-learning algorithms to understand how tree growth and death have changed at one highly studied site (Northern Old Black Spruce, NOBS) in the central Canadian boreal forest. Over the 1999-2012 inventory period, mean tree diameter increased even as stand density and basal area declined significantly. Tree mortality averaged 1.4 +/- 0.6%yr(-1), with most mortality occurring in medium-sized trees; new recruitment was minimal. There have been at least two, and probably three, significant influxes of new trees since stand initiation, but none in recent decades. A combined tree ring chronology constructed from sampling in 2001, 2004, and 2012 showed several periods of extreme growth depression, with increased mortality lagging depressed growth by similar to 5years. Higher minimum and maximum air temperatures exerted a negative influence on tree growth, while precipitation and climate moisture index had a positive effect; both current- and previous-year data exerted significant effects. Models based on these variables explained 23-44% of the ring-width variability. We suggest that past climate extremes led to significant mortality still visible in the current forest structure, with decadal dynamics superimposed on slower patterns of fire and succession. These results have significant implications for our understanding of previous work at NOBS, the carbon sequestration capability of old-growth stands in a disturbance-prone landscape, and the sustainable management of regional forests in a changing climate.

J	Crowley, M				Crowley, Mark			Using Equilibrium Policy Gradients for Spatiotemporal Planning in Forest Ecosystem Management	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS			English	Article						Markov decision processes; reinforcement learning; machine learning; policy gradient planning; computational sustainability; ecosystem management; forestry planning; optimization	OPTIMIZATION	Spatiotemporal planning involves making choices at multiple locations in space over some planning horizon to maximize utility and satisfy various constraints. In Forest Ecosystem Management, the problem is to choose actions for thousands of locations each year including harvesting, treating trees for fire or pests, or doing nothing. The utility models could place value on sale of lumber, ecosystem sustainability or employment levels and incorporate legal and logistical constraints on actions such as avoiding large contiguous areas of clearcutting. Simulators developed by forestry researchers provide detailed dynamics but are generally inaccesible black boxes. We model spatiotemporal planning as a factored Markov decision process and present a policy gradient planning algorithm to optimize a stochastic spatial policy using simulated dynamics. It is common in environmental and resource planning to have actions at different locations be spatially interelated; this makes representation and planning challenging. We define a global spatial policy in terms of interacting local policies defining distributions over actions at each location conditioned on actions at nearby locations. Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation is used to sample landscape policies and estimate their gradients. Evaluation is carried out on a forestry planning problem with 1,880 locations using a variety of value models and constraints.

Android is fast becoming the most popular mobile platform resulting in sharp increase in malware targeting the platform. Additionally, Android malware is evolving rapidly to evade detection by traditional signature-based scanning. Despite current detection measures in place, timely discovery of new malware is still a critical issue. This calls for novel approaches to mitigate the growing threat of zero-day Android malware. Hence, the authors develop and analyse proactive machine-learning approaches based on Bayesian classification aimed at uncovering unknown Android malware via static analysis. The study, which is based on a large malware sample set of majority of the existing families, demonstrates detection capabilities with high accuracy. Empirical results and comparative analysis are presented offering useful insight towards development of effective static-analytic Bayesian classification-based solutions for detecting unknown Android malware.

Each point cloud is segmented into planar surfaces. Each subset of planes that represents an object is labelled and predicates describing those planes and their relationships are used for learning. Our claim is that a relational description for classes of 3D objects can be built for robust object categorisation in real robotic application. To test the hypothesis, labelled sets of planes from 3D point clouds gathered during the RoboCup Rescue Robot competition are used as positive and negative examples for an ILP system. The robustness of the results is evaluated by 10-fold cross validation. In addition, common household objects that have curved surfaces are used for evaluation and comparison against a well-known non-relational classifier. The results show that ILP can be successfully applied to recognise objects encountered by a robot especially in an urban search and rescue environment.

It has enabled a number of new machine learning applications, e.g. graph mining and link analysis. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) performs relational learning either directly by manipulating first-order rules or through propositionalization, which translates the relational task into an attribute-value learning task by representing subsets of relations as features. In this paper, we introduce a fast method and system for relational learning based on a novel propositionalization called Bottom Clause Propositionalization (BCP). Bottom clauses are boundaries in the hypothesis search space used by ILP systems Progol and Aleph. Bottom clauses carry semantic meaning and can be mapped directly onto numerical vectors, simplifying the feature extraction process. We have integrated BCP with a well-known neural-symbolic system, C-(ILP)-P-2, to perform learning from numerical vectors. C-(ILP)-P-2 uses background knowledge in the form of propositional logic programs to build a neural network. The integrated system, which we call CILP++, handles first-order logic knowledge and is available for download from Sourceforge. We have evaluated CILP++ on seven ILP datasets, comparing results with Aleph and a well-known propositionalization method, RSD. The results show that CILP++ can achieve accuracy comparable to Aleph, while being generally faster, BCP achieved statistically significant improvement in accuracy in comparison with RSD when running with a neural network, but BCP and RSD perform similarly when running with C4.5. We have also extended CILP++ to include a statistical feature selection method, mRMR, with preliminary results indicating that a reduction of more than 90 % of features can be achieved with a small loss of accuracy.

It provides real-time cross-sectional images of arteries and assists clinicians to infer about atherosclerotic plaques composition. These plaques are heterogeneous in nature and constitute fibrous tissue, lipid deposits and calcifications. Each of these tissues backscatter ultrasonic pulses and are associated with a characteristic intensity in B-mode IVUS image. However, clinicians are challenged when colocated heterogeneous tissue backscatter mixed signals appearing as non-unique intensity patterns in B-mode IVUS image. Tissue characterization algorithms have been developed to assist clinicians to identify such heterogeneous tissues and assess plaque vulnerability. In this paper, we propose a novel technique coined as Stochastic Driven Histology (SDH) that is able to provide information about co-located heterogeneous tissues. It employs learning of tissue specific ultrasonic backscattering statistical physics and signal confidence primal from labeled data for predicting heterogeneous tissue composition in plaques. We employ a random forest for the purpose of learning such a primal using sparsely labeled and noisy samples. In clinical deployment, the posterior prediction of different lesions constituting the plaque is estimated. Folded cross-validation experiments have been performed with 53 plaques indicating high concurrence with traditional tissue histology. On the wider horizon, this framework enables learning of tissue-energy interaction statistical physics and can be leveraged for promising clinical applications requiring tissue characterization beyond the application demonstrated in this paper.

We applied four different machine-learning algorithms, namely the Multi Layer Perceptron, trained, respectively, with the Conjugate Gradient, the Scaled Conjugate Gradient, the Quasi Newton learning rules and the Support Vector Machines, to tackle the problem of the classification of emission line galaxies in different classes, mainly AGNs versus non-AGNs, obtained using optical photometry in place of the diagnostics based on line intensity ratios which are classically used in the literature. Using the same photometric features, we discuss also the behaviour of the classifiers on finer AGN classification tasks, namely Seyfert I versus Seyfert II, and Seyfert versus LINER. Furthermore, we describe the algorithms employed, the samples of spectroscopically classified galaxies used to train the algorithms, the procedure followed to select the photometric parameters and the performances of our methods in terms of multiple statistical indicators. The results of the experiments show that the application of self-adaptive data mining algorithms trained on spectroscopic data sets and applied to carefully chosen photometric parameters represents a viable alternative to the classical methods that employ time-consuming spectroscopic observations.

However, brain-based features sensitive enough to discriminate individual subjects with a specific anxiety disorder and that track symptom severity longitudinally, desirable qualities for putative disorder-specific biomarkers, remain to be identified. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI during emotional face perceptual tasks and a new, large-scale and condition-dependent FC and machine learning approach were used to identify features (pair-wise correlations) that discriminated patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD, N = 16) from controls (N = 19). We assessed whether these features discriminated SAD from panic disorder (PD, N = 16), and SAD from controls in an independent replication sample that performed a similar task at baseline (N: SAD = 15, controls = 17) and following 8-weeks paroxetine treatment (N: SAD = 12, untreated controls = 7). High SAD vs HCs discrimination (area under the ROC curve, AUC, arithmetic mean of sensitivity and specificity) was achieved with two FC features during unattended neutral face perception (AUC = 0.88, P<0.05 corrected). These features also discriminated SAD vs PD (AUC = 0.82, P = 0.0001) and SAD vs HCs in the independent replication sample (FC during unattended angry face perception, AUC = 0.71, P = 0.01). The most informative FC was left hippocampus-left temporal pole, which was reduced in both SAD samples (replication sample P = 0.027), and this FC increased following the treatment (post>pre, t((11)) = 2.9, P = 0.007). In conclusion, SAD is associated with reduced FC between left temporal pole and left hippocampus during face perception, and results suggest promise for emerging FC-based biomarkers for SAD diagnosis and treatment effects.

Unlike interface prediction algorithms that are based on monomers alone, RCF is binding partner specific. We evaluated the performance of RCF using the area under the precision-recall (PR) curve (AUC) on a large protein docking Benchmark. RCF (AUC=0.44) performed as well as meta-PPISP (AUC=0.43), which is one of the best monomer-based interface prediction methods. In addition, we test a support vector machine (SVM) to combine RCF with meta-PPISP and another monomer-based interface prediction algorithm Evolutionary Trace to further improve the performance. We found that the SVM that combined RCF and meta-PPISP achieved the best performance (AUC=0.47). We used RCF to predict the binding interfaces of proteins that can bind to multiple partners and RCF was able to correctly predict interface residues that are unique for the respective binding partners. Furthermore, we found that residues that contributed greatly to binding affinity (hotspot residues) had significantly higher RCF than other residues. Proteins 2014; 82:57-66.

By using the cognitive and decision sciences as a case study, we provide an introduction to what is also known as the strategy selection problem. First, we explain why many researchers assume humans and other animals to come equipped with a repertoire of behavioral and cognitive processes. Second, we expose three descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive challenges that are common to all disciplines which aim to model the choice among these processes. Third, we give an overview of different approaches to strategy selection. These include cost-benefit, ecological, learning, memory, unified, connectionist, sequential sampling, and maximization approaches. We conclude by pointing to opportunities for future research and by stressing that the selection problem is far from being resolved. (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Such models have important applications to algorithm analysis, portfolio-based algorithm selection, and the automatic configuration of parameterized algorithms. Over the past decade, a wide variety of techniques have been studied for building such models. Here, we describe extensions and improvements of existing models, new families of models, and perhaps most importantly a much more thorough treatment of algorithm parameters as model inputs. We also comprehensively describe new and existing features for predicting algorithm runtime for propositional satisfiability (SAT), travelling salesperson (TSP) and mixed integer programming (MIP) problems. We evaluate these innovations through the largest empirical analysis of its kind, comparing to a wide range of runtime modelling techniques from the literature. Our experiments consider 11 algorithms and 35 instance distributions; they also span a very wide range of SAT, MIP and TSP instances, with the least structured having been generated uniformly at random and the most structured having emerged from real industrial applications. Overall, we demonstrate that our new models yield substantially better runtime predictions than previous approaches in terms of their generalization to new problem instances, to new algorithms from a parameterized space, and to both simultaneously.

A 3D numerical model of nearshore wave field behind submerged breakwaters	COASTAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Submerged breakwater; Wave field; 3D wave transmission; Numerical modeling; Artificial neural network; Radial-basis function	LOW-CRESTED STRUCTURES; NEURAL-NETWORK; TRANSMISSION; APPROXIMATION; CURRENTS	The functional design of submerged breakwaters is still developing, particularly with respect to modeling of the nearshore wave field behind the structure. An effective design tool needs to calculate both 2D and 3D effects. A numerical method for predicting the spatial transmission coefficient for regular waves in the shadow region of a 3D submerged breakwater is proposed in this paper. Two distinct models have been developed using machine learning algorithms; these artificial neural networks, based on multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and radial-basis function (RBF) methods, have been designed and trained against new laboratory experimental data expressed in terms of both dimensional and non-dimensional parameters. Comparisons between the experimental data and predictions from the trained models show that the non-dimensional RBF model is able to best predict the 3D wave field around the submerged breakwater. The performance of the model was validated in interpolation, extrapolation and at larger scale using different laboratory facilities, revealing sufficient agreement with the experimental results to suggest that it has potential as a design tool in real applications.

A well-established tool for extracting the intrinsically low-dimensional structure from such data is principal component analysis (PCA). Due to the inherent limitations of this linear method, its extensions to extraction of nonlinear structures have attracted increasing research interest in recent years. Assuming a generative model for noisy data, we develop a probabilistic approach for separating the data-generating nonlinear functions from noise. We demonstrate that ridges of the marginal density induced by the model are viable estimators for the generating functions. For projecting a given point onto a ridge of its estimated marginal density, we develop a generalized trust region Newton method and prove its convergence to a ridge point. Accuracy of the model and computational efficiency of the projection method are assessed via numerical experiments where we utilize Gaussian kernels for nonparametric estimation of the underlying densities of the test datasets.

Novel cardiovascular gene functions revealed via systematic phenotype prediction in zebrafish	DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Systems biology; Zebrafish; Cardiovascular; tmem88a	2ND HEART FIELD; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; INSERTIONAL MUTAGENESIS; CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; VERTEBRATE DEVELOPMENT; TRANSMEMBRANE PROTEIN; BINDING-PROTEIN; HUMAN GENOME; EXPRESSION; MODEL	Comprehensive functional annotation of vertebrate genomes is fundamental to biological discovery. Reverse genetic screening has been highly useful for determination of gene function, but is untenable as a systematic approach in vertebrate model organisms given the number of surveyable genes and observable phenotypes. Unbiased prediction of gene-phenotype relationships offers a strategy to direct finite experimental resources towards likely phenotypes, thus maximizing de novo discovery of gene functions. Here we prioritized genes for phenotypic assay in zebrafish through machine learning, predicting the effect of loss of function of each of 15,106 zebrafish genes on 338 distinct embryonic anatomical processes. Focusing on cardiovascular phenotypes, the learning procedure predicted known knockdown and mutant phenotypes with high precision. In proof-of-concept studies we validated 16 high-confidence cardiac predictions using targeted morpholino knockdown and initial blinded phenotyping in embryonic zebrafish, confirming a significant enrichment for cardiac phenotypes as compared with morpholino controls. Subsequent detailed analyses of cardiac function confirmed these results, identifying novel physiological defects for 11 tested genes. Among these we identified tmem88a, a recently described attenuator of Wnt signaling, as a discrete regulator of the patterning of intercellular coupling in the zebrafish cardiac epithelium. Thus, we show that systematic prioritization in zebrafish can accelerate the pace of developmental gene function discovery.

Typically, the contexts are represented as the vector space using "Bag of Words (BoW)" technique. Despite its ease of use, BoW representation suffers from well-known limitations, mostly due to its inability to exploit semantic similarity between terms. In this paper, we apply the semantic diffusion kernel, which models semantic similarity by means of a diffusion process on a graph defined by lexicon and co-occurrence information, to smooth the BoW representation for WSD systems. Semantic diffusion kernel can be obtained through a matrix exponentiation transformation on the given kernel matrix, and virtually exploits higher order co-occurrences to infer semantic similarity between terms. The superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated experimentally with several SensEval disambiguation tasks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Analog computation is more energy- and area-efficient at the cost of its limited accuracy, whereas digital computation is more versatile and derives greater benefits from technology scaling. Besides, design automation tools for digital circuits are much more sophisticated than those for analog circuits. TD-AMS exploits both advantages, and is a solution better suited to implementing a system on chip including functions for which high computational accuracy is not required, such as error correction, image processing, and machine learning. As an example, a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code decoder with the technique is implemented in 65 nm CMOS and achieves the best reported efficiencies of 10.4 pJ/bit and 6.1 Gbps/mm(2).

The advantage of alternating optimization developed from the state-of-the-art MKL is the SVM-tied overall complexity and the simultaneous optimization on both the kernel weights and the classifier. Unfortunately, in LMKL, the sample-specific character makes the updating of kernel weights a difficult quadratic nonconvex problem. In this paper, starting from a new primal-dual equivalence, the canonical objective on which state-of-the-art methods are based is first decomposed into an ensemble of objectives corresponding to each sample, namely, sample-wise objectives. Then, the associated sample-wise alternating optimization method is conducted, in which the localized kernel weights can be independently obtained by solving their exclusive sample-wise objectives, either linear programming (for l(1)-norm) or with closed-form solutions (for l(p)-norm). At test time, the learnt kernel weights for the training data are deployed based on the nearest-neighbor rule. Hence, to guarantee their generality among the test part, we introduce the neighborhood information and incorporate it into the empirical loss when deriving the sample-wise objectives. Extensive experiments on four benchmark machine learning datasets and two real-world computer vision datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

Here we describe anomaly detection with data mined Bayesian Networks, learning them from real world Automated Identification System (AIS) data, and from supplementary data, producing both dynamic and static Bayesian network models. We find that the learned networks are quite easy to examine and verify despite incorporating a large number of variables. We also demonstrate that combining dynamic and static modelling approaches improves the coverage of the overall model and thereby anomaly detection performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Relating the Content and Confidence of Recognition Judgments	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-LEARNING MEMORY AND COGNITION			English	Article						recognition memory; confidence; linguistics	DUAL-PROCESS MODEL; REMEMBER-KNOW; MEMORY; RECOLLECTION; FAMILIARITY; EXPERIENCES; ACCESS	The Remember/ Know procedure, developed by Tulving (1985) to capture the distinction between the conscious correlates of episodic and semantic retrieval, has spawned considerable research and debate. However, only a handful of reports have examined the recognition content beyond this dichotomous simplification. To address this, we collected participants' written justifications in support of ordinary old/new recognition decisions accompanied by confidence ratings using a 3-point scale (high/medium/low). Unlike prior research, we did not provide the participants with any descriptions of Remembering or Knowing and thus, if the justifications mapped well onto theory, they would do so spontaneously. Word frequency analysis (unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams), independent ratings, and machine learning techniques (Support Vector Machine [SVM]) converged in demonstrating that the linguistic content of high and medium confidence recognition differs in a manner consistent with dual process theories of recognition. For example, the use of "I remember," particularly when combined with temporal or perceptual information (e. g., "when," "saw," "distinctly"), was heavily associated with high confidence recognition. Conversely, participants also used the absence of remembering for personally distinctive materials as support for high confidence new reports ("would have remembered"). Thus, participants afford a special status to the presence or absence of remembering and use this actively as a basis for high confidence during recognition judgments. Additionally, the pattern of classification successes and failures of a SVM was well anticipated by the dual process signal detection model of recognition and inconsistent with a single process, strictly unidimensional approach.

The traditional supervised learning methods require a large amount of labeled face images to achieve good performance. In practice, however, labeled images are usually scarce while unlabeled ones may be abundant. In this paper, we introduce a semi-supervised face recognition method, in which semi-supervised linear discriminant analysis (SDA) and affinity propagation (AP) are integrated into a self-training framework. In particular, SDA is employed to compute the face subspace using both labeled and unlabeled images, and AP is used to identify the exemplars of different face classes in the subspace. The unlabeled data can then be classified according to the exemplars and the newly labeled data with the highest confidence are added to the labeled data, and the whole procedure iterates until convergence. A series of experiments on four face datasets are carried out to evaluate the performance of our algorithm. Experimental results illustrate that our algorithm outperforms the other unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised methods.

A machine learning study in two independent samples of patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and healthy subjects	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Bipolar disorder; MRI; Machine learning; Classification	VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; DSM-III-R; DISEASE CLASSIFICATION; PATTERN-CLASSIFICATION; CORTICAL THICKNESS; BRAIN STRUCTURE; GREY-MATTER; METAANALYSIS; RELIABILITY; INTERVIEW	Although structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revealed partly non-overlapping brain abnormalities in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, it is unknown whether structural MRI scans can be used to separate individuals with schizophrenia from those with bipolar disorder. An algorithm capable of discriminating between these two disorders could become a diagnostic aid for psychiatrists. Here, we scanned 66 schizophrenia patients, 66 patients with bipolar disorder and 66 healthy subjects on a 1.5 T MRI scanner. Three support vector machines were trained to separate patients with schizophrenia from healthy subjects, patients with schizophrenia from those with bipolar disorder, and patients with bipolar disorder from healthy subjects, respectively, based on their gray matter density images. The predictive power of the models was tested using cross-validation and in an independent validation set of 46 schizophrenia patients, 47 patients with bipolar disorder and 43 healthy subjects scanned on a 3 T MRI scanner. Schizophrenia patients could be separated from healthy subjects with an average accuracy of 90%. Additionally, schizophrenia patients and patients with bipolar disorder could be distinguished with an average accuracy of 88%.The model delineating bipolar patients from healthy subjects was less accurate, correctly classifying 67% of the healthy subjects and only 53% of the patients with bipolar disorder. In the latter group, lithium and antipsychotics use had no influence on the classification results. Application of the 1.5 T models on the 3 T validation set yielded average classification accuracies of 76% (healthy vs schizophrenia), 66% (bipolar vs schizophrenia) and 61% (healthy vs bipolar). In conclusion, the accurate separation of schizophrenia from bipolar patients on the basis of structural MRI scans, as demonstrated here, could be of added value in the differential diagnosis of these two disorders. The results also suggest that gray matter pathology in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder differs to such an extent that they can be reliably differentiated using machine learning paradigms.

(2012) manuscript discusses two key findings regarding feature selection (FS): (1) data driven FS was no better than using whole brain voxel data and (2) a priori biological knowledge was effective to guide FS. Use of FS is highly relevant in neuroimaging-based machine learning, as the number of attributes can greatly exceed the number of exemplars. We strongly endorse their demonstration of both of these findings, and we provide additional important practical and theoretical arguments as to why, in their case, the data-driven FS methods they implemented did not result in improved accuracy. Further, we emphasize that the data-driven FS methods they tested performed approximately as well as the all-voxel case. We discuss why a sparse model may be favored over a complex one with similar performance. We caution readers that the findings in the Chu et al. report should not be generalized to all data-driven FS methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we have applied the label propagation algorithm to search for these two types of stars from Data Release Eight (DR8) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which is verified to be efficient by calculating precision and recall. From nearly two million spectra including stars, galaxies and QSOs, we have found 260 new carbon stars in which 96 stars have been identified as dwarfs and 7 identified as giants, and 11 composition spectrum systems (each of them consists of a white dwarf and a carbon star). Similarly, using the label propagation method, we have obtained 29 new DZ white dwarfs from SDSS DR8. Compared with PCA reconstructed spectra, the 29 findings are typical DZ white dwarfs. We have also investigated their proper motions by comparing them with proper motion distribution of 9,374 white dwarfs, and found that they satisfy the current observed white dwarfs by SDSS generally have large proper motions. In addition, we have estimated their effective temperatures by fitting the polynomial relationship between effective temperature and g-r color of known DZ white dwarfs, and found 12 of the 29 new DZ white dwarfs are cool, in which nine are between 6,000 K and 6,600 K, and three are below 6,000 K.

J	Li, BK; Cong, Y; Tian, ZY; Xue, Y				Li Bing-Ke; Cong Yong; Tian Zhi-Yue; Xue Ying			Predicting and Virtually Screening the Selective Inhibitors of MMP-13 over MMP-1 by Molecular Descriptors and Machine Learning Methods	ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						Matrix metalloproteinase-13; Selective inhibitor; Machine learning method; Support vector machine; Random forest; Virtual screening	MATRIX-METALLOPROTEINASE INHIBITORS; IN-SILICO PREDICTION; HYDROXAMIC ACID ANALOGS; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; STRUCTURE-BASED DESIGN; BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION; SPARE MMP-1; TACE INHIBITORS; ARYL BACKBONE; RANDOM FOREST	Matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) is an interesting target for the prevention and therapy of osteoarthritis (OA). Interruption of MMP-13 activity with an inhibitor has the potential to affect OA. However, a broad-spectrum inhibitor, which restrains the other members of the MMP family, especially MMP-1, can cause musculoskeletal syndrome. So, the design and discovery of potential and highly selective inhibitors for MMP-13 over MMP-1 are necessary and of great significance for the development of novel therapeutic agents against OA. Two machine-learning (ML) methods, support vector machine and random forest (RF), were explored in this work to develop classification models for predicting selective inhibitors of MMP-13 over MMP-1 from diverse compounds. These ML models achieved promising prediction accuracies. Among the two ML models, RF gave the better performance, i.e., 97.58% for MMP-13 selective inhibitors and 100% for non-inhibitors. We also used different feature selection methods to extract the molecular features most relevant to selective inhibition of MMP-13 over MMP-1 from the two models. In addition, the better-performing RF model was used to perform virtual screening of MMP-13 selective inhibitors against the "fragment-like" subset of the ZINC database to enrich the potential active agents, thereby obtaining a series of the most potent candidates. Our study suggests that ML methods, particularly RF, are potentially useful for facilitating the discovery of MMP-13 inhibitors and for identifying the molecular descriptors associated with MMP-13 selective inhibitors.

Efficient optimization of fully-integrated inductive DC-DC converters comprising tapered inductor layout synthesis and temperature effects	ANALOG INTEGRATED CIRCUITS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						DC-DC converters; Expensive optimization; Active learning sample selection; Layout-based modeling; Tapered inductor layout	MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES; ON-CHIP; EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION; RF ICS; COMPONENTS; DESIGN; MODEL	The evolution of computer-aided design tools has extended the capabilities of a designer by pushing the optimality of complex circuits beyond the ad hoc manual implementation. This work presents a framework to co-optimize the circuit and the layout parameters of fully integrated inductive DC-DC converters. The framework comprises expensive optimization that is speeded up by active learning sample selection and evolutionary techniques to acquire an optimal converter. A tapered inductor topology is used to increase the quality of the on-chip inductor and to improve the efficiency of the overall monolithic DC-DC converter. The optimization framework is validated by co-optimizing the design parameters and the tapered inductor layout for a fully-integrated DC-DC boost converter in a 0.13 mu m CMOS technology. The power loss in the circuit is reduced with 27 % resulting in a 7 % efficiency improvement, compared to a fully-integrated DC-DC boost converter with a regular inductor topology.

An emotion understanding framework for intelligent agents based on episodic and semantic memories	AUTONOMOUS AGENTS AND MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; Emotion understanding ability; Episodic memory; Semantic memory; Intelligent agents; Multi-agent simulation	MODEL; EXPERIENCE; CHARACTERS; SYSTEMS; DESIGN	Emotional intelligence is the ability to process information about one's own emotions and the emotions of others. It involves perceiving emotions, understanding emotions, managing emotions and using emotions in thought processes and in other activities. Emotion understanding is the cognitive activity of using emotions to infer why an agent is in an emotional state and which actions are associated with the emotional state. For humans, knowledge about emotions includes, in part, emotional experiences (episodic memory) and abstract knowledge about emotions (semantic memory). In accordance with the need for more sophisticated agents, the current research aims to increase the emotional intelligence of software agents by introducing and evaluating an emotion understanding framework for intelligent agents. The framework organizes the knowledge about emotions using episodic memory and semantic memory. Its episodic memory learns by storing specific details of emotional events experienced firsthand or observed. Its semantic memory is a lookup table of emotion-related facts combined with semantic graphs that learn through abstraction of additional relationships among emotions and actions from episodic memory. The framework is simulated in a multi-agent system in which agents attempt to elicit target emotions in other agents. They learn what events elicit emotions in other agents through interaction and observation. To evaluate the importance of different memory components, we run simulations with components "lesioned". We show that our framework outperformed Q-learning, a standard method for machine learning.

In this paper, we develop a novel application of a linguistic decision tree for a robot route learning problem by dynamically deciding the robot's behavior, which is decomposed into atomic actions in the context of a specified task. We examine the real-time performance of training and control of a linguistic decision tree, and explore the possibility of training a machine learning model in an adaptive system without dual CPUs for parallelization of training and control. A quantified evaluation approach is proposed, and a score is defined for the evaluation of a model's robustness regarding the quality of training data. Compared with the nonlinear system identification nonlinear auto-regressive moving average with eXogeneous inputs model structure with offline parameter estimation, the linguistic decision tree model with online linguistic ID3 learning achieves much better performance, robustness, and reliability.

Such a nonstationary environment emerges when large-scale failures occur at power networks because of external disruptions such as hurricanes and severe storms. Power distribution networks lie at the edge of the grid, and are especially vulnerable to external disruptions. Quantifiable approaches are lacking and needed to learn nonstationary behaviors of large-scale failure and recovery of power distribution. This paper studies such nonstationary behaviors in three aspects. First, a novel formulation is derived for an entire life cycle of large-scale failure and recovery of power distribution. Second, spatial-temporal models of failure and recovery of power distribution are developed as geolocation-based multivariate nonstationary GI(t)/G(t)/infinity queues. Third, the nonstationary spatial-temporal models identify a small number of parameters to be learned. Learning is applied to two real-life examples of large-scale disruptions. One is from Hurricane Ike, where data from an operational network is exact on failures and recoveries. The other is from Hurricane Sandy, where aggregated data is used for inferring failure and recovery processes at one of the impacted areas. Model parameters are learned using real data. Two findings emerge as results of learning: 1) failure rates behave similarly at the two different provider networks for two different hurricanes but differently at the geographical regions and 2) both the rapid and slow-recovery are present for Hurricane Ike but only slow recovery is shown for a regional distribution network from Hurricane Sandy.

In real-world applications, costs, including money, time and other resources, are required to acquire the features. In some cases, there is a test cost constraint due to limited resources. We shall deliberately select an informative and cheap feature subset for classification. This paper proposes the feature selection with test cost constraint problem for this issue. The new problem has a simple form while described as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). Backtracking is a general algorithm for CSP, and it is efficient in solving the new problem on medium-sized data. As the backtracking algorithm is not scalable to large datasets, a heuristic algorithm is also developed. Experimental results show that the heuristic algorithm can find the optimal solution in most cases. We also redefine some existing feature selection problems in rough sets, especially in decision-theoretic rough sets, from the viewpoint of CSP. These new definitions provide insight to some new research directions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Four main areas of likely advancement are explored: cloud computing, aggregate data analyses, parallel computation, and automation. As these developments promise both new opportunities and new risks to clinicians and patients alike, the potential benefits are weighed against the hazards associated with each advance, with special considerations regarding patient safety under new computational platforms and methodologies. While the concerns of patient safety are legitimate, the authors contend that progress toward next-generation clinical informatics systems will bring about extremely valuable developments in quality improvement initiatives, clinical efficiency, outcomes analyses, data sharing, and adaptive radiotherapy.

But how to extract the imagination feature and classify them to control systems is an important problem. To simplify the complexity of the classification, the power band and a small number of electrodes have been used, but there is still a loss in classification accuracy in the state-of-art approaches. The critical problem is the machine learning art that when the signal into source has property of non-stationary causing the estimation of the population parameter to change over time. In this paper, we analyzed the performance of feature extraction method using several spatial filter such as common average reference (CAR), Laplacian (LAP), common spatial pattern analysis (CSP) and no-spatial filter techniques and feature reduction method using principle component analysis (PCA) based 90% rule variance and leave-one-out correct classification accuracy selection method; where support vector machine is the classifier. The simulation with non-stationary data set from BCI competition III-Iva shows that CAR best performance CSP method in non-stationary data and PCA with leave-one-out CCA could maintain CCA performance and reduced the trading off between training and testing 13.96% compared to not using PCA and 0.46% compared PCA with 90% variance.

Sleep monitoring by itself is a difficult problem due to both privacy and technical considerations. The proposed system uses a combination of non-invasive sensors to assess and report sleep patterns: a contact-based pressure mattress and a non-contact 3D image acquisition device, which can complement each other. To evaluate our system, we used real data collected in Heracleia Lab's assistive living apartment. Our system uses Machine Learning techniques to automatically analyze the collected data and recognize sleep patterns. It is non-invasive, as it does not disrupt the user's usual sleeping behavior and it can be used both at the clinic and at home with minimal cost.

Because both collecting and labeling TR data are expensive, it is usually cost prohibitive to require a large amount of TR data, as well as their corresponding category labels, to train a classification model with high classification accuracy. Because in practice we only have very limited amount of labeled and unlabeled training TR data, traditional semi-supervised learning methods and transfer learning methods, which are the most commonly used strategies to deal with the lack of training data in statistical learning, cannot work well in the task of automatic TR categorization. To address this challenge, we propose to tackle the TR categorization problem from a new perspective via self-taught learning, an emerging technique in machine learning. Self-taught learning is a special type of transfer learning. Instead of requiring labeled data from an auxiliary domain that are relevant to the classification task of interest as in traditional transfer learning methods, it learns the inherent structures of the auxiliary data and does not require their labels. As a result, a classifier achieves decent classification accuracy using the limited amount of labeled TR texts, with the assistance from the large amount of text data obtained from some inexpensive, or even no-cost, resources. That is, a cost-effective TR categorization system can be built that may be particularly useful for diagnosis of patients and training of new therapists. By further taking into account the discrete nature input text data, instead of using the traditional Gaussian sparse coding in self-taught learning, we use exponential family sparse coding to better simulate the distribution of the input data. We apply the proposed method to the task of classifying patient homework texts. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed automatic TR classification framework.

Recent experimental evidence revealed a more complex picture where these mechanisms are highly entangled and can have synergistic and antagonistic effects on each other. In this study, we identified shared stress-responsive genes between abiotic and biotic stresses in rice (Oryza sativa) by performing meta-analyses of microarray studies. About 70% of the 1,377 common differentially expressed genes showed conserved expression status, and the majority of the rest were down-regulated in abiotic stresses and up-regulated in biotic stresses. Using dimension reduction techniques, principal component analysis, and partial least squares discriminant analysis, we were able to segregate abiotic and biotic stresses into separate entities. The supervised machine learning model, recursive-support vector machine, could classify abiotic and biotic stresses with 100% accuracy using a subset of differentially expressed genes. Furthermore, using a random forests decision tree model, eight out of 10 stress conditions were classified with high accuracy. Comparison of genes contributing most to the accurate classification by partial least squares discriminant analysis, recursive-support vector machine, and random forests revealed 196 common genes with a dynamic range of expression levels in multiple stresses. Functional enrichment and coexpression network analysis revealed the different roles of transcription factors and genes responding to phytohormones or modulating hormone levels in the regulation of stress responses. We envisage the top-ranked genes identified in this study, which highly discriminate abiotic and biotic stresses, as key components to further our understanding of the inherently complex nature of multiple stress responses in plants.

Therefore, in the last decade the use of machine learning has spread rapidly throughout computer science and beyond. This approach, supported on advanced statistics analysis, is usually known as Data Mining (DM) and has been applied successfully in different knowledge domains. In the present study, we show that DM can make a great contribution in solving complex problems in civil engineering, namely in the field of geotechnical engineering. Particularly, the high learning capabilities of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) algorithm, characterized by it flexibility and non-linear capabilities, were applied in the prediction of the Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) of Jet Grouting (JG) samples directly extracted from JG columns, usually known as soilcrete. JG technology is a soft-soil improvement method worldwide applied, extremely versatile and economically attractive when compared with other methods. However, even after many years of experience still lacks of accurate methods for JG columns design. Accordingly, in the present paper a novel approach (based on SVM algorithm) for UCS prediction of soilcrete mixtures is proposed supported on 472 results collected from different geotechnical works. Furthermore, a global sensitivity analysis is applied in order to explain and extract understandable knowledge from the proposed model. Such analysis allows one to identify the key variables in UCS prediction and to measure its effect. Finally, a tentative step toward a development of UCS prediction based on laboratory studies is presented and discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, due to the high computational cost of the EM simulations, the efficiency of directly using evolutionary algorithms is often very low (e. g., several weeks' optimization time), which limits the application of these methods for many industrial applications. To address this problem, a new method, called surrogate model assisted differential evolution for antenna synthesis (SADEA), is presented in this paper. The key ideas are: (1) A Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model is constructed on-line to predict the performances of the candidate designs, saving a lot of computationally expensive EM simulations. (2) A novel surrogate model-aware evolutionary search mechanism is proposed, directing effective global search even when a traditional high-quality surrogate model is not available. Three complex antennas and two mathematical benchmark problems are selected as examples. Compared with the widely used differential evolution and particle swarm optimization, SADEA can obtain comparable results, but achieves a 3 to 7 times speed enhancement for antenna design optimization.

Discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) is used to extract transient information from the measured voltages. Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are utilized to identify the faulty-section and faulty-half. Bewley diagrams are observed for the traveling wave patterns and the wavelet coefficients of the aerial mode voltage are used to locate the fault. The transient simulation for different fault types and locations are obtained by ATP using frequency-dependent line and cable models. MATLAB is used to process the simulated transients and apply the proposed method. The performance of the method is tested for different fault inception angles (FIA), different fault resistances, non-linear high impedance faults (NLHIF), and non-ideal faults with satisfactory results. The impact of cable aging on the proposed method accuracy is also investigated.	[Livani, Hanif; Evrenosoglu, C.

Aimed at the problem, an object recognition method based on transfer learning framework for the remote sensing image is proposed in this paper. The feature vectors of the object data are extracted by an improved LBP firstly, and then the transfer learning is used to find the common parameters among the feature spaces of the object data with the different distributions. The transfer learning method can transfer knowledge from the old object data to the new object data and improve the performance of the object recognition. According to the experiments in the satellite remote sensing images, it shows that the accuracy of object recognition has been greatly improved by our proposed method compared with the other classical methods.

In yeast, it was reported that such antisense transcripts play regulatory roles for their partner genes by forming a feedback loop with the protein-coding genes. Since not all coding genes have accompanying antisense transcripts, it would be interesting to know whether there are sequence signatures in a coding gene that are decisive or associated with the existence of such antisense partners. We collected all the annotated antisense transcripts in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, analyzed sequence motifs around the genes with antisense partners, and classified genes with and without accompanying antisense transcripts by using machine learning methods. Some weak but statistically significant sequence features are detected, which indicates that there are sequence signatures around the protein-coding genes that may be decisive or indicative for the existence of accompanying antisense transcripts.

Analysis is conducted for a residential neighborhood in Vancouver, Canada. Four separate models are developed to represent the increasing sophistication of spatial data available to municipalities. Results indicate that the random forests model using only LiDAR-derived building attributes predicts age with an average error (RMSE) of 16.8 years and 33.5% of the variance explained. When all attributes are combined from the various datasets the predictive capacity of the model is increased by 20% and the average error reduced to 15.8 years. Furthermore, examination of variable importance suggests that while mean building height derived from the LiDAR data is the most important attribute predicting age, the three subsequently ranked variables relate to non-LiDAR based attributes. Discussion is given to observable trends between select predictor variables and building age, and to the implications for building energy modeling and simulation efforts. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Gene-gene expression correlations are a common source of molecular networks because they can be extracted from high-dimensional disease data and encapsulate the activity of multiple regulatory systems. However, the analysis of gene coexpression patterns is often treated as a mechanistic black box, in which looming hub genes' direct cellular networks, and where other features are obscured. By examining the biophysical bases of coexpression and gene regulatory changes that occur in disease, recent studies suggest it is possible to use coexpression networks as a multi-omic screening procedure to generate novel hypotheses for disease mechanisms. Because technical processing steps can affect the outcome and interpretation of coexpression networks, we examine the assumptions and alternatives to common patterns of coexpression analysis and discuss additional topics such as acceptable datasets for coexpression analysis, the robust identification of modules, disease-related prioritization of genes and molecular systems and network meta-analysis. To accelerate coexpression research beyond modules and hubs, we highlight some emerging directions for coexpression network research that are especially relevant to complex brain disease, including the centrality-lethality relationship, integration with machine learning approaches and network pharmacology.

However, there is a lot of legacy content encoded with H.264/AVC. This paper proposes and evaluates several transcoding algorithms from the H.264/AVC to the HEVC format. In particular, a novel transcoding architecture, in which the first frames of the sequence are used to compute the parameters so that the transcoder can learn the mapping for that particular sequence, is proposed. Then, two types of mode mapping algorithms are proposed. In the first solution, a single H.264/AVC coding parameter is used to determine the outgoing HEVC partitions using dynamic thresholding. The second solution uses linear discriminant functions to map the incoming H.264/AVC coding parameters to the outgoing HEVC partitions. This paper contains experiments designed to study the impact of the number of frames used for training in the transcoder. Comparisons with existing transcoding solutions reveal that the proposed work results in lower rate-distortion loss at a competitive complexity performance.

This study presents a noninvasive surface EMG method for supporting diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Three diagnostic markers including the clustering index, the kurtosis of EMG amplitude histogram, and the kurtosis of EMG crossing-rate expansion, were used respectively to characterize surface EMG patterns recorded during different levels of voluntary muscle contraction. We then applied a linear discriminant analysis classifier to discriminate the ALS subjects from the neurologically intact subjects, using the statistics derived from all the three markers as input feature sets to the classifier. The method was tested in 10 ALS subjects and 11 neurologically intact subjects. Combination of the three surface EMG markers achieved 90% diagnostic sensitivity and 100% diagnostic specificity, which were higher than solely using a single surface EMG marker. Given the high diagnostic yield, the proposed surface EMG analysis can be used as a supplement to needle EMG examination in supporting the diagnosis of ALS.

We illustrate the proposed method in the context of human behaviour modeling on a sample scenario from the EDA project A-0938-RT-GC EUSAS. The method revolves around the twin concepts of a causal partition of a variable of interest, and a causal summary of a simulation run. We broadly define a causal summary as a partition of the significant values of the analyzed variables ( in our case the simulated motives fear and anger of human beings) into separate contributions by various causing factors, such as social influence or external events. We demonstrate that such causal summaries can be processed by machine learning techniques ( e. g. clustering and classification) and facilitate meaningful interpretations of the emergent behaviours of complex agent-based models.

According to a report released by an American security firm, RSA, there have been approximately 33,000 phishing attacks globally each month in 2012, leading to a loss of $687 million. Therefore, fighting against phishing attacks is of great importance. One popular and widely-deployed solution with browsers is to integrate a blacklist sites into them. However, this solution, which is unable to detect new attacks if the database is out of date, appears to be not effective when there are a lager number of phishing attacks created very day. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem by applying Genetic Programming to phishing detection problem. We conducted the experiments on a data set including both phishing and legitimate sites collected from the Internet. We compared the performance of Genetic Programming with a number of other machine learning techniques and the results showed that Genetic Programming produced the best solutions to phishing detection problem.			anh.pt204@gmail.com; quanguyhn@gmail.com; nxhoai@gmail.com						20	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	2194-5357		978-3-319-02821-7; 978-3-319-02820-0	ADV INTELL SYST			2014	245						185	195		10.1007/978-3-319-02821-7_18		11	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Computer Science; Engineering	BJR51	WOS:000329821100018

At the discourse level, they contains lots of reference phenomena which make the understanding of laws become more difficult. This paper investigates the task of reference resolution in the legal domain. The aim is to create a system which can automatically extracts referents for references in a real time. This is a new interesting task in the research of Legal Engineering. It does not only help readers in comprehending the law, support law makers in developing and amending laws, but also support in building an information system which works based on laws, etc. The main issues are to detect references and then resolve them to their referents. To detect references, we use a powerful machine learning technique rather than rule-based approaches as used in previous works. In resolving them, we design regular expressions to catch up the position of referents. We also build a corpus using Japanese National Pension Law to train and test our model. Our final system achieved 91.6% in the F1 score in detecting references, 96.18% accuracy in resolving them, and 88.5% in the F1 score in the end-to-end system.

In this paper we study the Hermite-Fejer interpolation operator which has this potential of applications. The interpolation is defined by zeros of the Jacobi polynomials with parameters -1 < alpha, beta < 0. Approximation rate is obtained for continuous functions. Asymptotic expression of the K-functional associated with the interpolation operators is given.

The design of the algorithm consists of two blocks. In the first one, a machine learning process is carried out, allowing the generation of a set of rules which, when applied over the image, permit the construction of a mask with the pixels candidates to be part of the pigment network. In the second block, an analysis of the structures over this mask is carried out, searching for those corresponding to the pigment network and making the diagnosis, whether it has pigment network or not, and also generating the mask corresponding to this pattern, if any. The method was tested against a database of 220 images, obtaining 86% sensitivity and 81.67% specificity, which proves the reliability of the algorithm. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Visual Analysis to Generate and Validate Geographical Heuristics	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						visualizations; visual inspection; geographical heuristics; machine learning	SEGREGATION; CHILE	The popularity of smartphones has opened endless possibilities for researchers. The adoption of these devices by all kind of users has transformed each one of them into a mobile sensor that can measure different types of data. These data can eventually be transmitted via Internet to servers where it can be studied to understand different aspects of the environment and human behavior in ways that were not possible a few years ago. Even with all this information available, the granularity of the data can be coarse, and the amount of it can be scarce, making it difficult to study and evaluate such data. This is especially true for certain geographically-related problems, where conventional algorithms are difficult to design. For these problems it is possible to design heuristics to reach a good approximation, however the methodology to assess the effectiveness of such heuristics is unclear. In this paper we present our work towards a methodology to generate and evaluate such heuristics. This methodology is based on displaying geographical information visually so human evaluators can judge the quality of the heuristic and combining it with the calculation power of computers.

J	Dorri, F; Ghodsi, A				Dorri, Fatemeh; Ghodsi, Ali			Minimizing the Discrepancy Between Source and Target Domains by Learning Adapting Components	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						domain adaptation; kernel embedding; Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion		Predicting the response variables of the target dataset is one of the main problems in machine learning. Predictive models are desired to perform satisfactorily in a broad range of target domains. However, that may not be plausible if there is a mismatch between the source and target domain distributions. The goal of domain adaptation algorithms is to solve this issue and deploy a model across different target domains. We propose a method based on kernel distribution embedding and Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) to address this problem. The proposed method embeds both source and target data into a new feature space with two properties: 1) the distributions of the source and the target datasets are as close as possible in the new feature space, and 2) the important structural information of the data is preserved. The embedded data can be in lower dimensional space while preserving the aforementioned properties and therefore the method can be considered as a dimensionality reduction method as well. Our proposed method has a closed-form solution and the experimental results show that it works well in practice.

Multimedia event detection with multimodal feature fusion and temporal concept localization	MACHINE VISION AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Multimedia; Classification; Machine learning; Fusion	SCORE NORMALIZATION; VIDEO	We present a system for multimedia event detection. The developed system characterizes complex multimedia events based on a large array of multimodal features, and classifies unseen videos by effectively fusing diverse responses. We present three major technical innovations. First, we explore novel visual and audio features across multiple semantic granularities, including building, often in an unsupervised manner, mid-level and high-level features upon low-level features to enable semantic understanding. Second, we show a novel Latent SVM model which learns and localizes discriminative high-level concepts in cluttered video sequences. In addition to improving detection accuracy beyond existing approaches, it enables a unique summary for every retrieval by its use of high-level concepts and temporal evidence localization. The resulting summary provides some transparency into why the system classified the video as it did. Finally, we present novel fusion learning algorithms and our methodology to improve fusion learning under limited training data condition. Thorough evaluation on a large TRECVID MED 2011 dataset showcases the benefits of the presented system.

However, like other evolutionary algorithms, it tends to suffer from premature convergence and slow convergence rate when solving complex problems. In this paper, we propose an enhanced GEP algorithm, called CTSGEP, which is inspired by the principle of minimal free energy in thermodynamics. In CTSGEP, it employs a component thermodynamical selection (CTS) operator to quantitatively keep a balance between the selective pressure and the population diversity during the evolution process. Experiments are conducted on several benchmark datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. The results show that the performance of CTSGEP is better than the conventional GEP and some GEP variations.

Improvement of Adequate Use of Warfarin for the Elderly Using Decision Tree-based Approaches	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Warfarin; anticoagulant; decision support techniques; decision trees; health services for the elderly	MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; AFRICAN-AMERICANS; CHINESE PATIENTS; DOSE PREDICTION; LIVER-FUNCTION; ANTICOAGULATION; THERAPY; REGIMEN; VKORC1; RISK	Objectives: Due to the narrow therapeutic range and high drug-to-drug interactions (DDIs), improving the adequate use of warfarin for the elderly is crucial in clinical practice. This study examines whether the effectiveness of using warfarin among elderly inpatients can be improved when machine learning techniques and data from the laboratory information system are incorporated. Methods: Having employed 288 validated clinical cases in the DDI group and 89 cases in the non-DDI group, we evaluate the prediction performance of seven classification techniques, with and without an Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm. Measures including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve are used to evaluate model performance. Results: Decision tree-based classifiers outperform other investigated classifiers in all evaluation measures. The classifiers supplemented with AdaBoost can generally improve the performance. In addition, weight, congestive heart failure, and gender are among the top three critical variables affecting prediction accuracy for the non-DDI group, while age, ALT, and warfarin doses are the most influential factors for the DDI group. Conclusion: Medical decision support systems incorporating decision tree-based approaches improve predicting performance and thus may serve as a supplementary tool in clinical practice. Information from laboratory tests and inpatients' history should not be ignored because related variables are shown to be decisive in our prediction models, especially when the DDIs exist.	[Liu, K.

However, there is not a user-friendly system available to date for public users to discriminate the common cell types, embryonic stem cells (ESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and somatic cells (SCs). Here, we develop WCTDS, a web-server of cell type discrimination system, to discriminate the three cell types and their subtypes like fetal versus adult SCs. WCTDS is developed as a top layer application of our recent publication regarding cell type discriminations, which employs DNA-methylation as biomarkers and machine learning models to discriminate cell types. Implemented by Django, Python, R, and Linux shell programming, run under Linux-Apache web server, and communicated through MySQL, WCTDS provides a friendly framework to efficiently receive the user input and to run mathematical models for analyzing data and then to present results to users. This framework is flexible and easy to be expended for other applications. Therefore, WCTDS works as a user-friendly framework to discriminate cell types and subtypes and it can also be expended to detect other cell types like cancer cells.

Data-Driven Link Quality Prediction Using Link Features	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article						Design; Measurement; Performance; Link quality estimation; link quality prediction	WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS	As an integral part of reliable communication in wireless networks, effective link estimation is essential for routing protocols. However, due to the dynamic nature of wireless channels, accurate link quality estimation remains a challenging task. In this article, we propose 4C, a novel link estimator that applies link quality prediction along with link estimation. Our approach is data driven and consists of three steps: data collection, offline modeling, and online prediction. The data collection step involves gathering link quality data, and based on our analysis of the data, we propose a set of guidelines for the amount of data to be collected in our experimental scenarios. The modeling step includes offline prediction model training and selection. We present three prediction models that utilize different machine learning methods, namely, naive Bayes classifier, logistic regression, and artificial neural networks. Our models take a combination of PRR and the physical-layer information, that is, Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and Link Quality Indicator (LQI) as input, and output the success probability of delivering the next packet. From our analysis and experiments, we find that logistic regression works well among the three models with small computational cost. Finally, the third step involves the implementation of 4C, a receiver-initiated online link quality prediction module that computes the short temporal link quality. We conducted extensive experiments in the Motelab and our local indoor testbeds, as well as an outdoor deployment. Our results with single-and multiple-senders experiments show that with 4C, CTP improves the average cost of delivering a packet by 20% to 30%. In some cases, the improvement is larger than 45%.

K-SVD, which generalizes k-means clustering, is one of the most famous algorithms for sparse representation and dictionary learning. K-SVD is an iterative method that alternates between encoding the data sparsely by using the current dictionary and updating the dictionary based on the sparsely represented data. In this paper, we introduce a single-pass K-SVD method. In this method, the previous input data are first summarized as a condensed representation of weighted samples. Then, we developed a weighted K-SVD algorithm to learn a dictionary from the union of this representation and the newly input data. Experimental results show that our approach can approximate K-SVD's performance well by consuming considerably less storage resource.

The solution of the CSG problem finds applications in many fields such as Machine Learning (set covering machines, clustering), Data Mining (decision tree, discretization), Graph Theory, Natural Language Processing (aggregation), Semantic Web (service composition), and Bioinformatics. The problem of finding the optimal coalition structure is NP-complete. In this paper we present a greedy adaptive search procedure (GRASP) with path-relinking to efficiently search the space of coalition structures. Experiments and comparisons to other algorithms prove the validity of the proposed method in solving this hard combinatorial problem.	[Di Mauro, Nicola; Basile, Teresa M.

There exist two major reasons for that. The first is that PEiD does not provide a way to create signatures, though it adopts a signature-based approach. We need to create signatures manually, and it is difficult to catch up with packers created or upgraded rapidly. The second is that PEiD utilizes exact matching. If a signature contains any error, PEiD cannot identify the packer that corresponds to the signature. In this paper, we propose a new automated packer identification method to overcome the limitations of PEiD and report the results of our numerical study. Our method applies string-kernel-based support vector machine (SVM): it can measure the similarity between packed programs without our operations such as manually creating signature and it provides some error tolerant mechanism that can significantly reduce detection failure caused by minor signature violations. In addition, we use the byte sequence starting from the entry point of a packed program as a packer's feature given to SVM. That is, our method combines the advantages from signature-based approach and machine learning (ML) based approach. The numerical results on 3902 samples with 26 packer classes and 3 unpacked (not-packed) classes shows that our method achieves a high accuracy of 99.46% outperforming PEiD and an existing ML-based method that Sun et al. have proposed.

However, arbiter-based PUFs utilizing the relative delay-time difference between equivalent paths have a security issue in which the generated challenge-response pairs (CRPs) can be predicted by a machine learning attack. We previously proposed the RG-DTM PUF, in which a response is decided from divided time domains allocated to response 0 or 1, to improve the uniqueness of the conventional arbiter-PUF in a small circuit. However, its resistance against machine learning attacks has not yet been studied. In this paper, we evaluate the resistance against machine learning attacks by using a support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR) in both simulations and measurements and compare the RG-DTM PUP with the conventional arbiter-PUF and with the XOR arbiter-PUF, which strengthens the resistance by using XORing output from multiple arbiter-PUFs. In numerical simulations, prediction rates using both SVM and LR were above 90% within 1,000 training CRPs on the arbiter-PUP. The machine learning attack using the SVM could never predict responses on the XOR arbiter-PUP with over six arbiter-PUFs, whereas the prediction rate eventually reached 95% using the LR and many training CRPs. On the RG-DTM PUP, when the division number of the time domains was over eight, the prediction rates using the SVM were equal to the probability by guess. The machine learning attack using LR has the potential to predict responses, although an adversary would need to steal a significant amount of CRPs. However, the resistance can exponentially be strengthened with an increase in the division number, just like with the XOR arbiter-PUP. Over one million CRPs are required to attack the 16-divided RG-DTM PUP. Differences between the RG-DTM PUP and the XOR arbiter-PUP relate to the area penalty and the power penalty. Specifically, the XOR arbiter-PUP has to make up for resistance against machine learning attacks by increasing the circuit area, while the RG-DTM PUP is resistant against machine learning attacks with less area penalty and power penalty since only capacitors are added to the conventional arbiter-PUP. We also attacked RG-DTM PUP chips, which were fabricated with 0.18-mu m CMOS technology, to evaluate the effect of physical variations and unstable responses. The resistance against machine learning attacks was related to the delay-time difference distribution, but unstable responses had little influence on the attack results.

However identifying new biologically active small molecules is still a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a new activity prediction approach using Bayesian belief network for classification (BBNC). The roots of the network are the fragments composing a compound. The leaves are, on one side, the activities to predict and, on another side, the unknown compound. The activities are represented by sets of known compounds, and sets of inactive compounds are also used. We calculated a similarity between an unknown compound and each activity class. The more similar activity is assigned to the unknown compound. We applied this new approach on eight well-known data sets extracted from the literature and compared its performance to three classical machine learning algorithms. Experiments showed that BBNC provides interesting prediction rates (from 79% accuracy for high diverse data sets to 99% for low diverse ones) with a short time calculation. Experiments also showed that BBNC is particularly effective for homogeneous data sets but has been found to perform less well with structurally heterogeneous sets. However, it is important to stress that we believe that using several approaches whenever possible for activity prediction can often give a broader understanding of the data than using only one approach alone. Thus, BBNC is a useful addition to the computational chemist's toolbox.

Ligand and Structure-Based Classification Models for Prediction of P-Glycoprotein Inhibitors	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							EMPIRICAL SCORING FUNCTIONS; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANCE; ABC-TRANSPORTERS; COMPUTATIONAL MODELS; BINDING; APPLICABILITY; METABOLISM; MODULATORS; DOCKING; DESIGN	The ABC transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) actively transports a wide range of drugs and toxins out of cells, and is therefore related to multidrug resistance and the ADME profile of therapeutics. Thus, development of predictive in silico models for the identification of P-gp inhibitors is of great interest in the field of drug discovery and development. So far in silico P-gp inhibitor prediction was dominated by ligand-based approaches because of the lack of high-quality structural information about P-gp. The present study aims at comparing the P-gp inhibitor/noninhibitor classification performance obtained by docking into a homology model of P-gp, to supervised machine learning methods, such as Kappa nearest neighbor, support vector machine (SVM), random fores,t and binary QSAR, by using a large, structurally diverse data set. In addition, the applicability domain of the models was assessed using an algorithm based on Euclidean distance. Results show that random forest and SVM performed best for classification of P-gp inhibitors and noninhibitors, correctly predicting 73/75% of the external test set compounds. Classification based on the docking experiments using the scoring function ChemScore resulted in the correct prediction of 61% of the external test set. This demonstrates that ligand-based models currently remain the methods of choice for accurately predicting P-gp inhibitors. However, structure-based classification offers information about possible drug/protein interactions, which helps in understanding the molecular basis of ligand-transporter interaction and could therefore also support lead optimization.

Functional Motions Modulating VanA Ligand Binding Unraveled by Self-Organizing Maps	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							D-LACTATE LIGASE; D-ALANINE LIGASE; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; FREE-ENERGIES; VANCOMYCIN RESISTANCE; PROTEIN-STRUCTURE; DIELECTRIC MEDIUM; DRUG DISCOVERY; EWALD METHOD; DOCKING	The VanA D-Ala:D-Lac ligase is a key enzyme in the emergence of high level resistance to vancomycin in Enterococcus species and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. It catalyzes the formation of D-Ala-D-Lac instead of the vancomycin target, D-Ala-D-Ala, leading to the production of modified, low vancomycin binding affinity peptidoglycan precursors. Therefore, VanA appears as an attractive target for the design of new antibacterials to overcome resistance. The catalytic site of VanA is delimited by three domains and closed by an omega-loop upon enzymatic reaction. The aim of the present work was (i) to investigate the conformational transition of VanA associated with the opening of its omega-loop and of a part of its central domain and (ii) to relate this transition with the substrate or product binding propensities. Molecular dynamics trajectories of the VanA ligase of Enterococcus faecium with or without a disulfide bridge distant from the catalytic site revealed differences in the catalytic site conformations with a slight opening. Conformations were clustered with an original machine learning method, based on self-organizing maps (SOM), which revealed four distinct conformational basins. Several ligands related to substrates, intermediates, or products were docked to SOM representative conformations with the DOCK 6.5 program. Classification of ligand docking poses, also performed with SOM, clearly distinguished ligand functional classes: substrates, reaction intermediates, and product. This result illustrates the acuity of the SOM classification and supports the quality of the DOCK program poses. The protein ligand interaction features for the different classes of poses will guide the search and design of novel inhibitors.

In this paper we present Ratsnake, a publicly available generic image annotation tool providing annotation efficiency, semantic awareness, versatility, and extensibility, features that can be exploited to transform it into an effective CAD system. In order to demonstrate this unique capability, we present its novel application for the evaluation and quantification of salient objects and structures of interest in kidney biopsy images. Accurate annotation identifying and quantifying such structures in microscopy images can provide an estimation of pathogenesis in obstructive nephropathy, which is a rather common disease with severe implication in children and infants. However a tool for detecting and quantifying the disease is not yet available. A machine learning-based approach, which utilizes prior domain knowledge and textural image features, is considered for the generation of an image force field customizing the presented tool for automatic evaluation of kidney biopsy images. The experimental evaluation of the proposed application of Ratsnake demonstrates its efficiency and effectiveness and promises its wide applicability across a variety of medical imaging domains.

J	Wang, JZ; Zhou, S; Yi, YG; Kong, J				Wang, Jianzhong; Zhou, Shuang; Yi, Yugen; Kong, Jun			An Improved Feature Selection Based on Effective Range for Classification	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article							EXPRESSION; REDUNDANCY; CANCER	Feature selection is a key issue in the domain of machine learning and related fields. The results of feature selection can directly affect the classifier's classification accuracy and generalization performance. Recently, a statistical feature selection method named effective range based gene selection (ERGS) is proposed. However, ERGS only considers the overlapping area (OA) among effective ranges of each class for every feature; it fails to handle the problem of the inclusion relation of effective ranges. In order to overcome this limitation, a novel efficient statistical feature selection approach called improved feature selection based on effective range (IFSER) is proposed in this paper. In IFSER, an including area (IA) is introduced to characterize the inclusion relation of effective ranges. Moreover, the samples' proportion for each feature of every class in both OA and IA is also taken into consideration.

Numerical Surrogates for Human Observers in Myocardial Motion Evaluation From SPECT Images	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING			English	Article						Cardiac motion; cardiac-gated single photon emission computed tomography; image quality; machine learning; model observers; numerical observer	PERFUSION SPECT; LEFT-VENTRICLE; GATED SPECT; MATHEMATICAL-MODEL; HOTELLING OBSERVER; DETECTION ACCURACY; RECONSTRUCTION; COMPENSATION; OPTIMIZATION; QUANTITATION	In medical imaging, the gold standard for image-quality assessment is a task-based approach in which one evaluates human observer performance for a given diagnostic task (e. g., detection of a myocardial perfusion or motion defect). To facilitate practical task-based image-quality assessment, model observers are needed as approximate surrogates for human observers. In cardiac-gated SPECT imaging, diagnosis relies on evaluation of the myocardial motion as well as perfusion. Model observers for the perfusion-defect detection task have been studied previously, but little effort has been devoted toward development of a model observer for cardiac-motion defect detection. In this work, we describe two model observers for predicting human observer performance in detection of cardiac-motion defects. Both proposed methods rely on motion features extracted using previously reported deformable mesh model for myocardium motion estimation. The first method is based on a Hotelling linear discriminant that is similar in concept to that used commonly for perfusion-defect detection. In the second method, based on relevance vector machines (RVM) for regression, we compute average human observer performance by first directly predicting individual human observer scores, and then using multi reader receiver operating characteristic analysis. Our results suggest that the proposed RVM model observer can predict human observer performance accurately, while the new Hotelling motion-defect detector is somewhat less effective.

Although the development of FS techniques specifically tuned for neuroimaging data is an active area of research, up to date most of the studies have focused on finding a subset of features that maximizes accuracy. However, maximizing accuracy does not guarantee reliable interpretation as similar accuracies can be obtained from distinct sets of features. In the current paper we propose a new approach for selecting features: SCoRS (survival count on random subsamples) based on a recently proposed Stability Selection theory. SCoRS relies on the idea of choosing relevant features that are stable under data perturbation. Data are perturbed by iteratively sub-sampling both features (subspaces) and examples. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed method in a clinical application to classify depressed patients versus healthy individuals based on functional magnetic resonance imaging data acquired during visualization of happy faces.

The feature selection properties of the three algorithms are studied to analyze the relevance of features in controlling the spatial distribution of landslides. The elimination of irrelevant features gives simpler, lower dimensional models while keeping the classification performance high. An object-based sampling procedure is considered to reduce the spatial autocorrelation of data and to estimate more reliably generalization skills when applying the model to predict the occurrence of new unknown landslides. The accuracy of the models, the relevance of features and the quality of landslide susceptibility maps were found to be high in the regions characterized by shallow landslides and low in the ones with deep-seated landslides. Despite providing similar skill, random forests and AdaBoost were found to be more efficient in performing feature selection than adaptive support vector machines. The results of this study reveal the strengths of the classification algorithms, but evidence: (1) the need for relying on more than one method for the identification of relevant variables; (2) the weakness of the adaptive scaling algorithm when used with landslide data; and (3) the lack of additional features which characterize the spatial distribution of deep-seated landslides.

This produces tons of unnecessary CO 2 emissions. This is partly due to the inadequate use of electrical devices given the intangible and invisible nature of energy. This misuse of devices and energy unawareness is particularly relevant in public spaces (offices, schools, hospitals and so on), where people use electrical appliances, but they do not directly pay the invoice to energy providers. Embedding intelligence within public, shared appliances, transforming them into Eco-aware things, is valuable to reduce a proportion of the unnecessarily consumed energy. To this end, we present a twofold approach for better energy efficiency in public spaces: 1) informing persuasively to concerned users about the misuse of electronic appliances; 2) Customizing the operating mode of this everyday electrical appliances as a function of their real usage pattern. To back this approach, a capsule-based coffee machine placed in a research laboratory has been augmented. This device is able to continuously collect its usage pattern to offer feedback to coffee consumers about the energy wasting and also, to intelligently adapt its operation to reduce wasted energy. To this aim, several machine learning approaches are compared and evaluated to forecast the next-day device usage.

It is our thesis that this phenomenon is the result of fundamental limits on the ability to use precise abstract domains as the basis for inferring strong invariants of programs. We show that bias-variance tradeoffs, an idea from learning theory, can be used to explain why more precise abstractions do not necessarily lead to better results and also provides practical techniques for coping with such limitations. Learning theory captures precision using a combinatorial quantity called the VC dimension. We compute the VC dimension for different abstractions and report on its usefulness as a precision metric for program analyses. We evaluate cross validation, a technique for addressing bias-variance tradeoffs, on an industrial strength program verification tool called YOGI. The tool produced using cross validation has significantly better running time, finds new defects, and has fewer time-outs than the current production version. Finally, we make some recommendations for tackling bias-variance tradeoffs in program analysis.

J	Faria, P; Vale, Z				Faria, Pedro; Vale, Zita			Decision Support Concerning Demand Response Programs Design and Use - A Conceptual Framework and Simulation Tool	APPLIED MATHEMATICS & INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Demand response; decision support system; distributed generation; distribution system; simulation		Demand response can play a very relevant role in the context of power systems with an intensive use of distributed energy resources, from which renewable intermittent sources are a significant part. More active consumers participation can help improving the system reliability and decrease or defer the required investments. Demand response adequate use and management is even more important in competitive electricity markets. However, experience shows difficulties to make demand response be adequately used in this context, showing the need of research work in this area. The most important difficulties seem to be caused by inadequate business models and by inadequate demand response programs management. This paper contributes to developing methodologies and a computational infrastructure able to provide the involved players with adequate decision support on demand response programs and contracts design and use. The presented work uses DemSi, a demand response simulator that has been developed by the authors to simulate demand response actions and programs, which includes realistic power system simulation. It includes an optimization module for the application of demand response programs and contracts using deterministic and metaheuristic approaches. The proposed methodology is an important improvement in the simulator while providing adequate tools for demand response programs adoption by the involved players. A machine learning method based on clustering and classification techniques, resulting in a rule base concerning DR programs and contracts use, is also used. A case study concerning the use of demand response in an incident situation is presented.

As pain is highly subjective, clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) can be critical for improving the accuracy of pain assessment and offering better support for clinical decision-making. This review is focused on computer technologies for pain management that allow CDSSs to obtain knowledge from the clinical data produced by either patients or health care professionals. Methods and materials: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in several electronic databases to identify relevant articles focused on computerised systems that constituted CDSSs and include data or results related to pain symptoms from patients with acute or chronic pain, published between 1992 and 2011 in the English language. In total, thirty-nine studies were analysed; thirty-two were selected from 1245 citations, and seven were obtained from reference tracking. Results: The results highlighted the following clusters of computer technologies: rule-based algorithms, artificial neural networks, nonstandard set theory, and statistical learning algorithms. In addition, several methodologies were found for content processing such as terminologies, questionnaires, and scores. The median accuracy ranged from 53% to 87.5%. Conclusions: Computer technologies that have been applied in CDSSs are important but not determinant in improving the systems' accuracy and the clinical practice, as evidenced by the moderate correlation among the studies. However, these systems play an important role in the design of computerised systems oriented to a patient's symptoms as is required for pain management. Several limitations related to CDSSs were observed: the lack of integration with mobile devices, the reduced use of web-based interfaces, and scarce capabilities for data to be inserted by patients.

This compromises the integrity of the independent test set, which serves as the basis for evaluating classifier performance. Methods and materials: We propose, implement and evaluate an improved CADx methodology where strict separation is maintained. This is achieved by subjecting the training data alone to dimension reduction; the test data is subsequently processed with out-of-sample extension methods. Our approach is demonstrated in the research context of classifying small diagnostically challenging lesions annotated on dynamic breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. The lesions were dynamically characterized through topological feature vectors derived from Minkowski functionals. These feature vectors were then subject to dimension reduction with different linear and non-linear algorithms applied in conjunction with out-of-sample extension techniques. This was followed by classification through supervised learning with support vector regression. Area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) was evaluated as the metric of classifier performance. Results: Of the feature vectors investigated, the best performance was observed with Minkowski functional 'perimeter' while comparable performance was observed with 'area'. Of the dimension reduction algorithms tested with 'perimeter', the best performance was observed with Sammon's mapping (0.84 +/- 0.10) while comparable performance was achieved with exploratory observation machine (0.82 +/- 0.09) and principal component analysis (0.80 +/- 0.10). Conclusions: The results reported in this study with the proposed CADx methodology present a significant improvement over previous results reported with such small lesions on dynamic breast MRI. In particular, non-linear algorithms for dimension reduction exhibited better classification performance than linear approaches, when integrated into our CADx methodology.

In this work, a novel approach was introduced to encode drug and enzyme molecules with physicochemical molecular descriptors and pseudo amino acid composition, respectively. Based on this encoding method, Random Forest was adopted to build the drug-enzyme interaction network. After selecting the optimal features that are able to represent the main factors of drug-enzyme interaction in our prediction, a total of 129 features were attained which can be clustered into nine categories: Elemental Analysis, Geometry, Chemistry, Amino Acid Composition, Secondary Structure, Polarity, Molecular Volume, Codon Diversity and Electrostatic Charge. It is further found that Geometry features were the most important of all the features. As a result, our predicting model achieved an MCC of 0.915 and a sensitivity of 87.9% at the specificity level of 99.8% for 10-fold cross-validation test, and achieved an MCC of 0.895 and a sensitivity of 95.7% at the specificity level of 95.4% for independent set test.

An important topic in hyperspectral remote sensing is the issue of high dimensionality, which is commonly addressed by dimensionality reduction techniques. While many studies focus on methodological developments in data reduction, less attention is paid to the assessment of the proposed methods in detailed urban hyperspectral land-cover mapping, using state-of-the-art image classification approaches. In this study we evaluate the potential of two unsupervised data reduction techniques, the Autoassociative Neural Network (AANN) and the BandClust method - the first a transformation based approach, the second a feature-selection based approach - for mapping of urban land cover at a high level of thematic detail, using an APEX 288-band hyperspectral dataset. Both methods were tested in combination with four state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers: Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost (ADB), the multiple layer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machines (SVM). When used in combination with a strong learner (MLP, SVM) BandClust produces classification accuracies similar to or higher than obtained with the full dataset, demonstrating the method's capability of preserving critical spectral information, required for the classifier to successfully distinguish between the 22 urban land-cover classes defined in this study. In the AANN data reduction process, on the other hand, important spectral information seems to be compromised or lost, resulting in lower accuracies for three of the four classifiers tested. Detailed analysis of accuracies at class level confirms the superiority of the SVM/Bandclust combination for accurate urban land-cover mapping using a reduced hyperspectral dataset. This study also demonstrates the potential of the new APEX sensor data for detailed mapping of land cover in spatially and spectrally complex urban areas.

J	Li, IJ; Wu, JL				Li, I-Jing; Wu, Jiunn-Lin			A New Nearest Neighbor Classification Algorithm Based on Local Probability Centers	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							DISTANCE MEASURE; RECOGNITION; REDUCTION; RULE	The nearest neighbor is one of the most popular classifiers, and it has been successfully used in pattern recognition and machine learning. One drawback of kNN is that it performs poorly when class distributions are overlapping. Recently, local probability center (LPC) algorithm is proposed to solve this problem; its main idea is giving weight to samples according to their posterior probability. However, LPC performs poorly when the value of k is very small and the higher-dimensional datasets are used. To deal with this problem, this paper suggests that the gradient of the posterior probability function can be estimated under sufficient assumption. The theoretic property is beneficial to faithfully calculate the inner product of two vectors. To increase the performance in high-dimensional datasets, the multidimensional Parzen window and Euler-Richardson method are utilized, and a new classifier based on local probability centers is developed in this paper. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields stable performance with a wide range of k for usage, robust performance to overlapping issue, and good performance to dimensionality. The proposed theorem can be applied to mathematical problems and other applications. Furthermore, the proposed method is an attractive classifier because of its simplicity.

We collected resting-state functional MRI data from 36 first-onset unmedicated depression patients and 27 healthy controls. The resting-state functional connectivity was constructed using the Automated Anatomical Labeling template with a partial correlation method. The metrics calculation and statistical analysis were performed using complex network theory. The results showed that both depressive patients and healthy controls presented typical small-world attributes. Compared with healthy controls, characteristic path length was significantly shorter in depressive patients, suggesting development toward randomization. Patients with depression showed apparently abnormal node attributes at key areas in cortical-striatal-pallidal-thalamic circuits. In addition, right hippocampus and right thalamus were closely linked with the severity of depression. We selected 270 local attributes as the classification features and their P values were regarded as criteria for statistically significant differences. An artificial neural network algorithm was applied for classification research. The results showed that brain network metrics could be used as an effective feature in machine learning research, which brings about a reasonable application prospect for brain network metrics. The present study also highlighted a significant positive correlation between the importance of the attributes and the intergroup differences; that is, the more significant the differences in node attributes, the stronger their contribution to the classification. Experimental findings indicate that statistical significance is an effective quantitative indicator of the selection of brain network metrics and can assist the clinical diagnosis of depression.

Puf3p induces translational repression of genes linked to oxidative stress	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							YEAST SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; RNA-BINDING PROTEIN; MESSENGER-RNAS; CODON USAGE; MITOCHONDRIAL BIOGENESIS; MULTIPLE LEVELS; BUDDING YEAST; HEAT-SHOCK; GENOME; TRANSCRIPTOME	In response to stress, the translation of many mRNAs in yeast can change in a fashion discordant with the general repression of translation. Here, we use machine learning to mine the properties of these mRNAs to determine specific translation control signals. We find a strong association between transcripts acutely translationally repressed under oxidative stress and those associated with the RNA-binding protein Puf3p, a known regulator of cellular mRNAs encoding proteins targeted to mitochondria. Under oxidative stress, a PUF3 deleted strain exhibits more robust growth than wild-type cells and the shift in translation from polysomes to monosomes is attenuated, suggesting puf3D cells perceive less stress. In agreement, the ratio of reduced: oxidized glutathione, a major antioxidant and indicator of cellular redox state, is increased in unstressed puf3D cells but remains lower under stress. In untreated conditions, Puf3p migrates with polysomes rather than ribosome-free fractions, but this is lost under stress. Finally, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of Puf3p targets following affinity purification shows Puf3p-mRNA associations are maintained or increased under oxidative stress. Collectively, these results point to Puf3p acting as a translational repressor in a manner exceeding the global translational response, possibly by temporarily limiting synthesis of new mitochondrial proteins as cells adapt to the stress.

CollecTF (http://collectf.umbc.edu) compiles data on experimentally validated, naturally occurring TF-binding sites across the Bacteria domain, placing a strong emphasis on the transparency of the curation process, the quality and availability of the stored data and fully customizable access to its records. CollecTF integrates multiple sources of data automatically and openly, allowing users to dynamically redefine binding motifs and their experimental support base. Data quality and currency are fostered in CollecTF by adopting a sustainable model that encourages direct author submissions in combination with in-house validation and curation of published literature. CollecTF entries are periodically submitted to NCBI for integration into RefSeq complete genome records as link-out features, maximizing the visibility of the data and enriching the annotation of RefSeq files with regulatory information. Seeking to facilitate comparative genomics and machine-learning analyses of regulatory interactions, in its initial release CollecTF provides domain-wide coverage of two TF families (LexA and Fur), as well as extensive representation for a clinically important bacterial family, the Vibrionaceae.

The experimental system contains a 16-element antenna array, and testing is done on breast phantoms that mimic breast tissue dielectric properties. We obtain experimental data from multiple breast phantoms with two possible tumor locations. In this work, we investigate a method for detecting the tumors within the breast but without the usual complexity inherent to image-generation methods, and confirm its feasibility on experimental data. The proposed method uses machine learning techniques, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), to determine whether the current breast being scanned is tumor-free. Our results show that both SVM and LDA methods have promise as algorithms supporting early breast cancer microwave screening.

There are three novelties compared to previous work. Firstly, the normalized segmented iris is divided into multitracks and then each track is estimated individually to analyze the recognition accuracy rate (RAR). Secondly, six local quality evaluation parameters are adopted to analyze texture information of each track. Besides, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is employed to get the weights of these evaluation parameters and corresponding weighted coefficients of different tracks. Finally, all tracks' information is fused according to the weights of different tracks. The experimental results based on subsets of three public and one private iris image databases demonstrate three contributions of this paper. (1) Our experimental results prove that partial iris image cannot completely replace the entire iris image for iris recognition system in several ways.

This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey and a structural understanding of online portfolio selection techniques published in the literature. From an online machine learning perspective, we first formulate online portfolio selection as a sequential decision problem, and then we survey a variety of state-of-the-art approaches, which are grouped into several major categories, including benchmarks, Follow-the-Winner approaches, Follow-the-Loser approaches, Pattern-Matching-based approaches, and Meta-Learning Algorithms. In addition to the problem formulation and related algorithms, we also discuss the relationship of these algorithms with the capital growth theory so as to better understand the similarities and differences of their underlying trading ideas. This article aims to provide a timely and comprehensive survey for both machine learning and data mining researchers in academia and quantitative portfolio managers in the financial industry to help them understand the state of the art and facilitate their research and practical applications. We also discuss some open issues and evaluate some emerging new trends for future research.	[Li, Bin] Wuhan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Dept Finance, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Hoi, Steven C.

Improving Glaucoma Detection Using Spatially Correspondent Clusters of Damage and by Combining Standard Automated Perimetry and Optical Coherence Tomography	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article						glaucoma; glaucomatous; detection; diagnosis; sensitivity; specificity; visual fields; standard automated perimetry; optical coherence tomography; retinal nerve fiber layer; retinal ganglion cells; macula	NERVE-FIBER-LAYER; MACHINE LEARNING CLASSIFIERS; VISUAL-FIELD DEFECTS; GANGLION-CELL LOSS; FUNCTIONAL MEASUREMENTS; DIAGNOSTIC-ACCURACY; ASYMMETRY-ANALYSIS; RETINAL-THICKNESS; POSTERIOR POLE; COMBINED INDEX	PURPOSE. To improve the detection of glaucoma, techniques for assessing local patterns of damage and for combining structure and function were developed. METHODS. Standard automated perimetry (SAP) and frequency-domain optical coherence tomography (fdOCT) data, consisting of macular retinal ganglion cell plus inner plexiform layer (mRGCPL) as well as macular and optic disc retinal nerve fiber layer (mRNFL and dRNFL) thicknesses, were collected from 52 eyes of 52 healthy controls and 156 eyes of 96 glaucoma suspects and patients. In addition to generating simple global metrics, SAP and fdOCT data were searched for contiguous clusters of abnormal points and converted to a continuous metric (p(cc)). The p(cc) metric, along with simpler methods, was used to combine the information from the SAP and fdOCT. The performance of different methods was assessed using the area under receiver operator characteristic curves (AROC scores). RESULTS. The p(cc) metric performed better than simple global measures for both the fdOCT and SAP. The best combined structure-function metric (mRGCPL& SAP p(cc), AROC = 0.868 +/- 0.032) was better (statistically significant) than the best metrics for independent measures of structure and function. When SAP was used as part of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, AROC scores increased for all metrics, including the best combined structure-function metric (AROC = 0.975 +/- 0.014). CONCLUSIONS. A combined structure-function metric improved the detection of glaucomatous eyes. Overall, the primary sources of value-added for glaucoma detection stem from the continuous cluster search (the p(cc)), the mRGCPL data, and the combination of structure and function.

Consequently, condition monitoring of such subsystems could increase reliability of machines that are carrying out field operations. Recently, research has focused on the implementation of vibration signals analysis for health status diagnosis in bearings systems considering the use of acceleration measurements. Informative features sensitive to specific bearing faults and fault locations were constructed by using advanced signal processing techniques which enable the accurate discrimination of faults based on their location. In this paper, the architecture of a diagnostic system for extended faults in bearings based on neural networks is presented. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) with Bayesian automatic relevance determination has been applied in the classification of accelerometer data. New features like the line integral and feature based sensor fusion are introduced which enhance the fault identification performance. Vibration feature selection based on Bayesian automatic relevance determination is introduced for finding better feature combinations.

Target localization methods that directly use raw sensor data can suffer from uncertainty or disturbance caused by the surrounding environmental elements and noise. Especially, when using WSNs, the limited communication capacity can impose a significant limit on the amount of data that can be processed. Considering these issues, various methods have been proposed, especially using machine learning techniques such as neural networks or support vector machines. In this paper, we employ a multi-class classification algorithm for target localization, in which a pseudo probability map is constructed using modified support vector domain description. A local classification strategy which uses information from local neighbors only is proposed in order to reduce communication costs. Experimental results using an acoustic WSN are compared with Platt's method to validate the multi-class classification algorithm.	[Kim, Woojin; Park, Jaemann; Kim, H.

Among machine learning algorithms, Multilayer Perceptron, Locally Weighted Learning, Additive Regression, M5Rules and ZeroR classifiers are used to estimate the electricity load demand. Among them, M5Rules and Multilayer Perceptron classifiers are observed to have better performance than the others. ZeroR classifier is a kind of majority classifier used to compare the performances of other classifiers. Locally Weighted Learning and Additive Regression classifiers are Meta classifiers. In the training period conducted by Locally Weighted Learning and Additive Regression classifiers, when Multilayer Perceptron and M5Rules classifiers are chosen respectively, it is possible to obtain models with the highest performance. As a result of the experiments performed using M5Rules and Multilayer Perceptron classifiers, correlation coefficient values of 0.948 and 0.9933 are obtained respectively. And, Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error value of Multilayer Perceptron classifier are closer to zero than that of M5Rules classifier. Therefore, it can be said the model performed by Multilayer Perceptron classifier has the best performance compared to the models of other classifiers.

Feature selection methods provides us a way of reducing computation time, improving prediction performance, and a better understanding of the data in machine learning or pattern recognition applications. In this paper we provide an overview of some of the methods present in literature. The objective is to provide a generic introduction to variable elimination which can be applied to a wide array of machine learning problems. We focus on Filter, Wrapper and Embedded methods. We also apply some of the feature selection techniques on standard datasets to demonstrate the applicability of feature selection techniques. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In our approach, a rule is an implication satisfying specified constraints. The term incomplete information databases covers many types of inexact data, such as non-deterministic information, data with missing values, incomplete information or interval valued data. In the paper, we start by defining certain and possible rules based on non-deterministic information. We use their mathematical properties to solve computational problems related to rule generation. Then, we reconsider the NIS-Apriori algorithm which generates a given implication if and only if it is either a certain rule or a possible rule satisfying the constraints. In this sense, NIS-Apriori is logically sound and complete. In this paper, we pay a special attention to soundness and completeness of the considered algorithmic framework, which is not necessarily obvious when switching from exact to inexact data sets. Moreover, we analyze different types of non-deterministic information corresponding to different types of the underlying attributes, i.e., value sets for qualitative attributes and intervals for quantitative attributes, and we discuss various approaches to construction of descriptors related to particular attributes within the rules' premises. An improved implementation of NIS-Apriori and some demonstrations of an experimental application of our approach to data sets taken from the UCI machine learning repository are also presented. Last but not least, we show simplified proofs of some of our theoretical results.

Electronic noses based on metal oxide semiconducting (MOS) sensors present a potential technology to create devices for such purposes. An array of four thick film MOS gas sensors was fabricated, based on zinc oxide inks. Production took place using a commercially available screen printer, a 3 x 3 mm alumina substrate containing interdigitated electrodes and a platinum heater track. ZnO inks were modified using zeolite beta, zeolite Y and mordenite admixtures. The sensors were exposed to four gases commonly found in the clandestine laboratory environment; these were nitrogen dioxide, ethanol, acetone and ammonia. Zeolite modification was found to increase the sensitivity of the sensor, compared to unmodified ZnO sensors, all of which showed strong responses to low ppm concentrations of acetone, ammonia and ethanol and to ppb concentrations of nitrogen dioxide. Machine learning techniques were incorporated to test the selectivity of the sensors. A high level of accuracy was achieved in determining the class of gas observed.	[Pugh, D. C.; Newton, E.

A significant number of computational methods have been developed to predict protein-protein interactions using protein sequence, structural and genomic data. Vast experimental data is publicly available on the Internet, but it is scattered across numerous databases. This fact motivated us to create and evaluate new high-throughput datasets of interacting proteins. We extracted interaction data from DIP, MINT, BioGRID and IntAct databases. Then we constructed descriptive features for machine learning purposes based on data from Gene Ontology and DOMINE. Thereafter, four well-established machine learning methods: Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Decision Tree and Naive Bayes, were used on these datasets to build an Ensemble Learning method based on majority voting. In cross-validation experiment, sensitivity exceeded 80% and classification/prediction accuracy reached 90% for the Ensemble Learning method. We extended the experiment to a bigger and more realistic dataset maintaining sensitivity over 70%. These results confirmed that our datasets are suitable for performing PPI prediction and Ensemble Learning method is well suited for this task. Both the processed PPI datasets and the software are available at http://sysbio.icm.edu.pl/indra/EL-PPI/home.html.

Databases, data mining and machine learning algorithms (MLAs), including artificial neural networks (ANNs), may assist by storing and interpreting data from multiple sources, potentially improving clinical decision-making. Aims: 1) Identify database technologies used to store AP data, 2) collate and categorise variables stored in AP databases, 3) identify the MLA technologies, including ANNs, used to analyse AP data, and 4) identify clinical and non-clinical benefits and obstacles in establishing a national or international AP database. Methods: Comprehensive systematic search of online reference databases.

Various machine learning-based approaches have been applied to BNER tasks and showed good performance. In this paper, we systematically investigated three different types of word representation (WR) features for BNER, including clustering-based representation, distributional representation, and word embeddings. We selected one algorithm from each of the three types of WR features and applied them to the JNLPBA and BioCreAtIvE II BNER tasks. Our results showed that all the three WR algorithms were beneficial to machine learning-based BNER systems. Moreover, combining these different types of WR features further improved BNER performance, indicating that they are complementary to each other. By combining all the three types of WR features, the improvements in F-measure on the BioCreAtIvE II GM and JNLPBA corpora were 3.75% and 1.39%, respectively, when compared with the systems using baseline features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate the effect of three different types of WR features for BNER tasks.

A key feature of these levels in an XML document is to identify its components for additional processing. XML components can expose sensitive information after application of data mining techniques over a shared database. Therefore, privacy preservation of sensitive information must be ensured prior to signify the outcome especially in sensitive XML Association Rules. Privacy issues in XML domain are not exceptionally addressed to determine a solution by the academia in a reliable and precise manner. In this paper, we have proposed a model for identifying sensitive items (nodes) to declare sensitive XML association rules and then to hide them. Bayesian networks-based central tendency measures are applied in declaration of sensitive XML association rules. K2 algorithm is used to generate Bayesian networks to ensure reliability and accuracy in preserving privacy of XML Association Rules. The proposed model is tested and compared using several case studies and large UCI machine learning datasets. The experimental results show improved accuracy and reliability of proposed model without any side effects such as new rules and lost rules. The proposed model uses the same minimum support threshold to find XML Association Rules from the original and transformed data sources. The significance of the proposed model is to minimize an incredible disclosure risk involved in XML association rule mining from external parties in a competitive business environment.

In this paper, two classifiers, namely, the asymmetric kernel partial least squares classifier (AKPLSC) and asymmetric kernel principal component analysis classifier (AKPCAC), are proposed for solving the class imbalance problem. This is achieved by applying kernel function to the asymmetric partial least squares classifier and asymmetric principal component analysis classifier, respectively. The kernel function used for the two classifiers is Gaussian function. Experiments conducted on NASA and SOFTLAB data sets using F-measure, Friedman's test, and Tukey's test confirm the validity of our methods.

Furthermore, PSO corresponds to a particular discretization of the PSO continuous model (regressive in velocity and centered in acceleration). Based on this mechanical analogy we derived a whole family of three-points PSO versions. All these algorithms are related to different second order stochastic difference equations that are used to perform their stability and convergence analysis. In this paper we present the stochastic stability, convergence, and numerical analysis of the four remaining PSO members that can be useful in different practical applications, such as in the solution and appraisal of nonlinear inverse and machine learning problems, where exploratory versions are needed to provide an approximately sampling of the posterior distribution of the model parameters (sampling while optimizing).

Due to the expansion of the range of three-dimensional indoor positioning, more features must be needed to describe the location fingerprint. Directly using a machine learning algorithm will result in the reduced ability of classification. To solve this problem, in this paper, a "divide and conquer" strategy is adopted; that is, first through k-medoids algorithm the three-dimensional location space is clustered into a number of service areas, and then a multicategory SVM with less features is created for each service area for further positioning. Our experiment shows that the error distance resolution of the approach with k-medoids algorithm and multicategory SVM is higher than that of the approach only with SVM, and the former can effectively decrease the "crazy prediction."

The quantum neural based pattern recognizer is used to recognize and learn the pattern of corpus, using the information of part of speech of individual word in the corpus, like a human. The system performs the machine translation using its knowledge gained during the learning by inputting the pair of sentences of Devnagri-Hindi and English. To analyze the effectiveness of the proposed approach, 2600 sentences have been evaluated during simulation and evaluation. The accuracy achieved on BLEU score is 0.7502, on NIST score is 6.5773, on ROUGE-L score is 0.9233, and on METEOR score is 0.5456, which is significantly higher in comparison with Google Translation and Bing Translation for Hindi to English Machine Translation.

The recognition of disease genes has long been a goal in biology, which may contribute to the improvement of health care and understanding gene functions, pathways, and interactions. However, few large-scale gene-gene association datasets, disease-disease association datasets, and gene-disease association datasets are available. A number of machine learning methods have been used to recognize disease genes based on networks. This paper states the relationship between disease and gene, summarizes the approaches used to recognize disease genes based on network, analyzes the core problems and challenges of the methods, and outlooks future research direction.

Gentle AdaBoost is a variant of AdaBoost which introduces Newton steps to the boosting process. It is proved that the overall performance considering both the training error and generalization error of Gentle AdaBoost is better than other AdaBoost variants on low-noise data. However, it suffers from overfitting problem when the training data include high noise. To solve this problem, we propose a new approach to limit the weight distortion according to a stretched distribution of the whole sample weights. Experimental results have shown that our algorithm obtains a better generalization error on both standard and noise-input datasets. Moreover, our method does not increase the calculation time compared with Gentle AdaBoost.

MutPred Splice: machine learning-based prediction of exonic variants that disrupt splicing	GENOME BIOLOGY			English	Article							PRE-MESSENGER-RNA; HUMAN INHERITED DISEASE; HUMAN GENES; ATAXIA-TELANGIECTASIA; REGULATORY ELEMENTS; MISSENSE MUTATIONS; SEQUENCE MOTIFS; FREQUENT CAUSE; IDENTIFICATION; CANCER	We have developed a novel machine-learning approach, MutPred Splice, for the identification of coding region substitutions that disrupt pre-mRNA splicing. Applying MutPred Splice to human disease-causing exonic mutations suggests that 16% of mutations causing inherited disease and 10 to 14% of somatic mutations in cancer may disrupt pre-mRNA splicing. For inherited disease, the main mechanism responsible for the splicing defect is splice site loss, whereas for cancer the predominant mechanism of splicing disruption is predicted to be exon skipping via loss of exonic splicing enhancers or gain of exonic splicing silencer elements.

Perceptual metrics and visualization tools for evaluation of page uniformity	IMAGE QUALITY AND SYSTEM PERFORMANCE XI	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Image Quality and System Performance XI (IQSP)	FEB 03-05, 2014	San Francisco, CA	Soc Imaging Sci & Technol, SPIE		Uniformity; Mottle; Grain; Visualization; Print Quality Assessment; Support Vector Machine		Uniformity is one of the issues of most critical concern for laser electrophotographic (EP) printers. Typical non-uniformity defects include mottle, grain, pinholes, and finger prints. It is a real challenge to make a Print Quality (PQ) assessment due to the large coverage of a letter-size, constant-tint printed test page and the variety of possible non-uniformity defects. In this paper, we propose a novel method that uses a block-based technique to analyze the page both visually and metrically. We use a grid of 150 pixels x 150 pixels (1/4 inch x 1/4 inch at 600-dpi resolution) square blocks throughout scanned page. For each block, we examine two aspects: behavior of its pixels within the block (metric of graininess) and behavior of the blocks within the printed page (metric of uniformity). Both delta E (CIE 1976) and the L* lightness channel are employed. For an input scanned page, we create eight visual outputs, each displaying a different aspect of uniformity. To apply machine learning, we train scanned pages of different 100% solid colors separately with the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. We use four metrics as features for the SVM: variation of page lightness, variation of page graininess, average of page graininess and maximum of page graininess. Our results show that we can predict, with up to 90% accuracy, the assignment by a human expert of one of four grades of uniformity to the print.

For this purpose, volumes of interest were extracted from the head, neck, and trochanter of 146 ex vivo proximal femur specimens on multidetector computer tomography. The trabecular bone captured was characterized with (1) statistical moments of the BMD distribution, (2) geometrical features derived from the scaling index method (SIM), and (3) morphometric parameters, such as bone fraction, trabecular thickness, etc. Feature sets comprising DXA BMD and such supplemental features were used to predict the failure load (FL) of the specimens, previously determined through biomechanical testing, with multiregression and support vector regression. Prediction performance was measured by the root mean square error (RMSE); correlation with measured FL was evaluated using the coefficient of determination R-2. The best prediction performance was achieved by a combination of DXA BMD and SIM-derived geometric features derived from the femoral head (RMSE: 0.869 +/- 0.121, R-2: 0.68 +/- 0.079), which was significantly better than DXA BMD alone (RMSE: 0.948 +/- 0.119, R-2: 0.61 +/- 0.101) (p < 10(-4)). For multivariate feature sets, SVR outperformed multiregression (p < 0.05). These results suggest that supplementing standard DXA BMD measurements with sophisticated femoral trabecular bone characterization and supervised learning techniques can significantly improve biomechanical strength prediction in proximal femur specimens.

It classifies a user's fitness level based on supervised machine learning techniques. This system is able to learn and make customized diagnoses according to the user's physiological data, such as age, gender, and body mass index (BMI). In addition, an elastic algorithm based on Poisson distribution is presented to allocate computation resources dynamically. It predicts the required resources in the future according to the exponential moving average of past observations. The experimental results show that Naive Bayes is the best classifier with the highest accuracy (90.8%) and that the elastic algorithm is able to capture tightly the trend of requests generated from the Internet and thus assign corresponding computation resources to ensure the quality of service.

These fields overlap most significantly when training is involved: the visualization or machine learning tool improves over time by exploiting observations of the human-computer interaction. This paper focuses on one aspect of the human-computer interaction that we call user-driven sampling strategies Unlike relevance feedback and active learning sampling strategies, where the computer selects which data to label at each iteration, we investigate situations where the user selects which data is to be labeled at each iteration. User-driven sampling strategies can emerge in many visual analytics applications but they have not been fully developed in machine learning. User-driven sampling strategies suggest new theoretical and practical research questions for both visualization science and machine learning. In this paper we identify and quantify the potential benefits of these strategies in a practical image analysis application. We find user-driven sampling strategies can sometimes provide significant performance gains by steering tools towards local minima that have lower error than tools trained with all of the data. In preliminary experiments we find these performance gains are particularly pronounced when the user is experienced with the tool and application domain	[Harvey, Neal; Porter, Reid] Los Alamos Natl Lab, Intelligence & Space Res Div, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA	Harvey, N (reprint author), Los Alamos Natl Lab, Intelligence & Space Res Div, POB 1663, Los Alamos, NM 87545 USA.	harve@lanl.gov; rporter@lanl.gov						16	0	0	SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING	BELLINGHAM	1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA	0277-786X		978-0-8194-9934-9	PROC SPIE			2014	9017								90170B	10.1117/12.2038581		8	Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Optics	Engineering; Optics	BA1SU	WOS:000333055000010

Both approaches attempt to develop video evaluation techniques capable of replacing human judgment when rating video quality in subjective experiments. The underlying study consists of selecting fundamental quality metrics based on Human Visual System (HVS) models and using artificial intelligence solutions as well as advanced statistical analysis. This new combination enables suitable video quality ratings while taking as input multiple quality metrics. The first method uses a neural network based machine learning process. The second method consists in evaluating the video quality assessment using non-linear regression model. The efficiency of the proposed methods is demonstrated by comparing their results with those of existing work done on synthetic video artifacts. The results obtained by each method are compared with scores from a database resulting from subjective experiments.

In this paper we present the results of our analysis of message header fields and the URLs in the message body, and propose informative and discriminative email spam detection features based on recent public email data sets. Furthermore, the Web of Trust (WOT) service was used to measure the reputation of the sender and the URLs included in the message. Subsequently, several machine learning-based classifiers were applied to evaluate the performance of these features, including the reputation feature. The results demonstrate the power of the extracted features, and also establish that the Random Forest (RF) classifier has the best performance of all the classifiers used in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and total cost ratio of 99.69%, 99.70%, 99.90%, 99.8%, and 65 respectively.

This paper discusses an automated technique for the classification of arecanuts, based on their texture. In our previous work [1], we made a classification using the Mean Around features, Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features, and a combination of both (Mean-around and GLCM). In this paper, we formulate different tree splitting rules and discuss the comparative results. The decision tree classifiers have been used for the classification of arecanuts into six classes. The splitting rules used for constructing the decision tree are the Gini Diversity Index (GDI), Twoing and Entropy. The results obtained from the proposed method are in good agreement with the observations of the agricultural experts, and the solutions proposed have been well received by them. The experiments on the proposed approach were carried out on a dataset of size 2214 using cross validation, with a good success rate.

Tree-based Phone Duration Modelling of the Serbian Language	ELEKTRONIKA IR ELEKTROTECHNIKA			English	Article						Decision trees; machine learning algorithms; speech; speech synthesis	SEGMENTAL DURATION	Considering the importance of segmental duration from a perceptive point of view, the possibility of automatic prediction of natural duration of phones is essential for achieving the naturalness of synthesized speech. In this paper phone duration prediction model for the Serbian language using tree-based machine learning approach is presented. A large speech corpus and a feature set of 21 parameters describing phones and their contexts were used for segmental duration prediction. Phone duration modelling is based on attributes such as the current segment identity, preceding and following segment types, manner of articulation (for consonants) and voicing of neighbouring phones, lexical stress, part-of-speech, word length, the position of the segment in the syllable, the position of the syllable in a word, the position of a word in a phrase, phrase break level, etc. These features have been extracted from the large speech database for the Serbian language. The results obtained for the full phoneme set using regression tree, RMSE (root-mean-squared-error) 14.8914 ms, MAE (mean absolute error) 11.1947 ms and correlation coefficient 0.8796 are comparable with those reported in the literature for Czech, Greek, Lithuanian, Korean, Indian languages Hindi and Telugu, Turkish.

This paper is a light introduction and survey of some deployed natural language systems and technologies and their historical evolution. We review two fundamental problems involving natural language: the language prediction problem and the language understanding problem. While describing in detail all these technologies is beyond our scope, we do comment on some aspects less discussed in the literature such as language prediction using huge models and semantic labeling using Marcus contextual grammars.

Focusing on satisfiability testing problems, we have generated random 3-SAT instances and found out that the correct branch prediction accuracy reached levels in excess of 99%. The branching in a simple backtracking-based SAT solver has been reduced in more than 90% of the tested cases, and the average number of branching steps has reduced to between 1/5 and 1/3 of the one without the machine learning model. The percentage of SAT instances where the machine learned heuristic-enhanced algorithm solved SAT in a single pass reached levels of 80-90%, depending on the set of features used.

Diurnal variation of the global electric circuit from clustered thunderstorms	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS			English	Article						lightning; thunderstorms; global electric circuit; clustering; WWLLN; machine learning	LIGHTNING LOCATION NETWORK; DETECTION EFFICIENCY; FIELD MEASUREMENTS; SOLAR; WEATHER; CLIMATE; WWLLN; FAIR; THUNDERCLOUDS; ATMOSPHERE	The diurnal variation of the global electric circuit is investigated using the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN), which has been shown to identify nearly all thunderstorms (using WWLLN data from 2005). To create an estimate of global electric circuit activity, a clustering algorithm is applied to the WWLLN data set to identify global thunderstorms from 2010 to 2013. Annual, seasonal, and regional thunderstorm activity is investigated in this new WWLLN thunderstorm data set in order to estimate the source behavior of the global electric circuit. Through the clustering algorithm, the total number of active thunderstorms are counted every 30 min creating a measure of the global electric circuit source function. The thunderstorm clusters are compared to precipitation radar data from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission satellite and with case studies of thunderstorm evolution. The clustering algorithm reveals an average of 66070 thunderstorms active at any given time with a peak-to-peak variation of 36%. The highest number of thunderstorms occurs in November (72090), and the lowest number occurs in January (61080). Thunderstorm cluster and electrified storm cloud activity are combined with thunderstorm overflight current measurements to estimate the global electric circuit thunderstorm contribution current to be 109070 A with a variation of 24%. By utilizing the global coverage and high time resolution of WWLLN, the total active thunderstorm count and current is shown to be less than previous estimates based on compiled climatologies.

J	Parapar, J; Losada, DE; Barreiro, A				Parapar, Javier; Losada, David E.; Barreiro, Alvaro			Combining Psycho-linguistic, Content-based and Chat-based Features to Detect Predation in Chatrooms	JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Sexual predation; Cybercrime; Text Mining; Machine Learning; Support Vector Machines; Psycho-linguistic analysis		The Digital Age has brought great benefits for the human race but also some drawbacks. Nowadays, people from opposite corners of the World can communicate online via instant messaging services. Unfortunately, this has introduced new kinds of crime. Sexual predators have adapted their predatory strategies to these platforms and, usually, the target victims are kids. The authorities cannot manually track all threats because massive amounts of online conversations take place in a daily basis. Automatic methods for alerting about these crimes need to be designed. This is the main motivation of this paper, where we present a Machine Learning approach to identify suspicious subjects in chat-rooms. We propose novel types of features for representing the chatters and we evaluate different classifiers against the largest benchmark available. This empirical validation shows that our approach is promising for the identification of predatory behaviour. Furthermore, we carefully analyse the characteristics of the learnt classifiers. This preliminary analysis is a first step towards profiling the behaviour of the sexual predators when chatting on the Internet.

In LBS, the recognition of the location word in user messages is meaningful and important. The location word recognition in LBS is different from the traditional named entity recognition, owing to the additional information such as user location coordinates in LBS. This paper proposes a method that adds the service context information including user location coordinates and message timestamps into the machine learning to improve the accuracy of the Chinese location word recognition. The experiment based on microblog datasets in mobile environment proves the viability and effectiveness of this method.

J	Hu, FH; Shao, ZQ; Ruan, T				Hu, Fanghuai; Shao, Zhiqing; Ruan, Tong			Self-Supervised Chinese Ontology Learning from Online Encyclopedias	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article							CONSTRUCTION; WIKIPEDIA	Constructing ontology manually is a time-consuming, error-prone, and tedious task. We present SSCO, a self-supervised learning based chinese ontology, which contains about 255 thousand concepts, 5 million entities, and 40 million facts. We explore the three largest online Chinese encyclopedias for ontology learning and describe how to transfer the structured knowledge in encyclopedias, including article titles, category labels, redirection pages, taxonomy systems, and InfoBox modules, into ontological form. In order to avoid the errors in encyclopedias and enrich the learnt ontology, we also apply some machine learning based methods. First, we proof that the self-supervised machine learning method is practicable in Chinese relation extraction (at least for synonymy and hyponymy) statistically and experimentally and train some self-supervised models (SVMs and CRFs) for synonymy extraction, concept-subconcept relation extraction, and concept-instance relation extraction; the advantages of our methods are that all training examples are automatically generated from the structural information of encyclopedias and a few general heuristic rules. Finally, we evaluate SSCO in two aspects, scale and precision; manual evaluation results show that the ontology has excellent precision, and high coverage is concluded by comparing SSCO with other famous ontologies and knowledge bases; the experiment results also indicate that the self-supervised models obviously enrich SSCO.

J	Bulut, F; Bucak, IO				bulut, Faruk; Bucak, Ihsan Omur			An urgent precaution system to detect students at risk of substance abuse through classification algorithms	TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article						Substance abuse; risk assessment; data mining; machine learning; classification algorithms		In recent years, the use of addictive drugs and substances has turned out to be a challenging social problem worldwide. The illicit use of these types of drugs and substances appears to be increasing among elementary and high school students. After becoming addicted to drugs, life becomes unbearable and gets even worse for their users. Scientific studies show that it becomes extremely difficult for an individual to break this habit after being a user. Hence, preventing teenagers from addiction becomes an important issue. This study focuses on an urgent precaution system that helps families and educators prevent teenagers from developing this type of addiction. The aim of this study is to detect a teenager's probability of being a drug abuser using classification algorithms in machine learning and data mining. The objective is not to test the classifiers theoretically on the benchmark datasets, but rather to use this study as a basis for advanced and detailed studies in this field in the future. This paper not only uses a special dataset but also focuses on psychometrics and statistics. The findings of this study show that if there is a computed high risk for a teenager, some precautions, if necessary, may be taken by educators and parents to keep the teenager away from those substances.

Since GPCR proteome is classified hierarchically, general ways for GPCR function prediction are based on hierarchical classification. Various computational tools have been developed to predict GPCR functions; those tools use not simple sequence searches but more powerful methods, such as alignment-free methods, statistical model methods, and machine learning methods used in protein sequence analysis, based on learning datasets. The first stage of hierarchical function prediction involves the discrimination of GPCRs from non-GPCRs and the second stage involves the classification of the predicted GPCR candidates into family, subfamily, andsub-subfamily levels. Then, further classification is performed according to their protein-protein interaction type: binding G-protein type, oligomerized partner type, etc. Those methods have achieved predictive accuracies of around 90 %. Finally, I described the future subject of research of the bioinformatics technique about functional prediction of GPCR.

Thus, it relies on a complete adaptive behavior composed of: reconfigurable radio frequency (RF) parts, enhanced spectrum sensing algorithms, and sophisticated machine learning techniques. In this paper, we present a review of the recent advances in CR transceivers hardware design and algorithms. For the RF part, three types of antennas are presented: UWB antennas, frequency-reconfigurable/tunable antennas, and UWB antennas with reconfigurable band notches. The main challenges faced by the design of the other RF blocks are also discussed. Sophisticated spectrum sensing algorithms that overcome main sensing challenges such as model uncertainty, hardware impairments, and wideband sensing are highlighted. The cognitive engine features are discussed. Moreover, we study unsupervised classification algorithms and a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that has been proposed to perform decision-making in CR networks.

They are flexible, conceptually simple and straightforward, but provide only average measures of uncertainty based on past data. However, if one needs to estimate uncertainty of a model in a particular hydro-meteorological situation in real time application of complex models, Monte Carlo simulation becomes impractical because of the large number of model runs required. This paper presents a novel approach to encapsulating and predicting parameter uncertainty of hydrological models using machine learning techniques. Generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation method (a version of the Monte Carlo method) is first used to assess the parameter uncertainty of a hydrological model, and then the generated data are used to train three machine learning models. Inputs to these models are specially identified representative variables. The trained models are then employed to predict the model output uncertainty which is specific for the new input data. This method has been applied to two contrasting catchments. The experimental results demonstrate that the machine learning models are quite accurate. An important advantage of the proposed method is its efficiency allowing for assessing uncertainty of complex models in real time.

J	Qin, CD; Zhao, HX				Qin, Chuandong; Zhao, Huixia			Selecting the Optimal Combination Model of FSSVM for the Imbalance Datasets	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							UNCONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION	Imbalanced data learning is one of the most active and important fields in machine learning research. The existing class imbalance learning methods can make Support Vector Machines (SVMs) less sensitive to class imbalance; they still suffer from the disturbance of outliers and noise present in the datasets. A kind of Fuzzy Smooth Support Vector Machines (FSSVMs) are proposed based on the Smooth Support Vector Machine (SSVM) of O. L. Mangasarian. SSVM can be computed by the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm or the Newton-Armijo algorithm easily. Two kinds of fuzzy memberships and three smooth functions can be chosen in the algorithms. The fuzzy memberships consider the contribution rate of each sample to the optimal separating hyperplane. The polynomial smooth functions can make the optimization problem more accurate at the inflection point. Those changes play the active effects on trials. The results of the experiments show that the FSSVMs can gain the better accuracy and the shorter time than the SSVMs and some of the other methods.

Classification of Exacerbation Episodes in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Patients	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						COPD; exacerbation; accelerometer; classification	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; COPD EXACERBATIONS; BODE INDEX; RISK; ACCELEROMETER; PREDICTION; FIELD	Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive disease affecting the airways, which constitutes a major cause of chronic morbidity and a significant economic and social burden throughout the world. Despite the fact that in COPD patients exacerbations are common acute events causing significant and often fatal worsening of symptoms, an accurate prognostication continues to be difficult. Objectives: To build computational models capable of distinguishing between normal life days from exacerbation days in COPD patients, based on physical activity measured by accelerometers. Methods: We recruited 58 patients suffering from COPD and measured their physical activity with accelerometers for 10 days or more, from August 2009 to March 2010. During this period we recorded six exacerbation episodes in the patients, accounting for 37 days. We were able to analyse data for 52 patients (369 patient days), and extracted three distinct sets of features from the data, one set of basic features such as average, one set based on the frequency domain and the last exploring the cross-information among sensors pairs. These were used by three machine-learning techniques (logarithmic regression, neural networks, support vector machines) to distinguish days with exacerbation events from normal days. Results: The support vector machine classifier achieved an AUC of 90% +/- 9, when supplied with a set of features resulting from sequential feature selection method. Neural networks achieved an AUC of 83% +/- 16 and the logarithmic regression an AUC of 67% +/- 15. Conclusions: None of the individual feature sets provided robust for reasonable classification of PA recording days. Our results indicate that this approach has the potential to extract useful information for, but are not robust enough for medical application of the system.

Censoring Weighted Separate-and-Conquer Rule Induction from Survival Data	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Survival prediction; rule induction; rule quality measures	QUALITY MEASURES; INTERESTINGNESS MEASURES; MODELS; TREES; REGRESSION; CANCER; SETS; SELECTION; SPLIT	Objectives: Rule induction is one of the major methods of machine learning. Rule-based models can be easily read and interpreted by humans, that makes them particularly useful in survival studies as they can help clinicians to better understand analysed data and make informed decisions about patient treatment. Although of such usefulness, there is still a little research on rule learning in survival analysis. In this paper we take a step towards rule-based analysis of survival data. Methods: We investigate so-called covering or separate-and-conquer method of rule induction in combination with a weighting scheme for handling censored observations. We also focus on rule quality measures being one of the key elements differentiating particular implementations of separate-and-conquer rule induction algorithms. We examine 15 rule quality measures guiding rule induction process and reflecting a wide range of different rule learning heuristics. Results: The algorithm is extensively tested on a collection of 20 real survival datasets and compared with the state-of-the-art survival trees and random survival forests algorithms. Most of the rule quality measures outperform Kaplan-Meier estimate and perform. at least equally well as tree-based algorithms. Conclusions: Separate-and-conquer rule induction in combination with weighting scheme is an effective technique for building rule-based models of survival data which, according to predictive accuracy, are competitive with tree-based representations.

Improving enzyme regulatory protein classification by means of SVM-RFE feature selection	MOLECULAR BIOSYSTEMS			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY; TOPOLOGICAL INDEXES; WEB SERVER; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; LEARNING ALGORITHMS; B INHIBITORS; MARCH-INSIDE; QSAR MODELS; 3D	Enzyme regulation proteins are very important due to their involvement in many biological processes that sustain life. The complexity of these proteins, the impossibility of identifying direct quantification molecular properties associated with the regulation of enzymatic activities, and their structural diversity creates the necessity for new theoretical methods that can predict the enzyme regulatory function of new proteins. The current work presents the first classification model that predicts protein enzyme regulators using the Markov mean properties. These protein descriptors encode the topological information of the amino acid into contact networks based on amino acid distances and physicochemical properties. MInD-Prot software calculated these molecular descriptors for 2415 protein chains (350 enzyme regulators) using five atom physicochemical properties (Mulliken electronegativity, Kang-Jhon polarizability, vdW area, atom contribution to P) and the protein 3D regions. The best classification models to predict enzyme regulators have been obtained with machine learning algorithms from Weka using 18 features. K-star has been demonstrated to be the most accurate algorithm for this protein function classification. Wrapper Subset Evaluator and SVM-RFE approaches were used to perform a feature subset selection with the best results obtained from SVM-RFE. Classification performance employing all the available features can be reached using only the 8 most relevant features selected by SVM-RFE. Thus, the current work has demonstrated the possibility of predicting new molecular targets involved in enzyme regulation using fast theoretical algorithms.

Whereas DEIM projects the nonlinear term onto one global subspace, our localized discrete empirical interpolation method (LDEIM) computes several local subspaces, each tailored to a particular region of characteristic system behavior. Then, depending on the current state of the system, LDEIM selects an appropriate local subspace for the approximation of the nonlinear term. In this way, the dimensions of the local DEIM subspaces, and thus the computational costs, remain low even though the system might exhibit a wide range of behaviors as it passes through different regimes. LDEIM uses machine learning methods in the offline computational phase to discover these regions via clustering. Local DEIM approximations are then computed for each cluster. In the online computational phase, machine-learning-based classification procedures select one of these local subspaces adaptively as the computation proceeds. The classification can be achieved using either the system parameters or a low-dimensional representation of the current state of the system obtained via feature extraction. The LDEIM approach is demonstrated for a reacting flow example of an H-2-Air flame. In this example, where the system state has a strong nonlinear dependence on the parameters, the LDEIM provides speedups of two orders of magnitude over standard DEIM.

Setting A regional cancer centre in Australia. Participants Disease-specific data from a purpose-built cancer registry (Evaluation of Cancer Outcomes (ECO)) from 869 patients were used to predict survival at 6, 12 and 24 months. The model was validated with data from a further 94 patients, and results compared to the assessment of five specialist oncologists. Machine-learning prediction using ECO data was compared with that using EAR and a model combining ECO and EAR data. Primary and secondary outcome measures Survival prediction accuracy in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results The ECO model yielded AUCs of 0.87 (95% CI 0.848 to 0.890) at 6 months, 0.796 (95% CI 0.774 to 0.823) at 12 months and 0.764 (95% CI 0.737 to 0.789) at 24 months. Each was slightly better than the performance of the clinician panel. The model performed consistently across a range of cancers, including rare cancers. Combining ECO and EAR data yielded better prediction than the ECO-based model (AUCs ranging from 0.757 to 0.997 for 6 months, AUCs from 0.689 to 0.988 for 12 months and AUCs from 0.713 to 0.973 for 24 months). The best prediction was for genitourinary, head and neck, lung, skin, and upper gastrointestinal tumours. Conclusions Machine learning applied to information from a disease-specific (cancer) database and the EAR can be used to predict clinical outcomes. Importantly, the approach described made use of digital data that is already routinely collected but underexploited by clinical health systems.

However, this hypothesis has been featured by several empirical experiential studies and a number of researchers have efficiently applied machine learning techniques to forecast stock market. This paper studied stock prediction for the use of investors. It is always true that investors typically obtain loss because of uncertain investment purposes and unsighted assets. This paper proposes a rough set model, a neural network model, and a hybrid neural network and rough set model to find optimal buy and sell of a share on Dhaka stock exchange. Investigational findings demonstrate that our proposed hybrid model has higher precision than the single rough set model and the neural network model. We believe this paper findings will help stock investors to decide about optimal buy and/or sell time on Dhaka stock exchange.	[Banik, Shipra; Khan, A. F. M.

Firstly, granules are represented as the forms of hyperdiamond, hypersphere, hypercube, and hyperbox. Secondly, the distance measure between two granules is defined from the view of set, and the union operator between two granules is formed to obtain the granule set including the granules with different granularity. Thirdly the threshold of granularity determines the union between two granules and is used to form the granular computing classification algorithms based on distance measures (DGrC). The benchmark datasets in UCI Machine Learning Repository are used to verify the performance of DGrC, and experimental results show that DGrC improved the testing accuracies.

The previous main results describing the generalization ability of learning algorithms are usually based on independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples. However, independence is a very restrictive concept for both theory and real-world applications. In this paper we go far beyond this classical framework by establishing the bounds on the rate of relative uniform convergence for the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) algorithm with uniformly ergodic Markov chain samples. We not only obtain generalization bounds of ERM algorithm, but also show that the ERM algorithm with uniformly ergodic Markov chain samples is consistent. The established theory underlies application of ERM type of learning algorithms.

J	El Hindi, K				El Hindi, Khalil			Fine tuning the Naive Bayesian learning algorithm	AI COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Machine learning; Naive Bayesian classification; improving estimated probabilities	CLASSIFIERS	This work augments the Naive Bayesian learning algorithm with a second training phase in an attempt to improve its classification accuracy. This is achieved by finding more accurate estimations of the needed probability terms. This approach helps in dealing with the problem of the lack of training data. Unlike many previous approaches that deal with this problem, the proposed method is an eager method in the sense that it does most of the work during training and, therefore, it does not increase classification time. It consists of two phases. In the first phase, the algorithm builds a classical Naive Bayesian classifier. The second phase is a fine tuning phase. In this phase each training instance is classified, if it is misclassified, the probability values involved are fine tuned in such a way that increases the chances of correctly classifying this instance in the next round. Our results show significant improvement in the classification accuracy of many benchmark data sets, compared to the classical Naive Bayesian, and two other methods that improve on the Naive Bayesian algorithm.

The sparsity of historical investment transaction data for many growth stage private companies' may present a major obstacle to using statistical methods to discern industry specific features associated with successful and failed companies. This paper describes a Bayesian ranking approach based on (i) extracting and selecting features; (ii) training support vector machine classifiers from feature pairs of labeled companies in an industry; (iii) non-parametric estimation of posterior probabilities of success and failure; and (iv) ranking unlabeled companies within a cohort based on scores derived from posterior probability estimates. We anticipate that this approach will not only be of interest to statisticians and machine learning specialists with an interest in venture capital and private equity but extend to a broader readership whose interests lie in classification methods where missing data is the primary obstacle.

There are several types of immune cells that has specific role in the whole immune system. The number and type of immune cells alter in the disease state and identifying the type of immune cell provides information about a person's state of health. There are several immune cell subsets that are essentially morphologically identical and require external labeling to enable discrimination. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of using Wavelength Modulated Raman Spectroscopy (WMRS) with suitable machine learning algorithms as a label-free method to distinguish between different closely lying immune cell subset. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on WMRS data from single cells, obtained using confocal Raman microscopy for feature reduction, followed by Support Vector Machine (SVM) for binary discrimination of various cell subset, which yielded an accuracy > 85%. The method was successful in discriminating between untouched and unfixed purified populations of CD4+CD3+ and CD8+ CD3+ T lymphocyte subsets, and CD56+ CD3- natural killer cells with a high degree of specificity. It was also proved sensitive enough to identify unique Raman signatures that allow clear discrimination between dendritic cell subsets, comprising CD303+CD45+ plasmacytoid and CD1c+CD141+ myeloid dendritic cells. The results of this study clearly show that WMRS is highly sensitive and can distinguish between cell types that are morphologically identical.

A contact image sensor (CIS) is used to generate digital images of the glass surfaces. The presented machine vision based quality inspection at the end of the production line aims to classify five different glass defect types. The defect images are usually characterized by very little 'image structure', i.e. homogeneous regions without distinct image texture. Additionally, these defect images usually consist of only a few pixels. At the same time the appearance of certain defect classes can be very diverse ( e. g. water drops). We used simple state-of-the-art image features like histogram-based features (std. deviation, curtosis, skewness), geometric features ( form factor/elongation, eccentricity, Hu-moments) and texture features ( grey level run length matrix, co-occurrence matrix) to extract defect information. The main contribution of this work now lies in the systematic evaluation of various machine learning algorithms to identify appropriate classification approaches for this specific class of images.

Classification of Phishing Email Using Random Forest Machine Learning Technique	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article								Phishing is one of the major challenges faced by the world of e-commerce today. Thanks to phishing attacks, billions of dollars have been lost by many companies and individuals. In 2012, an online report put the loss due to phishing attack at about $1.5 billion. This global impact of phishing attacks will continue to be on the increase and thus requires more efficient phishing detection techniques to curb the menace. This paper investigates and reports the use of random forest machine learning algorithm in classification of phishing attacks, with the major objective of developing an improved phishing email classifier with better prediction accuracy and fewer numbers of features. From a dataset consisting of 2000 phishing and ham emails, a set of prominent phishing email features (identified from the literature) were extracted and used by the machine learning algorithm with a resulting classification accuracy of 99.7% and low false negative (FN) and false positive (FP) rates.

Inference is a central problem to be solved on these networks. This, and other problems on these graph models are often known to be hard to solve in general, but tractable on graphs with bounded Treewidth. Therefore, finding or approximating the Treewidth of a graph is a fundamental problem related to inference in graphical models. In this paper, we study the approximability of a number of graph problems: Treewidth and Pathwidth of graphs, Minimum Fill-In, OneShot Black ( and Black-White) pebbling costs of directed acyclic graphs, and a variety of different graph layout problems such as Minimum Cut Linear Arrangement and Interval Graph Completion.

Previous research does not consider cases in which the behavior of spammers changes over time. This study proposes a framework that can dynamically adapt to new types of image spam. The proposed framework is a two-layer imaging spam filtering system with a self-adaptable mechanism. The first layer is a fast classification module, which can filter many similar spam images very quickly. The second layer is a precise classification module, which classifies input images that are not readily classified by the first layer. Based on the proposed self-adaptable mechanism, the second layer immediately feeds spam image information back to the first layer. This allows the first layer to process new images using the updated information. Because the first layer quickly filters most spam images, this feedback approach improves system performance. This study reports the implementation of an example system based on the proposed framework. Experimental results show that the proposed system improves both accuracy and overall performance. Using limited training data, the proposed system achieved an accuracy of approximately 93.4%.

However, the initial guess of cluster centers affects the clustering result seriously, which means that improper initialization cannot lead to a desirous clustering result. How to choose suitable initial centers is an important research issue for kappa-means algorithm. In this paper, we propose an adaptive initialization framework based on spatial local information (AIF-SLI), which takes advantage of local density of data distribution. As it is difficult to estimate density correctly, we develop two approximate estimations: density by t-nearest neighborhoods (t-NN) and density by epsilon-neighborhoods (epsilon-Ball), leading to two implements of the proposed framework. Our empirical study on more than 20 datasets shows promising performance of the proposed framework and denotes that it has several advantages: (1) can find the reasonable candidates of initial centers effectively; (2) it can reduce the iterations of kappa-means' methods significantly; (3) it is robust to outliers; and (4) it is easy to implement.

Recently, ensemble learning has arisen as an effective solution to class imbalance problems. The combination of bagging and boosting with data preprocessing resampling, namely, the simplest and accurate exploratory undersampling, has become the most popular method for imbalanced data classification. In this paper, we propose a novel selective ensemble construction method based on exploratory undersampling, RotEasy, with the advantage of improving storage requirement and computational efficiency by ensemble pruning technology. Our methodology aims to enhance the diversity between individual classifiers through feature extraction and diversity regularized ensemble pruning. We made a comprehensive comparison between our method and some state-of-the-art imbalanced learning methods. Experimental results on 20 real-world imbalanced data sets show that RotEasy possesses a significant increase in performance, contrasted by a nonparametric statistical test and various evaluation criteria.

Automatic annotation of skin biopsy image is an important problem for increasing efficiency and reducing the subjectiveness in diagnosis. However it is challenging particularly when there exists indirect relationship between annotation terms and local regions of a biopsy image, as well as local structures with different textures. In this paper, a novel method based on a recent proposed machine learning model, named multi-instance multilabel (MIML), is proposed to model the potential knowledge and experience of doctors on skin biopsy image annotation. We first show that the problem of skin biopsy image annotation can naturally be expressed as a MIML problem and then propose an image representation method that can capture both region structure and texture features, and a sparse Bayesian MIML algorithm which can produce probabilities indicating the confidence of annotation. The proposed algorithm framework is evaluated on a real clinical dataset containing 12,700 skin biopsy images. The results show that it is effective and prominent.

To achieve this goal, periodic cost estimation is vitally important not only in the planning phase, but also in the execution phase. Due to high uncertainty in operational environment, point estimation of project cost is oftentimes not sufficient to assist the decision-making process. This study utilizes Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM), machine learning based interval estimation (MLIE), and Differential Evolution (DE) to establish a novel model for predicting construction project cost. LS-SVM is a supervised learning technique used for regression analysis. MLIE is employed for inference of prediction intervals. Moreover, our model deploys DE in the cross validation process to search for the optimal values of tuning parameters. The newly developed model, named as EAC-LSPIM, yields results consisting of a point estimate coupled with lower and upper prediction limits, at a certain level of confidence, to accentuate uncertainty. Simulation and performance comparison demonstrate that the new model is capable of delivering accurate and reliable forecasting results.

Pain, is highly subjective and the use of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) can play an important part in improving the accuracy of pain assessment, and lead to better clinical practices. This review examines CDSSs, in relation to computer technologies and was conducted with the following electronic databases: CiteSeer(x), IEEE Xplore, ISI Web of Knowledge, Mendeley, Microsoft Academic Search, PubMed, Science Accelerator, Science. gov, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and The Cochrane Library. The studies referenced were compiled with several criteria in mind. Firstly, that they constituted a decision support system. Secondly, that study data included pain values or results based on the detection of pain. Thirdly, that they were published in English, between 1992 and 2011, and finally that they focused on patients with acute or chronic pain. In total, thirty-nine studies highlighted the following topics: rule based algorithms, artificial neural networks, rough and fuzzy sets, statistical learning algorithms, terminologies, questionnaires and scores. The median accuracy ranged from 53% to 87.5%. The lack of integration with mobile devices, the limited use of web-based interfaces and the scarcity of systems that allow for data to be inserted by patients were all limitations that were detected.

EEG Eye State Identification Using Incremental Attribute Learning with Time-Series Classification	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							GENETIC-ALGORITHMS	Eye state identification is a kind of common time-series classification problem which is also a hot spot in recent research. Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used in eye state classification to detect human's cognition state. Previous research has validated the feasibility of machine learning and statistical approaches for EEG eye state classification. This paper aims to propose a novel approach for EEG eye state identification using incremental attribute learning (IAL) based on neural networks. IAL is a novel machine learning strategy which gradually imports and trains features one by one. Previous studies have verified that such an approach is applicable for solving a number of pattern recognition problems. However, in these previous works, little research on IAL focused on its application to time-series problems. Therefore, it is still unknown whether IAL can be employed to cope with time-series problems like EEG eye state classification. Experimental results in this study demonstrates that, with proper feature extraction and feature ordering, IAL can not only efficiently cope with time-series classification problems, but also exhibit better classification performance in terms of classification error rates in comparison with conventional and some other approaches.

Jin			Semisupervised Location Awareness in Wireless Sensor Networks Using Laplacian Support Vector Regression	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article							LOCALIZATION; MACHINES	Supervised machine learning has been widely used in context-aware wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to discover context descriptions from sensor data. However, collecting a lot of labeled training data in order to guarantee good performance requires much cost and time. For this reason, the semisupervised learning has been recently developed due to its superior performance despite using only a small amount of the labeled data. In this paper, we extend the standard support vector regression (SVR) to the semisupervised SVR by employing manifold regularization, which we call Laplacian SVR (LapSVR). The LapSVR is compared with the standard SVR and the semisupervised least square algorithm that is another recently developed semisupervised regression algorithm. The algorithms are evaluated for location awareness of multiple mobile robots in a WSN. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm yields more accurate location estimates than the other algorithms.	[Yoo, Jaehyun; Kim, H.

Predictor augmentation in random forests	STATISTICS AND ITS INTERFACE			English	Article						Classification; Machine learning; Prediction; Regression		Random forest (RF) methodology is an increasingly popular nonparametric methodology for prediction in both regression and classification problems. We describe a behavior of random forests (RFs) that may be unknown and surprising to many initial users of the methodology: out-of-sample prediction by RFs can be sometimes improved by augmenting the dataset with a new explanatory variable, independent of all variables in the original dataset. We explain this phenomenon with a simulated example, and show how independent variable augmentation can help RFs to decreases prediction variance and improve prediction performance in some cases. We also give real data examples for illustration, argue that this phenomenon is closely connected with overfitting, and suggest potential research for improving RFs.

In CT, three-dimensional images of the interior of an object are generated based on its X-ray attenuation. Multi-energy CT can be used to enhance material discrimination. Currently, reliable identification and segmentation of objects from CT data is challenging due to the large range of materials which may appear in baggage and the presence of metal and high clutter. Conventionally reconstructed CT images suffer from metal induced streaks and artifacts which can lead to breaking of objects and inaccurate object labeling. We propose a novel learning-based framework for joint metal artifact reduction and direct object labeling from CT derived data. A material label image is directly estimated from measured effective attenuation images. We include data weighting to mitigate metal artifacts and incorporate an object boundary-field to reduce object splitting. The overall problem is posed as a graph optimization problem and solved using an efficient graph-cut algorithm. We test the method on real data and show that it can produce accurate material labels in the presence of metal and clutter.	[Martin, Limor; Tuysuzoglu, Ahmet; Ishwar, Prakash; Karl, W.

POSE ESTIMATION	Personal consumer photography collections often contain photos captured by numerous devices stored both locally and via online services. The task of gathering, organizing, and assembling still and video assets in preparation for sharing with others can be quite challenging. Current commercial photobook applications are mostly manual-based requiring significant user interactions. To assist the consumer in organizing these assets, we propose an automatic method to assign a fitness score to each asset, whereby the top scoring assets are used for product creation. Our method uses cues extracted from analyzing pixel data, metadata embedded in the file, as well as ancillary tags or online comments. When a face occurs in an image, its features have a dominating influence on both aesthetic and compositional properties of the displayed image. As such, this paper will emphasize the contributions faces have on affecting the overall fitness score of an image. To understand consumer preference, we conducted a psychophysical study that spanned 27 judges, 5,598 faces, and 2,550 images. Preferences on a per-face and per-image basis were independently gathered to train our classifiers. We describe how to use machine learning techniques to merge differing facial attributes into a single classifier. Our novel methods of facial weighting, fusion of facial attributes, and dimensionality reduction produce state-of-the-art results suitable for commercial applications.

In order to exploit the fine-grained structural information of textual content, a review may be considered as a collection of sentences, each with its own sentiment orientation and score. In this manner, a score aggregation method is needed to combine sentence-level scores into an overall review rating. While recent work has concentrated on designing effective sentence-level prediction methods, there remains the problem of finding efficient algorithms for score aggregation. In this study, we investigate different aggregation methods, as well as the cases in which they perform poorly. According to the analysis of existing methods, we propose a new score aggregation method based on the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. In the proposed method, we first detect the polarity of reviews using a machine learning approach and then, consider sentence scores as evidence for the overall review rating. The results from two public social web datasets show the higher performance of our method in comparison with existing score aggregation methods and state-of-the-art machine learning approaches.

The conventional approach towards identification is based on content fingerprinting where a short binary content description known as a fingerprint is extracted from the content. We propose an alternative solution based on elements of machine learning theory and digital communications. Similar to binary content fingerprinting, binary content representation is generated based on a set of trained binary classifiers. We consider several training/encoding strategies and demonstrate that the proposed system can achieve the upper theoretical performance limits of content identification. The experimental results were carried out both on a synthetic dataset with different parameters and the FAMOS dataset of microstructures from consumer packages.

In steganography, this situation is recognized as the so-called cover source mismatch (CSM). The drop in detection accuracy depends on many factors, including the properties of both sources, the detector construction, the feature space used to represent the covers, and the steganographic algorithm. Although well recognized as the single most important factor negatively affecting the performance of steganalyzers in practice, the CSM received surprisingly little attention from researchers. One of the reasons for this is the diversity with which the CSM can manifest. On a series of experiments in the spatial and JPEG domains, we refute some of the common misconceptions that the severity of the CSM is tied to the feature dimensionality or their "fragility." The CSM impact on detection appears too difficult to predict due to the effect of complex dependencies among the features. We also investigate ways to mitigate the negative effect of the CSM using simple measures, such as by enlarging the diversity of the training set (training on a mixture of sources) and by employing a bank of detectors trained on multiple different sources and testing on a detector trained on the closest source.

Generally, these photos are taken by individuals who have no training in photography with low-cost mobile phone cameras. It is desired that photos of the products have high aesthetic quality to improve the users' online shopping experience. In this work, we design features for aesthetic quality inference in the context of online fashion shopping. Psychophysical experiments are conducted to construct a database of the photos' aesthetic evaluation, specifically for photos from an online fashion shopping website. We then extract both generic low-level features and high-level image attributes to represent the aesthetic quality. Using a support vector machine framework, we train a predictor of the aesthetic quality rating based on the feature vector. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our approach. Metadata such as the product type are also used to further improve the result.

The algorithm first calculates the density-similar-neighbor-based outlier factor (DSNOF) for each point in the dataset according to the relationship of the density of the point and its neighbors, and then treats the point whose DSNOF is smaller than 1 as a core point. Second, the core points are used for clustering by the similar process of the density based spatial clustering application with noise (DBSCAN) to get some sub-clusters. Third, the proposed algorithm merges the obtained sub-clusters into some clusters. Finally, the points whose DSNOF are larger than 1 are assigned into these clusters. Experiments are performed on some real datasets of the UCI Machine Learning Repository and the experiments results verify that the effectiveness of the proposed model is higher than the DBSCAN algorithm and k-means algorithm and would not be affected by the parameter greatly.

Considering the entropy of each device monitored, which is calculated based on a Markov chain model, the proposed method identifies novelties through a machine learning algorithm. To this end, the NodePM is integrated into a platform for the remote monitoring of energy consumption, which consists of a wireless sensors network (WSN). It thus should be stressed that the experiments were conducted in real environments different from many related works, which are evaluated in simulated environments. In this sense, the results show that the NodePM reduces by 13.7% the power consumption of the equipment we monitored. In addition, the NodePM provides better efficiency to detect novelties when compared to an approach from the literature, surpassing it in different scenarios in all evaluations that were carried out.

The model links tool wear with features extracted from the force sensor and the main and feed drive current sensors signals recorded under different cutting conditions and different tool wear states. Signal features extracted from both the time and frequency domain were used as input parameters for construction of a decision tree which classifies the tool state into sharp or worn. The model was refined by selecting only the feature sources most important for classification.

However, storing data does not correspond with understanding the knowledge it contains. Thus, solutions capable of learning problem statements and gathering knowledge from huge amounts of data, be it structured or unstructured, are required.

These images capture axonal movement and orientation using echo-planar imaging and provide critical information for evaluating lesions and structural damage in the central nervous system. This information can be used for prediction of Spinal Cord Injuries (SCIs) and for assessment of patients who are recovering from such injuries. In this paper, we propose a classification scheme for identifying healthy individuals and patients. In the proposed scheme, a dataset is first constructed from DTI images, after which the constructed dataset undergoes feature selection and classification. The experiment results show that the proposed scheme aids in the diagnosis of SCIs.

As to monotonic classification, it is assumed that both features and decision are ordinal and there is the monotonicity constraints between the features and decision. Little work has been focused on feature selection for this type of tasks although a number of feature selection algorithms have been introduced for nominal classification problems. However these techniques can not be applied to monotonic classification as they do not consider the monotonicity constraints. In this work, we present a technique to compute the quality of features for monotonic classification. Using gradient directing search method, this method trains a feature weight vector by maximizing the fuzzy monotonic dependency, which was defined in fuzzy preference rough sets. We conduct some experiments to compare the classification performances of the proposed method with some other techniques. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Benefits and drawbacks of two modelling approaches for a generalist carnivore: can models predict where Wile E. Coyote will turn up next?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						species distribution models; machine learning; boosted regression trees; GLMM; coyotes	SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; RESOURCE SELECTION FUNCTIONS; KERNEL DENSITY ESTIMATORS; PRESENCE-ONLY DATA; HOME-RANGE; COLLAR PERFORMANCE; HABITAT PREFERENCE; ECOLOGICAL THEORY; DISTRIBUTIONS; SCALE	Wildlife ecologists frequently make use of limited information on locations of a species of interest in combination with readily available GIS data to build models to predict space use. In addition to a wide range of statistical data models that are more commonly used, machine learning approaches provide another means to develop predictive spatial models. However, comparison of output from these two families of models for the same data set is not often carried out. It is important that wildlife managers understand the pitfalls and limitations when a single set of models is used with limited GIS data to try to predict and understand species distribution. To illustrate this, we carried out two sets of models (generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) and boosted regression trees (BRTs)) to predict geographic occupancy of the eastern coyote (Canis latrans) on the island of Newfoundland, Canada. This exercise is illustrative of common spatial questions in wildlife research and management. Our results show that models vary depending on the approach (GLMM vs. BRT) and that, overall, BRT had higher predictive ability. Although machine learning has been criticized because it is not explicitly hypothesis-driven, it has been used in other areas of spatial modelling with success. Here, we demonstrate that it may be a useful approach for predicting wildlife space use and to generate hypotheses when data are limited. The results of this comparison can help to improve other models for species distributions and also guide future sampling and modelling initiatives.

The integrated scheme aims to adopt the SVM-PSO method to improve the validity of PCA based image recognition systems on dynamically visual perception. The face recognition for most human-robot interaction applications is accomplished by PCA based method because of its dimensionality reduction. However, PCA based systems are only suitable for processing the faces with the same face expressions and/or under the same view directions. Since the facial feature selection process can be considered as a problem of global combinatorial optimization in machine learning, the SVM-PSO is usually used as an optimal classifier of the system. In this paper, the PSO is used to implement a feature selection, and the SVMs serve as fitness functions of the PSO for classification problems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method simplifies features effectively and obtains higher classification accuracy.

However, authentication mechanisms on portable smart devices, particularly conventional biometric based approaches, still remain security and privacy concerns. These traditional systems are mostly based on pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms, wherein original biometric templates or extracted features are stored under unconcealed form for performing matching with a new biometric sample in the authentication phase. In this paper, we propose a novel gait based authentication using biometric cryptosystem to enhance the system security and user privacy on the smart phone. Extracted gait features are merely used to biometrically encrypt a cryptographic key which is acted as the authentication factor. Gait signals are acquired by using an inertial sensor named accelerometer in the mobile device and error correcting codes are adopted to deal with the natural variation of gait measurements. We evaluate our proposed system on a dataset consisting of gait samples of 34 volunteers. We achieved the lowest false acceptance rate (FAR) and false rejection rate (FRR) of 3.92% and 11.76%, respectively, in terms of key length of 50 bits.

In order to overcome this problem, the authors propose an accurate pedestrian detection system based on two machine learning methods: cascade AdaBoost detector and random vector functional-link net. During the offline training phase, the parameters of a cascade AdaBoost detector and random vector functional-link net are trained by standard dataset. These candidates, extracted by the strategy of a multiscale sliding window, are normalized to be standard scale and verified by the cascade AdaBoost detector and random vector functional-link net on the online phase. Only those candidates with high confidence can pass the validation. The proposed system is more accurate than other single machine learning algorithms with fewer false pedestrians, which has been confirmed in simulation experiment on four datasets.

It is pointed out in the present paper that, when including anisotropy detection to improve resolution on shock layer, SPH is a very peculiar case of unsupervised machine learning. On the other hand, the free particle nature of SPH opens an opportunity for artificial intelligence to study particles as agents acting in a collaborative framework in which the timed outcomes of a fluid simulation forms a large knowledge base, which might be very attractive in computational astrophysics phenomenological problems like self-propagating star formation.

The proposed method employs partial derivatives in order to calculate "causal partitions" of the system's state variables, which make it possible to quantify the extent to which various causes can be considered "responsible" for the emergent behavior of the simulated system. Causal partitions can be processed by machine learning techniques (e.g. clustering and classification), and so facilitate meaningful interpretations of the observed emergent behaviors. The method is applied to the simulated emotions of fear and anger in humans, in a hybrid agent-based model of human behavior in the context of EDA project EUSAS.

It is a powerful tool to improve the accuracy of classifiers. This approach has become increasingly interesting, especially for real-world problems, which are often characterized by their imbalanced nature. The unbalanced distribution of data leads to poor performance of most of the conventional machine learning techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel weighted rough set as a Meta classifier framework for 14 classifiers to find the smallest and optimal ensemble, which maximize the overall ensemble accuracy. We propose a new entropy-based method to compute the weight of each classifier. Each classifier assigns a weight based on its contribution to classification accuracy. Thanks to the powerful reduct technique in rough set, this guarantees high diversity of the produced reduct ensembles. The higher diversity between the core classifiers has a positive impact on the performance of minority class as well as on the overall system performance. Experimental results with ozone dataset demonstrate the advantages of weighted rough set Meta classifier framework over the well-known Meta classifiers like Bagging, boosting and random forest as well as any individual classifiers.

Accurate prediction of proline CTI is of great importance for the understanding of protein folding, splicing, cell signaling, and transmembrane active transport in both the human body and animals. Our goal is to develop a state-of-the-art proline CTI predictor based on a biophysically motivated intelligent consensus modeling through the use of sequence information only (i.e., position specific scores generated by PSI-BLAST). The current computational proline CTI predictors reach about 70-73 percent Q2 accuracies and about 0.40 Matthew correlation coefficient (Mcc) through the use of sequence-based evolutionary information as well as predicted protein secondary structure information. However, our approach that utilizes a novel decision tree-based consensus model with a powerful randomized-metalearning technique has achieved 86.58 percent Q2 accuracy and 0.74 Mcc, on the same proline CTI data set, which is a better result than those of any existing computational proline CTI predictors reported in the literature.

Specific patterns in DNA copy number variations (CNVs) can be associated with certain disease types and can facilitate prognosis and progress monitoring of the disease. Machine learning techniques have been used to model the problem of tissue typing as a classification problem. Feature selection is an important part of the classification process, because many biological features are not related to the diseases and confuse the classification tasks. Multiple feature selection methods have been proposed in the different domains where classification has been applied. In this work, we will present a new feature selection method based on structured sparsity-inducing norms to identify the informative aCGH biomarkers which can help us classify different disease subtypes. To validate the performance of the proposed method, we experimentally compare it with existing feature selection methods on four publicly available aCGH data sets. In all empirical results, the proposed sparse learning based feature selection method consistently outperforms other related approaches. More important, we carefully investigate the aCGH biomarkers selected by our method, and the biological evidences in literature strongly support our results.

Identification of (pre-) miRNAs helps in understanding regulatory processes. Machine learning methods have been designed for pre-miRNA identification. However, most of them cannot provide reliable predictive performances on independent testing data sets. We assumed this is because the training sets, especially the negative training sets, are not sufficiently representative. To generate a representative negative set, we proposed a novel negative sample selection technique, and successfully collected negative samples with improved quality. Two recent classifiers rebuilt with the proposed negative set achieved an improvement of similar to 6 percent in their predictive performance, which confirmed this assumption. Based on the proposed negative set, we constructed a training set, and developed an online system called miRNApre specifically for human pre-miRNA identification. We showed that miRNApre achieved accuracies on updated human and non-human data sets that were 34.3 and 7.6 percent higher than those achieved by current methods. The results suggest that miRNApre is an effective tool for pre-miRNA identification. Additionally, by integrating miRNApre, we developed a miRNA mining tool, mirnaDetect, which can be applied to find potential miRNAs in genome-scale data. MirnaDetect achieved a comparable mining performance on human chromosome 19 data as other existing methods.

The Faces of Engagement: Automatic Recognition of Student Engagement from Facial Expressions	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AFFECTIVE COMPUTING			English	Article						Student engagement; engagement recognition; facial expression recognition; facial actions; intelligent tutoring systems	SCHOOL; TASK; DYNAMICS; STATE; TIME	Student engagement is a key concept in contemporary education, where it is valued as a goal in its own right. In this paper we explore approaches for automatic recognition of engagement from students' facial expressions. We studied whether human observers can reliably judge engagement from the face; analyzed the signals observers use to make these judgments; and automated the process using machine learning. We found that human observers reliably agree when discriminating low versus high degrees of engagement (Cohen's kappa = 0.96). When fine discrimination is required (four distinct levels) the reliability decreases, but is still quite high (kappa = 0.56). Furthermore, we found that engagement labels of 10-second video clips can be reliably predicted from the average labels of their constituent frames (Pearson r = 0.85), suggesting that static expressions contain the bulk of the information used by observers. We used machine learning to develop automatic engagement detectors and found that for binary classification (e. g., high engagement versus low engagement), automated engagement detectors perform with comparable accuracy to humans. Finally, we show that both human and automatic engagement judgments correlate with task performance. In our experiment, student post-test performance was predicted with comparable accuracy from engagement labels (r = 0.47) as from pre-test scores (r = 0.44).

Instead of decomposing such problems into simple sub-problems and solving each part using a different classifier, the proposed system decomposes and implements the entire problem automatically in the same framework. The decomposition is performed using the most commonly used methods for dividing multi-class classification problems: OAA (one-against-all) and OAO (one-against-one). Consequently, two models are introduced: OAA and OAO based neuro-fuzzy classifiers. The design of the proposed models is based on the implementation of each sub-problem using a set of weights. The learning is performed by adjusting every set independently, and without adjusting the parameters of membership functions. This considerably simplifies the classification and learning tasks. After the learning stage, the proposed systems act as a single-module classifier for recognizing new examples.

A corpus-based approach for automated LOINC mapping	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							LABORATORY DATA; INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL; CODES; IDENTIFICATION; INSTITUTIONS; SYSTEM; NAMES; CARE	Objective To determine whether the knowledge contained in a rich corpus of local terms mapped to LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes) could be leveraged to help map local terms from other institutions. Methods We developed two models to test our hypothesis. The first based on supervised machine learning was created using Apache's OpenNLP Maxent and the second based on information retrieval was created using Apache's Lucene. The models were validated by a random subsampling method that was repeated 20 times and that used 80/20 splits for training and testing, respectively. We also evaluated the performance of these models on all laboratory terms from three test institutions. Results For the 20 iterations used for validation of our 80/20 splits Maxent and Lucene ranked the correct LOINC code first for between 70.5% and 71.4% and between 63.7% and 65.0% of local terms, respectively. For all laboratory terms from the three test institutions Maxent ranked the correct LOINC code first for between 73.5% and 84.6% (mean 78.9%) of local terms, whereas Lucene's performance was between 66.5% and 76.6% (mean 71.9%). Using a cut-off score of 0.46 Maxent always ranked the correct LOINC code first for over 57% of local terms. Conclusions This study showed that a rich corpus of local terms mapped to LOINC contains collective knowledge that can help map terms from other institutions. Using freely available software tools, we developed a data-driven automated approach that operates on term descriptions from existing mappings in the corpus. Accurate and efficient automated mapping methods can help to accelerate adoption of vocabulary standards and promote widespread health information exchange.

We show how an HPC can be re-engineered to accommodate clinical data while retaining its utility in computationally intensive tasks such as data mining, machine learning, and statistics. We also discuss deploying protected virtual machines. A critical planning step was to engage the university's information security operations and the information security and privacy office. Access to the environment requires a double authentication mechanism. The first level of authentication requires access to the university's virtual private network and the second requires that the users be listed in the HPC network information service directory. The physical hardware resides in a data center with controlled room access. All employees of the HPC and its users take the university's local Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act training series.

Using structural neuroanatomy to identify trauma survivors with and without post-traumatic stress disorder at the individual level	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Magnetic resonance imaging; natural disaster; post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); support vector machine (SVM); voxel-based morphometry (VBM)	DIMENSIONAL PATTERN-CLASSIFICATION; MACHINE LEARNING-METHODS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; DEPRESSION; PTSD; RISK; MRI	Background. At present there are no objective, biological markers that can be used to reliably identify individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study assessed the diagnostic potential of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) for identifying trauma-exposed individuals with and without PTSD. Method. sMRI scans were acquired from 50 survivors of the Sichuan earthquake of 2008 who had developed PTSD, 50 survivors who had not developed PTSD and 40 healthy controls who had not been exposed to the earthquake. Support vector machine (SVM), a multivariate pattern recognition technique, was used to develop an algorithm that distinguished between the three groups at an individual level. The accuracy of the algorithm and its statistical significance were estimated using leave-one-out cross-validation and permutation testing. Results. When survivors with PTSD were compared against healthy controls, both grey and white matter allowed discrimination with an accuracy of 91% (p<0.001). When survivors without PTSD were compared against healthy controls, the two groups could be discriminated with accuracies of 76% (p<0.001) and 85% (p<0.001) based on grey and white matter, respectively. Finally, when survivors with and without PTSD were compared directly, grey matter allowed discrimination with an accuracy of 67% (p<0.001); in contrast the two groups could not be distinguished based on white matter. Conclusions. These results reveal patterns of neuroanatomical alterations that could be used to inform the identification of trauma survivors with and without PTSD at the individual level, and provide preliminary support to the development of SVM as a clinically useful diagnostic aid.

Comparison of NAIP orthophotography and RapidEye satellite imagery for mapping of mining and mine reclamation	GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						National Agriculture Imagery Program; NAIP; RapidEye; mountaintop removal coal mining; surface coal mining; land cover classification; machine learning	LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER; SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; CENTRAL APPALACHIANS; PIXEL; ACCURACY; TEXTURE; TREES; VARIABILITY	National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) orthophotography is a potentially useful data source for land cover classification in the United States due to its nationwide and generally cloud-free coverage, low cost to the public, frequent update interval, and high spatial resolution. Nevertheless, there are challenges when working with NAIP imagery, especially regarding varying viewing geometry, radiometric normalization, and calibration. In this article, we compare NAIP orthophotography and RapidEye satellite imagery for high-resolution mapping of mining and mine reclamation within a mountaintop coal surface mine in the southern coalfields of West Virginia, USA. Two classification algorithms, support vector machines and random forests, were used to classify both data sets. Compared to the RapidEye classification, the NAIP classification resulted in lower overall accuracy and kappa and higher allocation disagreement and quantity disagreement. However, the accuracy of the NAIP classification was improved by reducing the number of classes mapped, using the near-infrared band, using textural measures and feature selection, and reducing the spatial resolution slightly by pixel aggregation or by applying a Gaussian low-pass filter. With such strategies, NAIP data can be a potential alternative to RapidEye satellite data for classification of surface mine land cover.	[Maxwell, A.

First, a database consisting of active and non-active classes was predicted with model performances above 85% and 80% in learning and test series, respectively. Second a regression-based model was developed which allow to estimate the EC50 with Q(2) values of 52.89 and 50.19, in training and prediction sets, respectively, were developed. These results provided new approaches on proteasome inhibitor identification encouraged by virtual screenings procedures.

Different notions of "bias" are identified and compared with the notion of bias in statistics, machine learning, and signal detection theory. Comparison with normative models then forms the basis for a critical look at the evidence that people succumb to motivated reasoning aimed at enabling them "to believe what they want to believe."

As hERG safety testing is a mandatory FDA-required procedure, there is a considerable interest for developing predictive computational tools to identify and filter out potential hERG blockers early in the drug discovery process. In this study, we aimed to generate predictive and well-characterized quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for hERG blockage using the largest publicly available dataset of 11,958 compounds from the ChEMBL database. The models have been developed and validated according to OECD guidelines using four types of descriptors and four different machine-learning techniques. The classification accuracies discriminating blockers from non-blockers were as high as 0.83-0.93 on external set. Model interpretation revealed several SAR rules, which can guide structural optimization of some hERG blockers into non-blockers. We have also applied the generated models for screening the World Drug Index (WDI) database and identify putative hERG blockers and non-blockers among currently marketed drugs. The developed models can reliably identify blockers and non-blockers, which could be useful for the scientific community. A freely accessible web server has been developed allowing users to identify putative hERG blockers and non-blockers in chemical libraries of their interest (http://labmol.farmacia.ufg.br/predherg).

In this paper, we propose a new approach which uses deep neural network to learn features automatically for solving author name ambiguity. Additionally, we propose the general system architecture for author name disambiguation on any dataset. We evaluate the proposed method on a dataset containing Vietnamese author names. The results show that this method significantly outperforms other methods that use predefined feature set. The proposed method achieves 99.31% in terms of accuracy. Prediction error rate decreases from 1.83% to 0.69%, i.e., it decreases by 1.14%, or 62.3% relatively compared with other methods that use predefined feature set (Table 3).

The topology of urban LC objects is analyzed by implementing neighborhood LC-graphs. Various graph measures are examined by their potential to distinguish between different UST, using the machine learning classifier random forest. Additionally the influence of different parameter settings of the random forest model, the reduction of training samples, and the graph measure importance is analyzed. An independent test set is classified and validated, achieving an overall accuracy of 87%. It was found that the height of the building with the highest node degree has a strong impact on the classification result.

Current histopathology practice involves preparing thin tissue sections and staining them using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) after which a histopathologist manually assess the tissue architecture under a visible microscope. Studies have shown that there is disagreement between operators viewing the same tissue suggesting that a complementary technique for verification could improve the robustness of the evaluation, and improve patient care. FT-IR chemical imaging allows the spatial distribution of chemistry to be rapidly imaged at a high (diffraction-limited) spatial resolution where each pixel represents an area of 5.5 x 5.5 mu m(2) and contains a full infrared spectrum providing a chemical fingerprint which studies have shown contains the diagnostic potential to discriminate between different cell-types, and even the benign or malignant state of prostatic epithelial cells. We report a label-free (i.e. no chemical de-waxing, or staining) method of imaging large pieces of prostate tissue (typically 1 cm x 2 cm) in tens of minutes (at a rate of 0.704 x 0.704 mm(2) every 14.5 s) yielding images containing millions of spectra. Due to refractive index matching between sample and surrounding paraffin, minimal signal processing is required to recover spectra with their natural profile as opposed to harsh baseline correction methods, paving the way for future quantitative analysis of biochemical signatures. The quality of the spectral information is demonstrated by building and testing an automated cell-type classifier based upon spectral features.

Deep learning approaches are learn-from-data methods involving computational modeling of the learning process. This approach is similar to how human brain works using different interpretation levels or layers of most representative and useful features resulting into a hierarchical learned representation. These methods have been shown to outpace traditional approaches of most challenging problems in several areas such as speech recognition and object detection. Invasive breast cancer detection is a time consuming and challenging task primarily because it involves a pathologist scanning large swathes of benign regions to ultimately identify the areas of malignancy. Precise delineation of IDC in WSI is crucial to the subsequent estimation of grading tumor aggressiveness and predicting patient outcome. DL approaches are particularly adept at handling these types of problems, especially if a large number of samples are available for training, which would also ensure the generalizability of the learned features and classifier. The DL framework in this paper extends a number of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for visual semantic analysis of tumor regions for diagnosis support. The CNN is trained over a large amount of image patches (tissue regions) from WSI to learn a hierarchical part-based representation. The method was evaluated over a WSI dataset from 162 patients diagnosed with IDC. 113 slides were selected for training and 49 slides were held out for independent testing. Ground truth for quantitative evaluation was provided via expert delineation of the region of cancer by an expert pathologist on the digitized slides. The experimental evaluation was designed to measure classifier accuracy in detecting IDC tissue regions in WSI. Our method yielded the best quantitative results for automatic detection of IDC regions in WSI in terms of F-measure and balanced accuracy (71.80%, 84.23%), in comparison with an approach using handcrafted image features (color, texture and edges, nuclear textural and architecture), and a machine learning classifier for invasive tumor classification using a Random Forest. The best performing handcrafted features were fuzzy color histogram (67.53%, 78.74%) and RGB histogram (66.64%, 77.24%). Our results also suggest that at least some of the tissue classification mistakes (false positives and false negatives) were less due to any fundamental problems associated with the approach, than the inherent limitations in obtaining a very highly granular annotation of the diseased area of interest by an expert pathologist.

SRS spectral microscopy has been used to obtain two-dimensional spectral images of rat liver tissue, three-dimensional images of a vessel in rat liver, and in vivo spectral images of mouse ear skin. Various multivariate analysis techniques, such as principal component analysis and independent component analysis, have been used to obtain spectral images. In this study, we propose a digital staining method. This method uses SRS spectra and statistical machine learning that makes use of prior knowledge of spectral peaks and their two-dimensional distributional patterns corresponding to the composition of tissue samples. The method selects spectral peaks on the basis of Mahalanobis distance, which is defined as the ratio of inter-group variation to intragroup variation. We also make use of higher-order local autocorrelations as feature values for two-dimensional distributional patterns. This combination of techniques allows groups corresponding to different intracellular structures to be clearly discriminated in the multidimensional feature space. We investigate the performance of our method on mouse liver tissue samples and show that the proposed method can digitally stain each intracellular structure such as cell nuclei, cytoplasm, and erythrocytes separately and clearly without time-consuming chemical staining processes. We anticipate that our method could be applied to computer-aided pathological diagnosis.

Computerized pathology increases our understanding and enables prevention of superficial spreading melanoma (SSM). Machine learning involved looking at the images to measure the size of cells through a 2-D Fourier transform and developing an appropriate mask with the erf() function to model the cells. Implementation involved processing the images to identify cells whose image segments provided the least difference when subtracted from the mask. With further simplification of the algorithm, the program may be directly implemented on the RCM images to indicate the presence of keratinocytes in seconds and to quantify the keratinocytes size in the en face plane as a function of depth. Using this system, the algorithm can identify any irregularities in maturation and differentiation of keratinocytes, thereby signaling the possible presence of cancer.

We have proposed a novel machine learning method that hybridizes support vector machine (SVM), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and cuckoo search (CS). The new method consists of two stages: firstly, a CS based approach for parameter optimization of SVM is developed to find the better initial parameters of kernel function, and then PSO is applied to continue SVM training and find the best parameters of SVM. Experimental results indicate that the proposed CS-PSO-SVM model achieves better classification accuracy and F-measure than PSO-SVM and GA-SVM. Therefore, we can conclude that our proposed method is very efficient compared to the previously reported algorithms.

An important analytical task in a number of scientific and technological domains is to retrieve information from text data, aiming to get a deeper insight into the content represented by the data in order to obtain some useful, often not explicitly stated knowledge and facts, related to a particular domain of interest. The major challenge is the size, structural complexity, and frequency of the analysed text sets' updates (i.e., the 'big data' aspect), which makes the use of traditional analysis techniques and tools impossible. We introduce an innovative approach to analyse unstructured text data. This allows for improving traditional data mining techniques by adopting algorithms from ontological domain modelling, natural language processing, and machine learning. The technique is inherently designed with parallelism in mind, which allows for high performance on large-scale Cloud computing infrastructures.

This type of dynamic programming, dynamic time wrapping (DTW), is mainly explored in this paper. The category of supervised learning strategies for DTW is developed. The supervised learning method, called incremental learning, is proposed in this study. Incremental learning is conceptually simple and has a satisfactory performance on calculation speed. Dynamic programming with the proposed incremental learning strategy for stochastic speech processing problem will be able to provide a reliable comparison path when performing template matching of speech patterns, and therefore the performance on recognition accuracy will be further improved. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed machine learning approach for dynamical programming-based DTW are demonstrated by a series of well-designed keywords speech recognition experiments.

These days, however, the huge number of email spam has caused serious problems in email communication. To mitigate sufferings of spam emails, Variety of techniques have been developed. One main method is content-based spam filtering, for which, classification methods and feature selection algorithms are critical techniques. As a machine learning technique, Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been proved to be very effective in spam filtering. Feature selection is a very critical process to select the most discriminative features from the original high-dimension feature space for classifier training, which, to a large extent, determines the precision and efficiency of spam filtering. In this paper, we proposed a framework combining SVM with feature selection algorithm - OCFS (Orthogonal Centroid Feature Selection) for spam filtering. Extensive comparison experiments were performed on five benchmark spam corpuses (PU1, PU2, PU3, PUA and ZH1). The results showed that, compared with other traditional combinations, the combination of SVM and OCFS obtained more excellent performance in terms of Accuracy and F-Measure.

For validation purposes, we train this model observer with the ground truth and the estimated template is actually the same as the statistically optimal detector. Next, we present the human observer template estimated for the detection of a signal on a different power-low background.

In SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), a realistic task-based approach involves detection and localization of perfusion defects, as well as a subsequent assessment of defect severity. In this paper we explore a machine-learning MO based on Naive-Bayes classification (NB-MO). NB-MO uses a set of polar-map image features to predict lesion detection, localization and severity scores given by five human readers for a set of simulated 3D SPECT-MPI patients. The simulated dataset included lesions with different sizes, perfusion-reduction ratios, and locations. Simulated projections were reconstructed using two readily used methods namely: FBP and OSEM. For validation, a multi-reader multi-case (MRMC) analysis of alternative free-response ROC (AFROC) curve was performed for NB-MO and human observers. For comparison, we also report performances of a statistical Hotelling Observer applied on polar-map images. Results show excellent agreement between NB-MO and humans, as well as model's good generalization between different reconstruction treatments.

In the current clinical setting paper-based forms are used to classify pain correctly, however, the accuracy of diagnoses and optimal management of pain largely depend on the expert reviewer, which in many cases is not possible because of very few experts in this field. The need for a clinical decision support system that can be used by expert and non-expert clinicians has been cited in literature, but such a system has not been developed. We have designed and developed a stand-alone tool for correctly classifying pain type in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients, using Bayesian decision theory. Various machine learning simulation methods are used to verify the algorithm using a pilot study data set, which consists of 48 patients data set. The data set consists of the paper-based forms, collected at Long Beach VA clinic with pain classification done by expert in the field. Using the WEKA as the machine learning tool we have tested on the 48 patient dataset that the hypothesis that attributes collected on the forms and the pain location marked by patients have very significant impact on the pain type classification. This tool will be integrated with an imaging informatics system to support a clinical study that will test the effectiveness of using Proton Beam radiotherapy for treating spinal cord injury (SCI) related neuropathic pain as an alternative to invasive surgical lesioning.

Estimating spatial variation in Alberta forest biomass from a combination of forest inventory and remote sensing data	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							MODERATE RESOLUTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; BOREAL FOREST; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; SENSED IMAGERY; UNITED-STATES; CARBON STOCKS; NORTH-AMERICA; CANADA; EQUATIONS	Uncertainties in the estimation of tree biomass carbon storage across large areas pose challenges for the study of forest carbon cycling at regional and global scales. In this study, we attempted to estimate the present aboveground biomass (AGB) in Alberta, Canada, by taking advantage of a spatially explicit data set derived from a combination of forest inventory data from 1968 plots and spaceborne light detection and ranging (lidar) canopy height data. Ten climatic variables, together with elevation, were used for model development and assessment. Four approaches, including spatial interpolation, non-spatial and spatial regression models, and decision-tree-based modeling with random forests algorithm (a machine-learning technique), were compared to find the "best" estimates. We found that the random forests approach provided the best accuracy for biomass estimates. Non-spatial and spatial regression models gave estimates similar to random forests, while spatial interpolation greatly overestimated the biomass storage. Using random forests, the total AGB stock in Alberta forests was estimated to be 2.26 x 10(9) Mg (megagram), with an average AGB density of 56.30 +/- 35.94 Mg ha(-1). At the species level, three major tree species, lodgepole pine, trembling aspen and white spruce, stocked about 1.39 x 10(9) Mg biomass, accounting for nearly 62% of total estimated AGB. Spatial distribution of biomass varied with natural regions, land cover types, and species. Furthermore, the relative importance of predictor variables on determining biomass distribution varied with species. This study showed that the combination of ground-based inventory data, spaceborne lidar data, land cover classification, and climatic and environmental variables was an efficient way to estimate the quantity, distribution and variation of forest biomass carbon stocks across large regions.

Therefore, all cases showing signs of hydronephrosis undergo further invasive studies, like diuretic renogram, in order to assess the actual renal function. Under the hypothesis that renal morphology is correlated with renal function, a new ultrasound based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tool for pediatric hydronephrosis is presented. From 2D ultrasound, a novel set of morphological features of the renal collecting systems and the parenchyma, is automatically extracted using image analysis techniques. From the original set of features, including size, geometric and curvature descriptors, a subset of ten features are selected as predictive variables, combining a feature selection technique and area under the curve filtering. Using the washout half time (T-1/2) as indicative of renal obstruction, two groups are defined. Those cases whose T1/2 is above 30 minutes are considered to be severe, while the rest would be in the safety zone, where diuretic renography could be avoided. Two different classification techniques are evaluated (logistic regression, and support vector machines). Adjusting the probability decision thresholds to operate at the point of maximum sensitivity, i.e., preventing any severe case be misclassified, specificities of 53%, and 75% are achieved, for the logistic regression and the support vector machine classifier, respectively. The proposed CAD system allows to establish a link between non-invasive non-ionizing imaging techniques and renal function, limiting the need for invasive and ionizing diuretic renography.

Abdominal Lymphadenopathy Detection using Random Forest	MEDICAL IMAGING 2014: COMPUTER-AIDED DIAGNOSIS	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Medical Imaging - Computer-Aided Diagnosis	FEB 18-20, 2014	San Diego, CA	SPIE, Modus Med Devices Inc, XIFIN, Inc, Ventana Med Syst Inc, Intrace Med		lymphadenopathy; lymph nodes; computed tomography; computer-aided detection; machine learning; random forest; support vector machines	LYMPH-NODES; RECOGNITION; EXTRACTION	We propose a new method for detecting abdominal lymphadenopathy by utilizing a random forest statistical classifier to create voxel-level lymph node predictions, i.e. initial detection of enlarged lymph nodes. The framework permits the combination of multiple statistical lymph node descriptors and appropriate feature selection in order to improve lesion detection beyond traditional enhancement filters. We show that Hessian blobness measurements alone are inadequate for detecting lymph nodes in the abdominal cavity. Of the features tested here, intensity proved to be the most important predictor for lymph node classification. For initial detection, candidate lesions were extracted from the 3D prediction map generated by random forest. Statistical features describing intensity distribution, shape, and texture were calculated from each enlarged lymph node candidate. In the last step, a support vector machine (SVM) was trained and tested based on the calculated features from candidates and labels determined by two experienced radiologists. The computer-aided detection (CAD) system was tested on a dataset containing 30 patients with 119 enlarged lymph nodes. Our method achieved an AUC of 0.762+/-0.022 and a sensitivity of 79.8% with 15 false positives suggesting it can aid radiologists in finding enlarged lymph nodes.

This is especially challenging because bone marrow tissue has the same intensity profile as the muscle surrounding the bone. Thus simple methods such as thresholding or adaptive k-means fail to accurately segment vertebrae. While several other algorithms such as level sets may be used for segmentation any algorithm that is clinically deployable has to work in under a few seconds. To address these dual challenges we present here, a new algorithm based on the geodesic distance transform that is capable of segmenting the spinal vertebrae in under one second. To achieve this we extend the theory of the geodesic distance transforms proposed in(1) to incorporate high level anatomical knowledge through adaptive weighting of image gradients. Such knowledge may be provided by the user directly or may be automatically generated by another algorithm. We incorporate information 'learnt' using a previously published machine learning algorithm(2) to segment the L1 to L5 vertebrae. While we present a particular application here, the adaptive geodesic transform is a generic concept which can be applied to segmentation of other organs as well.

Biochemical recurrence, which is characterized by a rise in serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) of at least 2 ng/mL above the nadir PSA, is associated with increased risk of metastasis and prostate cancer related mortality. Currently, risk of biochemical recurrence is predicted by the Kattan nomogram, which incorporates several clinical factors to predict the probability of recurrence free survival following radiation therapy (but has limited prediction accuracy). Semantic attributes on T2w MRI, such as the presence of extracapsular extension and seminal vesicle invasion and surrogate measurements of tumor size, have also been shown to be predictive of biochemical recurrence risk. While the correlation between biochemical recurrence and factors like tumor stage, Gleason grade, and extracapsular spread are well documented, it is less clear how to predict biochemical recurrence in the absence of extracapsular spread and for small tumors fully contained in the capsule. Computer extracted texture features, which quantitatively describe tumor micro architecture and morphology on MRI, have been shown to provide clues about a tumor's aggressiveness. However, while computer extracted features have been employed for predicting cancer presence and grade, they have not been evaluated in the context of predicting risk of biochemical recurrence. This work seeks to evaluate the role of computer extracted texture features in predicting risk of biochemical recurrence on a cohort of sixteen patients who underwent pre treatment 1.5 Tesla (T) T2w MRI. We extract a combination of first order statistical, gradient, co-occurrence, and Gabor wavelet features from T2w MRI. To identify which of these T2w MRI texture features are potential independent prognostic markers of PSA failure, we implement a partial least squares (PLS) method to embed the data in a low dimensional space and then use the variable importance in projections (VIP) method to quantify the contributions of individual features to classification on the PLS embedding. In spite of the poor resolution of the 1.5 T MRI data, we are able to identify three Gabor wavelet features that, in conjunction with a logistic regression classifier, yield an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 for predicting the probability of biochemical recurrence following radiation therapy. In comparison to both the Kattan nomogram and semantic MRI attributes, the ability of these three computer extracted features to predict biochemical recurrence risk is demonstrated.

The time course of the DCE images provides measures of the contrast agent uptake kinetics. Also, using pharmacokinetic modelling, one can extract parameters from the DCE-MR images that characterize the tumor vascularization and can be used to detect cancer. A requirement for calculating the pharmacokinetic DCE parameters is estimating the Arterial Input Function (AIF). One needs an accurate segmentation of the cross section of the external femoral artery to obtain the AIF. In this work we report a semi-automatic method for segmentation of the cross section of the femoral artery, using circular Hough transform, in the sequence of DCE images. We also report a machine-learning framework to combine pharmacokinetic parameters with the model-free contrast agent uptake kinetic parameters extracted from the DCE time course into a nine-dimensional feature vector. This combination of features is used with random forest and with support vector machine classification for cancer detection. The MR data is obtained from patients prior to radical prostatectomy. After the surgery, wholemount histopathology analysis is performed and registered to the DCE-MR images as the diagnostic reference. We show that the use of a combination of pharmacokinetic parameters and the model-free empirical parameters extracted from the time course of DCE results in improved cancer detection compared to the use of each group of features separately. We also validate the proposed method for calculation of AIF based on comparison with the manual method.

Unfortunately, the efficacy of such CAD systems is limited since they rely on correct automatic lesions detection and localization, and on robustness of features computed based on the detected areas. In this paper we propose a new approach to boost the performance of a Machine Learning based CAD system, by combining visual and clinical data from patient files. We compute a set of visual features from breast ultrasound images, and construct the textual descriptor of patients by extracting relevant keywords from patients' clinical data files. We then use the Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) framework to train SVM based classifier to discriminate between benign and malignant cases. We investigate different types of data fusion methods, namely, early, late, and intermediate (MKL-based) fusion. Our database consists of 408 patient cases, each containing US images, textual description of complaints and symptoms filled by physicians, and confirmed diagnoses. We show experimentally that the proposed MKL-based approach is superior to other classification methods. Even though the clinical data is very sparse and noisy, its MKL-based fusion with visual features yields significant improvement of the classification accuracy, as compared to the image features only based classifier.

K-SVD is an iterative dimensionality reduction method that optimally reduces the initial feature space by updating the dictionary columns jointly with the sparse representation coefficients. Therefore, by using K-SVD, we not only provide sparse representation of the features and condense the information in a few coefficients but also we reduce the dimensionality. The extracted K-SVD features are evaluated by a machine learning algorithm including a logistic regression classifier for the task of classifying high versus low breast cancer recurrence risk as determined by a validated gene expression assay. The features are evaluated using ROC curve analysis and leave one-out cross validation for different sparse representation and dimensionality reduction numbers. Optimal sparse representation is obtained when the number of dictionary elements is 4 (K=4) and maximum non-zero coefficients is 2 (L=2). We compare K-SVD with ANOVA based feature selection for the same prognostic features. The ROC results show that the AUC of the K-SVD based (K=4, L=2), the ANOVA based, and the original features (i.e., no dimensionality reduction) are 0.78, 0.71. and 0.68, respectively. From the results, it can be inferred that by using sparse representation of the originally extracted multi-parametric, high-dimensional data, we can condense the information on a few coefficients with the highest predictive value. In addition, the dimensionality reduction introduced by K-SVD can prevent models from over-fitting.

However, annotation of anatomic landmarks is desirable, as it yields additional anatomic and functional information. Moreover, landmark detection might help to further improve accuracy during ASM segmentation. We present an extension of surface-based 3D Active Shape Models incorporating isolated non-surface landmarks. Positions of isolated and surface landmarks are modeled conjoint within a point distribution model (PDM). Isolated landmark appearance is described by a set of haar-like features, supporting local landmark detection on the PDM estimates using a kNN-Classifier. Landmark detection was evaluated in a leave-one-out cross validation on a reference dataset comprising 45 CT volumes of the human liver after shape space projection. Depending on the anatomical landmark to be detected, our experiments have shown in about 1/4 up to more than 1/2 of all test cases a significant improvement in detection accuracy compared to the position estimates delivered by the PDM. Our results encourage further research with regard to the combination of shape priors and machine learning for landmark detection within the Active Shape Model Framework.

We are developing computer-vision methods for automated detection of NCPs in cCTA. A data set of 62 cCTA scans with 87 NCPs was collected retrospectively from patient files. Multiscale coronary vessel enhancement and rolling balloon tracking were first applied to each cCTA volume to extract the coronary artery trees. Each extracted vessel was reformatted to a straightened volume composed of cCTA slices perpendicular to the vessel centerline. A topological soft-gradient (TSG) detection method was developed to prescreen for both positive and negative remodeling candidates by analyzing the 2D topological features of the radial gradient field surface along the vessel wall. A quantitative luminal analysis was newly designed for feature extraction and false positive (FP) reduction. We extracted 9 geometric features and 6 gray-level features, to quantify the differences between NCPs and FPs. The gray-level features included 4 features to measure local statistical characteristics and 2 asymmetry features to measure the asymmetric spatial location of gray-level density along the vessel centerline. The geometric features included a radius differential feature and 8 features extracted from two transformed volumes: the volumetric shape indexing and the gradient direction mapping volumes. With a machine learning algorithm and feature selection method, useful features were selected and combined into an NCP likelihood measure to differentiate TPs from FPs. With the NCP likelihood measure as a decision variable in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the area under the curve achieved a value of 0.85 +/- 0.01, indicating that the luminal analysis is effective in reducing FPs for NCP detection.

We present a system using a forest of extremely randomized trees to automatically identify and quantify CAC in routinely acquired cardiac non-contrast enhanced CT. Candidate lesions the system could not label with high certainty were automatically identified and presented to an expert who could relabel them to achieve high scoring accuracy with minimal effort. The study included 200 consecutive non-contrast enhanced ECG-triggered cardiac CTs (120 kV, 55 mAs, 3 mm section thickness). Expert CAC annotations made as part of the clinical routine served as the reference standard. CAC candidates were extracted by thresholding (130 HU) and 3-D connected component analysis. They were described by shape, intensity and spatial features calculated using multi-atlas segmentation of coronary artery centerlines from ten CTA scans. CAC was identified using a randomized decision tree ensemble classifier in a ten-fold stratified cross-validation experiment and quantified in Agatston and volume scores for each patient. After classification, candidates with posterior probability indicating uncertain labeling were selected for further assessment by an expert. Images with metal implants were excluded. In the remaining 164 images, Spearman's rho between automatic and reference scores was 0.94 for both Agatston and volume scores. On average 1.8 candidate lesions per scan were subsequently presented to an expert. After correction, Spearman's rho was 0.98. We have described a system for automatic CAC scoring in cardiac CT images which is able to effectively select difficult examinations for further refinement by an expert.

As a result, large troves of data are being gathered and stored daily that may be used as clinical training sets in hospitals. While numerous machine learning (ML) algorithms have been implemented for Alzheimer's disease classification, their outputs are usually difficult to interpret in the clinical setting. Here, we propose a simple method of rapid diagnostic classification for the clinic using Support Vector Machines (SVM)(1) and easy to obtain geometrical measurements that, together with a cortical and sub-cortical brain parcellation, create a robust framework capable of automatic diagnosis with high accuracy. On a significantly large imaging dataset consisting of over 800 subjects taken from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, classification-success indexes of up to 99.2% are reached with a single measurement.

The proposed approach combines object localization, a probabilistic atlas, and 3D GrabCut techniques to achieve automatic and quick segmentation. The proposed method first detects a tight 3D bounding box that contains the target organ region in CT images and then estimates the prior of each pixel inside the bounding box belonging to the organ region or background based on a dynamically generated probabilistic atlas. Finally, the target organ region is separated from the background by using an improved 3D GrabCut algorithm. A machine-learning method is used to train a detector to localize the 3D bounding box of the target organ using template matching on a selected feature space. A content-based image retrieval method is used for online generation of a patient-specific probabilistic atlas for the target organ based on a database. A 3D GrabCut algorithm is used for final organ segmentation by iteratively estimating the CT number distributions of the target organ and backgrounds using a graph-cuts algorithm. We applied this approach to localize and segment twelve major organ and tissue regions independently based on a database that includes 1300 torso CT scans. In our experiments, we randomly selected numerous CT scans and manually input nine principal types of inner organ regions for performance evaluation. Preliminary results showed the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed approach for addressing automatic organ segmentation issues on CT images.

We demonstrate that this approach is feasible for significantly larger, structurally complex molecules, taking the natural product Archazolid A, a potent inhibitor of vacuolar-type ATPase, from the myxobacterium Archangium gephyra as an example. Our model estimates energies of new conformations by exploiting information from previous calculations via Gaussian process regression. Predictive variance is used to assess whether a conformation is in the interpolation region, allowing a controlled trade-off between prediction accuracy and computational speed-up. For energies of relaxed conformations at the density functional level of theory (implicit solvent, DFT/BLYP-disp3/def2-TZVP), mean absolute errors of less than 1 kcal/mol were achieved. The study demonstrates that predictive machine learning models can be developed for structurally complex, pharmaceutically relevant compounds, potentially enabling considerable speed-ups in simulations of larger molecular structures.

Sophisticated learning algorithms may be used to select the relevant process state variables out of a massive search space and can be used to build more efficient and robust fault detection models. In this study, we present a recently proposed swarm intelligence-based hybrid intelligent water drop (IWD) optimization algorithm in combination with support vector machines and an information gain heuristic for selecting a subset of relevant fault indicators. In the process, we demonstrate the successful application and effectiveness of this swarm intelligence-based method to variable selection and fault identification. Moreover, performance testing on standard machine learning benchmark datasets also indicates its viability as a strong candidate for complex classification and prediction tasks.

In particular, mental states classification, decoding brain activation, and finding the variable of interest by using fMRI data was one of the focused research topics among machine learning researchers during past few decades. In the context of classification, algorithms have biases, i.e., an algorithm perform better in one dataset may become worse in other dataset. To overcome the limitations of individual techniques, hybridization or fusion of these machine learning techniques proposed in recent years which have shown promising result and open up new direction of research. This paper reviews the hybrid machine learning techniques used in cognitive classification by giving proper attention to their performance and limitations. As a result, various domain specific techniques are identified in addition to many open research challenges.

A large amount of Internet traffic is of e-mail data. A lot of companies and organizations use e-mail services to promote their products and services. It is very important to filter out spam messages to save users' precious time. Machine learning methods plays vital role in spam detection, but it faces the problem of high dimensionality of feature vector. So feature reduction methods are very important for better results from machine learning approaches. In this paper, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and Information Gain (IG) methods are used for feature reduction. Further, e-mail messages are classified as spam or ham message using seven different classifiers namely Naive Baysian, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, J48, Bagging, and JRip. Comparative study of these techniques is done on TREC 2007 Spam e-mail Corpus with different feature size.

Images of the same individual taken at different times, different places, different postures, different lighting, may sometimes exhibit more variability due to the aforementioned factors, than images of different individuals due to gender, age, and individual variations. So a robust recognition system is implemented to recognize an individual even from a large amount of databases within a few minutes. So in order to handle this problem we have used SVM for face recognition. Using this technique an accurate face recognition system is developed and tested and the performance found is efficient. The procedure is tested on ORL face database.

While many studies have identified neural correlates of kinematics or applied advanced machine learning algorithms to improve decoding performance, relatively less attention has been paid to optimal design of decoding models. For generating continuous movements from neural activity, design of decoding models should address how to incorporate movement dynamics into models and how to select a model given specific BCI objectives. Considering nonlinear and independent speed characteristics, we propose a hybrid Kalman filter to decode the hand direction and speed independently. We also investigate changes in performance of different decoding models (the linear and Kalman filters) when they predict reaching movements only or predict both reach and rest. Our offline study on human magnetoencephalography (MEG) during point-to-point arm movements shows that the performance of the linear filter or the Kalman filter is affected by including resting states for training and predicting movements. However, the hybrid Kalman filter consistently outperforms others regardless of movement states. The results demonstrate that better design of decoding models is achieved by incorporating movement dynamics into modeling or selecting a model according to decoding objectives.

A data-driven black-box-type framework is proposed, where the discrete model is parametrized with adaptive regression techniques and the output of the continuous counterpart (e.g., output of partial differential equations) is coupled to the discrete system of interest in the form of a fixed exogenous time series of external factors. Data availability represents a significant issue for this type of coupled discrete-continuous model, and it is shown that missing information/observations can be incorporated in the model via a nonstationary and nonhomogeneous formulation. An unbiased estimator for the discrete model dynamics in presence of unobserved external impacts is derived and used to construct a data-based nonstationary and nonhomogeneous parameter estimator based on an appropriately regularized spatiotemporal clustering algorithm. One-step and long-term predictions are considered, and a new Bayesian approach to discrete data assimilation of hidden information is proposed. To illustrate our method, we apply it to synthetic data sets and compare it with standard techniques of the machine-learning community (such as maximum-likelihood estimation, artificial neural networks and support vector machines).

However, in many cases the interpretation of these images is heavily dependent on the subjective assessment of the imaging data by clinicians. Over the last decades image registration has transformed the clinical workflow in many areas of medical imaging. At the same time, advances in machine learning have transformed many of the classical problems in computer vision into machine learning problems. This paper will focus on the convergence of image registration and machine learning techniques for the discovery and quantification of clinically useful information from medical images. We will illustrate this with several examples such as the segmentation of neuro-anatomical structures, the discovery of biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases and the quantification of temporal changes such as atrophy in Alzheimer's disease.

This is an area with many different possible applications, giving users a simpler and more natural way to communicate with robots/systems interfaces, without the need for extra devices. So, the primary goal of gesture recognition research is to create systems, which can identify specific human gestures and use them to convey information or for device control. This work intends to study and implement a solution, generic enough, able to interpret user commands, composed of a set of dynamic and static gestures, and use those solutions to build an application able to work in a real-time human-computer interaction systems. The proposed solution is composed of two modules controlled by a FSM (Finite State Machine): a real time hand tracking and feature extraction system, supported by a SVM (Support Vector Machine) model for static hand posture classification and a set of HMMs (Hidden Markov Models) for dynamic single stroke hand gesture recognition. The experimental results showed that the system works very reliably, being able to recognize the set of defined commands in real-time. The SVM model for hand posture classification, trained with the selected hand features, achieved an accuracy of 99,2%. The proposed solution as the advantage of being computationally simple to train and use, and at the same time generic enough, allowing its application in any robot/system command interface.

A major difficulty in dealing with TB is that the causative bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, can persist in host tissue for a long period of time even after treatment. Mycobacterial persistence has become a central research focus for developing next-generation TB drugs. Latest genomic technology has enabled a high-throughput approach for identifying potential TB drug targets. Each gene product can be screened for its uniqueness to the TB metabolism, host-pathogen discrimination, essentiality for survival, and potential for chemical binding, among other properties. However, the exhaustive search for useful drug targets over the entire genome would not be productive as expected in practice. On the other hand, the problem can be formulated as pattern recognition or inductive learning and tackled with rule-based or statistically based learning algorithms. Here we review the perspective that combines machine learning and genomics for drug discovery in tuberculosis.

As the interest of recommendation systems grows, we started working on the movie recommendation systems. Most research efforts in the fields of movie recommendation system are focusing on discovering the most relevant features from users, or seeking out users who share same tastes as that of the given user as well as recommending the movies according to the liking of these sought users or seeking out users who share a connection with other people (friends, classmates, colleagues, etc.) and make recommendations based on those related people's tastes. However, little research has focused on recommending movies based on the movie's features. In this paper, we present a novel idea that applies machine learning techniques to construct a cluster for the movie by implementing a distance matrix based on the movie features and then make movie recommendation in real time. We implement some different clustering methods and evaluate their performance in a real movie forum website owned by one of our authors. This idea can also be used in other types of recommendation systems such as music, news, and articles.

A framework was designed to combine these two techniques. In the framework, 20-m hyperspectral imagery collected from Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer was first merged with 1-m Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quads using a proposed pixel/feature-level fusion strategy. The fused data set was then classified with an ensemble approach based on two contemporary machine learning algorithms: Random Forest and Support Vector Machine. The framework was applied to classify nine vegetation types in a portion of the coastal Everglades. An object-based vegetation map was produced with an overall accuracy of 90% and Kappa value of 0.86. Per-class classification accuracy varied from 61% for identifying buttonwood forest to 100% for identifying red mangrove scrub. The result shows that the framework is promising for automated vegetation mapping in the Everglades.

Robust Automated Lymph Node Segmentation with Random Forests	MEDICAL IMAGING 2014: IMAGE PROCESSING	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Medical Imaging - Image Processing	FEB 16-18, 2014	San Diego, CA	SPIE, Modus Med Devices Inc, XIFIN, Inc, Ventana Med Syst Inc, Intrace Med		Lymph node detection; machine learning; random forest	CT IMAGES; RECOGNITION; TREES	Enlarged lymph nodes may indicate the presence of illness. Therefore, identification and measurement of lymph nodes provide essential biomarkers for diagnosing disease. Accurate automatic detection and measurement of lymph nodes can assist radiologists for better repeatability and quality assurance, but is challenging as well because lymph nodes are often very small and have a highly variable shape. In this paper, we propose to tackle this problem via supervised statistical learning-based robust voxel labeling, specifically the random forest algorithm. Random forest employs an ensemble of decision trees that are trained on labeled multi-class data to recognize the data features and is adopted to handle low-level image features sampled and extracted from 3D medical scans. Here we exploit three types of image features (intensity, order-1 contrast and order-2 contrast) and evaluate their effectiveness in random forest feature selection setting. The trained forest can then be applied to unseen data by voxel scanning via sliding windows (11x11x11), to assign the class label and class-conditional probability to each unlabeled voxel at the center of window. Voxels from the manually annotated lymph nodes in a CT volume are treated as positive class; background non-lymph node voxels as negatives. We show that the random forest algorithm can be adapted and perform the voxel labeling task accurately and efficiently. The experimental results are very promising, with AUCs (area under curve) of the training and validation ROC (receiver operating characteristic) of 0.972 and 0.959, respectively. The visualized voxel labeling results also confirm the validity.

Cancer Therapy Prognosis Using Quantitative Ultrasound Spectroscopy and a Kernel-Based Metric	MEDICAL IMAGING 2014: IMAGE PROCESSING	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Medical Imaging - Image Processing	FEB 16-18, 2014	San Diego, CA	SPIE, Modus Med Devices Inc, XIFIN, Inc, Ventana Med Syst Inc, Intrace Med		Personalized medicine; quantitative ultrasound; Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC); machine learning; supervised learning; kernel methods; computer aided prognosis; cancer response monitoring	IN-VITRO; APOPTOSIS; RADIOTHERAPY; VIVO	In this study, a kernel-based metric based on the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) is proposed in a computer-aided-prognosis system to monitor cancer therapy effects. In order to induce tumour cell death, sarcoma xenograft tumour-bearing mice were injected with microbubbles followed by ultrasound and X-ray radiation therapy successively as a new anti-vascular treatment. High frequency (central frequency 30 MHz) ultrasound imaging was performed before and at different times after treatment and using spectroscopy, quantitative ultrasound (QUS) parametric maps were derived from the radiofrequency (RF) signals The intensity histogram of midband fit parametric maps was computed to represent the pre- and post-treatment images. Subsequently, the HSIC-based metric between pre- and post-treatment samples were computed for each animal as a measure of distance between the two distributions. The HSIC-based metrics computes the distance between two distributions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), meaning that by using a kernel, the input vectors are non-linearly mapped into a different, possibly high dimensional feature space. Computing the population means in this new space, enhanced group separability (compared to, e.g., Euclidean distance in the original feature space) is ideally obtained. The pre- and post-treatment parametric maps for each animal were thus represented by a dissimilarity measure, in which a high value of this metric indicated more treatment effect on the animal It was shown in this research that this metric has a high correlation with cell death and if it was used in supervised learning, a high accuracy classification was obtained using a k-nearest-neighbor (k-NN) classifier.

Due to the rare occurrence of crystals, images must be manually inspected, a laborious process. We develop a solution incorporating a regularized, logistic regression model for automatically evaluating these images. Standard image features, such as shape context, Gabor filters and Fourier transforms, are first extracted to represent the heterogeneous appearance of our images. Then the proposed solution utilizes Elastic Net to select relevant features. Its L-1-regularization mitigates the effects of our large dataset, and its L-2-regularization ensures proper operation when the feature number exceeds the sample number. A two-tier cascade classifier based on naive Bayes and random forest algorithms categorized the images. In order to validate the proposed method, we experimentally compare it with naive Bayes, linear discriminant analysis, random forest, and their two-tier cascade classifiers, by 10-fold cross validation. Our experimental results demonstrate a 3-category accuracy of 74%, outperforming other models. In addition, Elastic Net better reduces the false negatives responsible for a high, domain specific risk. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply Elastic Net to classifying protein crystallization images. Performance measured on a large pharmaceutical dataset also fared well in comparison with those presented in the previous studies, while the reduction of the high-risk false negatives is promising.

Unsupervised Non Linear Dimensionality Reduction Machine Learning methods applied to Multiparametric MRI in cerebral ischemia: Preliminary results	MEDICAL IMAGING 2014: IMAGE PROCESSING	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Medical Imaging - Image Processing	FEB 16-18, 2014	San Diego, CA	SPIE, Modus Med Devices Inc, XIFIN, Inc, Ventana Med Syst Inc, Intrace Med		Diffusion weighted imaging; DWI; Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC); Perfusion; stroke; cerebral ischemia; Non Linear Dimensionality; machine learning; computer aided diagnosis (CAD); segmentation	TISSUE-PLASMINOGEN-ACTIVATOR; ACUTE STROKE; DIFFUSION; MODEL	The evaluation and treatment of acute cerebral ischemia requires a technique that can determine the total area of tissue at risk for infarction using diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. Typical MRI data sets consist of Ti- and T2-weighted imaging (T1WI, T2WI) along with advanced MRI parameters of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) methods. Each of these parameters has distinct radiological-pathological meaning. For example, DWI interrogates the movement of water in the tissue and PWI gives an estimate of the blood flow, both are critical measures during the evolution of stroke. In order to integrate these data and give an estimate of the tissue at risk or damaged; we have developed advanced machine learning methods based on unsupervised non-linear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) techniques. NLDR methods are a class of algorithms that uses mathematically defined manifolds for statistical sampling of multidimensional classes to generate a discrimination rule of guaranteed statistical accuracy and they can generate a two- or three-dimensional map, which represents the prominent structures of the data and provides an embedded image of meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. In this manuscript, we develop NLDR methods on high dimensional MRI data sets of preclinical animals and clinical patients with stroke. On analyzing the performance of these methods, we observed that there was a high of similarity between multiparametric embedded images from NLDR methods and the ADC map and perfusion map. It was also observed that embedded scattergram of abnormal (infarcted or at risk) tissue can be visualized and provides a mechanism for automatic methods to delineate potential stroke volumes and early tissue at risk.

To this end we combine a predictive multi-task machine learning method(1) with novel MR-based multivariate morphometric surface map of the hippocampus(2) to predict future cognitive scores of patients. Previous work by Zhou et al.(1) has shown that a multi-task learning framework that performs prediction of all future time points (or tasks) simultaneously can be used to encode both sparsity as well as temporal smoothness. They showed that this can be used in predicting cognitive outcomes of Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects based on Free Surfer-based baseline MRI features, MMSE score demographic information and ApoE status. Whilst volumetric information may hold generalized information on brain status, we hypothesized that hippocampus specific information may be more useful in predictive modeling of AD. To this end, we applied Shi et al.(2)s recently developed multivariate tensor-based (mTBM) parametric surface analysis method to extract features from the hippocampal surface. We show that by combining the power of the multi-task framework with the sensitivity of mTBM features of the hippocampus surface, we are able to improve significantly improve predictive performance of ADAS cognitive scores 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months from baseline.

Visual field abnormalities (decreased visual sensitivity on psychophysical tests) are the primary means of glaucoma diagnosis. One form of visual field testing is Frequency Doubling Technology (FDT) that tests sensitivity at 52 points within the visual field. Like other psychophysical tests used in clinical practice, FDT results yield specific patterns of defect indicative of the disease. We used Gaussian Mixture Model with Expectation Maximization (GEM), (EM is used to estimate the model parameters) to automatically separate FDT data into clusters of normal and abnormal eyes. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to decompose each cluster into different axes (patterns). FDT measurements were obtained from 1,190 eyes with normal FDT results and 786 eyes with abnormal (i.e., glaucomatous) FDT results, recruited from a university-based, longitudinal, multi-center, clinical study on glaucoma. The GEM input was the 52-point FDT threshold sensitivities for all eyes. The optimal GEM model separated the FDT fields into 3 clusters. Cluster 1 contained 94% normal fields (94% specificity) and clusters 2 and 3 combined, contained 77% abnormal fields (77% sensitivity). For clusters 1, 2 and 3 the optimal number of PCA-identified axes were 2, 2 and 5, respectively. GEM with PCA successfully separated FDT fields from healthy and glaucoma eyes and identified familiar glaucomatous patterns of loss.

Identification of Ligand Binding Pockets on Nuclear Receptors by Machine Learning Methods	PROTEIN AND PEPTIDE LETTERS			English	Article						fpocket; ligand binding pockets; nuclear hormone receptors; nucleRDB; shell-wise features; support vector machines	HORMONE-RECEPTORS; DRUG DISCOVERY; SITES; PREDICTION; SUPERFAMILY; CLASSIFICATION; CONSERVATION; PROTEINS; CAVITIES; DESIGN	Nuclear receptors constitute a super family of protein hormones that serve as transcription factors. They typically reside in the cytosol and, after ligand binding, migrate to the nucleus to exert their biological action. Ligands are lipophilic, small molecules including retinoids, steroids, thyroxine, and vitamin D. Nuclear receptors being important regulators of gene expression, constitute 13% of proteins targeted by various drugs. Thus it becomes important to identify the ligand binding pockets on these proteins. Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was built to identify nuclear receptor ligand binding pockets. Positive dataset consisted of the ligand binding pockets of known nuclear receptor-ligand complex structures. Negative dataset consisted of ligand binding pockets of proteins other than nuclear receptors and non-ligand binding pockets of nuclear receptors. SVM model yielded a 10 fold cross-validation accuracy of 96% using linear kernel. Also, it is helpful to find out the class of nuclear receptor in order to design a "class-specific" drug. In case of the multiclass nuclear receptor dataset comprising of nuclear receptors belonging to three different classes, SVM model for classification yielded an average 10-fold cross validation accuracy of 92 % for this dataset. SVM algorithm identifies and classifies nuclear receptor binding pockets with excellent accuracy. Top ranked features indicate the hydrophobic nature of ligand binding pocket of nuclear receptors. Conserved Leucine and phenylalanine residues form a distinguishing feature of these binding pockets. Along-with identification of NR binding pockets, important top ranked features are listed which would be useful in screening of possible drug molecules with NRs as molecular targets.

J	Aaronson, S; Drucker, A				Aaronson, Scott; Drucker, Andrew			A FULL CHARACTERIZATION OF QUANTUM ADVICE	SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article						quantum computation; learning; compression; advice; local Hamiltonians; nonuniform computation; boosting; Karp-Lipton theorem	SCALE-SENSITIVE DIMENSIONS; UNIFORM-CONVERGENCE; LEARNABILITY; ORACLES; STATES; NP	We prove the following surprising result: given any quantum state rho on n qubits, there exists a local Hamiltonian H on poly(n) qubits (e.g., a sum of two-qubit interactions), such that any ground state of H can be used to simulate rho on all quantum circuits of fixed polynomial size. In terms of complexity classes, this implies that BQP/qpoly subset of QMA/poly, which supersedes the previous result of Aaronson that BQP/qpoly subset of PP/poly. Indeed, we can exactly characterize quantum advice as equivalent in power to untrusted quantum advice combined with trusted classical advice. Proving our main result requires combining a large number of previous tools-including a result of Alon et al. on learning of real-valued concept classes, a result of Aaronson on the learnability of quantum states, and a result of Aharonov and Regev on "QMA(+) super-verifiers"-and also creating some new ones. The main new tool is a so-called majority-certificates lemma, which is closely related to boosting in machine learning, and which seems likely to find independent applications. In its simplest version, this lemma says the following. Given any set S of Boolean functions on n variables, any function f is an element of S can be expressed as the pointwise majority of m = O(n) functions f(1), ... , f(m) is an element of S, such that each f(i) is the unique function in S compatible with O(log |S|) input/output constraints.

We consider the case when the unknown function is convex and a metamodel is used as a surrogate objective function. Often the data are non-i.i.d. and include an observable state variable, such as applicant information in a loan rate decision problem. State information is difficult to incorporate into convex models. We propose a new semiconvex regression method that is used to produce a convex metamodel in the presence of a state variable. We show consistency for this method. We demonstrate its effectiveness for metamodeling on a set of synthetic inventory management problems and a large real-life auto loan dataset.

After reformulating the LP as a convex nonsmooth problem, we apply Nesterov's primal-dual excessive-gap technique. The iteration complexity of the excessive-gap technique depends on a parameter theta that arises because we must bound the primal feasible set, which is originally unbounded. We also dynamically update theta to speed up the convergence. The application of our algorithm to two machine learning problems demonstrates several advantages of the excessive-gap technique over existing methods.

However, these methods often rely on prior knowledge. Specifically, they learn the image scene as part of a training dataset. For this reason, when the sampling equipment or scene is changed, monocular visual 3D scene recognition may fail. To cope with this problem, a new method of unsupervised learning for monocular visual 3D scene recognition is here proposed. First, the image is made using superpixel segmentation based on the CIELAB color space values L, a, and b and on the coordinate values x and y of pixels, forming a superpixel image with a specific density. Second, a spectral clustering algorithm based on the superpixels' color characteristics and neighboring relationships was used to reduce the dimensions of the superpixel image. Third, the fuzzy distribution density functions representing sky, ground, and facade are multiplied with the segment pixels, where the expectations of these segments are obtained. A preliminary classification of sky, ground, and facade is generated in this way. Fourth, the most accurate classification images of sky, ground, and facade were extracted through the tier-1 wavelet sampling and Manhattan direction feature. Finally, a depth perception map is generated based on the pinhole imaging model and the linear perspective information of ground surface. Here, 400 images of Make3D Image data from the Cornell University website were used to test the algorithm. The experimental results showed that this unsupervised learning method provides a more effective monocular visual 3D scene recognition model than other methods.

However, the commonly sparse meteorological networks in complex terrains are unable to provide the information needed for many applications. Therefore, downscaling local precipitation is necessary. To this end, a new machine learning method, LASSO algorithm (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), is used to address the disparity between ERA-Interim forecast precipitation data (0.25 degrees grid) and point-scale meteorological observations. LASSO was tested and validated against other three downscaling methods, local intensity scaling (LOCI), quantile-mapping (QM), and stepwise regression (Stepwise) at 50 meteorological stations, located in the high mountainous region of the central Alps. The downscaling procedure is implemented in two steps. Firstly, the dry or wet days are classified and the precipitation amounts conditional on the occurrence of wet days are modeled subsequently. Compared to other three downscaling methods, LASSO shows the best performances in precipitation occurrence and precipitation amount prediction on average. Furthermore, LASSO could reduce the error for certain sites, where no improvement could be seen when LOCI and QM were used. This study proves that LASSO is a reasonable alternative to other statistical methods with respect to the downscaling of precipitation data.

J	Twala, B				Twala, Bhekisipho			REASONING WITH NOISY SOFTWARE EFFORT DATA	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							DECISION TREES	Constructing an accurate effort prediction model remains a challenge in software engineering. Recently, machine learning classifiers have been used successfully for software effort evaluation decisions. However, the development and validation of these classifiers (and other modes) require good quality data. Most research on machine learning assumes that the attributes of training and tests instances are not only completely specified but are also free from noise. Real-world industrial datasets, however, suffer from corruption or noise that is not always known. However, blindly applying such machine learning techniques to noisy software effort evaluation data may fail to make very good or perfect predictions, resulting in poor decisions and ineffective project management. This article investigates the effect of noisy domains on the learning accuracy of eight machine learning and statistical pattern recognition algorithms. We further derive solutions for the problem of noisy domains in software effort prediction from a probabilistic point of view. Our experimental results show that our algorithm can improve prediction for software effort corrupted by noise with reasonable and much improved accuracy.

The red-green-blue (RGB) wound images grabbed by normal digital camera were first transformed into HSI (hue, saturation, and intensity) color space and subsequently the "S" component of HSI color channels was selected as it provided higher contrast. Wound areas from 6 different types of CW were segmented from whole images using fuzzy divergence based thresholding by minimizing edge ambiguity. A set of color and textural features describing granulation, necrotic, and slough tissues in the segmented wound area were extracted using various mathematical techniques. Finally, statistical learning algorithms, namely, Bayesian classification and support vector machine (SVM), were trained and tested for wound tissue classification in different CW images. The performance of the wound area segmentation protocol was further validated by ground truth images labeled by clinical experts. It was observed that SVM with 3rd order polynomial kernel provided the highest accuracies, that is, 86.94%, 90.47%, and 75.53%, for classifying granulation, slough, and necrotic tissues, respectively. The proposed automated tissue classification technique achieved the highest overall accuracy, that is, 87.61%, with highest kappa statistic value (0.793).

Functional annotation of these proteins is important to bridge gap between sequence information and functional characterization. As experimental approaches for characterizing the functional class of an enzyme are expensive and time consuming, computational prediction methods are an effective alternative. Various approaches like homology-based function transfer and machine learning methods have been utilized for in silico enzyme functional classifications in terms of Enzyme Commission number (EC number) for a protein. Different types of features have been used in various machine learning techniques and each has its own advantages and limitations. The critical evaluation of performance measure in terms of predictive ability of these methods is necessary. Here, a systematic review on the various approaches used by different research groups, their utility and inference is presented.

Credit scoring models have been widely used to facilitate the process of credit assessing. In this paper, an application of the locally linear model tree algorithm (LOLIMOT) was experimented to evaluate the superiority of its performance to predict the customer's credit status. The algorithm is improved with an aim of adjustment by credit scoring domain by means of data fusion and feature selection techniques. Two real world credit data sets - Australian and German - from UCI machine learning database were selected to demonstrate the performance of our new classifier.

Advances in medical imaging and medical image analysis have provided a means to generate and extract valuable neuroimaging information. Automatic classification techniques provide tools to analyze this information and observe inherent disease-related patterns in the data. In particular, these classifiers have been used to discriminate AD patients from healthy control subjects and to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD. In this paper, recent studies are reviewed that have used machine learning and multivariate analysis in the field of AD research. The main focus is on studies that used structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but studies that included positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in addition to MRI are also considered. A wide variety of materials and methods has been employed in different studies, resulting in a range of different outcomes. Influential factors such as classifiers, feature extraction algorithms, feature selection methods, validation approaches, and cohort properties are reviewed, as well as key MRI-based and multi-modal based studies.

Prediction of Surfactant Retention in Porous Media: A Robust Modeling Approach	JOURNAL OF DISPERSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Least square support vector machine; Leverage approach; porous media; surfactant retention	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; MINIMUM MISCIBILITY PRESSURE; RESERVOIR OIL; INTELLIGENT MODEL; CRUDE-OIL; ADSORPTION; VISCOSITY; NETWORKS; SORPTION; SYSTEMS	Demands for hydrocarbon production have been increasing in recent decades. As a tertiary production processes, chemical flooding is one of the effective technologies to increase oil recovery of hydrocarbon reservoirs. Retention of surfactants is one of the key parameters affecting the performance and economy of a chemical flooding process. The main parameters contribute to surfactant retention are mineralogy of rock, surfactant structure, pH, salinity, acidity of the oil, microemulsion viscosity, co-solvent concentration, and mobility. Despite various theoretical studies carried out so far, a comprehensive and reliable predictive model for surfactant retention is still found lacking. In this communication, a mathematical method based on machine learning approach, namely, least square support vector machine modeling is evolved for this purpose. To this end, the model was developed and tested using experimental dynamic surfactant retention data over a wide range of conditions. The results show that the developed model provides predictions in good agreement with experimental retention data. Moreover, it is shown that the developed model is capable of simulating the actual physical trend of surfactant retention versus three most important input parameters: total acid number of oil, pH, and mobility ratio. Finally, for detection of the probable doubtful retention data, outlier diagnosis was performed on the whole data set.

For this reason, it is important to make efficient use of the available energy discriminators in order to achieve an optimized material contrast at a radiation dose as low as possible. Unfortunately, the complexity of evaluating every possible combination of energy thresholds, given a fixed number of counters, rapidly increases with the resolution at which this search is performed, and makes brute-force approaches to this problem infeasible. In this work, we introduce methods from machine learning, in particular sparse regression, to perform a feature selection to determine optimal combinations of energy thresholds. We will demonstrate how methods enforcing row-sparsity on a linear regression's coefficient matrix can be applied to the multiple response problem in spectroscopic CT, i.e. the case in which a single set of energy thresholds is sought to simultaneously retrieve concentrations pertaining to a multitude of materials in an optimal way. These methods are applied to CT images experimentally obtained with a Medipix3RX detector operated in charge summing mode and with a CdTe sensor at a pixel pitch of 110 mu m. We show that the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso), generalized to the multiple response case, chooses four out of 20 possible threshold positions that allow discriminating PMMA, iodine and gadolinium in a contrast agent phantom at a higher accuracy than with equally spaced thresholds. Finally, we illustrate why it might be unwise to use a higher number of energy thresholds than absolutely necessary.

There are fundamental capability and accuracy limits in all the metrology techniques that are detrimental to the success of advanced IC nodes. Reference or physical CD metrology is provided by CD-AFM, and TEM while workhorse metrology is provided by CD-SEM, Scatterometry, Model Based Infrared Reflectrometry (MBIR). Precision alone is not sufficient moving forward. No single technique is sufficient to ensure the required accuracy of patterning. The accuracy of CD-AFM is similar to 1 nm and precision in TEM is poor due to limited statistics. CD-SEM, scatterometry and MBIR need to be calibrated by reference measurements for ensuring the accuracy of patterned CDs and patterning models. There is a dire need of measurement with < 0.5 nm accuracy and the industry currently does not have that capability with inline measurments. Being aware of the capability gaps for various metrology techniques, we have employed data processing techniques and predictive data analytics, along with patterning simulation and metrology models, and data integration techniques to selected applications demonstrating the potential solution and practicality of such an approach to enhance CD metrology accuracy. Data from multiple metrology techniques has been analyzed in multiple ways to extract information with associated uncertainties and integrated to extract the useful and more accurate CD and profile information of the structures. This paper presents the optimization of scatterometry and MBIR model calibration and feasibility to extrapolate not only in design and process space but from one process step to a previous process step. Well calibrated scatterometry model or patterning simulation model can be used to accurately extrapolate and interpolate in the design and process space for lithography patterning where AFM is not capable to accurately measure sub-40 nm trenches. Uncertainty associated with extrapolation can be large and needs to be minimized. We have made use of measurements from CD-SEM and CD-AFM, along with the patterning and scatterometry simulation models to estimate the uncertainty associated with extrapolation and methods to reduce it. First time we have reported the application of machine learning (Artificial Neural Networks) to the resist shrinkage systematic phenomenon to accurately predict the preshrink CD based on supervised learning using the CD-AFM data. The study lays out various basic concepts, approaches and protocols of multiple source data processing and integration for hybrid metrology approach. Impacts of this study include more accurate metrology, patterning models and better process controls for advanced IC nodes.

Next to improvements in the immersion scanner platform, enhancements in the overlay optimization and process control are needed to enable these low overlay numbers. Whereas conventional overlay control methods address wafer and lot variation autonomously with wafer pre exposure alignment metrology and post exposure overlay metrology, we see a need to reduce these variations by correlating more of the TWINSCAN system's sensor data directly to the post exposure YieldStar metrology in time. In this paper we will present the results of a study on applying a real time control algorithm based on machine learning technology. Machine learning methods use context and TWINSCAN system sensor data paired with post exposure YieldStar metrology to recognize generic behavior and train the control system to anticipate on this generic behavior. Specific for this study, the data concerns immersion scanner context, sensor data and on-wafer measured overlay data. By making the link between the scanner data and the wafer data we are able to establish a real time relationship. The result is an inline controller that accounts for small changes in scanner hardware performance in time while picking up subtle lot to lot and wafer to wafer deviations introduced by wafer processing.

So the attributes defmed in the past could not deal with this change sufficiently. This paper extracted attributes from all possible forged header fields to expand the feature sets, then used the rough set theory to classify the sample sets. Experiment validated more attributes including in feature sets may lead to greater performance, in terms of higher recall and precision, lower fake recognition than other algorithms.

We begin with a survey of the drug information domain and classify the drug related queries into a set of predefined classes. Our system uses several natural language processing tools coupled with machine learning classification techniques to process drug information related queries. We focus on developing a natural language interface allowing the user to be flexible in phrasing their queries and attain an accuracy of 81% in classifying the drug related questions. We conclude that it is feasible and cheap to deploy such a system to encourage the practice of evidence based medicine.

DECISION-TREE LEARNING ALGORITHM	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						decision-tree learning; information gain; over-fitting		Decision-tree learning is one of the most successful learning algorithms, due to its various attractive features: simplicity, comprehensibility, no parameters, and being able to handle mixed-type data. In decision-tree learning, a decision tree is induced from a set of labelled training instances represented by a tuple of attribute values and a class label. Because of the vast search space, decision-tree learning is typically a greedy, top-down and recursive process starting with the entire training data and an empty tree. Since large data sets with millions of instances and thousands of attributes are not rare today, the interest in developing fast decision-tree learning algorithms is rapidly growing. The major reason is that decision-tree learning works comparably well on large data sets, in addition to its general attractive features. Decision-tree learning is a supervised machine learning method for discrete-valued functions. ID3 searches a complete hypothesis space of decision trees top-down without back-tracking. It uses a preference bias for smaller trees with higher. information gain close to the root, to search a hypothesis space. Also, it is possible to avoid over-fitting and to handle missing attribute values.

Many research studies have been carried out in order to produce an accurate and effective emotion recognition system. Emotion recognition methods can be classified into different categories along a number of dimensions: speech emotion recognition vs. facial emotion recognition; machine learning method vs. statistic method. Facial expression method can also be classified based on input data to a sequence video or static image. This report focuses on different types of human facial expressions, like different types of sad, happiness, and surprise moments. This is carried out by trying to extract unique facial expression feature among emotions using Fuzzy and the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) approach.

Early detection is the only solution that allows treatment before the cancer spreads to other parts of the body. Diagnosis of breast cancer at the early stage is a very difficult task as the cancerous tumors are embedded in normal breast tissue structures. Aiming to model breast cancer prediction system, we propose a novel machine learning approach based on wavelets. The new model, called wavelet neural network (WNN), extends the existing artificial neural network by considering wavelets as activation function. The texture information in the area of interest provides important diagnostic information about the underlying biological process for the benign or malignant tissue and therefore should be included in the analysis. By exploiting the texture information, a computerized detection algorithm is developed that are not only accurate but also computationally efficient for cancer detection in mammograms. The texture features are fed to the WNN classifier for classification of malignant/benign cancers. An experimental analysis performed on a set of 216 mammograms from screening centres has shown the effectiveness of the proposed method.	[Dheeba, V.; Singh, J.

A content - based image retrieval (CBIR) system has been developed as an efficient image retrieval tool, whereby the user can provide their query to the system to allow it to retrieve the user's desired image from the image database. However, the traditional relevance feedback of CBIR has some limitations that will decrease the performance of the CBIR system, such as the imbalance of training-set problem, classification problem, limited information from user problem, and insufficient training set problem. Therefore, in this study, we proposed an enhanced relevance-feedback method to support the user query based on the representative image selection and weight ranking of the images retrieved. The support vector machine (SVM) has been used to support the learning process to reduce the semantic gap between the user and the CBIR system. From these experiments, the proposed learning method has enabled users to improve their search results based on the performance of CBIR system. In addition, the experiments also proved that by solving the imbalance training set issue, the performance of CBIR could be improved.	[Pavani, Palepu; Prabha, T.

Trip Purpose Identification from GPS Tracks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEMS; PERSONAL TRAVEL SURVEYS; INFORMATION	Travel surveys are increasingly taking advantage of GPS data, which offer precise route and time observations and a potentially reduced response burden. In these surveys, travel diaries are usually constructed automatically where research on the employed procedures has been focused on mode identification. The goal of the research reported here was to improve trip purpose identification. The analysis used random forests, a machine-learning approach that had been successfully applied to mode identification. The analysis was based on GPS tracks and accelerometer data collected by 156 participants who took part in a 1-week travel survey in Switzerland that was completed in 2012. The results show that random forests provide robust trip purpose classification. For ensemble runs, the share of correct predictions was between 80% and 85%. Different setups of the classifier were possible and sometimes required by the application context. The training set and its input variables (feature set) of the classifier were defined in various ways. Four relevant setups were tested for this study.

Due to the heterogeneity of the clinical samples, the list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) generated by the statistical methods or the machine learning algorithms often involves a number of false positive genes, which are not associated with the phenotypic differences between the compared clinical conditions, and subsequently impacts the reliability of the predictive models. In this study, we proposed a strategy, which combined the statistical algorithm with the gene-pathway bipartite networks, to generate the reliable lists of cancer-related DEGs and constructed the models by using support vector machine for predicting the prognosis of three types of cancers, namely, breast cancer, acute myeloma leukemia, and glioblastoma. Our results demonstrated that, combined with the gene-pathway bipartite networks, our proposed strategy can efficiently generate the reliable cancer-related DEG lists for constructing the predictive models. In addition, the model performance in the swap analysis was similar to that in the original analysis, indicating the robustness of the models in predicting the cancer outcomes.

New support vector machine-based method for microRNA target prediction	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						MicroRNA; Target-prediction; Support vector machine; Machine learning	MESSENGER-RNAS; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; DISCOVERY; DATABASE; GENES	MicroRNA (miRNA) plays important roles in cell differentiation, proliferation, growth, mobility, and apoptosis. An accurate list of precise target genes is necessary in order to fully understand the importance of miRNAs in animal development and disease. Several computational methods have been proposed for miRNA target-gene identification. However, these methods still have limitations with respect to their sensitivity and accuracy. Thus, we developed a new miRNA target-prediction method based on the support vector machine (SVM) model. The model supplies information of two binding sites (primary and secondary) for a radial basis function kernel as a similarity measure for SVM features. The information is categorized based on structural, thermodynamic, and sequence conservation. Using high-confidence datasets selected from public miRNA target databases, we obtained a human miRNA target SVM classifier model with high performance and provided an efficient tool for human miRNA target gene identification. Experiments have shown that our method is a reliable tool for miRNA target-gene prediction, and a successful application of an SVM classifier. Compared with other methods, the method proposed here improves the sensitivity and accuracy of miRNA prediction. Its performance can be further improved by providing more training examples.

Many loss functions have been proposed and applied to different classification problems. This paper proposes a new so called the smoothed 0-1 loss function, that could be considered as an approximation of the classical 0-1 loss function. Due to the non-convexity property of the proposed loss function, global optimization methods are required to solve the corresponding optimization problems. Together with the proposed loss function, we compare the performance of several existing loss functions in the classification of noisy data sets. In this comparison, different optimization problems are considered in regards to the convexity and smoothness of different loss functions. The experimental results show that the proposed smoothed 0-1 loss function works better on data sets with noisy labels, noisy features, and outliers.

Here we applied machine learning to detect expertise from the oculomotor behavior of novice and expert billiard players during free viewing of a filmed billiard match with no specific task, and in a dynamic trajectory prediction task involving ad-hoc, occluded billiard shots. We have adopted a ground framework for feature space fusion and a Bayesian sparse classifier, namely, a Relevance Vector Machine. By testing different combinations of simple oculomotor features (gaze shifts amplitude and direction, and fixation duration), we could classify on an individual basis which group - novice or expert - the observers belonged to with an accuracy of 82% and 87%, respectively for the match and the shots. These results provide evidence that, at least in the particular domain of billiard sport, a signature of expertise is hidden in very basic aspects of oculomotor behavior, and that expertise can be detected at the individual level both with ad-hoc testing conditions and under naturalistic conditions - and suitable data mining. Our procedure paves the way for the development of a test for the "expert's eye", and promotes the use of eye movements as an additional signal source in Brain-Computer-Interface (BCI) systems.

While it has been repeatedly pointed out that eye movements can be used to infer the internal states of humans, not many successes have been reported concerning image understanding. We investigate the possibility of image preference estimation based on a person's eye movements in a supervised manner in this paper. A dataset of eye movements is collected while the participants are viewing pairs of natural images, and it is used to train image preference label classifiers. The input feature is defined as a combination of various fixation and saccade event statistics, and the use of the random forest algorithm allows us to quantitatively assess how each of the statistics contributes to the classification task. We show that the gaze-based classifier had a higher level of accuracy than metadata-based baseline methods and a simple rule-based classifier throughout the experiments. We also present a quantitative comparison with image-based preference classifiers, and discuss the potential and limitations of the gaze-based preference estimator.

In this context, phase contrast CT imaging (PCI-CT) has recently emerged as a novel imaging technique that allows a direct examination of chondrocyte patterns and their correlation to osteoarthritis through visualization of cartilage soft tissue. This study investigates the use of topological and geometrical approaches for characterizing chondrocyte patterns in the radial zone of the knee cartilage matrix in the presence and absence of osteoarthritic damage. For this purpose, topological features derived from Minkowski Functionals and geometric features derived from the Scaling Index Method (SIM) were extracted from 842 regions of interest (ROI) annotated on PCI-CT images of healthy and osteoarthritic specimens of human patellar cartilage. The extracted features were then used in a machine learning task involving support vector regression to classify ROIs as healthy or osteoarthritic. Classification performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The best classification performance was observed with high-dimensional geometrical feature vectors derived from SIM (0.95 +/- 0.06) which outperformed all Minkowski Functionals (p < 0.001). These results suggest that such quantitative analysis of chondrocyte patterns in human patellar cartilage matrix involving SIM-derived geometrical features can distinguish between healthy and osteoarthritic tissue with high accuracy.

Recently, enhancement of lesion tissue through the use of contrast agents has been proposed for cone beam CT. This study investigates whether the use of such contrast agents improves the ability of texture features to differentiate lesion texture from healthy tissue on CBCT in an automated manner. For this purpose, 9 lesions were annotated by an experienced radiologist on both regular and contrast-enhanced CBCT images using two-dimensional (2D) square ROIs. These lesions were then segmented, and each pixel within the lesion ROI was assigned a label - lesion or non-lesion, based on the segmentation mask. On both sets of CBCT images, four three-dimensional (3D) Minkowski Functionals were used to characterize the local topology at each pixel. The resulting feature vectors were then used in a machine learning task involving support vector regression with a linear kernel (SVRlin) to classify each pixel as belonging to the lesion or non-lesion region of the ROI. Classification performance was assessed using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Minkowski Functionals derived from contrast-enhanced CBCT images were found to exhibit significantly better performance at distinguishing between lesion and non-lesion areas within the ROI when compared to those extracted from CBCT images without contrast enhancement (p < 0.05). Thus, contrast enhancement in CBCT can improve the ability of texture features to distinguish lesions from surrounding healthy tissue.

Extreme learning machines for predicting operation disruption events in railway systems	SAFETY, RELIABILITY AND RISK ANALYSIS: BEYOND THE HORIZON			English	Proceedings Paper	22nd Annual Conference on European Safety and Reliability (ESREL)	SEP 29-OCT 02, 2013	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	Netherlands Org Appl Sci Res, Delft Univ Technol, Dutch Soc Risk Management & Reliabil Anal, European Safety & Reliabil Assoc			NEURAL-NETWORKS; REGRESSION; DIAGNOSIS	European passenger rail systems are massively interconnected and operate with very high frequency. The impacts of component failures on these types of systems can significantly affect technical and operational reliability. Therefore, many advanced railway systems and components are equipped with monitoring and diagnostic tools to improve reliability and reduce maintenance expenditures. Approaches to predict component failure and remaining useful life are usually based on continuously measured data. The use of event data is limited, especially for predicting failures in railway systems. In this paper, we apply Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) to predict the occurrence of railway operation disruptions based on discrete-event data. ELM exhibit a good generalization ability, are computationally very efficient and do not require tuning of network parameters. For exemplification purposes, a case study with real data is considered concerning failures that cause undemanded service brake application of railway vehicles. While other machine learning techniques, such as multilayer perceptrons and feedforward neural networks with learning based on genetic algorithms, were not able to extract patterns in the diagnostic event data, the proposed approach was capable of predicting 98% of the operation disruption events correctly.

Traditionally, interactions between humans and machines like computers do not exhibit any emotional exchanges. If we could build any system that is intelligent enough to interact with humans that involves emotions, that is, it can detect user emotions and change its behaviour accordingly, then using machines could be more effective and friendly. Many approaches have been taken to detect user emotions. Affective computing is the field that detects user emotion in a particular moment. Our approach in this paper is to detect user emotions by analysing the keyboard typing patterns of the user and the type of texts (words, sentences) typed by them. This combined analysis gives us a promising result showing a substantial number of emotional states detected from user input. Several machine learning algorithms were used to analyse keystroke timing attributes and text pattern. We have chosen keystroke because it is the cheapest and most available medium to interact with computers. We have considered seven emotional classes for classifying the emotional states. For text pattern analysis, we have used vector space model with Jaccard similarity method to classify free-text input. Our combined approach showed above 80% accuracies in identifying emotions.

LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						reference production; alignment; computational modelling; machine learning	REFERENTIAL OVERSPECIFICATION; CONCEPTUAL PACTS; EXPRESSIONS; GENERATION; COMMUNICATION; CONVERSATION	Human speakers generally find it easy to refer to entities in such a way that their hearers can determine who or what is being talked about. In an attempt to model this behaviour, researchers in computational linguistics have explored the development of algorithms that operate in a deliberate manner, choosing attributes of an intended referent on the basis of their ability to distinguish that entity from its distractors. Psycholinguistic models, on the other hand, suggest that speakers align their referring expressions at several linguistic levels with those used previously in the discourse. This implies more subconscious reuse, and less deliberate choice, than is found in computational models of referring expression generation. Which of these is a more accurate characterisation of what people do? Do both models capture aspects of human referring behaviour? In this paper, we use a machine-learning approach to explore these questions. In our first study, we examine how underlying factors of the psycholinguistic and the computational models impact on the production of reference in dialogue. In our second study, we explore the psychological validity of another crucial aspect of some computational approaches to reference production: their serial dependency characteristic, whereby attributes are included in a referring expression based on which other attributes have already been chosen. The results of both studies suggest that the assumptions underpinning computational algorithms do not play a large role in people's referring behaviour.

Structure-activity relationship study of trifluoromethylketone inhibitors of insect juvenile hormone esterase: Comparison of several classification methods	SAR AND QSAR IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						juvenile hormone esterase; trifluoromethylketones; SAR models; machine learning methods; inhibitory activity	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; ANDROGEN RECEPTOR LIGANDS; FEATURE-SELECTION METHODS; QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE; VARIABLE SELECTION; QSAR MODELS; COMPOUND CLASSIFICATION; TETRAHYMENA-PYRIFORMIS; CANCER CLASSIFICATION; PROPERTY RELATIONSHIP	Juvenile hormone esterase (JHE) plays a key role in the development and metamorphosis of holometabolous insects. Its inhibitors could possibly be targeted for insect control. Conversely, JHE may also be involved in endocrine disruption by xenobiotics, resulting in detrimental effects in beneficial insects. There is therefore a need to know the structural characteristics of the molecules able to monitor JHE activity, and to develop SAR and QSAR studies to estimate their effectiveness. For a large diverse population of 181 trifluoromethylketones (TFKs) - the most potent JHE inhibitors known to date - we recently proposed a binary classification (active/inactive) using a support vector machine and Codessa structural descriptors. We have now examined, using the same data set and with the same descriptors, the applicability and performance of five other machine learning approaches. These have been shown able to handle high dimensional data (with descriptors possibly irrelevant or redundant) and to cope with complex mechanisms, but without delivering explicit directly exploitable models. Splitting the data into five batches (training set 80%, test set 20%) and carrying out leave-one-out cross-validation, led to good results of comparable performance, consistent with our previous support vector classifier (SVC) results. Accuracy was greater than 0.80 for all approaches. A reduced set of 15 descriptors common to all the investigated approaches showed good predictive ability (confirmed using a three-layer perceptron) and gives some clues regarding a mechanistic interpretation.

Radicalization under deep uncertainty: a multi-model exploration of activism, extremism, and terrorism	SYSTEM DYNAMICS REVIEW			English	Article							ROBUST STRATEGIES; DENSITY-FUNCTION; POLICY ANALYSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MODEL; SYSTEMS; COMPLEX; PROBABILITY; DYNAMICS	Many security-related phenomena are both dynamically complex and deeply uncertain. The consequences of failing to address these two characteristics may be severe in the security domain. Radicalization, possibly culminating in terrorism, is a phenomenon with these characteristics. In this article, we use an exploratory multi-model approach to generate and explore plausible dynamics of radicalization under deep uncertainty. Three system dynamics simulation models related to phenomenon-based radicalization are introduced and used to generate ensembles of plausible dynamics. These ensembles are analyzed with machine-learning techniques to design adaptive policies that are robust under deep uncertainty. Finally, counter-intuitive findings-related to radicalization as well as to model-based analysis of radicalization-like phenomena-are presented. These findings would not have been discovered without a multi-models approach, broad exploration of the uncertainty space, and the use of advanced machine learning techniques.

Studies support the necessity of screening and interventions for prediabetes, which could result in serious complications and diabetes. This study aimed at developing an intelligence-based screening model for prediabetes. Data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) were used, excluding subjects with diabetes. The KNHANES 2010 data (n = 4685) were used for training and internal validation, while data from KNHANES 2011 (n = 4566) were used for external validation. We developed two models to screen for prediabetes using an artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) and performed a systematic evaluation of the models using internal and external validation. We compared the performance of our models with that of a screening score model based on logistic regression analysis for prediabetes that had been developed previously. The SVM model showed the areas under the curve of 0.731 in the external datasets, which is higher than those of the ANN model (0.729) and the screening score model (0.712), respectively. The prescreening methods developed in this study performed better than the screening score model that had been developed previously and may be more effective method for prediabetes screening.

J	Zhang, C; Zhang, J				Zhang, Chen; Zhang, Jie			Analysing Chinese citizens' intentions of outbound travel: a machine learning approach	CURRENT ISSUES IN TOURISM			English	Article						travel intention; outbound travel; machine learning; twice-learning; personal characteristic	NEURAL-NETWORK; PERSONAL VALUES; HONG-KONG; DEMAND; DIAGNOSIS; ENSEMBLE; MARKET; ROLES; MODEL; C4.5	Due to the tremendous expansion of Chinese outbound travel market, it is of great significance to identify the characteristics of potential Chinese outbound tourists so as to develop targeted marketing strategies. As both extrinsic and intrinsic characteristics of individuals are important in influencing their decision-making process, this study explores potential Chinese outbound tourists from these two aspects. Demographic and psychographic factors, as the proxy of extrinsic and intrinsic characteristics, respectively, are incorporated into this study to construct the relationship between tourists' characteristics and their intentions of outbound travel. An advanced machine learning approach, called twice-learning, is employed for modelling in this study. As an intelligent data analysis tool, this method is able to construct models that can provide insight into the ground-truth relationships hidden beneath the data in an essentially comprehensible way, without being limited by the typical assumptions held by the traditional data analysis methods. By applying this method, the important personal factors that influence Chinese citizens' intentions of outbound travel are detected, and the typical groups of potential Chinese outbound tourists are characterised. The findings would be beneficial for destination marketers to develop marketing strategies on positioning and advertising which are tailored to potential Chinese outbound travel market.

Policies are designed so that the performance of the system is optimal and throughput of the Grid setup is maximum and also cater to the needs of all the users who are consumers of the Grid environment. Memory is one of the key resourcing parameter and policies involving the memory usage of a job are designed so that memory starvation is prevented. Machine Learning algorithms which finds its applications in diverse fields are used to predict the memory requirements of a job which in turn leads to better utilization of the Grid infrastructure. Two different datasets are considered in this paper from diverse fields and the memory requirements were predicted. Promising results were obtained from the proposed algorithm and this can be used in any field for identifying the memory requirement of jobs at a project/user level.

More recently, these techniques have begun to show promise for the diagnosis and treatment of depression, both as aids to conventional methods and as methods in their own right. In this review, we describe recent neuroimaging findings in the field that might aid diagnosis and improve treatment accuracy. Overall, major depression is associated with numerous structural and functional differences in neural systems involved in emotion processing and mood regulation. Furthermore, several studies have shown that the structure and function of these systems is changed by pharmacological and psychological treatments of the condition and that these changes in candidate brain regions might predict clinical response. More recently, "machine learning" methods have used neuroimaging data to categorize individual patients according to their diagnostic status and predict treatment response. Despite being mostly limited to group-level comparisons at present, with the introduction of new methods and more naturalistic studies, neuroimaging has the potential to become part of the clinical armamentarium and may improve diagnostic accuracy and inform treatment choice at the patient level.

Very often, students work as teams to effectively accomplish course related tasks. However, due to lack of face to face interaction, it becomes difficult for MOOC students to collaborate. Additionally, the instructor also faces challenges in manually organizing students into teams because students flock to these MOOCs in huge numbers. Thus, the proposed research is aimed at developing a robust methodology for dynamic team formation in MOOCs, the theoretical framework for which is grounded at the confluence of organizational team theory, social network analysis and machine learning. A prerequisite for such an undertaking is that we understand the fact that, each and every informal tie established among students offers the opportunities to influence and be influenced. Therefore, we aim to extract value from the inherent connectedness of students in the MOOC. These connections carry with them radical implications for the way students understand each other in the networked learning community. Our approach will enable course instructors to automatically group students in teams that have fairly balanced social connections with their peers, well defined in terms of appropriately selected qualitative and quantitative network metrics.

Reduction of Semantic Gap Using Relevance Feedback Technique in Image Retrieval System	2014 FIFTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE APPLICATIONS OF DIGITAL INFORMATION AND WEB TECHNOLOGIES (ICADIWT)			English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on the Applications of Digital Information and Web Technologies (ICADIWT)	FEB 17-19, 2014	Chennai, INDIA	IEEE Commun Soc, PRIST Univ		Content based image retrieval; Relevance feedback; Precision; Recall	HIGH-LEVEL SEMANTICS	This paper proposes a novel content based image retrieval system incorporating the relevance feedback technique. In order to improve the retrieval accuracy of content based image retrieval systems, research focus has been shifted in reducing the semantic gap between visual features and the human semantics. The five major techniques available to narrow down the semantic gap are: (a) Object ontology (b) machine learning (c) relevance feedback (d) semantic template (e) web image retrieval. This paper focuses on the relevance feedback technique by which semantic gap can be reduced in order to improve the retrieval efficiency of the system. The major challenges facing the existing relevance feedback technique is the number of iterations and the execution time. The proposed algorithm provides a better solution to overcome both these challenges. The efficiency of the system can be calculated based on precision and recall.

This work implements a management flow for the abstraction of real world objects and virtual composition of those objects to provide IoT services. We also present a real world knowledge model that aggregates constraints defining a situation, which is then used to detect and anticipate future potential situations. It is implemented based on reasoning and machine learning mechanisms. This work showcases a prototype implementation of the architectural framework in a smart home scenario, targeting two functionalities: actuation and automation based on the imposed constraints and thereby responding to situations and also adapting to the user preferences. It thus provides a productive integration of heterogeneous devices, IoT platforms, and cognitive technologies to improve the services provided to the user.

Recent developments have made use of biologically inspired architectures, such as the Convolutional Neural Network, and the Deep Belief Network. We test the hypothesis that generative models such as the Deep Belief Network should perform better on occluded object recognition tasks than purely discriminative models such as Convolutional Neural Networks. We find that the data does not support this hypothesis when the generative models are run in a partially discriminative manner. We also find that the use of Gaussian visible units in a Deep Belief Network trained on occluded image data allows it to also learn to classify non-occluded images.(1)	[Chu, Joseph Lin; Krzyzak, Adam] Concordia Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Software Engn, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada	Chu, JL (reprint author), Concordia Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Software Engn, 1455 Maisonneuve Blvd West, Montreal, PQ H3G 1M8, Canada.	jo_chu@encs.concordia.ca; krzyzak@cs.concordia.ca						24	0	1	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743		978-3-319-07172-5; 978-3-319-07173-2	LECT NOTES ARTIF INT			2014	8467						34	46				13	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence	Computer Science	BB1OW	WOS:000341246000004

Conventional approach in text categorization systems is to represent documents as a "Bag of Words" (BOW) in which the relations between the words and their positions are lost. Additionally, traditional machine learning algorithms assume that instances, in our case documents, are independent and identically distributed. This approach simplifies the underlying models, but nevertheless it ignores the semantic connections between words as well as the semantic relations between documents that stem from the words. In this study, we improve the semantic knowledge capture capability of a previous work in [1], which is called chi-Sim Algorithm and use this method in the SVM as a semantic kernel. The proposed approach is evaluated on different benchmark textual datasets. Experiment results show that classification performance improves over the well-known traditional kernels used in the SVM such as the linear kernel (one of the state-of-the-art algorithms for text classification system), the polynomial kernel and the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel.

Each hyperrectangle represents single decision rule which conditions are hyperplanes containing hyperrectangle sides. In order to simplify the obtained model less important conditions are removed from the rule and then less important variables are also eliminated from the hyperplane equations. The algorithm was applied for real and artificial datasets.

In Bag of Visual Words framework, image is represented as vector of frequencies of Visual Words, typically of length from hundreds to thousands elements. A dictionary of Visual Words is produced from image keypoints detected by SIFT algorithm and quantized into words by k-means clustering. In the paper we use Mutual Information and Information Gain as methods for selecting these words that are the most important for efficient image classification. There are four novel methods, which expand use of classic Mutual Information and Information Gain in line with our previous feature selection methods. We consider two basic selection strategies: one-vs-all and one-vs-one, as well as multi class and multi attribute value problems. The experimental session we have conducted has shown a positive effect of our modification, when applied to image classification by Support Vector Machines. The results showed that visual word selection based on modified Mutual Information in most cases wins over methods based on Information Gain.

In particular, we consider the coding approach which converts a multi-class problem to several binary classification problems by mapping the binary labeled space into several partitioned binary labeled spaces through binary channel codes. By modeling this learning problem as a communication channel, these codes are meant to have error correcting capabilities and thus performance improvement in classification. However, we argue that conventional coding schemes designed for communication systems do not treat the space partitioning problem optimally, because they are heedless of the partitioning behavior of underlying binary classifiers. We discuss an approach which is optimal in terms of space partitioning and advise it as a powerful tool towards multi-class classification. We then review the LDA, a known method for multi-class case and compare its performance with the proposed method. We run the experiments on synthetic data in several scenarios and then on a real database for face identification.

The high quality seeds are given input to K-Means as the set of initial seeds to produce the final clusters. DenClust uses a density based approach for initial seed selection. It calculates the density of each record, where the density of a record is the number of records that have the minimum distances with the record. This approach is expected to produce high quality initial seeds for K-Means resulting in high quality clusters from a dataset. The performance of DenClust is compared with five (5) existing techniques namely CRUDAW, AGCUK, Simple K-means (SK), Basic Farthest Point Heuristic (BFPH) and New Farthest Point Heuristic (NFPH) in terms of three (3) external cluster evaluation criteria namely F-Measure, Entropy, Purity and two (2) internal cluster evaluation criteria namely Xie-Beni Index (XB) and Sum of Square Error (SSE). We use three (3) natural datasets that we obtain from the UCI machine learning repository. DenClust performs better than all five existing techniques in terms of all five evaluation criteria for all three datasets used in this study.

On the other hand, analyzing the attention governments allocate to different policy areas is important since it helps us to understand the extent to which the limited resources of governments are focused or diversified. We classify the previous studies on government agenda representation into Individual and Total approaches. While the Individual approaches focuse on one policy area at a time and traces the extent of attention each one received, the Total approaches propose aggregated data analysis methods to represent the government agenda considering all the policy areas. In this paper, we use hierarchical clustering to propose an intermediate type of policy analysis called "Policy Cluster" which considers the relationships among different policy areas. For the evaluation, we built and analysed the Policy Clusters for the Irish government covering the time period 1945 to 2012. Comparing to previous Individual and Total approaches, the proposed intermediate approach reduces the search space in which we are looking for informative patterns by 57% and the results of our analysis represent the political agenda in more modular and informative way, taking into account intra-relationships of policies.

In large scale network structures like social networks, graph theoretical link and annotation prediction algorithms are usually not applicable due to graph isomorphism problem, unless some form of approximation is applied. We propose a non-graph theoretical alternative to link and annotation prediction in large networks by flattening network structures into feature vectors. We extract repeated sub-network pattern vectors for the nodes of a network, and utilize traditional machine learning algorithms for estimating missing or unknown annotations and links in the network. Our main contribution is a novel method for extracting features from large scale networks, and evaluation of the benefit each extraction method provides. We applied our methodology for suggesting new Twitter friends. In our experiments, we observed 11-27% improvement in prediction accuracy when compared to the simple methodology of suggesting friends of friends.

The leaf area index (LAI) is an important variable for the characterization of in-field variability. However, ground LAI measurement over large fields is time consuming. Our objective was to compare machine learning methods to describe in-field potato LAI patterns from airborne multispectral images. To this aim, intensive ground LAI measurements (97 quadrats) were collected in a potato field at the time of maximum LAI. Two methods were trained as function approximation, validated, and compared to linear regressions. The two methods were (i) multiple-layer perceptron (MLP) and (ii) least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM). After model training, spatial interpolation was performed and results were compared to a map interpolated with measured values. Both methods performed well using near-infrared and red channels as inputs. However, the gain in performance in validation over the best linear model was higher for the LS-SVM (29%) compared to the MLP (15%), and the kappa coefficient of agreement was higher during classification. The LS-SVM with 2 inputs (near-infrared and red) was therefore retained as the final model.	[Fortin, J.

Studying lethal phenotypes will provide important information about the function of the gene product and direct gene therapy. Traditionally, essential genes have been identified through single-gene knockout experiments, transposon mutagenesis, or antisense RNA inhibitions. However, experimental methods are expensive, labor-intensive, and time-consuming. In addition, such experiments are not always possible as the vast majority of microorganisms are unculturable. Computational methods for genome-scale essential gene prediction, aided bythe explosion of genome-scale data provided by high-throughput technologies in recent years, provide an alternative way to study essential genes. Constraint-based modeling and machine learning technology have been used in this area and achieved promising results. Information such as protein sequence, network topology, gene expression data and other features have been used to predict essential genes. In this article, we will review recent bioinformatics progresses in the prediction of gene essentiality, including databases, computational methods, the most commonly used features, machine learning classifier comparisons, and feature selection. Finally, we will discuss the challenges and future directions of the field.

Protein subcellular localization prediction based on machine learning is timely and has generated great interest in the field of bioinformatics. This paper reviews the research status of this problem in recent years from the following four aspects: protein dataset construction, features extraction of protein sequence, machine learning algorithms, and web server construction.

This data from multiple sensors in continuous stream becomes voluminous. For knowledge discovery like extraction of context, from these datasets, standard machine learning algorithms or their variations are used as classifier. Most classification schemes require the input data to be discretized. The focus of this paper is to study merits of some popular discretization methods when applied on noisy sensor logs. Representative methods from supervised and unsupervised discretization, like binning, clustering and entropy minimization are evaluated with context extraction. Interestingly, unlike common perception, for discretization of sensor data, supervised algorithms do not have a clear edge over unsupervised.

The presence of a filler material in the composite (such as carbon black or silica) causes its mechanical properties to differ in several ways when compared to pure rubber such as viscoelastic behaviour (the Payne effect), increased tensile strength and improved wear resistance. To fully understand these properties, it is necessary to characterise how the filler material is organised on the nanoscale. Using composite materials representative of those found in tyres, this work illustrates the use of electron tomography and machine learning methods as tools to describe the percolation behaviour of the filler; in this case, we focus on the largest proportion of particles absorbed into one single object as a function of particle spacing.

This problem consists of finding a tensor of minimum n-rank subject to linear equality constraints and has been proposed in many areas such as data mining, machine learning and computer vision. In this paper, operator splitting technique and convex relaxation technique are adapted to transform the low n-rank tensor recovery problem into a convex, unconstrained optimization problem, in which the objective function is the sum of a convex smooth function with Lipschitz continuous gradient and a convex function on a set of matrices. Furthermore, in order to solve the unconstrained nonsmooth convex optimization problem, an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm is proposed.

J	Khatib, T; Elmenreich, W				Khatib, Tamer; Elmenreich, Wilfried			An Improved Method for Sizing Standalone Photovoltaic Systems Using Generalized Regression Neural Network	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHOTOENERGY			English	Article							MODEL; ALGERIA	In this research an improved approach for sizing standalone PV system (SAPV) is presented. This work is an improved work developed previously by the authors. The previous work is based on the analytical method which faced some concerns regarding the difficulty of finding the model's coefficients. Therefore, the proposed approach in this research is based on a combination of an analytical method and a machine learning approach for a generalized artificial neural network (GRNN). The GRNN assists to predict the optimal size of a PV system using the geographical coordinates of the targeted site instead of using mathematical formulas. Employing the GRNN facilitates the use of a previously developed method by the authors and avoids some of its drawbacks. The approach has been tested using data from five Malaysian sites. According to the results, the proposed method can be efficiently used for SAPV sizing whereas the proposed GRNN based model predicts the sizing curves of the PV system accurately with a prediction error of 0.6%. Moreover, hourly meteorological and load demand data are used in this research in order to consider the uncertainty of the solar energy and the load demand.

The toxicity evaluation requires time consuming and expensive undertaking, leading to the deprivation of the methods employed for screening chemicals pointing towards the need to develop more efficient toxicity assessment systems. Computational approaches have reduced the time as well as the cost for evaluating the toxicity and kinetic behavior of any chemical. The accessibility of a large amount of data and the intense need of turning this data into useful information have attracted the attention towards data mining. Machine Learning, one of the powerful data mining techniques has evolved as the most effective and potent tool for exploring new insights on combinatorial relationships among various experimental data generated. The article accounts on some sophisticated machine learning algorithms like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-mean clustering and Self Organizing Maps (SOM) with some of the available tools used for classification, sorting and toxicological evaluation of data, clarifying, how data mining and machine learning interact cooperatively to facilitate knowledge discovery. Addressing the association of some commonly used expert systems, we briefly outline some real world applications to consider the crucial role of data set partitioning.

This type of problem arises in some interesting applications in machine learning. We propose a stochastic gradient descent algorithm for this class of optimization problems. When the non-smooth component has a particular structure, we propose a stochastic gradient descent algorithm by incorporating a smoothing method into our first algorithm. The proofs of the convergence rates of these two algorithms are given and we show the numerical performance of our algorithm by applying them to regularized linear regression and logistic regression problems with different sets of synthetic data.

J	Durillo, J; Fahringer, T				Durillo, Juan; Fahringer, Thomas			From single- to multi-objective auto-tuning of programs: Advantages and implications	SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING			English	Article						Program auto-tuning; single-objective optimization; multi-objective optimization	OPTIMIZATION; SUPPORT	Automatic tuning (auto-tuning) of software has emerged in recent years as a promising method that tries to automatically adapt the behaviour of a program to attain different performance objectives on a given computing system. This method is gaining momentum due to the increasing complexity of modern multicore-based hardware architectures. Many solutions to auto-tuning have been explored ranging from simple random search to more sophisticate methods like machine learning or evolutionary search. To this day, it is still unclear whether these approaches are general enough to encompass all the complexities of the problem (e. g. search space, parameters influencing the search space, input data sensitivity, etc.), or which approach is best suited for a given problem. Furthermore, the growing interest in auto-tuning a program for several objectives is increasing this confusion even further. The goal of this paper is to formally describe the problem addressed by auto-tuning programs and review existing solutions highlighting the advantages and drawbacks of different techniques for single-objective as well as multi-objective auto-tuning approaches.

However, they are still far from widespread production use due to lack of native support for auto-tuning in an ever changing and complex software and hardware stack, large and multi-dimensional optimization spaces, excessively long exploration times, and lack of unified mechanisms for preserving and sharing of optimization knowledge and research material. We present a possible collaborative approach to solve above problems using Collective Mind knowledge management system. In contrast with previous cTuning framework, this modular infrastructure allows to preserve and share through the Internet the whole auto-tuning setups with all related artifacts and their software and hardware dependencies besides just performance data. It also allows to gradually structure, systematize and describe all available research material including tools, benchmarks, data sets, search strategies and machine learning models. Researchers can take advantage of shared components and data with extensible meta-description to quickly and collaboratively validate and improve existing auto-tuning and benchmarking techniques or prototype new ones. The community can now gradually learn and improve complex behavior of all existing computer systems while exposing behavior anomalies or model mispredictions to an interdisciplinary community in a reproducible way for further analysis. We present several practical, collaborative and model-driven auto-tuning scenarios. We also decided to release all material at c-mind.org/repo to set up an example for a collaborative and reproducible research as well as our new publication model in computer engineering where experimental results are continuously shared and validated by the community.

Proposed solutions often incorporate machine-learning techniques with remedies that include delaying user notifications until an opportune moment or changing the intensity and/or mode of the notification (fewer rings, vibration mode). This paper describes a new machine-learning approach that aims to maintain the quality of mitigation under concept drift - unforeseen changes in context or the user's behaviour over time. We demonstrate our approach by developing an application for Android phones to mitigate disruptive phone calls (RingLearn). We report on a field trial of the application conducted over 2 months with 10 users and suggest that long-term mitigation can be practical with careful design that addresses concept drift.

The recognition of the user's activities and detection of falls is performed on a laptop using the raw sensors' data acquired through Bluetooth. The offline evaluation of the system's performance was conducted on a dataset containing a wide range of activities and different types of falls. The F-measure of the activity recognition and fall detection were 99% and 78%, respectively. Additionally, the system was evaluated at the EvAAL-2013 activity recognition competition and awarded the first place, achieving the score of 83.6%, which was for 14.2 percentage points better than the second-place system.

Most of the existing works have focused on simple forms of contexts derived directly from raw signals. High-level constructs and patterns have been largely neglected or remained under-explored in pervasive computing, mainly due to the growing complexity over time and the lack of efficient principal methods to extract them. Traditional parametric modeling approaches from machine learning find it difficult to discover new, unseen patterns and contexts arising from continuous growth of data streams due to its practice of training-then-prediction paradigm. In this work, we propose to apply Bayesian nonparametric models as a systematic and rigorous paradigm to continuously learn hidden patterns and contexts from raw social signals to provide basic building blocks for context-aware applications. Bayesian nonparametric models allow the model complexity to grow with data, fitting naturally to several problems encountered in pervasive computing. Under this framework, we use nonparametric prior distributions to model the data generative process, which helps towards learning the number of latent patterns automatically, adapting to changes in data and discovering never-seen-before patterns, contexts and activities. The proposed methods are agnostic to data types, however our work shall demonstrate to two types of signals: accelerometer activity data and Bluetooth proximal data.

We believe RL is an ideal approach since this task falls under the control-optimization problem where RL has yielded optimal results in previous work. The magnitude and scale of a DH system complexity incurs the curse of dimensionalities and model, hereby making RL a good choice since it provides a solution for the problem. To assist RL even further with the curse of dimensionalities, we intend to investigate the use of SL to reduce the state space. To achieve this, we shall use historical data to generate a heat load sub-model for each home. We believe using the output of these sub-models as feedback to the RL algorithm could significantly reduce the complexity of the learning task. Also, it could reduce convergence time for the RL algorithm. The desired goal is to achieve a real-time application, which takes operational actions when it receives new direct feedback. However, considering the dynamics of DH system such as large time delay and dissipation in DH network due to various factors, we hope to investigate things such as the appropriate data sampling rate and new parameters / sensors that could improve knowledge about the state of the system, especially on the consumer side of the DH network.

Core to the framework is a robust content-based publish-subscribe mechanism that allows flexible sharing of sensor data and computation results. The proposed communication platform has been tested at the proof of concept level, with several detailed features providing promising results.

We use signal processing and machine learning approaches to analyze the vibration responses collected both directly from the bridge model and indirectly from a vehicle passing over the model. Features are selected using principal component analysis (PCA), and a regression is performed using the kernel regression method. Various "damage" severities and positions are simulated on a laboratory bridge model by placing additional mass on the bridge. We perform two experiments; one to measure our ability to detect damage severity (i.e. size of the mass), and a second to measure our ability to detect damage location (i.e. position of the mass). In the first experiment, we vary the magnitude of the mass while keeping its location constant. In the second experiment, we vary the location of the mass while keeping its magnitude constant.

VHS incorporates the concepts borrowed from the invasive weed optimization technique to improve the performance of the harmony search algorithm (HS). This eliminates the main problem of constant parameter setting in the algorithm proposed recently and named as explorative HS. It uses the variance of a current population as well as presents a solution vector to improvise the harmony memory. In addition, the dynamic pitch adjustment operator is used to avoid solution oscillation. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on 14 standard benchmark functions of various characteristics. The performance of the proposed algorithm is investigated and compared with classical HS, an improved version of HS, the global best HS, self-adaptive HS, explorative HS, and the recently proposed state-of-art gravitational search algorithm. Experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms the above-mentioned approaches. The effects of scalability, noise, harmony memory size, and harmony memory consideration rate have also been investigated with the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm is then employed for a data clustering problem. Four real-life datasets selected from the UCI machine learning repository have been used. The results indicate that the VHS-based clustering outperforms the existing well-known clustering algorithms.

J	Hacohen-Kerner, Y; Margaliot, O				Hacohen-Kerner, Yaakov; Margaliot, Orr			Authorship Attribution of Responsa Using Clustering	CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						authorship attribution; Hebrew; responsa; text clustering; unsupervised machine learning methods; word lists	STYLISTIC FEATURE SETS; HISTORICAL PERIOD; ETHNIC-ORIGIN; CLASSIFIERS; DOCUMENTS	Authorship attribution of text documents is a "hot" domain in research; however, almost all of its applications use supervised machine learning (ML) methods. In this research, we explore authorship attribution as a clustering problem, that is, we attempt to complete the task of authorship attribution using unsupervised machine learning methods. The application domain is responsa, which are answers written by well-known Jewish rabbis in response to various Jewish religious questions. We have built a corpus of 6,079 responsa, composed by five authors who lived mainly in the 20th century and containing almost 10M words. The clustering tasks that have been performed were according to two or three or four or five authors. Clustering has been performed using three kinds of word lists: most frequent words (FW) including function words (stopwords), most frequent filtered words (FFW) excluding function words, and words with the highest variance values (HVW); and two unsupervised machine learning methods: K-means and Expectation Maximization (EM). The best clustering tasks according to two or three or four authors achieved results above 98%, and the improvement rates were above 40% in comparison to the "majority" (baseline) results. The EM method has been found to be superior to K-means for the discussed tasks. FW has been found as the best word list, far superior to FFW. FW, in contrast to FFW, includes function words, which are usually regarded as words that have little lexical meaning. This might imply that normalized frequencies of function words can serve as good indicators for authorship attribution using unsupervised ML methods. This finding supports previous findings about the usefulness of function words for other tasks, such as authorship attribution, using supervised ML methods, and genre and sentiment classification.

Image analysis for seed identification has been previously studied, and good recognition rates have been achieved. However, the data sets used in these experiments either contain very few groups of non-verified specimens or little representation of intra-species variations. This study considered a data set containing seed specimens that were verified to represent the species and a typical population variation, as well as look-alike species that share the same morphological appearance, in particular, seeds from species in the same genus, which can be particularly difficult for even trained professionals to visually distinguish. With representative specimens, the image features and machine learning algorithms described herein can achieve a high recognition rate: >97%. Three different types of features from seed images: colour, shape, and texture were extracted, and a multi-kernel support vector machine was used as the classifier. We compared our features to the previous state-of-the-art features and the results showed that the features we selected performed better on our data set.

This paper describes the development of a successive over relaxation support vector regress (SOR-SVR) model for the PM10 and PM2.5 prediction, based on the daily average aerosol optical depth (AOD) and meteorological parameters (atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, air temperature, wind speed), which were all measured in Beijing during the year of 2010-2012. The Gaussian kernel function, as well as the k-fold crosses validation and grid search method, are used in SVR model to obtain the optimal parameters to get a better generalization capability. The result shows that predicted values by the SOR-SVR model agree well with the actual data and have a good generalization ability to predict PM10 and PM2.5. In addition, AOD plays an important role in predicting particulate matter with SVR model, which should be included in the prediction model. If only considering the meteorological parameters and eliminating AOD from the SVR model, the prediction results of predict particulate matter will be not satisfying.

In recent years, various feature measurements have been proposed to select significant features from high-dimensional datasets. However, most traditional feature selection methods will ignore some features which have strong classification ability as a group but are weak as individuals. To deal with this problem, we redefine the redundancy, interdependence, and independence of features by using neighborhood entropy. Then the neighborhood entropy-based feature contribution is proposed under the framework of cooperative game. The evaluative criteria of features can be formalized as the product of contribution and other classical feature measures. Finally, the proposed method is tested on several UCI datasets. The results show that neighborhood entropy-based cooperative game theory model (NECGT) yield better performance than classical ones.

Previous work is mostly concentrated on the classification and analysis of tweets utilizing crowdsourcing or machine learning techniques. However, managing the high volume and velocity of social media messages still remains challenging. In order to enhance information extraction from social media, this chapter presents a new approach that relies upon the geographical relations between twitter data and flood phenomena. Our approach uses specific geographical features like hydrological data and digital elevation models to prioritize crisis-relevant twitter messages. We apply this approach to examine the River Elbe Flood in Germany in June 2013. The results show that our approach based on geographical relations can enhance information extraction from volunteered geographic information, thus being valuable for both crisis response and preventive flood monitoring.

These changes have, however, seldom been subjected to systematic comparison. In the present study, we analyzed language samples obtained during the course of a longitudinal clinical study from patients in whom one or other pathology was verified at post mortem. The aims of the study were twofold: first, to confirm the presence of differences in language produced by members of the two groups using quantitative methods of evaluation; and secondly to ascertain the most informative sources of variation between the groups. We adopted a computational approach to evaluate digitized transcripts of connected speech along a range of language-related dimensions. We then used machine learning text classification to assign the samples to one of the two pathological groups on the basis of these features. The classifiers' accuracies were tested using simple lexical features, syntactic features, and more complex statistical and information theory characteristics. Maximum accuracy was achieved when word occurrences and frequencies alone were used. Features based on syntactic and lexical complexity yielded lower discrimination scores, but all combinations of features showed significantly better performance than a baseline condition in which every transcript was assigned randomly to one of the two classes. The classification results illustrate the word content specific differences in the spoken language of the two groups. In addition, those with mixed pathology were found to exhibit a marked reduction in lexical variation and complexity compared to their pure AD counterparts.

J	Wu, HC; Hu, YH; Huang, YH				Wu, Hsu-Che; Hu, Ya-Han; Huang, Yen-Hao			Two-stage credit rating prediction using machine learning techniques	KYBERNETES			English	Article						Knowledge management; Decision making	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SCORING MODELS; CLASSIFICATION	Purpose - Credit ratings have become one of the primary references for financial institutions to assess credit risk. Conventional credit rating approaches mainly concentrated on two-class classification (i. e. good or bad credit), which lacks adequate precision to perform credit risk evaluations in practice. In addition, most of previous researches directly focussed on employing various data mining techniques, but rare studies discussed the influence of data preprocessing before classifier construction. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This study considers nine-class classification (i. e. nine credit risk level) to credit rating prediction. For the development of more accurate classifiers, the paper adopts two-stage analysis, which integrates multiple data preprocessing and supervised learning techniques. Specifically, the first stage applies feature selection, data clustering, and data resampling methods to preprocess the data, and then the second stage utilizes several classification techniques and classifier ensembles to construct prediction models. Findings - The results show that Bagging-DT with data resampling method achieves excellent accuracy (82.96 percent), indicating that the proposed two-stage prediction model is better than conventional one-stage models. Originality/value - Practical implication of this study can lower credit rating expenses and also allow corporations to gain credit rating information instantly.

Related studies have shown that machine learning techniques, such as neural networks, outperform many statistical approaches to solving this type of problem, and advanced machine learning techniques, such as classifier ensembles and hybrid classifiers, provide better prediction performance than single machine learning based classification techniques. However, it is not known which type of advanced classification technique performs better in terms of financial distress prediction. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This paper compares neural network ensembles and hybrid neural networks over three benchmarking credit scoring related data sets, which are Australian, German, and Japanese data sets. Findings - The experimental results show that hybrid neural networks and neural network ensembles outperform the single neural network. Although hybrid neural networks perform slightly better than neural network ensembles in terms of predication accuracy and errors with two of the data sets, there is no significant difference between the two types of prediction models. Originality/value - The originality of this paper is in comparing two types of advanced classification techniques, i.e. hybrid and ensemble learning techniques, in terms of financial distress prediction.

It entails the search of an optimal subset from a very large data set with high dimensional feature space. Apart from eliminating redundant features and reducing computational cost, a good selection of feature also leads to higher prediction and classification accuracy. In this paper, an efficient feature selection technique is introduced in the task of epileptic seizure detection. The raw data are electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Using discrete wavelet transform, the biomedical signals were decomposed into several sets of wavelet coefficients. To reduce the dimension of these wavelet coefficients, a feature selection method that combines the strength of both filter and wrapper methods is proposed. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used as part of the filter method. As for wrapper method, the evolutionary harmony search (HS) algorithm is employed. This metaheuristic method aims at finding the best discriminating set of features from the original data. The obtained features were then used as input for an automated classifier, namely wavelet neural networks (WNNs). The WNNs model was trained to perform a binary classification task, that is, to determine whether a given EEG signal was normal or epileptic. For comparison purposes, different sets of features were also used as input.

However, not all methods could provide accurate indications. This paper introduces an ensemble of classifiers by using Support Vector Machine that's never been applied in analyses involving currency crisis before with the aim of increasing the indication accuracy. The proposed ensemble classifiers' performances are measured using percentage of accuracy, root mean squared error (RMSE), area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve and Type II error. The performances of an ensemble of Support Vector Machine classifiers are compared with the single Support Vector Machine classifier and both of classifiers are tested on the data set from 27 countries with 12 macroeconomic indicators for each country. From our analyses, the results show that the ensemble of Support Vector Machine classifiers outperforms single Support Vector Machine classifier on the problem involving indicating a currency crisis in terms of a range of standard measures for comparing the performance of classifiers.

However, infrastructure limitations in urban areas often inhibit the ability to charge a significant number of electric vehicles, especially under one roof. This paper highlights a novel controls approach developed at GE Global Research in conjunction with Columbia University to fulfill the stated needs for intelligent charging of a commercial fleet of electric vehicles. This novel approach combines traditional control techniques with machine learning algorithms to adapt to customer behavior over time. The stated controls system is designed to regulate the charging rate of multiple electric vehicle supply equipment devices (EVSEs) to facilitate cost-optimal charging subject to past and predicted building load, vehicle energy requirements, and current conditions. In this embodiment, the system is primarily designed to mitigate electric demand charges that may otherwise occur due to charging at inopportune times. The system will be deployed at a New York City FedEx Express delivery depot in partnership with the local utility, Consolidated Edison Company of New York.

As a consequence, there is increasing pressure to develop comprehensive post-silicon test and debug tools that can be used to identify design bugs and improve modeling of complex electrical nonidealities observed in silicon. Often, it is not known a-priori what these bugs are and how they can be modeled, significantly complicating the debug process. In this research, a new atomic model learning approach is proposed that uses supervised learning techniques to diagnose design bugs and learn unknown module-level behaviors. Nonideality modeling artifacts called model atoms are inserted into different nodes of the design signal flow paths to learn unknown behaviors along those paths. Under the assumption that the design bug is localized, it is shown that the source of the bug can be identified with high resolution even when the nature of the bug is unknown. The method has been applied to a conventional wireless as well as a polar radio transmitter and key results that demonstrate usefulness and feasibility of the proposed approach are presented.

The trend has been driven by factors such as increases in data volume, need to detect subtle defects and need to extend beyond test's traditional sort function to a feedback-providing, yield-learning role. These factors, in turn, reflect needs for efficient data handling, ability to extract small signals from noise, and practically-useful model-building. Similar needs exist in other fields of emerging interest including unstructured text analysis, which in turn supports myriad applications. This paper surveys analysis techniques that have been used in the test domain, draws parallels in unstructured text analysis and suggests insights similar to those used to meet recent test challenges can find application in diverse and emerging fields as well.

We propose a semantic model of human-machine collaboration for the classification, discovery and selection of web services that integrates the semantic as well as syntactic data of the web services to achieve the hybrid cognition. This proposed cognitive approach uses the principals from the machine learning, measures of semantic relatedness and information retrieval where the cognitive information from the Word Net based Omiotis measure of semantic relatedness is merged with the syntactic service profiles and further these semantically enriched service vectors are passed to the supervised learning algorithms to achieve the decision support for the discovery and selection of relevant services. Empirical evaluation of the proposed approach implemented on OWL-X data set has been presented and a comparison of two different supervised classifiers has been made.

We bring into account a new and influential asset human intuition and perception - to the existing semi-automated decision support systems that mostly rely on numerical data collected by electronic sensors or cameras located either directly on the vessels or in the maritime command-and-control centers. For our project, we gathered weekly textual reports spanning twelve months from the United States Worldwide Threats to Shipping Reports repository that belongs to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). We considered the maritime incident reports written by human operators as a valuable and accessible unstructured textual input source in which a span of text! is called "risk" if it expresses one of the following kinds of vessel incidents: fired, robbed, boarded, hijacked, attacked, chased, approached, kidnapped, boarding attempted, suspiciously approached or clashed with. Our approach benefits from probability distributions of some useful features annotated based on a list of lexicons that contain expressions denoting vessel types, risks types, risk associates, maritime geographical locations, dates and times. These distributions are captured and used to anchor the span of "risks" as they are described in the textual reports. After some preprocessing steps that include tokenization, named entity extraction and part-of-speech tagging, the textual risk mining system applies a variety of sequence classification algorithms, e. g., Conditional Random Fields, Conditional Markov Models and Hidden Markov Models in order to compare the risk classification performance. Empirical results show that our NLP/ML-based system can extract variable-length risk spans from the textual reports with about 90 % correctness.

In this paper, we use a machine learning technique to learn the underlying conditional dependence and independence structure in the base station traffic loads to show how such probabilistic models can be used to reduce the traffic monitoring efforts. The broad goal is to exploit the model to develop a spatial sampling technique that estimates the loads on all the base stations based on actual measurements only on a small subset of base stations. We take special care to develop a sparse model that focuses on capturing only key dependences. Using trace data collected in a network of 400 base stations we show the effectiveness of this approach in reducing the monitoring effort. To understand the tradeoff between the accuracy and monitoring complexity better, we also study the use of this modeling approach on real applications. Two applications are studied - energy saving and opportunistic scheduling. They show that load estimation via such modeling is quite effective in reducing the monitoring burden.

In decision support, we use machine learning techniques in predicting closures of a shellfish farm. As environmental time series are used in closure, we propose two approaches using time series and machine learning for closure prediction. In one approach, we consider time series prediction and then using expert rules to predict closure. In other approach, we use time series classification for closure prediction. Both approaches exploit a dynamic data-driven technique where prediction models are updated with the update of new data to predict closure decisions. Experimental results at a case study shellfish farm validate the applicability of the proposed method in aquaculture decision support.

We present definitions for both intrinsic context, i.e. factors which directly affect sensor measurements for a given event, as well as extrinsic context, i.e. factors which do not affect the sensor measurements directly, but do affect the interpretation of collected data. Supervised and unsupervised modeling techniques to derive context and context labels from sensor data are formulated. Here, supervised modeling incorporates the a priori known factors affecting the sensing modalities, while unsupervised modeling autonomously discovers the structure of those factors in sensor data. Context-aware event classification algorithms are developed by adapting the classification boundaries, dependent on the current operational context. Improvements in context-aware classification have been quantified and validated in an unattended sensor-fence application for US Border Monitoring. Field data, collected with seismic sensors on different ground types, are analyzed in order to classify two types of walking across the border, namely, normal and stealthy. The classification is shown to be strongly dependent on the context (specifically, soil type: gravel or moist soil).

In fact, 12 indicators, which can represent the macro economy well in both economically and statistically, are chosen to build our new index. Here, different from traditional econometric method, a novel machine learning method support vector regression machine (SVR) is employed to product the predictor of consumer price index (CPI) in China. In addition, in the experiment part, we also compare the result of SVR with that of least square regression (LSR) and vector autoregressive (VAR) impulse response analysis. The comparison shows that the latter two methods are hard to satisfy the requirement in both economically and statistically. On the contrary, SVR gives a good predictor of CPI and exhibits a manifest leading of CPI. In other words, our index can forecast the trends by 4 to 6 months, which is useful for investment and policy making.

Such applications necessarily require rapid identification of the organism as a prelude to annotation and further analysis. NGS data consist of a substantial number of short sequence reads, given context through downstream assembly and annotation, a process requiring reads consistent with the assumed species or species group. Highly accurate results have been obtained for restricted sets using SVM classifiers, but such methods are difficult to parallelise and success depends on careful attention to feature selection. This work examines the problem at very large scale, using a mix of synthetic and real data with a view to determining the overall structure of the problem and the effectiveness of parallel ensembles of simpler classifiers (principally random forests) in addressing the challenges of large scale genomics.

There are many types of detection methods that the Army has or is currently investigating, including ground-penetrating radar, thermal and visible spectrum cameras, acoustic arrays, laser vibrometers, etc. Since standoff range is an important characteristic for sensor performance, forward-looking ground-penetrating radar has been investigated for some time. Recently, the Army has begun testing a forward-looking system that combines L-band and X-band radar arrays. Our work focuses on developing imaging and detection methods for this sensor-fused system. In this paper, we investigate approaches that fuse L-band radar and X-band radar for explosive hazard detection and false alarm rejection. We use multiple kernel learning with support vector machines as the classification method and histogram of gradients (HOG) and local statistics as the main feature descriptors. We also perform preliminary testing on a context aware approach for detection. Results on government furnished data show that our false alarm rejection method improves area-under-ROC by up to 158%.

A few notable examples include the techniques of topic models, deep belief networks, deep Boltzmann machines, and local discriminative Gaussians, all inspired by human learning. This self-learning of new concepts via rich generative models has emerged as a promising area of research in machine learning. Although there has been recent progress, existing computational models are still far from being able to represent, identify and learn the wide variety of possible patterns and structure in real-world data. An important issue for further consideration is the use of unsupervised representations for novel underwater target recognition applications. This work will discuss and demonstrate the use of latent Dirichlet allocation and autoencoders for learning unsupervised representations of objects in sonar imagery. The objective is to make these representations more abstract and invariant to noise in the training distribution and improve performance.

Numerous scoring functions have been introduced in the structure learning. The performance of these scoring functions usually tends to favor the dense Bayesian Network by using an implicit over-fitting phenomenon. Motivated by this limitation, this study has introduced a novel scoring function which is optimized for producing non complex learnt structures but with the target of higher classification accuracy. The introduced scoring function assumes no external parameter for its fine tuning. It is decomposable and possesses no penalty factor. The introduced scoring function holds its mathematical interpretation within information theory. This scoring function is designed to maximize the discriminant function for given dataset query variables with respect to the class feature and other non class features. The empirical evaluation of the introduced scoring function points out that its classification accuracy is significantly better than other existent scoring functions using greedy search algorithm K2 and hill climber. The outcome of this study illustrates that simplistic structure with higher classification performance is possible by means of exercising the proposed scoring function in the Bayesian Belief structure learning.

As conducting experimental studies to identify essential proteins are both time and resource consuming, here we present a computational approach in predicting them based on network topology properties from protein-protein interaction networks of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The proposed method, namely EP3NN (Essential Proteins Prediction using Probabilistic Neural Network) employed a machine learning algorithm called Probabilistic Neural Network as a classifier to identify essential proteins of the organism of interest; it uses degree centrality, closeness centrality, local assortativity and local clustering coefficient of each protein in the network for such predictions. Results show that EP3NN managed to successfully predict essential proteins with an accuracy of 95% for our studied organism. Results also show that most of the essential proteins are close to other proteins, have assortativity behavior and form clusters/sub-graph in the network.

In order for these efforts to be effective, there is a need to develop automated algorithms to process the full-motion videos (FMV) captured by UAVs in an efficient and timely manner to extract meaningful information that can assist human analysts and decision makers. This paper presents a generalizeable marine object detection system that is specifically designed to process raw video footage streaming from UAVs in real-time. Our approach does not make any assumptions about the object and/or background characteristics because, in the MDA domain, we encounter varying background and foreground characteristics such as boats, bouys and ships of varying sizes and shapes, wakes, white caps on water, glint from the sun, to name but a few. Our efforts rely on basic signal processing and machine learning approaches to develop a generic object detection system that maintains a high level of performance without making prior assumptions about foreground-background characteristics and does not experience abrupt performance degradation when subjected to variations in lighting, background characteristics, video quality, abrupt changes in video perspective, size, appearance and number of the targets. In the following report, in addition to our marine object detection system, we present representative object detection results on some real-world UAV full-motion video data.

Examples of modalities include, e. g., EO imagery and gamma radiation data, or radiation data collected during multiple events. In addition, elevation data or spatial proximity can be used to enhance the performance of acquisition systems. State of the art techniques in processing and exploitation of complex information manifolds rely on diffusion operators. Our approach involves machine learning techniques based on analysis of joint data-dependent graphs and their associated diffusion kernels. Then, the significant eigenvectors of the derived fused graph Laplace and Schroedinger operators form the new representation, which provides integrated features from the heterogeneous input data. The families of data-dependent Laplace and Schroedinger operators on joint data graphs, shall be integrated by means of appropriately designed fusion metrics. These fused representations are used for target and anomaly detection.

We show how the SOM can be efficiently used for target-panel prediction, drug re-purposing, and the design of focused compound libraries. We also present the concept of virtual organic synthesis in combination with quantitative estimates of ligand-receptor binding, which we used for de novo designing target-selective ligands.

They are fused to get an image that contains all well-focussed objects. Previously, individual machine-learning models are proposed for image fusion. The performance of individual models is limited to fuse the useful information extracted from the blurred images. To address this problem, we developed a novel ensemble scheme for multi-focus image fusion using support vector machines (SVMs). In the proposed scheme, first, SVM models are constructed using different kernel functions of linear, polynomial, radial basis, and sigmoid. The predictions of individual SVM models are then combined using majority voting. In this way, the combined decision space becomes more informative and discriminant. A comparative analysis of the proposed scheme is carried out with previous techniques. It is found that our scheme is more accurate for synthesized-blurred and real defocussed images.

Many useful applications based on NMF, including musical source separation and polyphonic transcription, have been presented in the field of music information retrieval. The multiplicative update rules for making inference on the NMF model are quite simple and practical; however, they do not scale up well with the increasing size of the dictionary matrices. In this study, we develop efficient approaches based on randomized matrix decompositions and exemplar selection that can easily handle very large dictionary matrices that can be encountered in real applications. We apply our methods on the transcription of polyphonic piano music. The results show that by only retaining 1% of a large dictionary matrix, we still get high performance in terms of objective measures.

Anumber of different classifiers are used to build and test dance hit prediction models. The resulting best model has a good performance when predictingwhether a song is a 'top 10' dance hit versus a lower listed position.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for building computational models of ensemble expressive performance and show how this method can be applied for deriving new insights about collaboration among musicians. In order to address the problem of inter-dependence among musicians we propose the introduction of inter-voice contextual attributes. We evaluate the method on data extracted from multi-modal recordings of string quartet performances in two different conditions: solo and ensemble. We used machine-learning algorithms to produce computational models for predicting intensity, timing deviations, vibrato extent, and bowing speed of each note. As a result, the introduced inter-voice contextual attributes generally improved the prediction of the expressive parameters. Furthermore, results on attribute selection show that the models trained on ensemble recordings took more advantage of inter-voice contextual attributes than those trained on solo recordings.

The framework is formulated in terms of acoustic models for both keys and chords, and a prior model that contains musicological knowledge about chords and keys. The latter consists of a compound of four components: a duration and a change model for both keys and chords. This division allows us to modify each of the components separately and to choose the most appropriate sources of knowledge for each of them. Furthermore, this makes it easier to interpret their role and their relevance in the estimation procedure. We compared multiple configurations of our system, increasing in complexity. This has permitted us to explore the relation between keys and chords, and the importance of integrating prior musicological knowledge into an automatic estimation system. It was found that chord estimation scores mostly depend on the integration of durational knowledge, while key estimation also requires prior information about the broader context.

The probabilistic models that most studies have proposed already contain nodes or states that represent chord symbols. Chord symbols, however, may not be suitable as a node of probabilistic models because they are ambiguous; chords with different voicings are represented as the same symbol. In this paper, we develop Bayesian networks that do and do not include chord nodes and compare the harmonies generated by them. Experimental results show that the non-chord model generates harmonies in which each voice has smoother note motions than the chord model.

Analysing such musical structure resembles natural language parsing: it requires the derivation of an underlying interpretation from an unstructured sequence of highly ambiguous elements-in the case of music, the notes. The task here is not merely to decide whether the sequence is grammatical, but rather to decide which among a large number of analyses it has. An analysis of this sort is a part of the cognitive processing performed by listeners familiar with amusical idiom, whether musically trained or not. Our focus is on the analysis of the structure of expectations and resolutions created by harmonic progressions. Building on previous work, we define a theory of tonal harmonic progression, which plays a role analogous to semantics in language. Our parser uses a formal grammar of jazz chord sequences, of a kind widely used for natural language processing (NLP), to map music, in the form of chord sequences used by performers, onto a representation of the structured relationships between chords. It uses statistical modelling techniques used for wide-coverage parsing in NLP to make practical parsing feasible in the face of considerable ambiguity in the grammar. Using machine learning over a small corpus of jazz chord sequences annotated with harmonic analyses, we show that grammar-based musical interpretation using simple statistical parsing models ismore accurate than a baseline HMM. The experiment demonstrates that statistical techniques adapted from NLP can be profitably applied to the analysis of harmonic structure.

J	Li, XL; Ma, L; Xu, LJ				Li, Xiaolu; Ma, Lian; Xu, Lijun			Real-time terrain classification using ICESat/GLAS data over Beijing area	REMOTE SENSING LETTERS			English	Article							DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; LIDAR DATA; MISSION	For providing a feasible solution for real-time terrain classification using ICESat-2 data, a supervised machine-learning-based real-time terrain classification method using ICESat data is proposed, which is composed of two procedures: offline classifier training and online terrain classification. The first procedure is accomplished by true label generation and feature selection. We advanced a new method of true label generation that uses laser-footprint-scale slopes and waveform characteristics as input data. The laser-footprint-scale slopes are estimated by an improved slope estimation method using elevations of repeat tracks. For feature selection, several waveform characteristics are extracted and the best ones are selected based on experiments. Using the generated true labels and selected features, we train a support vector machine classifier for the second procedure and the performance of online terrain classification is tested using ICESat/GLAS data collected from Beijing area during 2003-2009. The results show that by carefully selecting the features, high classification accuracy (around 92.36%) can be achieved even if the feature dimension is significantly reduced. Furthermore, the classification time of one laser footprint, which is approximately equal to 0.006 s, is less than one laser shot time; thus, the proposed method can be used for real-time terrain classification.

However, because a maneuvering nanosatellite can threaten HVAs on-orbit, it must provide a level of security typically reserved for HVAs. Securing nanosatellites with maneuvering capability is challenging due to extreme cost, size, and power constraints. While still in the design process, our low-cost SecureCPS architecture promises to dramatically improve security, to include preempting unknown binaries and detecting abnormal behavior. SecureCPS also applies to a broad class of cyber-physical systems (CPS), such as aircraft, cars, and trains. This paper focuses on Embry-Riddle's ARAPAIMA nanosatellite architecture, where we assume any off-the-shelf component could be compromised by a supply chain attack. 1 Based on these assumptions, we have used Vanderbilt's Cyber Physical - Attack Description Language (CP-ADL) to represent realistic attacks, analyze how these attacks propagate in the ARAPAIMA architecture, and how to defeat them using the combination of a low-cost Root of Trust (RoT) Module, Global InfoTek's Advanced Malware Analysis System (GAMAS), and Anomaly Detection by Machine Learning (ADML). 2 Our most recent efforts focus on refining and validating the design of SecureCPS.

Key to this effort is the Common World Model, which moves beyond the state-of-the-art by representing the world using semantic and symbolic as well as metric information. It joins these layers of information to define objects in the world. These objects may be reasoned upon jointly using traditional geometric, symbolic cognitive algorithms and new computational nodes formed by the combination of these disciplines to address Symbol Grounding and Uncertainty. The Common World Model must understand how these objects relate to each other. It includes the concept of Self-Information about the robot. By encoding current capability, component status, task execution state, and their histories we track information which enables the robot to reason and adapt its performance using Meta-Cognition and Machine Learning principles. The world model also includes models of how entities in the environment behave which enable prediction of future world states. To manage complexity, we have adopted a phased implementation approach. Phase 1, published in these proceedings in 2013 [1], presented the approach for linking metric with symbolic information and interfaces for traditional planners and cognitive reasoning. Here we discuss the design of "Phase 2" of this world model, which extends the Phase 1 design API, data structures, and reviews the use of the Common World Model as part of a semantic navigation use case.

Algorithms trained under closed set assumptions do not account for the infinite universe of confusers found in practice. In contrast, classification algorithms developed under open set assumptions label inputs not present in the training data as unknown instead of assigning the most likely class. We present an approach to open set recognition that utilizes class posterior estimates to determine probability thresholds for classification. This is accomplished by first training a support vector machine (SVM) in a 1-vs-all configuration on a training dataset containing only target classes. A validation set containing only class data belonging to the training set is used to iteratively determine appropriate posterior probability thresholds for each target class. The testing dataset, which contains targets present in the training data as well as several confuser classes, is first classified by the 1-vs-all SVM. If the estimated posterior for an input falls below the threshold, the target is labeled as unknown. Otherwise, it is labeled with the class resulting from the SVM decision. We apply our method to automatic target recognition (ATR) of ladar range images and compare its performance to current open set and closed set recognition techniques.

Limited sensor resolution (often exacerbated as a function of platform standoff distance) and clutter from shadows in dense target environments, unfavorable environmental conditions, and the normal properties of real data all contribute to the challenge. The unique and innovative aspect of our approach is a synthesis of multimodal signal processing with incremental non-parametric, hierarchical Bayesian machine learning methods to create a new kind of target classification architecture. This architecture is designed from the ground up to optimally exploit correlations among the multiple sensing modalities (multimodal data fusion) and rapidly and continuously learns (online self-tuning) patterns of distinct classes of dismounts given little a priori information. This increases classification performance in the presence of challenges posed by anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) sensing. To fuse multimodal features, Long-range Dismount Activity Classification (LODAC) develops a novel statistical information theoretic approach for multimodal data fusion that jointly models multimodal data (i.e., a probabilistic model for cross-modal signal generation) and discovers the critical cross-modal correlations by identifying components (features) with maximal mutual information (MI) which is efficiently estimated using non-parametric entropy models. LODAC develops a generic probabilistic pattern learning and classification framework based on a new class of hierarchical Bayesian learning algorithms for efficiently discovering recurring patterns (classes of dismounts) in multiple simultaneous time series (sensor modalities) at multiple levels of feature granularity.

However, our classification task is more complex due to the several reasons. First, we deal with the Lithuanian language which is highly inflective, has rich morphology, vocabulary, word derivation system, and relatively free-word-order in a sentence. Besides, we have more classes, as the Lithuanian Parliament consists of more party groups if compared to e.g. the European Parliament or the US Senate. Moreover, classes are not stable, because a considerable number of the Lithuanian parliamentarians migrate from one party group to another even within the same parliamentary term. In this research we experimentally investigated the influence of different pre-processing techniques and feature types on two datasets composed of the texts taken from two parliamentary terms. A classifier based on the bag-of-words and token bigrams interpolation gave the best results: i.e. it outperformed random and majority baselines by more than 0.13 points and achieved 0.54 and 0.49 accuracy on the 1st and the 2nd dataset, respectively. The error analysis revealed that the same confusion patterns stand for both datasets, besides, majority of these confusions can be explained on the basis of the ideological or pragmatic similarities between those party groups.

A probabilistic methodology for multilabel classification	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Multilabel classification; label dependency; probabilistic classifiers; text classification	TEXT CATEGORIZATION; RETRIEVAL	Multilabel classification is a relatively recent subfield of machine learning. Unlike to the classical approach, where instances are labeled with only one category, in multilabel classification, an arbitrary number of categories is chosen to label an instance. Due to the problem complexity (the solution is one among an exponential number of alternatives), a very common solution (the binary method) is frequently used, learning a binary classifier for every category, and combining them all afterwards. The assumption taken in this solution is not realistic, and in this work we give examples where the decisions for all the labels are not taken independently, and thus, a supervised approach should learn those existing relationships among categories to make a better classification. Therefore, we show here a generic methodology that can improve the results obtained by a set of independent probabilistic binary classifiers, by using a combination procedure with a classifier trained on the co-occurrences of the labels. We show an exhaustive experimentation in three different standard corpora of labeled documents (Reuters-21578, Ohsumed-23 and RCV1), which present noticeable improvements in all of them, when using our methodology, in three probabilistic base classifiers.

The effective guidance on wheelchair tilt and recline usage is therefore critical to pressure ulcer prevention. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of using machine learning techniques to construct an intelligent model to provide personalized guidance to individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). The motivation stems from the clinical evidence that the requirements of individuals vary greatly and that no universal guidance on tilt and recline usage could possibly satisfy all individuals with SCI. We explored all aspects involved in constructing the intelligent model and proposed approaches tailored to suit the characteristics of this preliminary study, such as modeling research participants, using machine learning techniques to construct the intelligent model, and evaluating the performance of the intelligent model. We further improved the intelligent model's prediction accuracy by developing a two-phase feature selection algorithm to identify important attributes. Experimental results demonstrated that our approaches showed promise: they could effectively construct the intelligent model, evaluate its performance, and refine the participant model so that the intelligent model's prediction accuracy was significantly improved.

Here we propose an optical circuit that performs a ubiquitous operation: the controlled, random-access readout of a collection of stored memory phases or, equivalently, the computation of the inner product of a vector of phases with a binary "selector" vector, where the arithmetic is done modulo 2pi and the result is encoded in the phase of a coherent field. This circuit, a collection of cascaded interferometers driven by a coherent input field, demonstrates the use of coherence as a computational resource, and of the use of recently-developed mathematical tools for modeling optical circuits with many coupled parts. The construction extends in a straightforward way to the computation of matrix-vector and matrix-matrix products, and, with the inclusion of an optical feedback loop, to the computation of a "weighted" readout of stored memory phases. We note some applications of these circuits for error correction and for computing tasks requiring fast vector inner products, e.g. statistical classification and some machine learning algorithms.

The influence of a researcher is often measured by how often he or she is cited, yet as a measure of influence, we show that citation frequency is only weakly correlated with influence ratings collected from peers. In this paper, we use machine learning to enable a new system that provides a better measure of researcher influence. This system predicts the influence of one researcher on another via a range of novel social, linguistic, psychological, and bibliometric features. To collect data for training and testing this approach, we conducted a survey of 74 researchers in the field of computational linguistics, and collected thousands of influence ratings. Our results on this data show that our approach significantly outperforms measures based on citations alone, improving prediction accuracy by 56%. We also perform a detailed analysis of the key features in our model, and make some important observations about the scientific and non-scientific factors that most predict researcher influence.

Recent developments have made use of biologically inspired architectures, such as the Convolutional Neural Network. The nature of the Convolutional Neural Network is that each convolutional layer of the network contains a certain number of feature maps or kernels. The number of these used has historically been determined on an ad-hoc basis. We propose a theoretical method for determining the optimal number of feature maps using the dimensions of the feature map or convolutional kernel. We find that the empirical data suggests that our theoretical method works for extremely small receptive fields, but doesn't generalize as clearly to all receptive field sizes. Furthermore, we note that architectures that are pyramidal rather than equally balanced tend to make better use of computational resources.

The method applies Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on a corpus to infer its major topics, which will be used for document representation. The representation that we propose has multiple levels (granularities) by using different numbers of topics. We postulate that interpreting data in a more general space, with fewer dimensions, can improve the representation quality. Experimental results support the informative power of our multi-level representation vectors. We show that choosing the correct granularity of representation is an important aspect of text classification. We propose a multi-level representation, at different topical granularities, rather than choosing one level. The documents are represented by topical relevancy weights, in a low-dimensional vector representation. Finally, the proposed representation is applied to a text classification task using several well-known classification algorithms. We show that it leads to very good classification performance. Another advantage is that, with a small compromise on accuracy, our low-dimensional representation can be fed into many supervised or unsupervised machine learning algorithms that empirically cannot be applied on the conventional high-dimensional text representation methods.

The last two classifiers use pre-game textual reports: one classifier uses words as features (unigrams, bigrams and trigrams) in order to detect the main ideas expressed in the texts and the second one uses features based on counts of positive and negative words in order to detect the opinions of the pre-game report writers. Our results show that meta classifiers that use the two data sources combined in various ways obtain better prediction accuracies than classifiers that use only numerical data or only textual data.

Such reviews require frequent and time-consuming updating. This study aims to compare the performance of combining relatively simple Bayesian classifiers using a fixed rule, to the relatively complex linear Support Vector Machine for medical systematic reviews. A collection of four systematic drug reviews is used to compare the performance of the classifiers in this study. Cross-validation experiments were performed to evaluate performance. We found that combining Discriminative Multinomial Naive Bayes and Complement Naive Bayes performs equally well or better than SVM while being about 25% faster than SVM in training time. The results support the usefulness of using an ensemble of Bayesian classifiers for machine learning-based automation of systematic reviews of medical topics, especially when datasets have a large number of abstracts. Further work is needed to integrate the powerful features of such Bayesian classifiers together.

However, most of the technical studies have focused on the detection of cyberbullying through identifying harassing comments rather than preventing the incidents by detecting the bullies. In this work we study the automatic detection of bully users on YouTube. We compare three types of automatic detection: an expert system, supervised machine learning models, and a hybrid type combining the two. All these systems assign a score indicating the level of "bulliness" of online bullies. We demonstrate that the expert system outperforms the machine learning models. The hybrid classifier shows an even better performance.

The process includes pre-processing, building the graph per subject with different correlations, atlas, relevant feature extraction according to the literature, and finally providing a set of machine learning algorithms which can produce analyzable results for physicians or specialists. In order to verify the process, a set of images from prescription drug abusers and patients with migraine have been used. In this way, the proper functioning of the tool has been proved, providing results of 87% and 92% of success depending on the classifier used.

This tool allows to classify subjects under study, analysing in this case, the functions related to language in young patients with dyslexia. Images are obtained using a scanner and different tests are performed on subjects. After processing the images, the areas that are activated by patients when performing the paradigms or anatomy of the tracts were obtained. The main objective is to ultimately introduce a group of monocular vision subjects, whose brain activation model is unknown. This classification helps to assess whether these subjects are more akin to dyslexic or control subjects. Machine learning techniques study systems that learn how to perform non-linear classifications through supervised or unsupervised training, or a combination of both. Once the machine has been set up, it is validated with the subjects who have not been entered in the training stage. The results are obtained using a user-friendly chart. Finally, a new tool for the classification of subjects with dyslexia and monocular vision was obtained (achieving a success rate of 94.8718% on the Neuronal Network classifier), which can be extended to other further classifications.

J	Li, P; Bi, TT; Huang, JL; Li, SB				Li, Peng; Bi, Tingting; Huang, Jiuling; Li, Siben			Breast cancer early diagnosis based on hybrid strategy	BIO-MEDICAL MATERIALS AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Computer-aided diagnosis; image data mining; support vector machine; clustering sampling		The frequent occurrence of breast cancer and its serious consequences have attracted worldwide attention in recent years. Problems such as low rate of accuracy and poor self-adaptability still exist in traditional diagnosis. In order to solve these problems, an AdaBoost-SVM classification algorithm, combined with the cluster boundary sampling preprocessing techniques (CBS-AdaBoost-SVM), is proposed in this paper for the early diagnosis of breast cancer. The algorithm uses machine learning method to diagnose the unknown image data. Moreover, not all of the characteristics play positive roles for classification. To address this issue the paper delete redundant features by using Rough set attribute reduction algorithm based on the genetic algorithm (GA). The effectiveness of the proposed methods are examined on DDSM by calculating its accuracy, confusion matrix, and receiver operating characteristic curves, which give important clues to the physicians for early diagnosis of breast cancer.

Nonetheless, the proposed works are not able to satisfactorily solve the problem, usually being suitable for only addressing a given portion of the whole network traffic and thus none of them can be considered an ultimate solution for network classification. In this paper, we address network traffic classification by proposing a new architecture - named Waterfall architecture - that, by combining several classification algorithms together according to a cascade principle, is able to correctly classify the whole mixture of network traffic. Through extensive experimental tests run over real traffic datasets, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposal.

Recently, machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines and genetic programming have been explored for predicting inhibitors, antagonists, blockers, agonists, activators and substrates of proteins related to specific therapeutic targets. These methods are particularly useful for screening compound libraries of diverse chemical structures, "noisy" and high-dimensional data to complement QSAR methods, and in cases of unavailable receptor 3D structure to complement structure-based methods. A variety of studies have demonstrated the potential of machine-learning methods for predicting compounds as potential drug candidates. The present review is intended to give an overview of the strategies and current progress in using machine learning methods for drug design and the potential of the respective model development tools. We also regard a number of applications of the machine learning algorithms based on common classes of diseases.

The SOM is widely known as a "scalable" algorithm because of its capability to handle large numbers of records. However, it is effective only when the vectors are small and dense. Although a number of studies on making the SOM scalable have been conducted, technical issues on scalability and performance for sparse high-dimensional data such as hyperlinked documents still remain. In this paper, we introduce MIGSOM, an SOM algorithm inspired by new discovery on neuronal migration. The two major advantages of MIGSOM are its scalability for sparse high-dimensional data and its clustering visualization functionality. In this paper, we describe the algorithm and implementation in detail, and show the practicality of the algorithm in several experiments. We applied MIGSOM to not only experimental data sets but also a large scale real data set: Wikipedia's hyperlink data.

Recently, ensemble pruning techniques have attracted significant attention in the machine learning and the data mining community. Unlike previous heuristic approaches, in this paper we formalize the ensemble pruning problem as a function maximization problem to strike an optimal balance between quality of classifiers and diversity within the subset. Firstly, a quality and pairwise diversity combined framework is proposed and the function is proved to be submodular. Furthermore, we propose a submodular and monotonic function which is the composition of both quality and entropy diversity. Based on the theoretical analysis, although this maximization problem is still NP-hard, the greedy search algorithm with approximation guarantee of factor 1-1/e is employed to get a near-optimal solution. Through the extensive experiments on 36 real datasets, our empirical studies demonstrate that our proposed approaches are capable of achieving superior performance and better efficiency.

Unfortunately, a representative analysis on a corpus of 733 million Web documents shows that, a year after its introduction, only 1.56% of documents featured any schema.org annotations. A probable reason is that providing annotations is quite tiresome, hindering wide-spread adoption. Here even state-of-the-art tools like Google's Structured Data Markup Helper offer only limited support. In this paper we propose SASS, a system for automatically finding high quality schema suggestions for page content, to ease the annotation process. SASS intelligently blends supervised machine learning techniques with simple user feedback. Moreover, additional support features for binding attributes to values even further reduces the necessary effort. We show that SASS is superior to current tools for schema.org annotations.

Although many machine-learning and statistical techniques have been proposed widely for defining fault prone modules in software fault prediction, but this area have yet to be explored with high accuracy and less error. Unfortunately, several earlier methods including artificial neural networks and its variants that have been used, marred by limitations such as inability to adequately handle uncertainties in software measurement data which leads to low accuracy, instability and inconsistency in prediction. In this paper, first the effect of irrelevant and inconsistent modules on fault prediction is decreased by designing a new framework, in which the entire project's modules are clustered. The generated output is then passed to the next model in the hybrid setting, which is a probabilistic neural network (PNN) for training and prediction. We used four NASA data sets to evaluate our results. Performance evaluation in terms of false positive rate, false negative rate, and overall error are calculated and showed 30% to 60% improvement in false negative rate compared to other well-performed training methods such as naive Bayes and random forest.

Opinion mining identifies whether the opinion about a given topic, expressed in a document, is positive or negative.

This paper investigates technological products reviews mining using the psychological and linguistic features obtained through of text analysis software, LIWC. Furthermore, an analysis of the classification techniques J48, SMO, and BayesNet has been performed by using WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis). This analysis aims to evaluate the classifying potential of the LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) dimensions on written opinions in Spanish. All in all, findings have revealed that the combination of the four LIWC dimensions provides better results than the other combinations and individual dimensions, and that SMO is the algorithm which has obtained the best results.

Currently, lots of information concerning electricity markets is available, as market operators provide, after a period of confidentiality, data regarding market proposals and transactions. These data can be used as source of knowledge to define realistic scenarios, which are essential for understanding and forecast electricity markets behavior. The development of tools able to extract, transform, store and dynamically update data, is of great importance to go a step further into the comprehension of electricity markets and of the behaviour of the involved entities. In this paper an adaptable tool capable of downloading, parsing and storing data from market operators' websites is presented, assuring constant updating and reliability of the stored data.

In this work we propose the use of supervised machine learning techniques to retrieve and rank sentences describing different types of biomolecular events.

Accordingly, attackers are expanding the scope of their attack not only in the existing PC and Internet environment but also to mobile devices. In this paper, we monitor the resource information of mobile devices to detect Android malware. Using the monitored information, we propose a method of detecting malware by applying linear SVM (support vector machine) that shows high classification performance in machine learning classifiers in order to automatically detect malware. The validity of the proposed methodology is verified through experiment results.

J	Xu, CL; Wang, GY; Zhang, QH				Xu, Changlin; Wang, Guoyin; Zhang, Qinghua			A New Multi-Step Backward Cloud Transformation Algorithm Based on Normal Cloud Model	FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE			English	Article						Concept expression; Cognitive transformation; Normal cloud model; Backward cloud transformation; Mean squared error	RANDOM SETS; FUZZY-SETS	The representation and processing of uncertainty information is one of the key basic issues of the intelligent information processing in the face of growing vast information, especially in the era of network. There have been many theories, such as probability statistics, evidence theory, fuzzy set, rough set, cloud model, etc., to deal with uncertainty information from different perspectives, and they have been applied into obtaining the rules and knowledge from amount of data, for example, data mining, knowledge discovery, machine learning, expert system, etc. Simply, This is a cognitive transformation process from data to knowledge (FDtoK). However, the cognitive transformation process from knowledge to data (FKtoD) is what often happens in human brain, but it is lack of research. As an effective cognition model, cloud model provides a cognitive transformation way to realize both processes of FDtoK and FKtoD via forward cloud transformation (FCT) and backward cloud transformation (BCT). In this paper, the authors introduce the FCT and BCT firstly, and make a depth analysis for the two existing single-step BCT algorithms. We find that these two BCT algorithms lack stability and sometimes are invalid. For this reason we propose a new multi-step backward cloud transformation algorithm based on sampling with replacement (MBCT-SR) which is more precise than the existing methods. Furthermore, the effectiveness and convergence of new method is analyzed in detail, and how to set the parameters m, r appeared in MBCT-SR is also analyzed. Finally, we have error analysis and comparison to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed backward cloud transformation algorithm for some simulation experiments.

The difference is that in DLs objects are described not only by attributes but also by binary relationships between objects. In this paper, we develop the first bisimulation-based method of concept learning in DLs for the following setting: given a knowledge base KB in a DL, a set of objects standing for positive examples and a set of objects standing for negative examples, learn a concept C in that DL such that the positive examples are instances of C w.r.t.

As an individual's health changes with age, their ability to consistently perform standard gestures may decrease, particularly towards the end of life. Thus, such interfaces will need to be capable of learning commands which are not choreographed ahead of time by the system designers. This circumstance illustrates the need for a system which engages in lifelong learning and is capable of discerning new gestures and the user's desired response to them. This paper describes an innovative approach to lifelong learning based on clustered gesture representations identified through the Growing Neural Gas algorithm. The simulated approach utilizes a user-generated reward signal to progressively refine the response of an assistive robot toward a preferred goal configuration.

In these applications, it is necessary for the agent to identify the addressee of each user utterance to deliberate appropriate responses in interacting with visitor groups. However, as long as the addressee identification mechanism is not completely correct, the agent makes error in its responses. Once there is an error, the agent's hypothesis collapses and the following decision-making path may go to a totally different direction. We are working on developing the mechanism to detect the error from the users' reactions and the mechanism to recover the error. This paper presents the first step, a method to detect laughing, surprises, and confused facial expressions after the agent's wrong responses. This method is machine learning base with the data (user reactions) collected in aWOZ (Wizard of Oz) experiment and reached an accuracy over 90%.

More specifically, we have recorded the center of gaze of users when they were viewing natural scenes. We used machine learning techniques to train a bottom-up, top-down model of saliency based on 2D and depth features/cues. We found that models trained on Itti & Koch and depth features combined outperform models trained on other individual features (i.e. only Gabor filter responses or only depth features), or trained on combination of these features. As a consequence, depth features combined with Itti & Koch features improve the prediction of gaze locations. This first characterization of using joint luminance and depth features is an important step towards developing models of eye movements, which operate well under natural conditions such as those encountered in HCI settings.

However, these techniques mostly suffer from problems such as occlusion and noise. In this work, we present Pingu, a multi-sensor based framework that is capable of recognizing simple, sharp, and tiny gestures without the problems mentioned above. Pingu has been calibrated in the form of a wearable finger ring, capable of interacting even when the device is not in the vicinity of the user. An advanced set of sensors, wireless connectivity, and feedback facilities enable Pingu for a wide range of potential applications, from novel gestures to social computing. In this paper, we present our results based on experiments conducted to explore Pingu's use as a general gestural interaction device. Our analysis, based on simple machine learning algorithms, shows that simple and sharp gestures performed by a finger can be detected with a high accuracy, thereby, stablishing Pingu as a wearable ring to control a smart environment effectively.

Elfoid has a soft exterior that provides the look and feel of human skin and is designed to transmit a speaker's presence to their communication partner using a camera and microphone. To transmit the speaker's presence, Elfoid transmits not only the voice of the speaker but also their facial expression as captured by the camera. In this research, facial expressions are recognized by a machine learning technique. Elfoid cannot, however, physically display facial expressions because of its compactness and a lack of sufficiently small actuator motors. The recognized facial expressions are displayed using a mobile projector installed in Elfoid's head to convey emotions. We build a prototype system and experimentally evaluate its subjective usability.

There exist a need for introducing novel machine learning methods, that can tackle high dimensionality and large number of classes in these images. In this paper, we introduce a novel ensemble method for classification of hyperspectral data. The pool of classifiers is built on the basis of color decomposition of the given image. Each base classifier corresponds to a single color channel that is extracted. We propose a new method for decomposing hyperspectral image into 11 different color channels. As not all of the channels may bear as useful information as other, we need to promote the most relevant ones. For this, our ensemble uses a weighted trained fuser, which uses a neural methods for establishing weights. We show, that the proposed ensemble can outperform other state-of-the-art classifiers in the given task.

However, for several domains, the available data is unlabeled and the generation of a class label for each instance may have a high cost. An alternative to reduce this cost is the use of active learning, which selects instances according to a criterion of relevance. Diverse sampling strategies for active learning, following different paradigms, can be found in the literature. However, there is no detailed comparison between these strategies and they are usually evaluated for only one classification technique. In this paper, strategies from different paradigms are experimentally compared using different learning algorithms and datasets. Additionally, a multiclass hypothesis space search called SG-multi is proposed and empirically shown to be feasible.

Its deficiency depends on the mass of the case data and the rapidity of the retrieval process that can be wasteful in time. This is due to the number of cases that gets large and the store of cases besieges with ineffective cases, as the noises. This may badly affect the performance of the system in terms of its efficiency, competence and solution quality. Resultantly, maintaining CBR system becomes mandatory. In this paper, we offer a novel case base maintenance (CBM) policy based on well-organized machine learning techniques, using a soft competence model, in the process of improving the competence of our reduced case base. The intention of our CBM strategy is to shrink the volume of a case base while preserving as much as possible the performance and the competence of the CBR system. We support our approach with empirical evaluation using different benchmark data sets to show the effectiveness of our method in terms of shrinking the size of the case base and the research time, getting satisfying classification accuracy and improving the competence of the system.

It uses one-class classifiers as base learners. We prove, that despite the multi-class nature of hyperspectral images using one-class approach can be beneficial. One need simply to decompose a multi-class set into a number of simpler one-class tasks. One-class classifiers can handle difficulties embedded in the nature of the hyperspectral data, such as a large number of classes, class imbalance and noisy pixels. For this task, we utilise our novel ensemble, based on soft clustering of the object space. On the basis of each cluster, a weighted one-class classifier is constructed. We show a fast method for calculating weights assigned to each object, and for an automatic calculation of preferred number of clusters. We propose to build such ensemble for each of the classes and then to reconstruct the original multi-class hyperspectral image using Error-Correcting Output Codes. Experimental analysis, carried on a set of benchmark data and backed-up with an extensive statistical analysis, proves that our one-class ensemble is an efficient tool for handling hyperspectral images and outperforms several state-of-the-art binary and multi-class classifiers.

The race has recently become more about how to sift through torrents of data to find the hidden diamond and engineer a better, smarter and healthier world. The ease with which our mobile captures daily data about ourselves makes it an exceptionally suitable means for ultimately improving the quality of our lives and gaining valuable insights into our affective, mental and physical state. This paper takes the first exploratory step into this direction by using the mobile to process and analyze the "digital exhaust" it collects to automatically recognize our emotional states and accordingly respond to them in the most effective and "human" way possible. To achieve this we treat all technical, psycho-somatic, and cognitive aspects of emotion observation and prediction, and repackage all these elements into a mobile multimodal emotion recognition system that can be used on any mobile device.(1)	[Mousannif, Hajar] Cadi Ayyad Univ, LISI Lab, Fac Sci Semlalia, Marrakech 40000, Morocco	Mousannif, H (reprint author), Cadi Ayyad Univ, LISI Lab, Fac Sci Semlalia, BP 2390, Marrakech 40000, Morocco.	mousannif@uca.ma; Ismail.khalil@jku.at						37	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743		978-3-642-55032-4; 978-3-642-55031-7	LECT NOTES COMPUT SC			2014	8407						1	20				20	Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications	Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications	BB3EQ	WOS:000342740900003

In our analysis, we aim to explore different methods for optimizing the scoring problem in order to maximize the AUC. Not only are the existing methods pertaining to the use of the AUC to measure prediction accuracy evaluated, but the AUC is introduced as an objective function to optimize prediction accuracy directly. For the AUC approach, the coefficients are estimated by calculating the AUC measure using the Wilcoxon Mann Whitney and Nelder Mead algorithms. In a simulation study, we compare our new method to the logit model using different measures for predictive performance. The simulation study indicates the superiority of the AUC approach in cases where the logistic model assumption fails. From machine learning we explore boosting methods by additionally using the AUC as a loss function. Our evaluation of German retail credit data includes different performance measures and shows superior results in terms of the prediction accuracy of the boosting algorithms as well as the AUC approach compared with the most widely used logistic regression model.

While several metal-binding motifs have been defined, it remains challenging to confidently identify metalloproteins from primary protein sequences using computational approaches alone. Here, we describe a comprehensive strategy based on a machine learning approach to design and assess a penalized generalized linear model. We used this strategy to detect members of the iron-sulfur cluster protein family. A new category of descriptors, whose profile is based on profile hidden Markov models, encoding structural information was combined with public descriptors into a linear model. The model was trained and tested on distinct datasets composed of well-characterized iron-sulfur protein sequences, and the resulting model provided higher sensitivity compared to a motif-based approach, while maintaining a good level of specificity. Analysis of this linear model allows us to detect and quantify the contribution of each descriptor, providing us with a better understanding of this complex protein family along with valuable indications for further experimental characterization. Two newly-identified proteins, YhcC and YdiJ, were functionally validated as genuine iron-sulfur proteins, confirming the prediction. The computational model was then applied to over 550 prokaryotic genomes to screen for iron-sulfur proteomes; the results are publicly available at: http://biodev.extra.cea.fr/isph. This study represents a proof-of-concept for the application of a penalized linear model to identify metalloprotein superfamilies on a large-scale. The application employed here, screening for iron-sulfur proteomes, provides new candidates for further biochemical and structural analysis as well as new resources for an extensive exploration of iron-sulfuromes in the microbial world.

It provides a foundation for building owners to optimize not only the energy usage but also the operation to respond to the demand signals from smart grid. However, modeling energy consumption in traditional physic-modeling techniques remains a challenge. To address this issue, we present a data-mining-based methodology, as an alternative, for developing data-driven models to predict energy consumption for BEMSs. Following the methodology, we developed data-driven models for predicting energy consumption for a chiller in BEMS by using historic building operation data and weather forecast information. The models were evaluated with unseen data. The experimental results demonstrated that the data-driven models can predict energy consumption for chiller with promising accuracy.

Building such scripts requires time and expertise, and becomes harder as the domain becomes richer and more life-like. These downsides can be reduced by automatically generating behavior for CGFs using machine learning techniques. This paper focuses on Dynamic Scripting (DS), a technique tailored to generating agent behavior. DS searches for an optimal combination of rules from a rule base. Under the assumption that intra-team coordination leads to more effective learning, we propose an extension of DS, called DS+C, with explicit coordination. In a comparison with regular DS we find that the addition of team coordination results in earlier convergence to optimal behavior. In addition, we achieved a performance increase of 20% against an unpredictable opponent. With DS+ C, behavior for CGFs can be generated that is more effective since the CGFs act on knowledge achieved by coordination and the behavior converges more efficiently than with regular DS.

We start by calculating the risk factors associated with the outcome, followed by a prediction phase that utilises a random forest approach for classification into one of four obtained classes, namely low, mid, high, and moderate.

Our research addresses the process that must occur once the composition has completed and stakeholders must investigate historical and online operations/data flow to reengineer the process either offline or in real-time. This research introduces an effective reference model to assess the message flow of long-running service workflows. We examine Dynamic Bayesian Networks (dDBNs), a data-driven modeling technique employed in machine learning, to create service workflow reference models. Unlike other reference models, this method is not limited by static assumptions. We achieve this by including the trend and time varying variables in the model. We demonstrate this method using a flight dataset collected from various airlines.

However, two main challenging issues remain: the high dimension of data and the label correlation. In this paper, a new classification method, called penalized partial least squares discriminant analysis for multi-label learning (PPML), is proposed. It aims at performing dimension reduction and capturing the label correlations simultaneously. Specifically, PPML first identifies a latent space for the variable and label space via partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). To tackle with the problem of high dimensionality in solving PLS-DA, a ridge penalization is exerted on the optimization problem. After that, the latent space is used to construct learning model. The experimental results on the standard public data sets indicate that PPML has better performance than the state-of-the-art approaches.

Compared with the Internet, economy, industry, and aerospace fields, the application of big data in the area of architecture is relatively few. In this paper, on the basis of the actual data, the values of Boston suburb houses are forecast by several machine learning methods. According to the predictions, the government and developers can make decisions about whether developing the real estate on corresponding regions or not. In this paper, support vector machine (SVM), least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), and partial least squares (PLS) methods are used to forecast the home values. And these algorithms are compared according to the predicted results. Experiment shows that although the data set exists serious nonlinearity, the experiment result also show SVM and LSSVM methods are superior to PLS on dealing with the problem of nonlinearity. The global optimal solution can be found and best forecasting effect can be achieved by SVM because of solving a quadratic programming problem. In this paper, the different computation efficiencies of the algorithms are compared according to the computing times of relevant algorithms.

By extending the Laplacian of a graph constructed from hyperspectral imagery to incorporate barrier or cluster potentials, SE enables machine learning techniques that employ expert/labeled information provided at a subset of pixels. In this paper, we show how different types of nondiagonal potentials can be used within the SE framework in a way that allows for the integration of spatial and spectral information in unsupervised manifold learning and recovery. The nondiagonal potentials encode spatial proximity, which when combined with the spectral proximity information in the original graph, yields a framework that is competitive with state-of-the-art spectral/spatial fusion approaches for clustering and subsequent classification of hyperspectral image data.

While obtaining this knowledge through machine learning would require huge amounts of data, context is commonsense knowledge for people, so human computation is a better choice. We identify context using a game with a purpose that increases the workers' engagement in this complex task. With the contextual knowledge we obtain from only a small set of answers, we already halve the sentiment lexicons' performance gap relative to human performance.

Supervised methods mostly rely on a training data and rich linguistic resources that are either language-specific or generic. This study proposes a knowledge-poor approach to text categorization without using any sets of rules or language specific resources such as part-of-speech tagger or shallow parser. Knowledge-poor here refers to lack of a reasonable amount of background knowledge. The proposed system architecture takes data as-is and simply separates tokens by space. Documents represented in vector space models are used as training data for many machine learning algorithm. We empirically examined and compared a several factors from similarity metrics to learning algorithms in a variety of experimental setups. Although researchers believe that some particular classifiers or metrics are better than others for text categorization, the recent studies disclose that the ranking of the models purely depends on the class, experimental setup and domain as well. The study features extensive evaluation, comparison within a variety of experiments. We evaluate models and similarity metrics for Turkish language as one of the agglutinative language especially within poor-knowledge framework. It is seen that output of the study would be very beneficial for other studies.

In our view, while urban legends represent a form of "sticky" deceptive text, they are marked by a tension between the credible and incredible. They should be credible like a news article and incredible like a fairy tale. In particular we will focus on the idea that urban legends should mimic the details of news (who, where, when) to be credible, while they should be emotional and readable like a fairy tale to be catchy and memorable. Using NLP tools we will provide a quantitative analysis of these prototypical characteristics. We also lay out some machine learning experiments showing that it is possible to recognize an urban legend using just these simple features.

Sentence compression is useful in text summarization as it allows to remove redundant and irrelevant information hence preserve space for more relevant information. In this paper, we evaluate recent state-of-the-art sentence compression techniques that are based on syntax alone, a mixture of relevancy and syntax, part of speech feature based machine learning, keywords alone and a naive random word removal baseline. Results show that syntactic based techniques complemented by relevancy measures outperform all other techniques to preserve content in the task of text summarization. However, further analysis of human compressed sentences also shows that human compression techniques rely on world knowledge which is not captured by any automatic technique.

The features of the proposed model, which are lexical and syntactical (part of speech), were normalized to avoid that the model uses the length of the text as a predictor. In addition, the initial features were extended using n-grams representations and combined using machine learning techniques for regression (i.e. SMOreg). The proposed model was tested with collections of texts retrieved from Internet in Spanish, French and English, obtaining mean-absolute-error rates in the age-prediction task of 1.40, 1.20 and 1.72 years-old, respectively. Finally, we discuss the usefulness of this model to generate rankings of documents by written proficiency for each age.

Identification and classification of chemical entities are relatively more complex and challenging compared to the other related tasks. As chemical entities we focus on IUPAC and IUPAC related entities. The algorithm performs feature selection within the framework of a robust machine learning algorithm, namely Conditional Random Field. Features are identified and implemented mostly without using any domain specific knowledge and/or resources. In this paper we modify traditional differential evolution to perform two tasks, viz. determining relevant set of features as well as determining proper voting weights for constructing an ensemble. The feature selection technique produces a set of potential solutions on the final population. We develop many models of CRF using these feature combinations.

As such, they are frequently used to convey facts and opinions about the nouns they modify. Connecting nouns to the corresponding adjectives becomes vital for intelligent tasks such as aspect-level sentiment analysis or interpretation of complex queries (e.g., "small hotel with large rooms") for fine-grained information retrieval. To respond to the need, we propose a methodology that identifies dependencies of nouns and adjectives by looking at syntactic clues related to part-of-speech sequences that help recognize such relationships. These sequences are generalized into patterns that are used to train a binary classifier using machine learning methods. The capabilities of the new method are demonstrated in two, syntactically different languages: English, the leading language of international discourse, and Hebrew, whose rich morphology poses additional challenges for parsing. In each language we compare our method with a designated, state-of-the-art parser and show that it performs similarly in terms of accuracy while: (a) our method uses a simple and relatively small training set; (b) it does not require a language specific adaptation, and (c) it is robust across a variety of writing styles.

It plays a critical role in conversational Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) as it can increase the accuracy of assessing students' knowledge level, i.e. mental model, based on their natural language inputs. Although anaphora resolution is one of the most studied problems in Natural Language Processing, there are very few studies that focus on anaphora resolution in dialogue based ITSs. To this end, we present Deep Anaphora Resolution Engine++ (DARE++) that adapts and extends existing machine learning solutions to resolve pronouns in ITS dialogues.

It is usually based on clustering which necessitates defining a notion of similarity between the relevant entities. In this paper, we propose to divert a supervised machine learning technique (namely Conditional Random Fields, widely used for supervised labeling tasks) in order to calculate, indirectly and without supervision, similarities among text sequences. Our approach consists in generating artificial labeling problems on the data to reveal regularities between entities through their labeling. We describe how this framework can be implemented and experiment it on two information extraction/discovery tasks. The results demonstrate the usefulness of this unsupervised approach, and open many avenues for defining similarities for complex representations of textual data.

Their portable nature and the great exposure to security attacks, however, call out for stronger authentication mechanisms than simple password-based identification. Biometric authentication techniques have shown potential in this context. Unfortunately, prior approaches are either excessively prone to forgery or have too low accuracy to foster widespread adoption. In this paper, we propose sensor-enhanced keystroke dynamics, a new biometric mechanism to authenticate users typing on mobile devices. The key idea is to characterize the typing behavior of the user via unique sensor features and rely on standard machine learning techniques to perform user authentication. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we implemented an Android prototype system termed UNAGI. Our implementation supports several feature extraction and detection algorithms for evaluation and comparison purposes. Experimental results demonstrate that sensor-enhanced keystroke dynamics can improve the accuracy of recent gestured-based authentication mechanisms (i.e., EER > 0.5%) by one order of magnitude, and the accuracy of traditional keystroke dynamics (i.e., EER > 7%) by two orders of magnitude.

Many of these models are quite complex to enable just about any learner to get the optimum tailored experience possible. These systems have shown great results, typically at least one standard deviation (a letter grade) better than traditional training (e. g. [1] [2]). This complexity not only ensured that ITSs were successful, it also prohibited their widespread use (e. g. [3]). Results of studies in which the expert and system models were simplified show similar gains in effectiveness (e. g. [4] [5]), suggesting that lower-cost ITSs can be just as effective as those developed at higher costs. This paper compares the results of effectiveness studies in which the ITSs had various levels of fidelity and presents some recommended guidelines in determining the level of fidelity for student, expert, and system models of the ITS.

Among proven devices such as fmgerprint readers and cameras that can sense the human eye's iris pattern, we introduced a number of users to a sequence of 'grandmother images', or emotionally evoked stimuli-response images from other users, as well as one of their own, for the purpose of authentication. We performed testing and evaluation of the Authenticity Privacy and Security (APS) brainwave biometrics, similar to the internal organ of the human eye's iris which cannot easily be altered. 'Aha' recognition through stimulus-response habituation can serve as a biomarker, similar to keystroke dynamics analysis for inter and intra key fluctuation time of a memorized PIN number (FIST). Using a non-tethered Electroencephalogram (EEG) wireless smartphone/pc monitor interface, we explore the appropriate stimuli-response biomarker present in DTAB low frequency group waves. Prior to login, the user is shown a series of images on a computer display. They have been primed to click their mouse when the image is presented. DTAB waves are collected with a wireless EEG and are sent via Smartphone to a cloud based processing infrastructure. There, we measure fluctuations in DTAB waves from a wireless, non-tethered, single node EEG device between the Personal Graphic Image Number (PGIN) stimulus image and the response time from an individual's mental performance baseline. We hope Higher Order Statistics (HOS) in typing and PGIN can reveal intrinsic personal traits/habits and increase EEG specificity through stimulus-response neuro-biomarkers. Towards that goal, we describe an infrastructure that supports distributed verification for web-based EEG authentication. The performance of machine learning on the relative Power Spectral Density EEG data may uncover features required for subsequent access to web or media content. Our approach provides a scalable framework wrapped into a robust Neuro-Informatics toolkit, viable for use in the Biomedical and mental health communities, as well as numerous consumer applications.

The gold standard in Economic data manipulation techniques matured during a period of limited data access, and the new Large Data Analysis (LDA) paradigm we all face may quickly obfuscate most tools used by Economists. When coupled with an increased availability of numerous unstructured, multi-modal data sets, the impending 'data tsunami' could have serious detrimental effects for Economic forecasting, analysis, and research in general. Given this reality we propose a decision-aid framework for Augmented-LDA (A-LDA) a synergistic approach to LDA which combines traditional supervised, rule-based Machine Learning (ML) strategies to iteratively uncover hidden sources in large data, the artificial neural network (ANN) Unsupervised Learning (USL) at the minimum Helmholtz free energy for isothermal dynamic equilibrium strategies, and the Economic intuitions required to handle problems encountered when interpreting large amounts of Financial or Economic data. To make the ANN USL framework applicable to economics we define the temperature, entropy, and energy concepts in Economics from non-equilibrium molecular thermodynamics of Boltzmann viewpoint, as well as defining an information geometry, on which the ANN can operate using USL to reduce information saturation. An exemplar of such a system representation is given for firm industry equilibrium. We demonstrate the traditional ML methodology in the economics context and leverage firm financial data to explore a frontier concept known as behavioral heterogeneity. Behavioral heterogeneity on the firm level can be imagined as a firm's interactions with different types of Economic entities over time. These interactions could impose varying degrees of institutional constraints on a firm's business behavior. We specifically look at behavioral heterogeneity for firms that are operating with the label of 'Going-Concern' and firms labeled according to institutional influence they may be experiencing, such as constraints on firm hiring/spending while in a Bankruptcy or a Merger procedure. Uncovering invariant features, or behavioral data metrics from observable firm data in an economy can greatly benefit the FED, World Bank, etc. We find that the ML/LDA communities can benefit from Economic intuitions just as much as Economists can benefit from generic data exploration tools. The future of successful Economic data understanding, modeling, simulation, and visualization can be amplified by new A-LDA models and approaches for new and analogous models of Economic system dynamics The potential benefits of improved economic data analysis and real time decision aid tools are numerous for researchers, analysts, and federal agencies who all deal with increasingly large amounts of complex data to support their decision making.

Several derivatives of the k-nearest neighbours classifier to deal with multi-label data have been proposed. A k-nearest neighbours classifier has a high dependency with respect to the definition of a distance function, which is used to retrieve the k-nearest neighbours in feature space. The distance function is sensitive to irrelevant, redundant, and interacting or noise features that have a negative impact on the precision of the lazy algorithms. The performance of lazy algorithms can be significantly improved with the use of an appropriate weight vector, where a feature weight represents the ability of the feature to distinguish pattern classes. In this paper a filter-based feature weighting method to improve the performance of multi-label lazy algorithms is proposed. To learn the weights, an optimisation process of a metric is carried out as heuristic to estimate the feature weights. The experimental results on 21 multi-label datasets and 5 multi-label lazy algorithms confirm the effectiveness of the feature weighting method proposed for a better multi-label lazy learning.

MASCEM (Multi-Agent System for Competitive Electricity Markets) is a multiagent electricity market simulator that models market players and simulates their operation in the market. Market players are entities with specific characteristics and objectives, making their decisions and interacting with other players. This paper presents a methodology to provide decision support to electricity market negotiating players. This model allows integrating different strategic approaches for electricity market negotiations, and choosing the most appropriate one at each time, for each different negotiation context. This methodology is integrated in ALBidS (Adaptive Learning strategic Bidding System) - a multiagent system that provides decision support to MASCEM's negotiating agents so that they can properly achieve their goals. ALBidS uses artificial intelligence methodologies and data analysis algorithms to provide effective adaptive learning capabilities to such negotiating entities. The main contribution is provided by a methodology that combines several distinct strategies to build actions proposals, so that the best can be chosen at each time, depending on the context and simulation circumstances. The choosing process includes reinforcement learning algorithms, a mechanism for negotiating contexts analysis, a mechanism for the management of the efficiency/effectiveness balance of the system, and a mechanism for competitor players' profiles definition.

Supervised machine learning algorithms were used to predict if students would quit an upcoming text by analyzing reading behaviors observed in previous texts. Behavioral disengagement (quitting) at any point during the text was predicted with an accuracy of 76.5% (48% above chance), before students even began engaging with the text. We also predicted if a student would quit reading on the first page of a text or continue reading past the first page with an accuracy of 88.5% (29% above chance), as well as if students would quit sometime after the first page with an accuracy of 81.4% (51% greater than chance). Both actual quits and predicted quits were significantly related to learning, which provides some evidence for the predictive validity of our model. Implications and future work related to ITSs are also discussed.

Hence, automated methods that detect and combat mind wandering might be beneficial to learning. As an initial step in this direction, we propose to detect mind wandering by monitoring physiological measures of skin conductance and skin temperature. We conducted a study in which student's physiology signals were measured while they learned topics in research methods from instructional texts. Momentary self-reports of mind wandering were collected with standard probe-based methods. We computed features from the physiological signals in windows leading up to the probes and trained supervised classification models to detect mind wandering. We obtained a kappa, a measurement of accuracy corrected for random guessing, of .22, signaling feasibility of detecting MW in a student-independent manner. Though modest, we consider this result to be an important step towards fully-automated unobtrusive detection of mind wandering during learning.

The ability to stay focused while learning from instructional texts involves factors related to the text, to the task, and to the individual. This study explored the possibility that learners could be placed in optimal conditions (task and text) to reduce MW based on an analysis of individual attributes. Students studied four texts which varied along dimensions of value and difficulty while reporting instances of MW. Supervised machine learning techniques based on a small set of individual difference attributes determined the optimal condition for each participant with some success when considering value and difficulty separately (kappas of .16 and .24; accuracy of 59% and 64% respectively). Results are discussed in terms of creating a learning system that prospectively places learners in the optimal condition to increase learning by minimizing MW.

We compare speech act classification models trained and tested with contextual and non-contextual features (contents of the current utterance). The accuracy of the proposed models is high. A surprising finding is the modest role of context in automatically predicting the speech acts.

As part of a larger project aimed at deepening our understanding of student processes for integrating multiple sources of information, we are developing machine learning and natural language processing techniques for evaluating students' argumentative essays. In previous work, we have focused on identifying conceptual elements of the essays. In this paper, we present a method for inferring the causal structure of student essays. We used a standard parser to derive grammatical dependencies of the essay and converted them to logic statements. Then a simple inference mechanism was used to identify concepts linked to syntactic connectors by these dependencies. The results suggest that we will soon be able to provide explicit feedback that enables teachers and students to improve comprehension.

By combining IoT with smartphones, many convenient IoT services have been provided to users. However, there are adverse underlying effects in such services including invasion of privacy and information leakage. In most cases, mobile devices have become cluttered with important personal user information as various services and contents are provided through them. Accordingly, attackers are expanding the scope of their attacks beyond the existing PC and Internet environment into mobile devices. In this paper, we apply a linear support vector machine (SVM) to detect Android malware and compare the malware detection performance of SVM with that of other machine learning classifiers. Through experimental validation, we show that the SVM outperforms other machine learning classifiers.

J	Song, MK; Sarker, MMK				Song, Moon Kyou; Sarker, Md. Mostafa Kamal			Modeling and Implementing Two-Stage AdaBoost for Real-Time Vehicle License Plate Detection	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article							RAPID OBJECT DETECTION; FEATURES	License plate (LP) detection is the most imperative part of the automatic LP recognition system. In previous years, different methods, techniques, and algorithms have been developed for LP detection (LPD) systems. This paper proposes to automatical detection of car LPs via image processing techniques based on classifier or machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose a real-time and robust method for LPD systems using the two-stage adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm combined with different image preprocessing techniques. Haar-like features are used to compute and select features from LP images. The AdaBoost algorithm is used to classify parts of an image within a search window by a trained strong classifier as either LP or non-LP. Adaptive thresholding is used for the image preprocessing method applied to those images that are of insufficient quality for LPD. This method is of a faster speed and higher accuracy than most of the existing methods used in LPD. Experimental results demonstrate that the average LPD rate is 98.38% and the computational time is approximately 49 ms.	[Song, Moon Kyou; Sarker, Md.

Their inability to reason means that they don't consider the larger, constantly changing context outside their immediate inputs. Their nearsightedness is particularly dangerous because, in our complex systems, it is difficult to prevent all exploitable situations. Additionally, the lack of autonomous oversight of our systems means they are unable to fight through attacks. Keeping adversaries completely out of systems may be an unreasonable expectation, and our systems need to adapt to attacks and other disruptions to achieve their objectives. What is needed is an autonomous controller within the computer system that can sense the state of the system and reason about that state. In this paper, we present Self-Awareness Through Predictive Abstraction Modeling (SATPAM). SATPAM uses prediction to learn abstractions that allow it to recognize the right events at the right level of detail. These abstractions allow SATPAM to break the world into small, relatively independent, pieces that allow employment of existing reasoning methods. SATPAM goes beyond classification-based machine learning and statistical anomaly detection to be able to reason about the system, and SATPAM's knowledge representation and reasoning is more like that of a human. For example, humans intuitively know that the color of a car is not relevant to any mechanical problem, and SATPAM provides a plausible method whereby a machine can acquire such reasoning patterns. In this paper, we present the initial experimental results using SATPAM.
