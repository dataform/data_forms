Reinforcement Learning offers very efficient model-free methods which are often combined with approximation architectures to overcome these problems. We present a Q-learning implementation that uses a new adaptive clustering method to approximate state and actions sets. Experimental results for an obstacle avoidance behavior with the mobile robot Khepera are given.

Selective meta-leaming takes multiple learning schemes with the following different ways: bagging, boosting, cascading and stacking methods. On the other hand, constructive meta-leaming constructs the learning scheme proper to a given data set. We have implemented constructive meta-learning by recomposing methods into learning schemes with mining (inductive learning) method repositories that come from decomposition of popular mining algorithms. To evaluate our constructive meta-leaming, we have done the comparison of the performances of our constructive meta-learning and those of two stacking methods, using UCI/ML common data sets. It has shown us that our constructive meta-learning goes better than the two stacking methods. Furthermore, it turns out to be promising that we apply constructive meta-learning to meta-learner in selective meta-learning.

Indeed, it is difficult to monitor the students' learning behaviours. A solution is the exploitation of automatic tools for the generation and discovery of user profiles, to obtain a simple student model based on his/her learning performance and communication preferences, that in turn allows to create a personalized education environment. This paper focuses on Machine Learning approaches for inducing student profiles, respectively based on Inductive Logic Programming (the INTHELEX system) and on methods using numeric algorithms (the Profile Extractor system), to be exploited in this environment. Moreover, an experimental session has been carried out, comparing the effectiveness of these methods along with an evaluation of their efficiency in order to decide how to best exploit them in the induction of student profiles.

The transition probabilities of the Markov chain are learned from the musical sequences from which the patterns were extracted. These transitions determine which of the extracted patterns can follow other patterns. Our pattern matching phase considers three dimensions: time, pitch, and duration. Patterns of notes are considered to be equivalent under shifts in time, the baseline note of the pattern, and multiplicative changes of duration across all notes in the pattern; We give experimental results using classical music as training sequences to show the viability of our method in composing novel musical sequences.

Application of the standard machine learning techniques for user modeling seems appropriate and effective but they have drawbacks. The need for large labeled data, 'concept drift' concerns due to the dynamic nature of user's features. and computational complexity are the three major problems. Further, the standard machine learning techniques do not handle adequately the inherent incomplete, imprecise and uncertain knowledge about users. The objective of the study is for handling of uncertainty due to imprecision and vagueness in inferring a user's interest.. This study compares the effectiveness of the Neuro-fuzzy modeling approach to artificial neural network, decision tree induction, and the Naive Bayes. The results indicate that the Neuro-fuzzy modeling approach has potential and practical application in handling uncertainty and predicting a user interest in a Web Page and related pages.

It borrows various algorithms from statistics, machine learning, etc. We introduce in this paper a supervised clustering and classification algorithm (CCAS) and its application in learning patterns of normal and intrusive activities and detecting suspicious activity records. This algorithm utilizes a heuristic in grid-based clustering. Several post-processing techniques including data redistribution, supervised grouping of clusters, and removal of outliers, are used to enhance the scalability and robustness. This algorithm is applied to a large set of computer audit data for intrusion detection. We describe the analysis method in using this data set. The results show that CCAS makes significant improvement in performance with regard to detection ability and robustness.

While some of data analysis algorithms can work with incomplete data, a large portion of them require complete data. Therefore, different strategies, such as deletion of incomplete examples, and imputation (filling) of missing values through variety of statistical and machine learning (ML) procedures, are developed to preprocess the incomplete data. This study concentrates on performing experimental analysis of several algorithms for imputation of missing values, which range from simple statistical algorithms like mean and hot deck imputation to imputation algorithms that work based on application of inductive ML algorithms. Three major families of ML algorithms, such as probabilistic algorithms (e.g. Naive Bayes), decision tree algorithms (e.g. C4.5), and decision rule algorithms (e.g. CLIP4), are used to implement the ML based imputation algorithms. The analysis is carried out using a comprehensive range of databases, for which missing values were introduced randomly. The goal of this paper is to provide general guidelines on selection of suitable data imputation algorithms based on characteristics of the data. The guidelines are developed by performing a comprehensive experimental comparison of performance of different data imputation algorithms.

The classical prediction approach is to employ pairwise sequence alignments. However this method often faces difficulties when no statistically significant homologous sequences are identified. An alternative way is to predict protein function from sequence-derived features using machine learning. In this case the choice of possible features which can be derived from the sequence is of vital importance to ensure adequate discrimination to predict function. In this paper we have shown that carefully assessing the discriminative value of derived features by performing feature selection improves the performance of the prediction classifiers by eliminating irrelevant and redundant features. The subset selected from available features has also shown to be biologically meaningful as they correspond to features that have commonly been employed to assess biological function.

In the process of constructing a tree, the criteria of selecting partitional attributes will influence the classification accuracy of the tree. In this paper, we present a new concept, weighted mean roughness, which is based on rough set theory, for choosing attributes. The experimental result shows that compared with the entropy-based approach, our approach is a better way to select nodes for constructing decision trees.

However, improving performance of the classifier is still attractive. Combining multiple classifiers is an effective technique for improving accuracy. There are many general combining algorithms, such as Bagging, Boosting, or Error Correcting Output Coding that significantly improve the classifier such as decision trees, rule learners, or neural networks. Unfortunately, these combining methods do not improve the nearest neighbor classifiers. In this paper we present a new approach to combine multiple KNN classifiers based on different distance funtions, in which we apply multiple distance functions to improve the performance of the k-nearest neighbor classifier. The proposed algorithm seeks to increase generalization accuracy when compared to the basic k-nearest neighbor algorithm. Experiments have been conducted on some benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The results show that the proposed algorithm improves the performance of the k-nearest neighbor classification.

In this paper, we investigate application of the machine learning techniques of support vector machines and neural networks to the problem of amalgamating catalogues of galaxies as objects from two disparate data sources: radio and optical. Formulating this as a classification problem presents several challenges, including dealing with a highly unbalanced data set. Unlike the conventional approach to the problem (which is based on a likelihood ratio) machine learning does not require density estimation and is shown here to provide a significant improvement in performance. We also report some experiments that explore the importance of the radio and optical data features for the matching problem.

For quantitative evaluation of classification uncertainty, we use an Uncertainty Envelope dealing with the class posterior distribution and a given confidence probability. Counting the classifier outcomes, this technique produces feasible evaluations of the classification uncertainty. Using this technique in our experiments, we found that the Bayesian DT technique is superior to the randomised DT ensemble technique.

The method uses evolutionary computation to evolve feature transformation expressions, encoded in a form of fixed-length sequences of predefined elementary operations. Two variants of the method are proposed. One of them involves evolutionary computation for searching the space of possible solutions, whereas the other one engages cooperative coevolution for the same purpose. The results of extensive experimental evaluation on reference machine learning problems indicate superiority of the coevolutionary variety of the proposed approach.

To cope with missing knowledge, each agent can communicate to others and receive knowledge components nee-led for (default) reasoning. Such approach requires from the agents permanent acquiring and verification of both environmental and domain knowledge. In this paper we concentrate on agents learning capabilities.

BioPubMiner employs natural language processing techniques and machine learning based data mining techniques for mining useful biological information such as protein-protein interaction from the massive literature. The system recognizes biological terms such as gene, protein, and enzymes and extracts their interactions described in the document through natural language processing. The extracted interactions are further analyzed with a set of features of each entity that were collected from the related public database to infer more interactions from the original interactions.

In this environment, called AdapTIVE (Adaptive Three-dimensional Intelligent and Virtual Environment), an intelligent virtual agent assists users during navigation and retrieval of relevant information. The users' interests and preferences, represented in a user model, are used in the adaptation of environment structure. An automatic content categorization process, that applies machine-learning techniques, is used in the spatial organization of the contents in the environment. This is a promising approach for new and advanced forms of education, entertainment and e-commerce. In order to validate our approach, a case study of a distance-learning environment, used to make educational content available, is presented.

The goal of our project is to automate the acquisition of domain models for constraint-based tutors for both procedural and non-procedural tasks. We propose a three-phase approach: building a domain ontology, acquiring syntactic constraints directly from the ontology, and engaging the author in a dialog, in order to induce semantic constraints using machine learning techniques. An ontology is arguably easier to create than the domain model. Our hypothesis is that the domain ontology is also useful for reflecting on the domain, so would be of great importance for building constraints manually. This paper reports on an experiment performed in order to test this hypothesis. The results show that constraints sets built using a domain ontology are superior, and the authors who developed the ontology before constraints acknowledge the usefulness of an ontology in the knowledge acquisition process.

Thus, the information state that is maintained in DReSDeN represents the items that are currently being discussed as well as their interrelationships. This representation provides a structure for organizing the representation for the interwoven conversational threads [26] out of which the negotiation dialogue is composed. We are developing DReSDeN in the context of the CycleTalk tutorial dialogue system that supports the development of critical thinking and argumentation skills by engaging students in negotiation dialogues. We describe the role of DReSDeN in the CycleTalk tutorial dialogue system, currently under development. We then give a detailed description of DReSDeN's underlying algorithms and data structures, illustrated with a working example. We conclude with some early work in using machine learning techniques to adapt DReSDeN's behavior.

By using a pair of somewhat intelligent iterative-deepening, depth-first searches, we were able to generate production rules from a set of marked examples and domain background knowledge. Such production rules required independent searches for both the "if" and "then" portion of the rule. This automated rule generation allows generalized rules with a small number of suboperations to be generated in a reasonable amount of time, and provides nonprogrammer domain experts with a tool for developing Intelligent Tutoring Systems.

Machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to identify categories of errors and then to discriminate a new error in order to provide feedback to the student. However, remediation very often requires interpreting student errors in terms of knowledge in the context of a specific learning situation. This work is mainly concerned with this problem area. In this sense, we present here an approach to student diagnosis founded on a cognitive framework, called Conception Model, developed in the domain of educational research. The main issue about the Conception Model is the fact that it allows representing student errors in terms of knowledge applied to a learning context. We describe the main aspects of the student diagnosis system we have implemented, and then we evaluate the diagnosis results by comparing them to human diagnoses.

These features are the alignment score and alignment length of the best local alignment obtained in a database of known allergen sequences. Methods: In the work reported here a much more comprehensive statistical evaluation of the potential of these features was performed, this time for the prediction of allergenicity in general. The evaluation consisted of the following four key components. (1) A new high quality database consisting of 318 carefully selected, non-redundant allergens and 1,007 sequences carefully selected to be non-allergens. (2) Three different supervised algorithms: the kNN classifier, the Bayesian linear Gaussian classifier, and the Bayesian quadratic Gaussian classifier. (3) A large set of local alignment procedures defined using the FASTA3 alignment program by means of a wide range of different parameter settings. (4) Novel performance curves, alternative to conventional receiver-operating characteristic curves, to display not only average behaviors but also statistical variations due to small data sets. Results: The linear Gaussian classifier proved most useful among the tested supervised machine learning algorithms, closely followed by the quadratic Gaussian equivalent and kNN. The overall best classification results were obtained with a novel feature vector consisting of the combined alignment scores derived from local alignment procedures using different substitution matrices. Conclusions: The models reported here should be useful as a part of an integrated assessment scheme for potential protein allergenicity and for future comparisons with alternative bioinformatic approaches.

We record runtime properties of each request and apply automated machine learning and data mining techniques to identify the causes of failures. We train decision trees on the request traces from time periods in which user-visible failures are present. Paths through the tree are ranked according to their degree of correlation with failure, and nodes are merged according to the observed partial order of system components. We evaluate this approach using actual failures from eBay, and find that, among hundreds of potential causes, the algorithm successfully identifies 13 out of 14 true causes of failure, along with 2 false positives. We discuss some results in applying simplified decision trees on eBay's production site for several months. In addition, we give a cost-benefit analysis of manual vs. automated diagnosis systems. Our contributions include the statistical learning approach, the adaptation of decision trees to the context of failure diagnosis, and the deployment and evaluation of our tools on a high-volume production service.

Introduced in the early 90's, they led to an explosion of interest in machine learning. However, like most machine learning algorithms, they are generally applied using a selected training set classified in advance. With the repaid development of the internet and telecommunication, huge of information has been produced as digital data format, generally the data is unlabeled. It is impossible to classify the data with one's own hand one by one in many realistic problems, so that the research on unlabeled data classification has been grown. Improvements in databases technology, computing performance and artificial intelligence have contributed to the development of intelligent data analysis. In this paper, a SVMs classifier based on k-means algorithm is presented for the classification of unlabeled data.

The challenge of complex environments is therefore obvious. To cope with such environments, the promise of information customization systems is becoming highly attractive. In this paper we present a multi-agent system that customizes information by combining intelligent computing and communications, i.e., combining machine learning methods with Web mining techniques.

The Agent technology becomes hopeful approach to bridge the gap between humans and machines. Agents may be autonomous and intelligent entities that may travel among agents and human. They get the requirements from human or other agents, and offer an appropriate solution through consulting among them. The main difference between agent and ordinary software development is the issue of coordination, cooperation and learning. This issue is very important for utilizing the web information. In this paper, we attempt to give an overview and research challenges with respect to the combination of machine learning and agent technologies with Semantic Web from the perspective of interaction as well as interoperability among agents and humans.

This goal is achieved by integrating these algorithms within a Database Management System. We are thus only limited by disk capacity, and not by available main memory. However, the disk accesses that are necessary to scan the database induce long response times. Hence, we propose an original method to reduce the size of the learning set by building its contingency table. The machine learning algorithms are then adapted to operate on this contingency table. In order to validate our approach, we implemented the ID3 decision tree construction method and showed that using the contingency table helped us obtaining response times equivalent to those of classical, in-memory software.

To provide reliable and effective maintenance support, it is important for the airline companies to utilise previous repair experience with the aid of advanced decision support technology. Case-based reasoning (CBR) is a machine learning method that adapts previous similar cases to solve current problems. To effectively retrieve similar aircraft maintenance cases, this research proposes using a CBR system to aid electronic ballast fault diagnosis of Boeing 747-400 airplanes. By employing genetic algorithms (GA) to enhance dynamic weighting and the design of non-similarity functions, the proposed CBR system is able to achieve superior learning performance as compared to those with either equal/varied weights or linear similarity functions.

The multidisciplinary research agenda incorporates a variety of information technologies: networks; distributed systems; databases; image and video processing; and machine learning, together with subjective information obtained through social science. While the IT challenges focus on systems and algorithms to get the right information to the right person at the right time, social science provides the right context. Besides providing an overview of the nature of RESCUE research activities the paper highlights challenges of particular interest to the internet imaging community.

A lot of systems were introduced in order to achieve image indexation. One of the most common method is to compute a segmentation and to extract different parameters from regions. However, this segmentation step is based on low level knowledge, without taking into account simple perceptual aspects of images, like the blur. When a photographer decides to focus only on some objects in a scene, he certainly considers very differently these objects from the rest of the scene. It does not represent the same amount of information. The blurry regions may generally be considered as the context and not as the information container by image retrieval tools. Our idea is then to focus the comparison between images by restricting our study only on the non blurry regions, using then these meta data. Our aim is to introduce different features and a machine learning approach in order to reach blur identification in scene images.

This framework allows radiologists to remotely diagnose and share expert knowledge about lung HRCT interpretation, which is then used to develop a Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system for lung disease. In this paper, we describe the knowledge acquisition system LMIK, which is Internet-based and platform-independent. The LMIK utilises the Internet to provide users with secure access to patient and research data and facilitates communication among highly qualified radiologists and researchers. It is currently used by five radiologists and over 20 researchers and has proved to be an invaluable research tool. Research is underway to develop computer algorithms for automatic diagnosis of lung diseases. In future, these algorithms will be integrated into LMIK to equip it with CAD capabilities to improve diagnostic accuracy of radiologists and extend availability of expert clinical knowledge to wider communities.

We present an experiment on such a new technique to segregate old and young stellar populations in galactic spectra using machine learning methods. We used an ensemble of classifiers, each classifier in the ensemble specializes in young or old populations and was trained with locally weighted regression and tested using ten-fold cross-validation. Since the relevant information concentrates in certain regions of the spectra we used the method of sequential floating backward selection offline for feature selection. Very interestingly, the application to Seyfert galaxies proved that this technique is very insensitive to the dilution by the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) continuum. Comparing with exhaustive search we concluded that both methods are similar in terms of accuracy but the machine learning method is faster by about two orders of magnitude.

In this framework, the nodes of the sensor network collaborate to optimally fit a global function to each of their local measurements. The algorithm is based upon kernel linear regression, where the model takes the form of a weighted sum of local basis functions; this provides an expressive yet tractable class of models for sensor network data. Rather than transmitting data to one another or outside the network, nodes communicate constraints on the model parameters, drastically reducing the communication required. After the algorithm is run, each node can answer queries for its local region, or the nodes can efficiently transmit the parameters of the model to a user outside the network. We present an evaluation of the algorithm based upon data from a 48-node sensor network deployment at the Intel Research - Berkeley Lab, demonstrating that our distributed algorithm converges to the optimal solution at a fast rate and is very robust to packet losses.

Dot gain tables are currently updated sporadically, and between updates colors can shift due to process drift in the press. The goal of this investigation is to dynamically control the dot gain table and developer voltage to ensure more consistent color control while minimizing waste and calibration measurements. In this article we approach the elements of this calibration process as a series of machine-learning problems and investigate the efficacy of replacing physical calibration measurements with model-based predictions. The current state of the machine, expressed as sensor measurements, are used to model both the developer voltage, and the subsequent dot gain look up table. We also consider models that make a prediction based on a restricted set of calibration measurements, not necessarily including the full machine state vector. Our initial investigation using a preliminary dataset shows that machine learning methods are suitable for predicting the dot gain table.

The concept of adaptation differs from the concept of intelligence and they do not necessarily associated with each other. Agent adaptation is classified into three categories: internal, external and complete. Internal adaptation is concerned with the problem-solving algorithm; however, external adaptation is concerned with changes in the agent environment. The paper presents an automated travel agent that performs adaptive tasks using the AQDT-2 system for learning task-oriented decision structures. The AQDT-2 system can optimize the learning process according to a set of costs. The system allows defining costs for attributes, decisions, cases, and learning criteria. The system offers alternative decisions whenever it is impossible to reach an exact decision. Another application is presented for identification agent. The identification agent is implemented to recognize faces through pictures. The agent utilizes multiple classifiers to speed up the recognition process. The agent uses some of these classifiers to select the best classifier to recognize the given object. Other classifiers are used for identifying the object. The concept of adaptation is illustrated through out the two examples.

It is a very important in a variety of engineering and scientific disciplines such as computer vision, artificial intelligence, medicine. New and emerging applications, such as web searching, multimedia data retrieval, data mining, and machine learning require robust and efficient pattern classification techniques. Recently, functional network has been proposed as a generalization of the standard neural network. In this paper we are interested in dealing with the statistical pattern recognition via functional networks and investigate its performance using some real-world applications. We use functional equations to approximate the neuron functions, which allows a wide class of functions to be presented. The steps of working with functional networks and the structural learning is proposed.

In this paper, two machine-learning paradigms, Artificial Neural Networks and Fuzzy Inference System, are used to design an Intrusion Detection System. SNORT is used to perform real time traffic analysis and packet logging on IP network during the training phase of the system. Then a signature pattern database is constructed using protocol analysis and Neuro-Fuzzy learning method. Using 1998 DARPA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Data and TCP dump raw data, the experiments are deployed and discussed.

There are two main approaches for intrusion detection: signature-based and anomaly-based. Signature-based detection employs pattern matching to match attack signatures with observed data making it ideal for detecting known attacks. However it cannot detect unknown attacks for which there is no signature available. Anomaly-based detection uses machine-learning techniques to create a profile of normal system behavior and uses this profile to detect deviations from the normal behavior Although this technique is effective in detecting unknown attacks, it has a drawback of a high false alarm rate. In this paper we describe our anomaly-based IDS designed for detecting malicious' use of cryptographic and application-level protocols. Our system has several unique characteristics and benefits, such as the ability to monitor cryptographic protocols and application-level protocols embedded in encrypted sessions, a very lightweight, monitoring process, and the ability to react to protocol misuse by modifying protocol response directly.

Machine Learning (ML) based document classification is now the prevalent approach. However, classification by ML may not keep the same performance because the knowledge generated from the training set may not be appropriate for certain types of web information. People are often concerned more about the newly uploaded information such as web based online news than information already available. This explains why it is not widely used in real applications. However, the manual classification method, by the domain users, cannot be a solution either until the knowledge acquisition bottleneck issue is resolved Multiple Classification Ripple Down Rules, an incremental knowledge acquisition method, is suggested to overcome this problem with fast learning and low cost maintenance.

In routine learning, already recognized contexts are utilized in modeling the user behavior. The methodology is presented via a use case scenario. Data collected from various ubiquitous sensors are used in recognizing and defining contexts, and association rules determine the routines. The focus is on testing the suitability of the Apriori algorithm for this application area. Several useful routines were derived from the user data, and the results show that data mining can be utilized in pervasive computing.

Many different ad-hoc models have been built in user modeling as well as in student modeling, using either expert knowledge elicitation or machine learning techniques but none of these methods is perfectly adapted to the case of student modeling. Moreover, the evolution of the student cognitive state only leads to probability update in these models, whereas we think that the topology of the network should also vary in order to reflect the changes in the student knowledge structure. In this paper, we propose a general framework for embedding different Bayesian network student models in an architecture that handles transitions between them and dynamic adaptation to the learner. We aim at specifying and developing an application that could provide help to build such models without having to deal with the difficulties of using belief networks.

The method enables quick simple and accurate prediction of a and)6 protein folds on a personal computer by means of few binary patterns of coded amino acid and nucleotide physicochemical properties. The algorithm was tested with machine learning SMO (sequential minimal optimisation) classifier for the support vector machines and classification trees, on a dataset of 140 dissimilar protein folds. Depending on the method of testing, the overall classification accuracy was 91.43% - 100% and the tenfold cross-validation result of the procedure was 83.57% > 90%. Genetic code randomisation analysis based on 100,000 different codes tested for the protein fold prediction quality indicated that: a) there is a very low chance of p = 2.7 x 10(-4) that a better code than the natural one specified by the binary coding algorithm is randomly produced, b) dipeptides represent basic protein units with respect to the natural genetic code defining of the secondary protein structure.

Many technologies have been implemented for primary screening, but less has been done to improve the secondary screening process. This paper introduces two methods that may aid in detecting deception during the interviews characteristic of secondary screening. First, message feature mining uses message features or cues combined with machine learning techniques to classify messages according to their deceptive potential. Second, speech act profiling, a method for quantifying and visualizing entire conversations, has shown promise in aiding deception detection. These methods may be combined and are intended to be a part of a suite of tools for automating deception detection.

With this knowledge of driver's workload, the in-vehicle information systems (IVIS) can provide information when the driver has the spare capacity to receive and comprehend it, which is both effective and efficient. However, after years of study, it is still difficult to build a robust DWE system. In this paper, we analyze the difficulties facing the existing methodology of developing DWE systems and propose a machine-learning-based DWE development process. Some preliminary but promising results are reported using a popular machine-learning method, decision tree.

It is considered that a state of damage can be modeled as reduction in stiffness. The task is to determine the magnitude and location of damage. In a composite plate that is discretized into a set of finite elements, if a j(th) element is damaged, the GA based technique will predict the reduction in E-x and E-y and the location j. The fact that the natural frequency decreases with decrease in stiffness is made use of in the method. The natural frequency of any two modes of the damaged plates for the assumed damage parameters is facilitated by the use of Eigen sensitivity analysis. The Eigen value sensitivities are the derivatives of the Eigen values with respect to certain design parameters. If omega(iu) is the natural frequency of the i(th) mode of the undamaged plate and COW is that of the damaged plate, with deltaomega(i) as the difference between the two, while 84 is a similar difference in the k(th) mode, R is defined as the ratio of the two. For a random selection of E-x, E-y and j, a ratio R-i is obtained. A proper combination of E-x, E-y and j which makes R-i - R = 0 is obtained by Genetic Algorithm.

Digital libraries are created to facilitate search and retrieval of information supplied by the documents. These libraries may span an entire area of interest (e.g., computer science) or be limited to documents within a small organization. While tools that index, classify, rank and retrieve documents from such libraries are important, it would be worthwhile to complement these tools with information available on the Web. We propose one such technique that uses a topical crawler driven by the information extracted from a research document. The goal of the crawler is to harvest a collection of Web pages that are focused on the topical subspaces associated with the given document. The collection created through Web crawling is further processed using lexical and linkage analysis. The entire process is automated and uses machine learning techniques to both guide the crawler as well as analyze the collection it fetches. A report is generated at the end that provides visual cues and information to the researcher.	Univ Iowa, Dept Management Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA							Aggarwal C.

Under the auspices of the GovStat Project, our goal is to identify a small number of semantically valid concepts that adequately spans the intellectual domain of a collection. The goal of this discovery is twofold. First we desire a practical aid for information architects. Second, automatically derived document-concept relationships are a necessary precondition for realworld deployment of many dynamic interfaces. The current study compares concept learning strategies based on three document representations: keywords, titles, and full-text. In statistical and user-based studies, human-created keywords provide significant improvements in concept learning over both title-only and full-text representations.

One of the pivotal issues in this domain is uncertainty about hotel prices, which have a significant influence on the relative cost of alternative trip schedules. Thus, virtually all participants employ some method for predicting hotel prices. We survey approaches employed in the tournament, finding that agents apply an interesting diversity of techniques, taking into account differing sources of evidence bearing on prices. Based on data provided by entrants on their agents' actual predictions in the TAC-02 finals and semifinals, we analyze the relative efficacy of these approaches. The results show that taking into account game-specific information about flight prices is a major distinguishing factor. Machine learning methods effectively induce the relationship between flight and hotel prices from game data, and a purely analytical approach based on competitive equilibrium analysis achieves equal accuracy with no historical data. Employing a new measure of prediction quality, we relate absolute accuracy to bottom-line performance in the game.

J	Stanley, KO; Miikkulainen, R				Stanley, KO; Miikkulainen, R			Competitive coevolution through evolutionary complexification	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article							VERTEBRATE GENOME EVOLUTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; GENETIC-RECOMBINATION; STRAND-EXCHANGE; DUPLICATIONS; MODELS	Two major goals in machine learning are the discovery and improvement of solutions to complex problems. In this paper, we argue that complexification, i.e. the incremental elaboration of solutions through adding new structure, achieves both these goals. We demonstrate the power of complexification through the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) method, which evolves increasingly complex neural network architectures. NEAT is applied to an open-ended coevolutionary robot duel domain where robot controllers compete head to head. Because the robot duel domain supports a wide range of strategies, and because coevolution benefits from an escalating arms race, it serves as a suitable testbed for studying complexification. When compared to the evolution of networks with fixed structure, complexifying evolution discovers significantly more sophisticated strategies. The results suggest that in order to discover and improve complex solutions, evolution, and search in general, should be allowed to complexify as well as optimize.

J	Bruha, I				Bruha, I			Meta-learner for unknown attribute values processing: Dealing with inconsistency of meta-databases	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems (ISMIS 2002)	JUN 27-29, 2002	LYON, FRANCE	Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Univ Lumiere Lyon 2, Inst Natl Sci Appl Lyon		unknown attribute value processing; meta-learning; meta-combiner; meta-classifier; base classifiers		Efficient robust data mining algorithms should comprise some routines for processing unknown (missing) attribute values when acquiring knowledge from real-world databases because these data usually contain a certain percentage of missing values. The paper Bruha and Franek (1996) figures out that each dataset has more or less its own `favourite' routine for processing unknown attribute values. It evidently depends on the magnitude of noise and source of unknownness in each dataset. One possibility how to choose an efficient routine for processing unknown attribute values for a given database is exhibited in this paper. The covering machine learning algorithm CN4, a large extension of the well-known CN2 algorithm, is used here as an inductive vehicle. Each of the six routines for unknown attribute value processing ( which are available in CN4) is used independently in order to process a given database. Afterwards, a meta-learner is used to derive a meta-classifier that makes up the overall (final) decision about the class of input unseen objects. The entire system is called a meta-combiner. The meta-database that is formed for the meta-learner could be inconsistent which could decrease the performance of the entire meta-classifier. Therefore, the existing meta-system (Meta-CN4) has been enhanced by a `purification' procedure that appropriately solves up the conflict of inconsistent meta-data. The paper first surveys the CN4 algorithms including its six routines for unknown attribute value processing. Afterwards, it introduces the methodology of the meta-learner including its enhancement that solves inconsistent meta-databases. Finally, the results of experiments with various percentages of unknown attribute values on real-world data are presented and performances of the meta-classifier and the six base classifiers are then compared. The paper also explains the difference between the meta-combiner (meta-learner) described here and the cross-validation procedure used for obtaining the classification accuracy.

Unfortunately some databases contain noisy data which perturb the generalization of the models. An important source of noise consists of mislabelled training instances. We offer a new approach which deals with improving classification accuracies by using a preliminary filtering procedure. An example is suspect when in its neighbourhood defined by a geometrical graph the proportion of examples of the same class is not significantly greater than in the database itself. Such suspect examples in the training data can be removed or relabelled. The filtered training set is then provided as input to learning algorithms. Our experiments on ten benchmarks of UCI Machine Learning Repository using 1-NN as the final algorithm show that removal gives better results than relabelling. Removing allows maintaining the generalization error rate when we introduce from 0 to 20% of noise on the class, especially when classes are well separable. The filtering method proposed is finally compared to the relaxation relabelling schema.

The embedding is performed implicitly, by specifying the inner products between each pair of points in the embedding space. This information is contained in the so-called kernel matrix, a symmetric and positive semidefinite matrix that encodes the relative positions of all points. Specifying this matrix amounts to specifying the geometry of the embedding space and inducing a notion of similarity in the input space-classical model selection problems in machine learning. In this paper we show how the kernel matrix can be learned from data via semidefinite programming (SDP) techniques. When applied to a kernel matrix associated with both training and test data this gives a powerful transductive algorithm- using the labeled part of the data one can learn an embedding also for the unlabeled part. The similarity between test points is inferred from training points and their labels. Importantly, these learning problems are convex, so we obtain a method for learning both the model class and the function without local minima. Furthermore, this approach leads directly to a convex method for learning the 2-norm soft margin parameter in support vector machines, solving an important open problem.

J	Bakker, B; Heskes, T				Bakker, B; Heskes, T			Task clustering and gating for Bayesian multitask learning	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						empirical Bayes; multitask learning; mixture of experts; multilevel analysis	GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS; HIERARCHICAL MIXTURES; EM ALGORITHM; EXPERTS; ISSUES	Modeling a collection of similar regression or classification tasks can be improved by making the tasks 'learn from each other'. In machine learning, this subject is approached through 'multitask learning', where parallel tasks are modeled as multiple outputs of the same network. In multilevel analysis this is generally implemented through the mixed-effects linear model where a distinction is made between 'fixed effects', which are the same for all tasks, and 'random effects', which may vary between tasks. In the present article we will adopt a Bayesian approach in which some of the model parameters are shared (the same for all tasks) and others more loosely connected through a joint prior distribution that can be learned from the data. We seek in this way to combine the best parts of both the statistical multilevel approach and the neural network machinery. The standard assumption expressed in both approaches is that each task can learn equally well from any other task. In this article we extend the model by allowing more differentiation in the similarities between tasks. One such extension is to make the prior mean depend on higher-level task characteristics. More unsupervised clustering of tasks is obtained if we go from a single Gaussian prior to a mixture of Gaussians. This can be further generalized to a mixture of experts architecture with the gates depending on task characteristics. All three extensions are demonstrated through application both on an artificial data set and on two real-world problems, one a school problem and the other involving single-copy newspaper sales.

Particularly in e-learning a main issue is student modeling, that is the analysis of student behavior and prediction of his/her future behavior and learning performance. In fact, nowadays, the most prevailing issue in the e-learning environment is that it is not easy to monitor students' learning behaviors. In this paper we have focused our attention on the system ( the Profile Extractor) based on Machine Learning techniques, which allows for the discovery of preferences, needs and interests of users that have access to an e- learning system. The automatic generation and the discovery of the user profile, to agree as simple student model based on the learning performance and the communication preferences, allow creating a personalized education environment. Moreover, we presented an evaluation of the accuracy of the Profile Extractor system using the classical Information Retrieval metrics.

The key capability of such learning systems is the efficency with respect to the number of interactions with the real system.

In this paper we present a system that allows a user to re-rank the results locally by augmenting a query with positive example pages. Since it is not always easy to come up with many example pages, our system aims to work with only a couple of positive training examples and without any negative ones. Our approach creates artificial (virtual) negative examples based upon the returned pages and the example pages before the training commences. The list of results is then re-ordered according to the outcome from the machine learner. We have further shown that our system performs sufficiently well even if the example pages belong to a slightly different (but related) domain.

The automatic text classification systems implement machine learning algorithms and need training samples. In commercial applications however, the automatic categorization appear to come up against limiting factors. For example, it turns out to be difficult to reduce the sample complexity without the categorization quality in terms of recall and precision will suffer. Instead of trying to fully replace the human work by machine, it could be more effective and ultimately efficient to let human and machine cooperate. So we have developed a categorization workbench to realise synergy between manual and machine categorization. To compare the categorization workbench with common automatic classification systems, the automatic categorizer of the IBM DB2 Information Integrator for Content has been chosen for tests. The test results show that, benefiting from the incorporation of user's domain knowledge, the categorization workbench can improve the recall by a factor of two till four with the same number of training samples as the automatic categorizer uses. Further, to get a comparable categorization quality, the categorization workbench just needs an eighth till a quarter of the training samples as the automatic categorizer does.

Put another way, genre classification is orthogonal to a classification based on the documents' contents. While most of the existing investigations of an automated genre classification are based on news articles corpora, the idea here is applied to arbitrary Web pages. We see genre classification as a powerful instrument to bring Web-based search services closer to a user's information need. This objective raises two questions: 1. What are useful genres when searching the WWW? 2. Can these genres be reliably identified? The paper in hand presents results from a user study on Web genre usefulness as well as results from the construction of a genre classifier using discriminant analysis, neural network learning, and support vector machines. Particular attention is turned to a classifier's underlying feature set: Aside from the standard feature types we introduce new features that are based on word frequency classes and that can be computed with minimum computational effort. They allow us to construct compact feature sets with few elements, with which a satisfactory genre diversification is achieved. About 70% of the Web-documents are assigned to their true genre; note in this connection that no genre classification benchmark for Web pages has been published so far.

LEM can be very successful at accelerating the evolutionary optimization of multivariable mathematical functions, but appears to fail to accelerate the evolution of neural networks [Aleti & de Garis 2004]. This paper reports on experiments comparing the evolution times of mathematical optimization problems with those of neural network evolution problems, where the bit string chromosomes of both sets of problems are the same, to see if there is something special about neural network chromosomes that make them unsuitable to have their evolution accelerated.

In this paper we explore the use of a machine learning method based on decision trees using CART for verifying clinically established diagnostic criteria and also for seeking new criteria in different autopsy-confirmed Parkinsonian disorders. Since differentiating various types of Parkinsonian disorders can often present great difficulties due to the overlapping of clinical signs and symptoms, we present a strategy for extracting additional attributes from our database. From the clinical point of view, we obtained interesting results that confirm the importance of already established diagnostic criteria, but we also found some attributes (signs and symptoms) which deserve closer clinical observation. The compatibility of results obtained by our method with those from already established clinical criteria speaks in favor of the validity of the method.

However in some cases ensemble construction algorithms do not improve the classification accuracy. Mostly ensembles are constructed using specific machine learning method or a combination of methods, the drawback being that the combination of methods or selection of the appropriate method for a specific problem must be made by the user. To overcome this problem we invented a novel approach where ensemble of classifiers is constructed by a self-organizing system applying cellular automata (CA). First results are promising and show that in the iterative process of combining the classifiers in the CA, a combination of methods can occur, that leads to superior accuracy.

We use the Naive Bayes classifier, the rule-induction algorithm C4.5 and a recently introduced classifier named random forest (RF). We first employ image processing to standardize the images, eliminating the effects of orientation and scale, then perform principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the data, and finally, classify the galaxy images. Our experiments show that RF obtains the best results considering three, five and seven galaxy types.

For most of that century, data analysis was the realm of only one discipline - statistics. As a consequence of the development of the computer, things have changed dramatically and now there are several such disciplines, including machine learning, pattern recognition, and data mining. This paper looks at some of the similarities and some of the differences between these disciplines, noting where they intersect and, perhaps of more interest, where they do not. Particular issues examined include the nature of the data with which they are concerned, the role of mathematics, differences in the objectives, how the different areas of application have led to different aims, and how the different disciplines have led sometimes to the same analytic tools being developed, but also sometimes to different tools being developed. Some conjectures about likely future developments are given.

This is crucial in decision making tasks. Procedures for calibration have already been studied in weather forecasting, game theory, and more recently in machine learning, with the latter showing empirically that calibration of classifiers helps not only in decision making, but also improves classification accuracy. In this paper we extend the theoretical foundation of these empirical observations. We prove that (1) a well calibrated classifier provides bounds on the Bayes error (2) calibrating a classifier is guaranteed not to decrease classification accuracy, and (3) the procedure of calibration provides the threshold or thresholds on the decision rule that minimize the classification error. We also draw the parallels and differences between methods that use receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration based procedures that are aimed at finding a threshold of minimum error. In particular, calibration leads to improved performance when multiple thresholds exist.

Additionally, the class distribution of the training set often does not match the target distribution. In this paper we compare the performance of many learning models on a substantial benchmark of binary text classification tasks having small training sets. We vary the training size and class distribution to examine the learning surface, as opposed to the traditional learning curve. The models tested include various feature selection methods each coupled with four learning algorithms: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Multinomial Naive Bayes. Different models excel in different regions of the learning surface, leading to meta-knowledge about which to apply in different situations. This helps guide the researcher and practitioner when facing choices of model and feature selection methods in, for example, information retrieval settings and others.

In this article, we propose to use text mining techniques to automate processing of data found in scientific text databases. The watch activity introduces an unusual difficulty compared with conventional areas of application for text mining techniques since, instead of searching for frequent knowledge hidden in the texts, the target is unexpected knowledge. As a result, the usual measures used for knowledge discovery have to be revised. For that purpose, we have developed the UnexpectedMiner system using new measures for to estimate the unexpectedness of a document. Our system is evaluated using a base that contains articles relating to the field of machine learning.

A relaxed setting for Feature Selection is known as Feature Ranking, ranking the features with respect to their relevance. This paper proposes an ensemble approach for Feature Ranking, aggregating feature rankings extracted along independent runs of an evolutionary learning algorithm named ROGER. The convergence of ensemble feature ranking is studied in a theoretical perspective, and a statistical model is devised for the empirical validation, inspired from the complexity framework proposed in the Constraint Satisfaction domain. Comparative experiments demonstrate the robustness of the approach for learning (a limited kind of) non-linear concepts, specifically when the features significantly outnumber the examples.

In order not to include all data as submitted, one possible alternative consists of performing the annotation manually. A less resource demanding alternative is automatic annotation. The latter helps the curator since predicting the properties of each protein sequence manually is turning a bottleneck, at least for protein databases. Machine Learning - ML - techniques have been used to generate automatic annotation and to help curators. A challenging problem for automatic annotation is that traditional ML algorithms assume a balanced training set. However, real-world data sets are predominantly imbalanced (skewed), i.e., there is a large number of examples of one class compared with just few examples of the other class. This is the case for protein databases where a large number of proteins is not annotated for every feature. In this work we discuss some over and under-sampling techniques that deal with class imbalance. A new method to deal with this problem that combines two known over and under-sampling methods is also proposed. Experimental results show that the symbolic classifiers induced by C4.5 on data sets after applying known over and under-sampling methods, as well as the new proposed method are always more accurate than the ones induced from the original imbalanced data sets. Therefore, this is a step towards producing more accurate rules for automating annotation.

It helps give an indication of what has occurred and why. In some cases this can be obvious however, this is not always the case. This process of extracting useful knowledge from data can be enhanced by using techniques like machine learning and data mining. Given the speed and ease of these computerised techniques, the more beneficial it becomes to store and analysis data which may contain vital knowledge. Medical domains have been using a variety of machine learning tools for some time, such examples as: classification trees, neural networks. These allow an algorithm to analysis data in relation to a concept and learn and present knowledge specific to that concept. However, the next challenge in this area is not only to automate the learning of these concepts, but to adapt to changes in them i.e. concept drift. These changes can occur over time: different stages of disease progression, or it may be triggered by some controlled change: changes in a drug being used. The changes can be immediate (revolutionary) or over a period of time (evolutionary). Changes in data with automated learning can now be handled by the algorithm CD3. CD3 will detect drift, highlight specifically which sections of the knowledge have changed/drifted and remove the examples that are no longer valid This is all done automatically without any intervention from the user.

Machine Learning (ML) in general, and lazy learning techniques in particular, have been applied to the task of predictive toxicology. ML approaches differ in which kind of chemistry knowledge they use but all rely on some specific representation of chemical compounds. In this paper we deal with one specific issue of molecule representation, the multiplicity of descriptions that can be ascribed to a particular compound. We present a new approach to lazy learning, based on the notion of multiple-instance, which is capable of seamlessly working with multiple descriptions. Experimental analysis of this approach is presented using the Predictive Toxicology Challenge data set.

RA includes set-theoretic modeling of relations and information-theoretic modeling of frequency and probability distribution. It thus encompasses both statistical and nonstatistical problems. It overlaps with logic design and machine learning in engineering and with log-linear modeling in the social sciences. Its generality gives it considerable potential for knowledge representation and data mining.

Also, it was previously shown that whenever decomposition exists in both AM and CRA, MRA yields simpler or equal complexity decompositions. In this paper, AM is extended to many-valued logic functions, and logic structures that correspond to such decomposition are developed It is shown that many-valued AM can decompose many-valued functions when CRA fails to do so. Since real-fife data are often many-valued, this new decomposition can be useful for machine learning and data mining. Many-valued MRA can also be applied for the decomposition of relations.

MRA is superior to conventional reconstructability analysis, i.e. it decomposes more NPN functions. MA is compared to Ashenhurst-Curtis (A Q decomposition using two different complexity measures: log-functionality, a measure suitable for machine learning, and the count of the total number of two-input gates, a measure suitable for circuit design. MRA is superior to AC using the first of these measures, and is comparable to, but different from AC, using the second.

Most of mainstream data mining tools are not applicable in the more challenging task of finding knowledge in structured data represented by a multi-relational database. Although a family of methods known as inductive logic programming have been developed to tackle that challenge by immediate means, the idea of adapting structured data into a simpler form digestible by the wealth of AVL systems has been always tempting to data miners. To this end, we present a method based on constructing first-order logic features that conducts this kind of conversion, also known as propositionalization. It incorporates some basic principles suggested in previous research and provides significant enhancements that lead to remarkable improvements in efficiency of the feature-construction process. We begin by motivating the propositionalization task with an illustrative example, review some previous approaches to propositionalization, and formalize the concept of a first-order feature elaborating mainly the points that influence the efficiency of the designed feature-construction algorithm.

To that end, we evaluated three statistical models: Regression Tree Analysis (RTA), Bagging Trees (BT) and Random Forest (RF) for their utility in predicting the distributions of four tree species under current and future climate. RTA's single tree was the easiest to interpret but is less accurate compared to BT and RF which use multiple regression trees with resampling and resampling-randomisation respectively. Future estimates of suitable habitat following climate change were also improved with BT and RF, with a slight edge to RF because it better smoothes the outputs in a logical gradient fashion. We recommend widespread use of these tools for GIS-based vegetation mapping.

A convergent scheduler is composed of many independent passes, each of which implements a specific compiler heuristic. Each of the passes shares a common interface, which allows them to be run multiple times, and in any order. Because of this, a convergent scheduler is presented with a vast number of legal pass orderings. In this work, we use machine learning techniques to automatically search for good, orderings. We do so by evolving, through genetic programming, s-expressions that describe a particular pass sequence. Our system has the flexibility to create dynamic sequences where the ordering of the passes is predicated upon characteristics of the program being compiled. In particular, we implemented a few tests on the present state of the code being compiled. We are able to find improved sequences for a range of clustered architectures. These sequences were tested with cross-validation, and generally outperform Desoli's PCC and UAS.

Many algorithms for resource management in sensor networks require complete knowledge of the external environment and the sensor network system, and are rule-based; this restricts their use in dynamic environments. We present an event based control optimization formulation of the resource management problem and discuss a method to adoptively change desired system performance of the sensor network in response to events. This functionality is critical in field-deployable sensor networks where continuous operation is expensive and system adaptation is critical for extended operation in the face of dynamic external events. We show results on various synthetic heterogeneous sensor networks where only partially accurate information about the sensing system is available and illustrate the efficacy of the control algorithm in handling such incorrect models with a negligible increase in transmission of the optimal control settings. We show that the run-time performance of the control algorithm scales quadratically with increasing number of sensors.

For example, a doctor may need to predict the probability of getting a disease P[y\x], which depends on a number of risk factors. Generalized additive models [9] are a well-studied nonparametric model in the statistics literature, usually with monotonic link functions. However, no known efficient algorithms exist for learning such a general class. We show that regression graphs efficiently learn such real-valued concepts, while regression trees inefficiently learn them. One corollary is that any function E[y\x] = u(w . x) for u monotonic can be learned to arbitrarily small squared error c in time polynomial in 1/epsilon, \w\(1), and the Lipschitz constant of u (analogous to a margin). The model includes, as special cases, linear and logistic regression, as well as learning a noisy half-space with a margin [5,4]. Kearns, Mansour, and McAllester [12,15], analyzed decision trees and decision graphs as boosting algorithms for classification accuracy. We extend their analysis and the boosting analogy to the case of real-valued predictors, where a small positive correlation coefficient can be boosted to arbitrary accuracy. Viewed as a noisy boosting algorithm [3,10], the algorithm learns both the target function and the asymmetric noise.

However, in many application domains results cannot simply be distinguished in this restrictive form. Instead to classify a result as correct or incorrect, here results might be more or less useful for solving a given problem or for satisfying given user demands, respectively. In such a situation, an expert system should be able to estimate the utility of possible outputs a-priori in order to produce reasonable results. In Case-Based Reasoning this is done by using similarity measures which can be seen as an approximation of the domain specific, but a-priori unknown utility function. In this article we present an approach how this approximation of utility functions can be facilitated by employing machine learning techniques.

In the database field, the view of data mining as advanced querying has recently stimulated much research into the development of data mining query languages. In the field of machine learning, inductive logic programming has broadened its scope toward extending standard data mining tasks from the usual attribute-value setting to a multirelational setting. After a concise description of data mining, the contribution of logic to both fields is discussed. At the end, we indicate the potential use of logic for unifying different existing data mining formalisms.

For most of that century, data analysis was the realm of only one discipline - statistics. As a consequence of the development of the computer, things have changed dramatically and now there are several such disciplines, including machine learning, pattern recognition, and data mining. This paper looks at some of the similarities and some of the differences between these disciplines, noting where they intersect and, perhaps of more interest, where they do not. Particular issues examined include the nature of the data with which they are concerned, the role of mathematics, differences in the objectives, how the different areas of application have led to different aims, and how the different disciplines have led sometimes to the same analytic tools being developed, but also sometimes to different tools being developed. Some conjectures about likely future developments are given.

Using metafeatures, the scope of attribute-value learning is expanded to domains that contain instances that have some kind of recurring substructure, such as strokes in handwriting recognition, or local maxima in time series data. These substructures are used to construct attributes. Metafeatures are applied to two real-world domains: sign language recognition and ECG classification. Using a very generic set of metafeatures we axe able to generate classifiers that are either comprehensible or accurate, producing results that are comparable to hand-crafted preprocessing and comparable to human experts.

The particular problem considered is to generate a clone of a human pilot performing a flying task on a simulated aircraft. The work presented here uses the human behaviour to create constraints for a search process that results in a controller - pilot's clone. Experiments in this paper indicate that this approach, called "indirect controllers", results in pilot clones that are, in comparison with those obtained with traditional "direct controllers", simpler, more robust and easier to understand. An important feature of indirect controllers in this paper is the use of qualitative constraints.

While most state-of-the-art machine learning methods for regression focus on inducing piecewise regression models (regression and model trees), we investigate the predictive performance of regression models based on polynomial equations. We present CIPER, an efficient method for inducing polynomial equations and empirically evaluate its predictive performance on standard regression tasks. The evaluation shows that polynomials compare favorably to linear and piecewise regression models, induced by standard regression methods, in terms of degree of fit and complexity. The bias-variance decomposition of predictive error shows that CIPER has lower variance than methods for inducing regression trees.

However, in some applications such as image classification, the training data are often collected from multiple sources and heterogeneous. Ensemble learning is a proven effective approach to heterogeneous data, which uses multiple classification models to capture the diverse aspects of heterogeneous data. If an ensemble can learn the relationship between different portions of data and their corresponding models, the ensemble can selectively apply models to unseen data according to the learned relationship. We propose a novel approach to enable the learning of the relationships between data and models by creating a set of I switches' that can route a testing instance to appropriate classification models in an ensemble. Our empirical study on both real-world data and benchmark data shows that the proposed approach to ensemble learning can achieve significant performance improvement for heterogeneous data.

A number of papers have focused on LOO error estimation for support vector machines, but little work has focused on LOO error estimation when learning with smooth, convex margin loss functions. We consider the problem of approximating the LOO error estimate in the context of sparse kernel machine learning. We first motivate a general framework for learning sparse kernel machines that involves minimizing a regularized, smooth, strictly convex margin loss. Then we present an approximation of the LOO error for the family of learning algorithms admissible in the general framework. We examine the implications of the approximation and review preliminary experimental results demonstrating the utility of the approach.

While functional genomics looks after the composition and function of the proteins codified by the genes, geneticists are more interested in investigating the mechanism, which regulates the expression of the genes. In particular, the study of the promoters is of crucial importance for understanding the responses to biological and environmental stimuli. In this article we address the use of neural networks for promoter recognition in the genome of the fungus Crinipellis perniciosa, an aggressive phytopathogen of the cacao tree, which is being sequenced by a Brazilian Consortium. A divide and conquer strategy was used for the solution of the complex problem of localizing and characterizing the gene promoters. The division of the problem is based on the localization of an internal structure called TATA-box, considered as one of the promoter's signal. With that purpose we trained a feed-forward neural network using patterns found in other species, due to absence of validated data for the fungus under study. A new approach for feature extraction, based on local compositional measures, is described. Currently, biological studies are being carried out for the experimental validation of the predictions of the neural network.

This helps to maximise the useful information from the raw data in order to make the classification effective and simple. In this paper, one of the machine learning approaches, Genetic Programming (GP), is employed to extract features from the raw vibration data taken from a rotating machine with several different conditions. The created features are then used as the input to a simple ANN for the identification of different bearing conditions, in comparison with the other classical machine learning methods.

In this context, they have investigated alternative methodologies for refractive error measurement. A new strategy is the determination of refractive errors from images of the globe of the eye. A process named Hartmann-Shack can obtain these images. The HS images should be analysed in order to extract relevant information for identification of refractive errors. The present paper investigates a technique based on Radial Basis Functions (RBFs), an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and on Support Vector Machines (SVMs), which automatically performs analysis of images from the globe of the eye and identifies refractive errors. The most relevant data of these images are extracted using Gabor wavelets transform, and then these Machine Learning techniques carry out the image analysis.

The nature of their effort required collecting and analyzing a large amount of literature from a broad spectrum of research disciplines. They developed a research classification and mining technique to help manage the volumes of research sources that led to a methodology called Stateof-the-Art-Matrix (SAM) Analysis. The SAM Analysis is a technique that partitions a knowledgebase into matrices organized by regions or topics of interest. Partitioning knowledgebases helps researchers detect issues considered important by other researchers and track the evolution of the research domain over time. Researchers use a manual technique when applying the SAM Analysis. A manual approach is necessarily restrictive on the number of categories and keywords that can be used. In addition, the amount of time that can be devoted toward the analysis of an article is limited. In this paper, an approach is presented to automate the process of classifying publications in research databases through the use of a machine learning technique known as a Learning Classifier System (LCS). The approach appeals to researchers for two reasons. First, automation would allow deeper exploration of the results from the SAM matrices to reveal trends useful to researchers. Second, automation would enable richer exploration of the predictive possibilities of further research knowledge.

Hence, there is a need for a representation that can quantify all the microstructural elements through the analysis of digitized images. This paper addresses representation through the creation of a dynamic microstructure library. The paper focuses on the application of machine learning theory for the creation of a library that is trained by experimentally or computationally. obtained microstructure snapshots. Support vector machines (SVM) are used to classify microstructure snapshots based on its features into various classes. An incremental-principal component analysis (PCA) method is employed within image classes to constantly update the microstructure basis and numerically quantify the microstructural features.

Classification of a detected object as malignant lesion, benign lesion, or normal tissue on mammogram is a typical three-class pattern recognition problem. This paper presents a three-class classification approach by using two-stage classifier combined with support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithm for classification of breast cancer on mammograms. The first classification stage is used to detect abnormal areas and normal breast tissues, and the second stage is for classification of malignant or benign in detected abnormal objects. A series of spatial, morphology and texture features have been extracted on detected objects areas. By using genetic algorithm (GA), different feature groups for different stage classification have been investigated. Computerized free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses have been employed in different classification stages. Results have shown that obvious performance improvement in both sensitivity and specificity was observed through proposed classification approach compared with conventional two-class classification approaches, indicating its effectiveness in classification of breast cancer on mammograms.

Segmentation of abnormal lung patterns is a necessary stacre in the construction of a computer-aided diagnosis system. We interpret lung patterns as textures and apply a texture classification technique for segmentation of lung patterns. The wavelet transform is used to extract texture features and then the Support Vector Machines (SVM) machine learning algorithm is applied to texture classification. The parameters of the SVM play a crucial role in the performance of the algorithm. We apply gradient-based optimization of the radius/margin bound of a generalization error to choose parameters of the SVM algorithm. This approach is more efficient in terms of the required number of SVM training cycles than the commonly used method of finding the optimal parameters which is based on sampling the parameter space and choosing the parameter combination which produces the lowest test error. We assess the applicability of optimization of the radius/margin bound to tuning SVM parameters for the problem of segmentation of lung pattern textures in HRCT images. Results of experiments indicate that this method chooses parameters which are comparable to the parameters obtained using test error in terms of classification accuracy, employing fewer training cycles.

Quantitative analysis of these and other parameters from ventriculograms is infrequently performed due to the expense of manual segmentation. We present a method for semi-automatic segmentation of ventriculograms based on a two-stage boosted decision-tree pixel classifier. The classifier determines which pixels are inside the ventricle at key end-diastole and end-systole frames. The classifier is semi-automatic, requiring a user to select 3 points in each frame: the endpoints of the aortic valve and the apex. The classifier uses about 90 feature images, computed from the raw ventriculogram image frames, including simple per pixel gray-level statistics (e.g. median brightness) and image geometry (e.g. coordinates relative to user supplied 3 points). Border pixels are determined from segmented images using dilation and erosion. A curve is then fit to the border pixels, minimizing a penalty function that trades off fidelity to the border pixels with smoothness. Volumes and ejection fraction are estimated from border curves using standard area-length formulas. On independent test data, the differences between automatic and manual volumes (and ejection fractions) are similar in size to the differences between two human observers.

Rather than represent the image structure using intensity gradients, we extract local edge features for each landmark using steerable filters. A machine learning algorithm based on AdaBoost selects a small number of critical features from a large set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. These non-linear classifiers are used, instead of the linear Mahalanobis distance, to find optimal displacements by searching along the direction perpendicular to each landmark. These features give more accurate and reliable matching between model and new images than modeling image intensity alone. Experimental results demonstrated the ability of this improved method to accurately locate edge features.

Most refer to characteristics of the ambiguous word and surrounding words and are based on hundreds of examples. Unfortunately, developing large training sets is time-consuming. We investigate the use of symbolic knowledge to augment machine-learning techniques for small datasets. UMLS semantic types assigned to concepts found in the sentence and relationships between these semantic types form the knowledge base. A naive Bayes classifier was trained for 15 words with 100 examples for each. The most frequent sense of a word served as the baseline. The effect of increasingly accurate symbolic knowledge was evaluated in eight experimental conditions. Performance was measured by accuracy based on 10-fold cross-validation. The best condition used only the semantic types of the words in the sentence. Accuracy was then on average 10% higher than the baseline; however, it varied from 8% deterioration to 29% improvement. In a follow-up evaluation, we noted a trend that the best disambiguation was found for words that were the least troublesome to the human evaluators.

Automated signal generation aims to focus the attention of experts on drug - adverse event associations which are disproportionally present in the database. Although adverse events are coded by means of controlled vocabularies such as the MedDRA dictionary, this semantic information is not taken into account for signal generation. Objective: To improve the performance of current signal detection algorithms using knowledge based approach. Method: We developed a formal ontology of ADRs and built a data mining tool that uses description logic representations of MedDRA terms to group medically related case reports. Results: This knowledge based approach increased the sensitivity of signal detection with no decrease in specificity. Discussion: A knowledge based approach improved the performance of signal detection tools. However, the huge workload involved in the knowledge engineering step limits the use of this approach for machine learning.

However, such benefits do not come without cost. The analysis of such large datasets, particularly where the data may have to be merged from several sources and may be noisy and incomplete, is a challenging task. Furthermore, the introduction of clinical changes is a cyclical task meaning that the processes under examination operate in an environment that is not static. We suggest that traditional methods of analysis are unsuitable for the task and identify complexity theory and machine learning as areas that have the potential to facilitate the examination of clinical quality. By its nature the field of complex adaptive systems deals with environments that change because of the interactions that have occurred in the past. We draw parallels between health informatics and bioinformatics, which has already started to successfully use machine learning methods.

Each dataset contained multiple sources of information: history of related symptoms and other illnesses, physical examination findings, laboratory tests, medications (patient records dataset), health attitudes, and disabilities in activities of daily living (survey dataset). Each technique showed very good mortality prediction in the acute patients data sample (AUC up to 0.89) and fair prediction accuracy for six year mortality (AUC from 0.70 to 0.76) in individuals from epidemiological database surveys. The results suggest that the nature of data is of primary importance rather than the learning technique. However, the consistently superior performance of the artificial neural network (multi-layer perceptron) indicates that nonlinear relationships (which cannot be discerned by linear separation techniques) can provide additional improvement in correctly predicting health outcomes.

Unlike the Euclidean distance, heterogeneous proximity functions process variables differently according to their scale. The correct evaluation of nominal variables, whose values are unordered, is especially important. We compared five heterogeneous functions with the Euclidean distance to study whether functions sensitive to scale are better than a function assuming the same scale. In addition, we were interested of the relative performance of the five heterogeneous functions. The performance of the functions was measured with a nearest neighbor classifier that was applied to 12 medical data sets characterized with different scales. Unexpectedly, the performance of heterogeneous functions did not differ significantly from that of the Euclidean distance. As expected, significant differences between the Heterogeneous Value Difference Metric (HVDM) and the four value-matching-based heterogeneous functions favored HVDM. Additional research is needed to explain why heterogeneous functions did not outperform the Euclidean distance.

Traditional machine learning usually builds a model that captures the behavior of the 'concept' from the training instances. Following this context, the ATC learns the concept from text data such as digital text documents, web pages, or e-mail texts. In this paper, we categorize the concepts that have been dealt by ATC into two groups: broad concepts and narrow concepts. Broad concepts are difficult to learn than narrow concepts. We propose a multi model approach where multiple local models are constructed to learn the broad concepts. Some experimental results showed that the multi model approach turned out to be effective in learning the confidentiality of company.			byhwang@catholic.ac.kr; blee@dankook.ac.kr					APTE C, 1994, P 17 ANN INT ACM SIG; COHEN W, 1996, P 19 ANN INT ACM SIG; DEVEL O, 2000, P KDD 2000 WORKSH TE; Drucker H., 1999, IEEE T NEURAL NETWOR, V10; HULL D, 1994, P 17 ANN INT ACM SIG; ITTNER D, 1995, P 4 ANN S DOC AN INF; Joachims T., 1998, P EUR C MACH LEARN; KATIRAI H, 1999, FILTERING JUNK MAIL; KIM S, HYBRID USER MODEL TE; Lang K., 1995, P 12 INT C MACH LEAR; LEE B, 2003, LECT NOTE COMPUTER S, V2665; Sahami M, 1998, P AAAI 98 WORKSH LEA; WEINER E, 1995, P 4 ANN S DOC AN INF; Weiss S.

Given a certain performance of a musical piece and a set of candidate pianists the task is to examine whether or not a particular pianist is the actual performer. A database of 22 pianists playing pieces by F. Chopin in a computer-controlled piano is used in the presented experiments. An appropriate set of features that captures the idiosyncrasies of music performers is proposed.

This is accomplished through the implementation of the k nearest neighbor machine learning algorithm on top of a highly adjustable planner, called HAP. Learning data are produced by running HAP offline on several problems from multiple domains using all value combinations of its parameters. When the adaptive planner HAP-NN is faced with a new problem, it locates the k nearest problems, using a set of measurable problem characteristics, retrieves the performance data for all parameter configurations on these problems and performs a multicriteria combination, with user-specified weights for plan length and planning time. Based on this combination, the configuration with the best performance is then used in order to solve the new problem. Comparative experiments with the statistically best static configurations of the planner show that HAPNN manages to adapt successfully to unseen problems, leading to an increased planning performance.

The crawler must contain a component which assigns visiting priorities to the links, by estimating the probability of leading to a relevant page in the future. Reinforcement Learning was chosen as a method that fits this task nicely, as it provides a method for rewarding intermediate states to the goal. Initial results show that a crawler trained with Reinforcement Learning is able to retrieve relevant documents after a small number of steps.

For more complex problems, combinations of simple classifiers can significantly improve performance. There are several combination methods, like Bagging and Boosting that combine simple classifiers. We propose, here, a new meta-classifier approach which combines several different combination methods, in analogy to the combination of simple classifiers. The meta-classifier approach is employed in the implementation of a medical diagnosis system and evaluated using three benchmark diagnosis problems as well as a problem concerning the classification of hepatic lesions from computed tomography (CT) images.

Decision trees are one of the most frequently occurring knowledge representation schemes used in classification algorithms. Decision trees can offer a more practical way of capturing knowledge than coding rules in more conventional languages. Decision trees are generally constructed by means of a top down growth procedure, which starts from the root node and greedily chooses a split of the data that maximizes some cost function. The order, in which attributes are chosen, according to the cost function, determines how efficient the decision tree is. Gain, Gain ratio, Gini and Twoing are some of the most famous splitting criteria used in calculating the cost function. In this paper, we propose a new splitting criterion, namely the False-Positives criterion. The key idea behind the False-Positives criterion is to consider the instances having the most frequent class value, with respect to a certain attribute value, as true-positives and all the instances having the rest class values, with respect to that attribute value, as false positives. We present extensive empirical tests, which demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed criterion.

Moreover it extends the typical mixture model by allowing the sharing of mixture components among all classes, in contrast to the conventional approach that suggests mixture components describing only one class. The typical learning method of PRBF for a classification task employs the Expectation - Maximization (EM) algorithm. This widely used method depends strongly on the initial parameter values. The Greedy EM algorithm is a recently proposed method that tries to overcome this drawback, in the case of the density estimation problem using mixture models. In this work we propose a similar approach for incremental training of the PRBF network for classification. The proposed algorithm starts with a single component and incrementally adds more components. After convergence the algorithm splits all the components of the network. The addition of a new component is based on criteria for detecting a region in the data space that is crucial for the classification task. Experimental results using several well-known classification datasets indicate that the incremental method provides solutions of superior classification performance.

This knowledge is usually evolvable and therefore an ontology maintenance process is required. In the context of ontology maintenance we tackle the problem that arises when an instance/individual is written differently (grammatically, orthographically, lexicographically), while representing the same entity/ concept. This type of knowledge is captured into a semantic relationship and constitutes valuable information for many intelligent methods and systems. We enrich a domain ontology with instances that participate in this type of relationship, using a novel name matching method based on machine learning. We also show how the proposed method can support the discovery of new entities/concepts to be added to the ontology. Finally, we present experimental results for the enrichment of an ontology used in the multi-lingual information integration project CROSSMARC.

The classifier system method does worse due to the small size of the data set and missing values. The use of Artificial Neural Networks is promising, although it takes more time in training. A Genetic Algorithm is also employed to find the best structure of the Neural Network. Experimental results for the different methods are presented and compared.

Some learning methods are originally binary, being able to realize classifications where k = 2. Among these one can mention Support Vector Machines. This paper presents a comparison of methods for multiclass classification using SVMs. The techniques investigated use strategies of dividing the multiclass problem into binary subproblems and can be extended to other learning techniques. Results indicate that the use of Directed Acyclic Graphs is an efficient approach in generating multiclass SVM classifiers.

However, in some cases, learning algorithms perform well on several imbalanced domains. Thus, it does not seem fair to directly correlate class imbalance to the loss of performance of learning algorithms. In this work, we develop a systematic study aiming to question whether class imbalances are truly to blame for the loss of performance of learning systems or whether the class imbalances are not a problem by themselves. Our experiments suggest that the problem is not directly caused by class imbalances, but is also related to the degree of overlapping among the classes.

Given this setting, Bayes-N induces an ancestral ordering of all the variables generating a directed acyclic graph in which the class variable is a sink variable, with a subset of the explanatory variables as its parents. It is shown that classification using this variables as predictors performs better than the naive bayes classifier, and at least as good as other algorithms that learn Bayesian networks such as K2, PC and Bayes-9. It is also shown that the MDL measure of the networks generated by Bayes-N is comparable to those obtained by these other algorithms.

Usually elementary geometric shape robust characterization, subjected to geometric transformation, on a rigorous mathematical level is a key problem in many computer applications in different interest areas. The past four decades have seen solutions almost based on the use of n-Dimensional Moment and Fourier descriptor invariants. The present paper introduces a new approach for automatic model generation based on n-Dimensional Tensor Invariants as formal dictionary. An ontological model is the kernel used for specifying ontologies so that how close an ontology can be from the real world depends on the possibilities offered by the ontological model. By this approach even chromatic information content can be easily and reliably decoupled from target geometric information and computed into robus colour shape parameter attributes. Main GEOGINE(C) operational advantages over previous approaches are: 1) Automated Model Generation, 2) Invariant Minimal Complete Set for computational efficiency, 3) Arbitrary Model Precision for robust object description.

For this problem, there are two main selection approaches. The first one consists of developing functions to relate performance to problem size. In the second more characteristics are incorporated, however they are not defined formally, neither systematically. In contrast, we propose a methodology to model algorithm performance predictors that incorporate critical characteristics. The relationship among performance and characteristics is learned from historical data using machine learning techniques. To validate our approach we carried out experiments using an extensive test set. In particular, for the classical bin packing problem, we developed predictors that incorporate the interrelation among five critical characteristics and the performance of seven heuristic algorithms. We obtained an accuracy of 81% in the selection of the best algorithm.

Feature selection algorithm focuses mainly on the design of a criterion function and the selection of a search strategy. In this paper, a novel feature selection approach (NFSA) based on quantum genetic algorithm (QGA) and a good evaluation criterion is proposed to select the optimal feature subset from a large number of features extracted from radar emitter signals (RESs). The criterion function is given firstly. Then, detailed algorithm of QGA is described and its performances are analyzed. Finally, the best feature subset is selected from the original feature set (OFS) composed of 16 features of RESs. Experimental results show that the proposed approach reduces greatly the dimensions of OFS and heightens accurate recognition rate of RESs, which indicates that NFSA is feasible and effective.

Though relatively small in number, these spurious records present a significant problem in many situations, where they can become a large proportion of the records potentially of interest to a given astronomer. Accurate and robust techniques are needed for locating and flagging such spurious objects, and we are undertaking a programme investigating the use of machine learning techniques in this context. In this paper we focus on the four most common causes of unwanted records in the SSS: satellite or aeroplane tracks, scratches, fibres and other linear phenomena introduced to the plate, circular haloes around bright stars due to internal reflections within the telescope and diffraction spikes near to bright stars. Appropriate techniques are developed for the detection of each of these. The methods are applied to the SSS data to develop a data set of spurious object detections, along with confidence measures, which can allow these unwanted data to be removed from consideration.

In particular, the work of Piet Mondrian, M.C. Escher and Paul Klee are suitable vehicles for investigation since their work is accompanied by extensive writings describing the ideas and motivation behind their compositions. In particular, we have tried to abstract from their theories, rules that describe the construction process or the properties that their finished artefacts possess in order to create software programs that can articulate these rules. In this way, we are able to simulate either automatically or with user interaction, the process of creating works of art of a similar genre and satisfying the properties desired by the artist. Since the rules are bound to be considerably more complex than those currently exposed, we are looking to use machine-learning techniques to develop more sophisticated agents, which may behave more closely like the actual artist.

They can be used to infer such "high-level" variables as "threat" or "intent", given observations, background and intelligence data. However, their usefulness depends on the model, i.e. the Bayesian network, used for inference. We demonstrate how Bayesian multinets can be used to simplify the representation of certain complex domains, allowing a decomposition into simpler models that are conditionally independent given a class variable. We illustrate this concept using a threat assessment application, in which each component is specialized to a different class of threat and show, how this simplifies model construction and target identification.

However, we do not have yet satisfactory methods for approximation of functions and developed calculi on function approximations. In the paper we discuss a function approximation using the rough set approach. The main difference with the existing approaches in rough set theory is based on modification of the inclusion measure. This makes it possible to overcome some drawbacks of the previously used definitions. For applications it is important to develop rough measures on approximated objects, in particular on function approximations. The modified inclusion measure is also used to define an exemplary measure, i.e., the rough integral.

First, a classification problem is divided into several two-class problems following a extended version of a fuzzy round robin class binarization scheme; next, a fuzzy classifier is generated using any machine learning technique for each two-class problem (we use evolution of fuzzy rules in this paper); finally, the generated fuzzy classifiers are integrated into a 2-dimensional coupled map lattice. The answer of the classifier to a sample is determined by the dynamics of the lattice when it is initialized with the answers given by each fuzzy classifier. Experiments are conducted with various publicly available data sets.								Cormer T., 1990, INTRO ALGORITHMS; DASGUPTA D, 2001, P GEN EV COMP C GECC, P299; DE JONG K.

This involves a chatbot, a program that emulates human conversation; the chatbot must be trainable with a text, to accept input and match it against the text to generate replies in the conversation. We have developed a Machine Learning approach to retrain the ALICE chatbot with a transcript of human dialogue, and used this to develop a range of chatbots conversing in different styles and languages. We adapted this chatbot-training program to the Qur'an, to allow users to learn from the Qur'an in a conversational information-access style. The process and results are illustrated in this paper.

J	Vahed, A; Omlin, CW				Vahed, A; Omlin, CW			A machine learning method for extracting symbolic knowledge from recurrent neural networks	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							FINITE-STATE AUTOMATA; TIME; INDUCTION; RULES	Neural networks do not readily provide an explanation of the knowledge stored in their weights as part of their information processing. Until recently, neural networks were considered to be black boxes, with the knowledge stored in their weights not readily accessible. Since then, research has resulted in a number of algorithms for extracting knowledge in symbolic form from trained neural networks. This article addresses the extraction of knowledge in symbolic form from recurrent neural networks trained to behave like deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs). To date, methods used to extract knowledge from such networks have relied on the hypothesis that networks' states tend to cluster and that clusters of network states correspond to DFA states. The computational complexity of such a cluster analysis has led to heuristics that either limit the number of clusters that may form during training or limit the exploration of the space of hidden recurrent state neurons. These limitations, while necessary, may lead to decreased fidelity, in which the extracted knowledge may not model the true behavior of a trained network, perhaps not even for the training set. The method proposed here uses a polynomial time, symbolic learning algorithm to infer DFAs solely from the observation of a trained network's input-output behavior. Thus, this method has the potential to increase the fidelity of the extracted knowledge.

J	Smithies, R; Salhi, S; Queen, N				Smithies, R; Salhi, S; Queen, N			Adaptive hybrid learning for neural networks	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article								A robust locally adaptive learning algorithm is developed via two enhancements of the Resilient Propagation (RPROP) method. Remaining drawbacks of the gradient-based approach are addressed by hybridization with gradient-independent Local Search. Finally, a global optimization method based on recursion of the hybrid is constructed, making use of tabu neighborhoods to accelerate the search for minima through diversification. Enhanced RPROP is shown to be faster and more accurate than the standard RPROP in solving classification tasks based on natural data sets taken from the UCI repository of machine learning databases. Furthermore, the use of Local Search is shown to improve Enhanced RPROP by solving the same classification tasks as part of the global optimization method.

Among several machine learning techniques, the neural networks are known for its good performance in learning system call sequences. However, it suffers from very long training time because there are no formal solutions for determining the suitable structure of networks. In this paper, a novel intrusion detection technique based on evolutionary neural networks is proposed. Evolutionary neural networks have the advantage that it takes shorter time to obtain superior neural network than the conventional approaches because they learn the structure and weights of neural network simultaneously. Experimental results against 1999 DARPA IDEVAL data confirm that evolutionary neural networks are promising for intrusion detection.

Dimension selection via learning, however, usually requires a large number of iterations to find an appropriate solution. This means that learning involving dimension-selection is hard to achieve in an incremental manner. An improved version of the previous work to overcome this problem is presented, namely, "Incremental Learning with Sleep" (ILS). This system repeats two learning phases, awake and sleep phases, alternately. The system records new novel instances like instance-based learning during the awake phase, whereas it achieves both an optimization of parameters and dimension selection during the sleep phase. Because the learning of the awake phase is very quick, the system's apparent learning time is very short. The experimental results show the extended ILS allows learning inputs incrementally but ignores redundant dimensions during the learning.

Recent advances in ensemble methods have demonstrated that robust behavior can be improved by combining a large number of weak classifiers. The key insight of this paper is that the performance enhancement due to combining multiple classifiers is considerably greater in multi-category situations than in binary classifications, as long as their errors are conditionally independent. This paper provides some experimental and theoretical analysis of the performance using majority vote, paying special attention to the effect of several parameters that include the number of combined classifiers, weakness of the combined classifiers and the number of classes. These insights can provide guidance for the analysis and design of multi-classifier systems.

This paper describes a new feature extraction method called semantic mapping and its application in categorization of web documents. The semantic mapping uses SOM maps to construct variables in reduced space, where each variable describes the behavior of a group of features semantically related. The performance of the semantic mapping is measured and compared empirically with the performance of sparse random mapping and PCA methods and shows to be better than random mapping and a good alternative to PCA.

There are more than 100 types in HPV and each HPV has two risk types, low and high. In particular, high risk type HPV is known to the most important factors in medical judgment. Thus, the classifying the risk type of HPV is very important to the treat of cervical cancer. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to mine the structure of HPV DNA sequence for effective classification of the HPV risk types. We learn the most informative subsequence segment sets and its weights with genetic algorithm to classify the risk types of each HPV. To resolve the problem of computational complexity of genetic algorithm we use distributed intelligent data engineering platform based on active grid concept called "IDEA@Home." The proposed genetic mining method, with the described platform, shows about 85.6% classification accuracy with relatively fast mining speed.

The standard approach to use generative models for classification is to train a separate model for each class. A novel data point is then classified by the model that attributes the highest probability. The algorithm we propose modifies the parameters of the models to improve the classification accuracy. Our approach is made computationally tractable by assuming that each of the models is deterministic, by which we mean that a data-point is associated to only a single latent state. The resulting algorithm is a variant of the support vector machine learning algorithm and in a limiting case the method is similar to the standard perceptron learning algorithm. We apply the method to two types of latent variable models. The first has a discrete latent state space and the second, principal component analysis, has a continuous latent state space. We compare the effectiveness of both approaches on a handwritten digit recognition problem and on a satellite image recognition problem. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recently, a promising data mining technique in machine learning has been proposed to uncover the predictive relationships of numerous financial and economic variables. Inspired by the fact that the determinant between these variables and their interrelationships over stock returns changes over time, we explore this issue further by using data mining to uncover the recent relevant variables with the greatest predictive ability. The objective is to examine whether using the recent relevant variables leads to additional improvements in stock return forecasting. Given evidence of non-linearity in the financial market, the resulting variables are then provided to neural networks, including probabilistic and feed-forward neural networks, for predicting the directions of future excess stock return. The results show that redeveloped neural network models that use the recent relevant variables generate higher profits with lower risks than the buy-and-hold strategy, conventional linear regression, and the random walk model, as well as the neural network models that use constant relevant variables.

J	Yang, J; Frangi, AF; Yang, JY				Yang, J; Frangi, AF; Yang, JY			A new kernel Fisher discriminant algorithm with application to face recognition	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Kernel-based methods; principal component analysis (PCA); Fisher linear discriminant analysis; (FLD or LDA); feature extraction; face recognition		Kernel-based methods have been of wide concern in the field of machine learning and neurocomputing. In this paper, a new Kernel Fisher discriminant analysis (KFD) algorithm, called complete KFD (CKFD), is developed. CKFD has two advantages over the existing KFD algorithms. First, its implementation is divided into two phases, i.e., Kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) plus Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLD), which makes it more transparent and simpler. Second, CKFD can make use of two categories of discriminant information, which makes it more powerful. The proposed algorithm was applied to face recognition and tested on a subset of the FERET database. The experimental results demonstrate that CKFD is significantly better than the algorithms of Kernel Fisherface and Kernel Eigenface. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Population differences with complex spatial patterns are then determined by applying a nonlinear support vector machine (SVM) pattern classification method to the morphological signatures. Significant reduction of the dimensionality of the morphological signatures is achieved via wavelet decomposition and feature reduction methods. Applying the method to MR images with simulated atrophy shows that the method can correctly detect subtle and spatially complex atrophy, even when the simulated atrophy represents only a 5% variation from the original image. Applying this method to actual MR images shows that brains can be correctly determined to be male or female with a successful classification rate of 97%, using the leave-one-out method. This proposed method also shows a high classification rate for old adults' age classification, even under difficult test scenarios. The main characteristic of the proposed methodology is that, by applying multivariate pattern classification methods, it can detect subtle and spatially complex patterns of morphological group differences which are often not detectable by voxel-based morphometric methods, because these methods analyze morphological measurements voxel-by-voxel and do not consider the entirety of the data simultaneously.

J	Wu, KP; Lin, HN; Chang, JM; Sung, TY; Hsu, WL				Wu, KP; Lin, HN; Chang, JM; Sung, TY; Hsu, WL			HYPROSP: a hybrid protein secondary structure prediction algorithm - a knowledge-based approach	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORKS; ACCURACY; SERVER	We develop a knowledge-based approach (called PROSP) for protein secondary structure prediction. The knowledge base contains small peptide fragments together with their secondary structural information. A quantitative measure M, called match rate, is defined to measure the amount of structural information that a target protein can extract from the knowledge base. Our experimental results show that proteins with a higher match rate will likely be predicted more accurately based on PROSP. That is, there is roughly a monotone correlation between the prediction accuracy and the amount of structure matching with the knowledge base. To fully utilize the strength of our knowledge base, a hybrid prediction method is proposed as follows: if the match rate of a target protein is at least 80%, we use the extracted information to make the prediction; otherwise, we adopt a popular machine-learning approach. This comprises our hybrid protein structure prediction (HYPROSP) approach. We use the DSSP and EVA data as our datasets and PSIPRED as our underlying machine-learning algorithm. For target proteins with match rate at least 80%, the average Q(3) of PROSP is 3.96 and 7.2 better than that of PSIPRED on DSSP and EVA data, respectively.

Our purpose is to extract semantic relations from text corpora in an unsupervised way and use the output as preprocessed material for the construction of ontologies from scratch. The experiments are evaluated in a quantitative and "impressionistic" manner. We have worked on two corpora: a 13M words corpus composed of Medline abstracts related to proteins (SwissProt), and a small legal corpus (EU VAT directive) consisting of 43K words. Using a shallow parser, we select functional relations from the syntactic structure subject-verb-direct-object. Those functional relations correspond to what is a called a "lexon". The selection is done using prepositional structures and statistical measures in order to select the most relevant lexons. Therefore, the paper stresses the filtering carried out in order to discard automatically all irrelevant structures. Domain experts have evaluated the precision of the outcomes on the SwissProt corpus. The global precision has been rated 55%, with a precision of 42% for the functional relations or lexons, and a precision of 76% for the prepositional relations. For the VAT corpus, a knowledge engineer has judged that the outcomes are useful to support and can speed up his modelling task. In addition, a quantitative scoring method (coverage and accuracy measures resulting in a 52.38% and 47.12% score respectively) has been applied.

We propose the use of an integrated machine learning architecture, with automated planning-scheduling and resource management capabilities that can be used for a variety of autonomous sensing applications with very limited computing, power, and bandwidth resources. We lay out general solutions for efficient processing in a multi-tiered (three-tier) machine learning framework that is suited for remote, mobile sensing systems. Novel dimensionality reduction techniques that are designed for classification are used to compress each individual sensor data and pass only relevant information to the mobile multisensor fusion module (second-tier). Statistical classifiers that are capable of handling missing/partial sensory data due to sensor failure or power loss are used to detect critical events and pass the information to the third tier (central server) for manual analysis and/or analysis by advanced pattern recognition techniques. Genetic optimisation algorithms are used to control the system in the presence of dynamic events, and also ensure that system requirements (i.e. minimum life of the system) are met. This tight integration of control optimisation and machine learning algorithms results in a highly efficient sensor network with intelligent decision making capabilities. The applicability of our technology in remote health monitoring and environmental monitoring is shown. Other uses of our solution are also discussed.

These relations form part of the qualia structure assumed in generative lexicon theory, where the telic role represents a typical purpose of the entity and the agentive role represents the origin of the entity. The first discovery method uses hand-generated templates for each role type, and the second employs a supervised machine-learning technique. To evaluate the effectiveness of the two methods, we took a sample of 30 nouns, selected 50 verbs for each, and then generated a ranked list of verbs for a given noun. Using a variant of Spearman's rank correlation, we demonstrate the ability of the methods to identify qualia structure.

Each individual in neuron population can contribute to one or more networks in network population, so there is a two-fold difficulty in evaluating the effectiveness (or fitness) of a neuron. Firstly, since each neuron only represents a partial solution to the problem, it needs to be assigned some credit for the complete problem solving activity. Secondly, these credits need to be accumulated from different networks the neuron participates in. This model, along with various credit assignment strategies, is tested on a classification (Heart disease diagnosis problem from UCI machine learning repository) and a regression problem (Mackey-Glass time series prediction problem).

If used properly, they additionally can be used to improve the classification accuracy of the system. In this paper we develop a theoretical framework for a windowing scheme called ILAS, developed previously by the authors. The framework allows us to approximate the degree of windowing we can apply to a given dataset as well as the gain in runtime. The framework sets the first stage for the development of a larger methodology with several types of learning strategies in which we can apply ILAS, such as maximizing the learning performance of the system, or achieving the maximum run-time reduction without significant accuracy loss.

Recent theoretical advancements show that the system can scale-up polynomially in the problem complexity and problem size given the problem is a k-DNF with certain properties. This paper addresses two major issues in XCS: (1) knowledge extraction and (2) structure identification. Knowledge extraction addresses the issue of mining problem knowledge from the final solution developed by XCS. The goal is to identify most important features in the problem and the dependencies among those features. The extracted knowledge may not only be used for further data mining, but may actually be re-fed into the system giving it further competence in solving problems in which dependent features, that is, building blocks, need to be processed effectively. This paper proposes to extract a feature dependency tree out of the developed rule-based problem representation of XCS. The investigations herein focus on Boolean function problems.

In this paper we primarily examine the use of Genetic Programming and a Genetic Algorithm to preprocess data before it is classified using the C4.5 decision tree learning algorithm. Genetic Programming is used to construct new features from those available in the data, a potentially significant process for data mining since it gives consideration to hidden relationships between features. A Genetic Algorithm is used to determine which such features are the most predictive. Using ten well-known datasets we show that our approach, in comparison to C4.5 alone, provides marked improvement in a number of cases. We then examine its use with other well-known machine learning techniques.

Header traces are the aggregate of traffic from many concurrent applications. We present a methodology, based on machine learning, that can break the trace down into clusters of traffic where each cluster has different traffic characteristics. Typical clusters include bulk transfer, single and multiple transactions and interactive traffic, amongst others. The paper includes a description of the methodology, a visualisation of the attribute statistics that aids in recognising cluster types and a discussion of the stability and effectiveness of the methodology.

It leverages on machine learning approaches, such as artificial neural networks, decision trees and clustering algorithms, and is ideally suited for handling huge data amounts. In this article, we review the analysis of mass spectrometry data in proteomics, starting with common pre-processing steps and using single decision trees and decision tree ensembles for classification. Special emphasis is put on the pitfall of overfitting, i.e., of generating too complex single decision trees. Finally, we discuss the pros and cons of the two different decision tree usages.

Simultaneously, this principle is gaining popularity in robotics, computer graphics and computer vision: movement primitives were successfully applied to robotic control tasks as well as to render or to recognize human behavior. In this paper, we demonstrate that movement primitives can also be applied to the problem of implementing lifelike computer game characters. We present an approach to behavior modeling and learning that integrates several pattern recognition and machine learning techniques: trained with data from recorded multiplayer computer games, neural gas networks learn topological representation of virtual worlds; PCA is used to identify elementary movements the human players repeatedly executed during a match and complex behaviors are represented as probability functions mapping movement primitives to locations in the game environment. Experimental results underline that this framework produces game characters with humanlike skills.

A common example is a-priori knowledge given by a distance measure between objects. A simple but effective approach for kernel construction consists of substituting the Euclidean distance in ordinary kernel functions by the problem specific distance measure. We formalize this distance substitution procedure and investigate theoretical and empirical effects. In particular we state criteria for definiteness of the resulting kernels. We demonstrate the wide applicability by solving several classification tasks with SVMs. Regularization of the kernel matrices can additionally increase the recognition accuracy.

The classical photogrammetric approach explicitly models the two cameras and estimates their intrinsic and extrinsic parameters using a tedious calibration procedure; 2. A generic machine learning approach where the mapping from image to spatial coordinates is directly approximated by a Gaussian Process regression. Our results show that the generic learning approach, in addition to simplifying the procedure of calibration, can lead to higher depth accuracies than classical calibration although no specific domain knowledge is used.

J	Chow, CK; Tsui, HT; Lee, T				Chow, CK; Tsui, HT; Lee, T			Surface registration using a dynamic genetic algorithm	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						surface registration; genetic algorithm; model integration	OBJECTS; VIEWS	Robust and fast free-form surface registration is a useful technique in various areas such as object recognition and 3D model reconstruction for animation. Notably, an object model can be constructed, in principle, by surface registration and integration of range images of the target object from different views. In this paper, we propose to formulate the surface registration problem as a high dimensional optimization problem, which can be solved by a genetic algorithm (GA) (Genetic Algorithms in Search Optimization and Machine Learning, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 1989). The performance of the GA for surface registration is highly dependent on its speed in evaluating the fitness function. A novel GA with a new fitness function and a new genetic operator is proposed. It can compute an optimal registration 1000 times faster than a conventional GA. The accuracy, speed and the robustness of the proposed method are verified by a number of real experiments.

In order to ease this content selection overload problem, we pursued three related research themes. First, we developed a recommender engine that tracks users' TV-preferences and delivers accurate content recommendations. Second, we designed a user interface that allows easy navigation of selections and easily affords inputs required by the recommender engine. Third, we explored the importance of gaining users' trust in the recommender by automatically generating explanations for content recommendations. In evaluation with users, our smart interface came out on top beating TiVo's interface and TV Guide Magazine, in terms of usability, fun, and quick access to TV shows of interest. Further, our approach of combining multiple recommender ratings-resulting from various machine-learning methods-using neural networks has produced very accurate content recommendations.

J	Wolpert, D; Tumer, K; Bandari, E				Wolpert, D; Tumer, K; Bandari, E			Improving search algorithms by using intelligent coordinates	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							OPTIMIZATION	We consider algorithms that maximize a global function G in a distributed manner, using a different adaptive computational agent to set each variable of the underlying space. Each agent eta is self-interested; it sets its variable to maximize its own function g(eta). Three factors govern such a distributed algorithm's performance, related to exploration/exploitation, game theory, and machine learning. We demonstrate how to exploit all three factors by modifying a search algorithm's exploration stage: rather than random exploration, each coordinate of the search space is now controlled by a separate machine-learning-based "player" engaged in a noncooperative game. Experiments demonstrate that this modification improves simulated annealing (SA) by up to an order of magnitude for bin packing and for a model of an economic process run over an underlying network. These experiments also reveal interesting small-world phenomena.

However, the algorithm has difficulty in selecting an optimal constant learning rate and thus results in non-optimal learning speed and inflexible operation for working data. This paper introduces an elastic learning rate that guarantees convergence of learning and its local realization by online update of MLP parameters into the original EBP algorithm in order to complement the non-optimality. The results of experiments on a speaker verification system with Korean speech database are presented and discussed to demonstrate the performance improvement of the proposed method in terms of learning speed and flexibility for working data of the original EBP algorithm.

The feature selection methods using support vector machines have obtained satisfactory results, but the previous works are usually for binary classification, and needs auxiliary techniques to be extended to multiple classification. In this paper, we propose a prediction risk based feature selection method using multiple classification support vector machines. The performance of the proposed method is compared with the previous methods of optimal brain damage based feature selection methods using binary support vector machines. The results of experiments on UCI data sets show that prediction risk based feature selection method obtains better results than the previous methods using support vector machines for multiple classification problems.

However, users of constraint programming technology need significant expertise in order to model their problem appropriately. The lack of availability of such expertise can be a significant bottleneck to the broader uptake of constraint technology in the real world. In this paper we are concerned with automating the formulation of constraint satisfaction problems from examples of solutions and non-solutions. We combine techniques from the fields of machine learning and constraint programming. In particular we present a portfolio of approaches to exploiting the semantics of the constraints that we acquire to improve the efficiency of the acquisition process. We demonstrate how inference and search can be used to extract useful information that would otherwise be hidden in the set of examples from which we learn the target constraint satisfaction problem. We demonstrate the utility of the approaches in a case-study domain.

We consider the problem of identifying such features of random SAT instances automatically using machine learning. We describe and analyze models for three SAT solvers - kcnfs, oksolver and satz- and for two different distributions of instances: uniform random 3-SAT with varying ratio of clauses-to-variables, and uniform random 3-SAT with fixed ratio of clauses-to-variables. We show that surprisingly accurate models can be built in all cases. Furthermore, we analyze these models to determine which features are most useful in predicting whether an instance will be hard to solve. Finally we discuss the use of our models to build SATzi11a, an algorithm portfolio for SAV(1).

It provides a framework for representing and reasoning about the social factors that affect people's play. The model predicts how a human player is likely to react to different actions of another player, and these predictions are used to determine the best possible strategy for that player. Data collection and evaluation of the model were performed on a negotiation game in which humans played against each other and against computer models playing various strategies.

Understanding natural language requires identifying whether different mentions of a name, within and across documents, represent the same entity. We present two machine learning approaches to this problem, which we call the "Robust Reading". problem. Our first approach is a discriminative approach, trained in a supervised way. Our second approach is a generative model, at the heart of which is a view on how documents are generated and how names (of different entity types) are "sprinkled" into them. In its most general form, our model assumes: (1) a joint distribution over entities (e.g., a document that mentions "President Kennedy" is more likely to mention "Oswald" or "White House" than "Roger Clemens"), (2) an "author" model, that assumes that at least one mention of an entity in a document is easily identifiable, and then generates other mentions via (3) an appearance model, governing how mentions are transformed from the "representative" mention. We show that both approaches perform very accurately, in the range of 90% - 95% F-1 measure for different entity types, much better than previous approaches to (some aspects of) this problem. Our extensive experiments exhibit the contribution of relational and structural features and, somewhat surprisingly, that the assumptions made within our generative model are strong enough to yield a very powerful approach, that performs better than a supervised approach with limited supervised information.

There are two technical problems involved: (1) the correspondence problem in symbol grounding - how to associate words (symbols) with their perceptually grounded meanings from multiple cooccurrences between words and objects in the physical environment. (2) object learning - how to recognize and categorize visual objects. We argue that those two problems can be fundamentally simplified by considering them in a general system and incorporating the spatio-temporal and crossmodal constraints of multimodal data. The system collects egocentric data including image sequences as well as speech while users perform natural tasks. It is able to automatically infer the meanings of object names from vision, and categorize objects based on teaching signals potentially encoded in speech. The experimental results reported in this paper reveal the effectiveness of using multimodal data and integrating heterogeneous techniques in machine learning, natural language processing and computer vision.

However, locomotion on legged robots is a challenging multidimensional control problem. This paper presents a machine learning approach to legged locomotion, with all training done on the physical robots. The main contributions are a specification of our fully automated learning environment and a detailed empirical comparison of four different machine learning algorithms for learning quadrupedal locomotion. The resulting learned walk is considerably faster than all previously reported hand-coded walks for the same robot platform.

However, agents applying the same machine learning techniques in online applications have not been so successful. Even agent-based hybrid recommender systems that combine information filtering techniques with collaborative filtering techniques have only been applied with considerable success to simple consumer goods such as movies, books, clothing and food. Complex, adaptive autonomous agent systems that can handle complex goods such as real estate, vacation plans, insurance, mutual funds, and mortgage have yet emerged. To a large extent, the reinforcement learning methods developed to aid agents in learning have been more successfully deployed in offline applications. The inherent limitations in these methods have rendered them somewhat ineffective in online applications. In this paper, we postulate that a small amount of prior knowledge and human-provided input can dramatically speed up online learning. We will demonstrate that our agent HumanE - with its prior knowledge or "experiences" about the real estate domain can effectively assist users in identifying requirements, especially unstated ones, quickly and unobtrusively.

Until recently, designing such systems required extensive subject matter and computer vision expertise resulting in poor cross-domain portability and expensive maintenance. Recently, a machine-learned system (ADORE) was successfully applied in an aerial image interpretation domain. Subsequently, it was re-trained for another man-made object recognition task. In this paper we propose and implement several extensions of ADORE addressing its primary limitations. These extensions enable the first successful application of this emerging AI technology to a natural image interpretation domain. The resulting system is shown to be robust with respect to noise in the training data, illumination, and camera angle variations as well as competitively adaptive with respect to novel images.

In response, visionaries have begun proposing that computer systems be imbued with the ability to configure themselves, diagnose failures, and ultimately repair themselves in response to these failures. However, despite convincing arguments that such a shift would be desirable, as of yet there has been little concrete progress made towards this goal. We view these problems as fundamentally machine learning challenges. Hence, this article presents a new network simulator designed to study the application of machine learning methods from a system-wide perspective. We also introduce learning-based methods for addressing the problems of job routing and scheduling in the networks we simulate. Our experimental results verify that methods using machine learning outperform heuristic and hand-coded approaches on an example network designed to capture many of the complexities that exist in real systems.

In the machine learning phase, parametric representations of existent calligraphic artwork are derived from input images of calligraphy. Using a six-level hierarchical representation, the acquired knowledge is organized as a small structural stroke database, which is then exploited by a constraint-based analogous reasoning component to create artwork in new styles. A set of geometric constraints is proposed and incorporated into the system for rejecting the aesthetically unacceptable results. The combination of knowledge from various input sources creates a huge space for the intelligent system to explore and produce new calligraphy.

The approach is intended for hardware implementation and could be included in the network interface, switch or firewall. Efficient implementation in software on a network host is also possible. Network traffic is characterized using a novel technique that maps packet-level payloads onto a set of counters using bit-pattern hash functions, which were chosen for their implementation efficiency in both hardware and software. Machine learning is accomplished by mapping unlabelled training data onto a set of two-dimensional grids and forming a set of bitmaps that identify anomalous and normal regions. These bitmaps are used as the classifiers for real-time detection. The proposed method is extremely efficient in both the offline machine learning and real-time detection components and has the potential to provide accurate detection performance due to the ability of the bitmaps to capture nearly arbitrary shaped regions in the feature space.

EM ALGORITHM	Recent advancements in sensors, wireless technology, and a reduction in the form factor of computing devices, have pushed its closer to the realization of true autonomy in mobile sensing systems. Past field-deployable sensing systems for health/biomedical applications and even environmental sensing have been designed for data collection and data transmission at pre-set intervals, rather than for on-board processing. This lack of true autonomy has resulted in systems with lower lifetimes and those that require large amounts of bandwidth to transmit all sensory data at all times. We propose the use of a new, general machine learning architecture that can be used for a variety of autonomous sensing applications that have very limited computing, power, and bandwidth resources. We lay out general solutions for efficient processing in a multi-tiered (three-tier) machine learning framework that is suited for remote, mobile sensing systems with low computing capabilities. Simple pattern recognition methods are used at the sensor level to filter significant events. Novel dimensionality reduction techniques that are designed for classification are used to compress each individual sensor data and pass only relevant information to the mobile multisensor fusion module (second-tier). Statistical classifiers that are capable of handling missing/partial sensory data due to sensor failure or power loss are used to detect critical events and pass the information to the third tier (central server) for manual analysis and/or analysis by advanced pattern recognition techniques. The applicability of our technology in mobile health & alcohol monitoring is shown. Other uses of our solution are also discussed.

This principle has been embodied in support vector machines, a widely acclaimed generic approach to machine learning. This paper investigates the performance of the SRM principle in its application to standard least-squares regression and compares it with its integration with support vector machines.

For this purpose, two analysis methods are implemented to work in parallel. The first one is based on image document analysis (OCR recognition, physical block selection), the other on text analysis (word feature extraction, local grammar rules). Our main contribution consisted in introducing a neural network to find an optimal combination of the two approaches. Tests carried on real fax images show that the neural network improves performance compared to an empirical combination function and to each method used separately.

It has become one of the main tools for global gene expression analysis in molecular biology research in recent years. The large amount of expression data generated by this technology makes the study of certain complex biological problems possible, and machine learning methods are expected to play a crucial role in the analysis process. We present our results from integrating a Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the analysis of the various functions of Zebra fish genes based on their expression. We discuss how SOM can be used as a data-filtering tool to improve the classification performance of the SVM on this data set.

From an abstract pattern recognition viewpoint, the problem can be formulated as a (continuous) consistent labeling problem, whereby one has to assign symbolic labels to a set of objects by taking into account potential constraints between nearby objects. Motivated by this observation, in this paper we propose a new approach to the problem based on (optimally trained) relaxation labeling algorithms, a well-known class of iterative procedures that aim at reducing labeling ambiguities and achieving global consistency through a parallel exploitation of local information. Preliminary experiments performed on standard benchmark data confirm the effectiveness of the approach as compared to standard state-of-the-art machine learning predictors.

The key observation made here is that object variation due to appearance and due to geometric deformation are often,for good reasons, intermixed in typical object detection applications. In the paper we consider a whole range of differently specific object detectors. It is shown that such detectors vary in their robustness to geometric deformation and also their specificity. Such detectors can then be used in a cascade, where coarse detectors operate on a less-specific and more robust scale. This makes it possible to use coarse sampling of the space of geometric transformations. Further on more-specific and less robust detectors are used. This requires as input the detections at a coarser scale combined with an optimization search step. In the paper it is also discussed how such detectors can automatically be obtained from a coarsely defined database of ground truth.

They are, however very expensive from the computational point of view. In pattern recognition it is often necessary to match an unknown sample against a database of candidate patterns. In this process, however the size of the database is introduced as an additional factor into the overall complexity of the matching process. To reduce the influence of that factor an approach based on machine learning techniques is proposed in this paper Graphs are represented using feature vectors. Based on these vectors a decision tree is built to index the database. The decision tree allows at runtime to eliminate a number of graphs from the database as possible matching candidates.

We propose thresholding the distance of tested patterns from the SVM separating hyperplane as a way of rejecting a percentage of the miss-classified patterns thereby allowing reduction of the expected risk. Results show accurate performance of the SVM in classifying FISH signals in comparison to other state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers, indicating the potential of an SVM-based genetic diagnosis system.

In recent years, data in some applications has increased in both the number of instances and features. It is in this context that we introduce a novel approach to reduce both instance and feature space through Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for the classification of Emphysema in High Resolution Computer Tomography (HRCT) images. The technique was tested successfully on 60 HRCT scans having, Emphysema using three different classifiers (Naive Bayes, C4.5 and Seeded K Means). The results were also compared against "density mask", a standard approach used for Emphysema detection in medical image analysis. In addition, the results were visually validated by radiologists.

Database and query objects are embedded into a Euclidean space, in which similarities can be rapidly measured using a weighted Manhattan distance. Embedding construction is formulated as a machine learning task, where AdaBoost is used to combine many simple, 1D embeddings into a multidimensional embedding that preserves a significant amount of the proximity structure in the original space. Performance is evaluated in a hand pose estimation system, and a dynamic gesture recognition system, where the proposed method is used to retrieve approximate nearest neighbors under expensive image and video similarity measures. In both systems, in quantitative experiments, BoostMap significantly increases efficiency, with minimal losses in accuracy. Moreover the experiments indicate that BoostMap compares favorably with existing embedding methods that have been employed in computer vision and database applications, i.e., FastMap and Bourgain embeddings.

The algorithm is intended for use by blind and visually impaired subjects walking through city scenes. We first obtain a dataset of city images taken by blind and normally sighted subjects. From this dataset, we manually label and extract the text regions. Next we perform statistical analysis of the text regions to determine which image-features are reliable indicators of text and have low entropy (i.e. feature response is similar for all text images). We obtain weak classifiers by using joint probabilities for feature responses on and off text. These weak classifiers are used as input to an AdaBoost machine learning algorithm to train a strong classifier In practice, we trained a cascade with 4 strong classifiers containg 79 features. An adaptive binarization and extension algorithm is applied to those regions selected by the cascade classifier A commercial OCR software is used to read the text or reject it as a non-text region. The overall algorithm has a success rate of over 90% (evaluated by complete detection and reading of the text) on the test set and the unread text is typically small and distant from the viewer.

Traditional machine learning methods seeking an accurate performance over a full range of instances are not suitable to deal with this problem, since they tend to classify all the data into the majority, usually the less important class. Moreover, some current methods have tried to utilize some intermediate factors, e.g., the distribution of the training set, the decision thresholds or the cost matrices, to influence the bias of the classification. However, it remains uncertain whether these methods can improve the performance in a systematic way. In this paper, we propose a novel model named Biased Minimax Probability Machine. Different from previous methods, this model directly controls the worst-case real accuracy of classification of the future data to build up biased classifiers. Hence, it provides a rigorous treatment on imbalanced data. The experimental results on the novel model comparing with those of three competitive methods, i.e., the Naive Bayesian classifier, the k-Nearest Neighbor method, and the decision tree method C4.5, demonstrate the superiority of our novel model.

Many classical machine learning methods may result inadequate in this scenario because they seldom allow to make use of all the knowledge that we might have at hand. Visualization techniques, that have been used for a long time for data visualization, can also be used to visualize certain forms of knowledge, resulting in a more efficient data mining process. In this paper we present a unifying approach for knowledge visualization based on dimension reduction (DR) that allows to represent rules, cases, models and correlations on a low-dimensional visualization space in a consistent way.

In this paper we report on the application of a single layer neural network for reducing the number of originally measured genes from over 7000 to 64 through repeated application of thresholds on the weights linking genes to the class values of samples. This results in a small but informative gene set for the domain of brain cancer that can be further analyzed through the application of symbolic machine learning techniques (See5) and cluster analysis (Cluster and Treeview).

Key insights into the action and effects of a disease can be obtained by comparison of the expression of the expressed proteins in normal versus diseased tissue. Tandem mass spectrometry(MS/MS) of peptides is a central technology for Proteomics, enabling the identification of thousands of peptides from a complex mixture. With the increasing acquisition rate of tandem mass spectrometers, there is an increasing potential to solve important biological problems by applying data-mining and machine-learning techniques to MS/MS data. These problems include (i) estimating the levels of the thousands of proteins in a tissue sample, (ii) predicting the intensity of the peaks in a mass spectrum, and (iii) explaining why different peptides from the same protein have different peak intensities. In other works, we have focussed on the first two problems. In this paper, we focus on the last problem. In particular, we try to explain why some peptides produce peaks of great intensity, while others produce peaks of low intensity, and we treat this as a classification problem. That is, we experimentally evaluate and compare a variety of discrimination methods for classifying peptides into those that produce high-intensity peaks and those that produce low-intensity peaks. The methods considered include K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Naive Bayes, and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Experiments using these methods were conducted on three real-world datasets derived from tissue samples of Mouse. The methods were then evaluated using ROC curves and cross validation.

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to reduce dimensionality of the feature space by employing Independent Component Analysis. While ICA is primarily a Jeature extraction technique, we use it here as a feature selection technique in a generic way. Our technique, called FSS - ICA, is more efficient than many of its competitors without loss in accuracy. FSS_ICA determines a set of statistically independent features instead of merely reducing the number of the original features. In applications FSS_ICA results in a smaller number of effective features than the Relief attribute estimator, and it usually outperforms both the Relief attribute estimator and CFS, when used as a pre-processing step for Naive Bayes, instance based learning and decision trees. In addition, by disregarding some features, we demonstrate that in some cases FSS_ICA is more accurate than classification based on all features. Also, decision trees built from the preprocessed data are often significantly smaller than those derived from the original feature space. In addition, we also report the performance of ICA on a "real world" application in medical image segmentation.

Segmentation of abnormal lung patterns is a necessary stage in the construction of a computer-aided diagnosis system. We interpret lung patterns as textures and develop a texture classification technique for segmentation of lung patterns. The wavelet transform is used to extract texture features and then the Support Vector Machines (SVM) machine learning algorithm is applied to texture classification. The parameters of the SVM play a crucial role in the performance of the algorithm. We apply gradient-based optimization of the radius/margin bound of a generalization error to tune parameters of the SVM algorithm. We compare the performance of isotropic and anisotropic Gaussian kernels and study the applicability of the radius/margin bound to timing parameters of the SVM algorithm on the problem of lung pattern classification.

Proceedings of the 2004 Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks & Information Processing Conference			English	Proceedings Paper	Intelligent Sensors, Sensor Networks and Information Processing Conference	DEC 14-17, 2004	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA					The aim of this work is to develop an automatic lung segmentation system, capable of segmenting the lung into Apical, Middle and Basal regions, along the axial plane of the body. An accurate segmentation of the lung is important for diagnosis of diffuse lung diseases, as well as to characterise and track particular diseases. In this paper we compare the two strategies we have developed. The anatomy based approach uses anatomical landmark detection to define the separation points between the regions, whilst the machine learning approach uses lung shape, size and location properties, to classify a given lung into the appropriate region.

Given the value of design variables, under this circumstance, the values of objective functions are obtained by real/computational experiments such as structural analysis, fluid-mechanical analysis, thermodynamic analysis, and so on. Since those experiments are considerably expensive and also time consuming, thus it is actually almost impossible to find the exact solution to those problems by using conventional optimization methods. Recently, approximation methods using computational intelligence, for example, evolutionary algorithms and neural networks have been developed remarkably. Even those algorithms need a tremendous number of experiments to obtain an approximate solution. Furthermore, most engineering design problems should be formulated as multi-objective optimization problems so as to meet the diversified demands of designer. It also causes that the number of experiments goes on increasing. This paper proposes a new method using computational intelligence methods, which are a machine learning algorithm and an evolutionary algorithm, in order to make the number of experiments for finding the solution of problem with multi-objective functions as few as possible. Furthermore, this paper shows that the proposed method combining a machine learning algorithm and an evolutionary algorithm can generate well approximate Pareto frontier, and a decision making with two or three objective functions can be easily performed on the basis of visualized Pareto frontiers by our method. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method will be illustrated through several numerical and practical examples.

In the previous work, we apply 5 different supervised classification algorithms from the machine learning field on both the original gap dataset and the gap dataset with the best features selected using mutual information. In this paper, we improve the classification result with the aid of a set of feature variables of strokes preceding and following each gap. The best classification result attained suggests that the technique we employ is particularly suitable for digital ink manipulation at the level of words.

To address this problem, in this paper we propose a website reconfiguration system using the machine learning approach. First, a Naive Bayes Classifier is trained and then applied to identify each page in a web site as important oil unimportant in terms fulfilling visitors' information needs. For those important pages, we check the reason ableness of their locations, which is measured by the average number of hops needed to reach them during visitor sessions. Those important but difficult reach pages are considered for reconfiguration, which is done by either automatically moving them to some level closer to the visitors' starting point, making it easier for users to access them, or presenting webmasters with a list of suggestions. We also propose a formula to evaluate the "global structure" of a web site, and use it to examine the effect of our system on improving website design.

We show that many important text classifiers, either probabilistic or non-probabilistic, can be unified under this framework, and the proposed MCE classifier training approach can be applied to improve the classifier performance. In addition, we describe an effective MCE classifier training algorithm that uses AdaBoost to generate alternative initial classifiers, as opposed to combining multiple classifiers as it is typically used. This method is applied to MCE classifier training to overcome local minimums in optimal classifier parameter search, utilizing the fact that the family of generalized linear classifiers is closed under AdaBoost. Moreover, we extend the loss function in MCE training to incorporate training sample prior distributions to compensate the imbalanced training data distribution in each category. Experimental studies are performed on the text classification tasks, and the significant classification error reductions of 25% similar to 55% are observed.

Training adaptable systems, or machine learning agents, on large data sets is computationally costly and often ineffective. Proper management of data utilized for adaptation can speed up learning and decrease computational costs. The article presents a sample selection algorithm easily implementable into first order adaptable systems. It effectively selects an appropriate set of training exemplars at each iteration of adaptation. The selected exemplar set may vary in size and chosen data. Dynamic sample selection algorithm is computationally inexpensive and positively contributes to the increased convergence speed of the first order learning methods. The presented dynamic sample selection. is theoretically justified and practically demonstrated on the tasks of neural networks training. The simulation results indicate satisfactory performance.

Researchers strive to propose learners that are characterized by excellent accuracy, and sometimes also low computational complexity but the size of the data model generated by the learners is often not even reported. While the model size can be disregarded from the research point of view, it is very important from the end user's perspective. Quite often the generated model is too complex to be manually analyzed or inspected, which prohibits from using it in a real-world setting. To fill this gap, the paper proposes a novel framework, which is designed to address problem of complexity, reduction of rule based models. The framework is based on a Meta Mining concept, and can be applied to enhance several of existing rule learners. Its main goal is to reduce complexity in terms of reducing size and number of generated rules, without sacrificing accuracy of the rules. The paper proposes the framework, and tests it 077 a set of benchmark datasets using two well known rule learners: C5.0 and DataSqueezer. The results are encouraging, and show that 50% complexity reduction can be achieved virtually without any loss of accuracy.

It is an increasingly popular field that uses statistical, visualization, machine learning, and other data manipulation and knowledge extraction techniques aiming at gaining an insight into the relationships and patterns hidden in the data. Availability of digital data within picture archiving and communication systems raises a possibility of health care and research enhancement associated with manipulation, processing and handling of data by computers. That is the basis for computer-assisted radiology development. Further development of computer-assisted radiology is associated with the use of new intelligent capabilities such as multimedia support and data mining in order to discover the relevant knowledge for diagnosis. It is very useful if results of data mining can be communicated to humans in an understandable way. In this paper, we present our work on data mining in medical image archiving systems. We investigate the use of a very efficient data mining technique, decision tree, in order to learn the knowledge for computer-assisted image analysis. We apply our method to classification of x-ray images for lung cancer diagnosis.. The proposed technique is based on an inductive decision tree learning algorithm that has low complexity with high transparency and accuracy. The results show that the proposed algorithm is robust, accurate, fast, and it produces a comprehensible structure summarizing the knowledge it induces.

Based on Web mining and intelligent agent technologies, WMS03, a domain-oriented Web information mining model is presented in this paper. WMS03, a synthetic intelligent system can help users to mine information and knowledge on the Web quickly and effectively. First, the user can provide some pages or text documents or keywords or URLs as preference guidance for collecting information. WMS03 uses Machine Learning algorithms to extract features from this initiative information and to automatically learn the user's interests in special domains. Second, using intelligent agents, the system searches relevant information and monitors changes on the Web sites. Third, WMS03 uses expert systems with heuristic knowledge to cluster and filter information. Fourth, using neural networks and intelligent agents, WMS03 mines information and knowledge, and recommends new information to the user automatically.

The first phase detects the presence of the target class, while the second detects the absence of the target class. Emerging Patterns (EPs) are itemsets whose supports change significantly from one data class to another, while essential emerging patterns (eEPs) are minimal ones among the EPs. It has been shown that the eEPs are useful and sufficient for building accurate classifiers. This work proposes a novel classification method, called CEEPTP, to combine the idea of two-phase induction and classification by EPs. The experiment study carried on 15 benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository shows that CEEPTP performs comparably with other classification methods such as CBA, CMAR, C5.0, NB, and CAEP in terms of overall predictive accuracy.

We will discuss properties of it and apply it to discuss basic concepts in rough set theory. From the analysis, we construct a mapping between knowledge entropy theory and rough set theory, and we also hope to find effective algorithms by the application of it.

However, a non-trivial obstacle in good text filtering is the high dimensionality of the data. In this paper, we introduced a hybrid method to select features more accurately using some feature selection method and rough set theory. We can select features firstly using one of feature selection methods, such as x(2) statistic, mutual information, information gain, and then further select features using rough set. Thus more accurate and less features are extracted. In experiments, we used UCI machine learning dataset as our dataset.

Recently, an increasing number of telecommunications customers are switching from one service or service provider to another. This phenomenon is called 'churn', which is a major cause of corporations' loss of profitability. It is important for a telecommunications company to find out the transitional behavior of its customers through data mining. Our approach is to use a model-based clustering method, extended to handle multi dimensional data, to automatically and efficiently partition the customer behavior according to their behavior. We model this problem as a. sequential clustering problem, and present an effective solution for solving the problem when the elements in the sequences are of a multi-dimensional nature. We provide theory and algorithms for the task, and empirically demonstrate that the method is effective in mining the customers data for the telecommunications industry.

Currently, the dimensionality of feature set or instance set is very high in many applications, such as information retrieval, so the feature selection from high-dimensional data is also an urgent task for researchers. The paper presents a new approach, which is a two-level filter model system integrateing the ReliefF and a newly developed algorithm of feature cluster, to reduce the dimensionality of large-scale feature set via the feature correlation(relevance) including the feature-feature correlation and feature-class correlation. Our major contributions are: (1) to present a system to perform feature. selection from high-dimensional data; (2) to analyze the change of system architecture according to the time cost of the parts in the system; (3) to summarize and comment on the calculations of feature correlation; (4)to perform experiments to show the effective of the proposed approach, which has shown that the system can efficiently get a better compromise between dimensionality reduction and accuracy rate of classification than just part of the system. In many cases, it can improve the accuracy rate and dimensionality reduction.

Support Vector Machine works well for incremental learning model with impressive performance for its outstanding power to summarize the data space in a concise way. This paper proposes a heuristic algorithm to incremental learning with SVM taking the possible impact of new training data to history data into account. The idea of this heuristic algorithm is that the partition difference set has less elements, and existing hyperplane is much closer to the optimal one. New support vectors in this algorithm consist of existing support vectors and partition difference set of new training data and history data by separating hyperplane. The algorithm improves classification precision by adding partition difference set, and decreases the computation complexity by constructing new classification hyperplane on support vector set. The experiment results show that this heuristic algorithm is efficient and effective to improve the classification precision.

Rough set theory is a powerful tool to deal with knowledge reduction. The values of attributes in real world may often be both symbolic and real-valued, that is, hybrid. In order to deal with the reduction of the hybrid knowledge, we analyze Pawlak's rough approximations and its different kinds of extensive versions and then obtain a uniform form of knowledge granules and rough approximations under crisp and fuzzy relations. Aimed at hybrid knowledge reduction using the uniform rough approximations, we give a new interpretation to Yager's entropy from "knowledge granules" and present the concept and definitions of "granular entropy". Based on the granular entropy, we propose an approach to hybrid knowledge reduction. The utility of this approach is demonstrated with an application example in the wine recognition dataset from the UCI Machine Learning data repository.

Secondary structure prediction is a useful first step in understanding how the amino acid sequence of a protein determines the native state. There are many previous famous prediction methods available now, although most of them allow users to submit their queries to dedicated servers, bulk protein sequence prediction service such as the whole database sequence prediction is still not widely available or requires tedious waiting time. The author proposed a parallelized protein secondary structure prediction method namely mpiPSSP, using Message Passing Interface (MPI) on a multi-node compute cluster. A preprocess mpiSEQ processes and converts the Pasta-like database to the format preferred by mpiPSSP, and a post process mpiRES collects and reports the result as well. mpiPSSP can self-determine the appropriate number of processors according to the size of the querying database or also run using the user-desired number of processors. As the tasks are made independent of each other, a highly scalable solution is achieved.

Its two major parts are creating a tree and controlling its size. The advantage of rough set theory for processing uncertain data is used in this paper. From the viewpoint of the certainty of a decision table, the global certainty influenced by each of its condition attributes is used to select split-attributes and control the growing of decision tree. This simplifies the learning process, and solves the problem that the threshold for controlling the growing of decision trees must be given by domain experts in its pre-pruning process.

And it has been proved that computing the minimal reduction of decision system is NP-complete. This paper proposes a novel approach to obtain relative reduct of a decision system whose attributes values are expressed by fuzzy sets in rough set-based machine learning. Some properties of the discernibility relation matrix are presented first. The binary discernibility relation is used to find relative reduct directly, based on these properties. A heuristic information is presented in the process of selecting the attribute of relative reduct. The algorithm is presented and a simple example is detailed to illustrate the approach.

However, the exponentially increasing information provided by the Internet enterprises causes the problem of searching a lot of information in which customers are not interested. This would annoy the customers and finally lead them to quit shopping. To solve this problem, our paper builds a personalized products selection system in virtual mail to retrieve product information that the customers really demand. In order to realize personalized products selection, some concepts and techniques about machine learning such as rough set, fuzzy set, Case-Base Reasoning (CBR) is applied to our system. On the other hand, to achieve better realistic and human-like behavior, a virtual reality modeling language (VRML) 97mbased user interface is developed to permit users to navigate around the virtual mall.

Encryption invalidates content analysis techniques, while traffic analysis can solve the problem by concentrating on the nature and behavior of traffic. Based on the structural-stable but content-mutable properties of website, a method combining machine learning algorithm and traffic analysis technique is proposed for encrypted website recognition. Session Describing Vector, composed of connection count and data volumes transferred in each connection, is introduced to characterize a web surfing flow. And through vector normalization, generalization and ranking, the sequence, length and dimension weight are adjusted to improve the recognition effect The recognition process can be considered as a binary classification problem, thus SVM (support vector machine) algorithm is adopted because of its excellent performance in pattern classification problems. Experiments show that the proposed method can discern the vectors of a specific website from others clearly, and the process of generalization and ranking are of great help to classification.

An accurate forecast is required to guarantee a balanced network operation and ensure safe gas supply at a the minimal cost. Machine learning techniques are finding more and more applications in the field of load forecasting. A novel regression technique, called Support Vector Machines (SVM), based on the statistical learning theory is explored in this paper for the prediction of natural gas demands. SVM is based on the principle of Structure Risk Minimization as opposed to the principle of Empirical Risk Minimization supported by conventional regression techniques. Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LS-SVM) is a kind of SVM that has different cost function with respect to standard SVM. The research result shows that the prediction accuracy of SVM is better than that of neural network. The software package NGPSLF based on LS-SVM prediction has been gone into practical business application.

The original SVM was developed to solve the dichotomy classification problem. Various approaches have been presented to solve multi-class problems. Using multi-class SVM classifier we have obtained high class' rate of 95.4% in remote sensing image classification. But for the class number of remote sensing image is much great, manually obtaining of training samples is a much time-consuming work. So we present a multi-class SVM based semi-supervised approach. We choose the initial cluster centers manually first, then label the samples as the training ones automatically with fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm. It is believed that this method will upgrade the classification efficiency greatly with practicable class rate.

Its generalization accuracy, however, is not always optimal in dealing with real world problems with neither Gaussian distributions nor sharp boundaries. Incorporating domain theory about problems and excellent intelligent techniques in machine learning into SVM becomes one of promising alternatives. In this paper, a novel approach, explanation based generalized epsilon-SVM, which synthesizes SVM, prior knowledge, fuzzy logic and neural network, is proposed. Prior knowledge is expressed as a trained fuzzy neural network. An optimal subset of features is obtained by dynamically reducing feature space dimensionality according to the training derivatives extracted from network. By examining a subset of the practical data sampled from Guangdong Natural Science Foundation and testing the remaining set of data, application shows that explanation based generalized epsilon-SVM performs better than that pure SVM and other traditional classifiers.

In this paper, a new approach named BAGAEN is proposed, in which adaptive genetic. algorithm and Bootstrap algorithm are employed to increase the different degrees among individual RBF neural networks in order to enhance the generalization ability of a neural network system. The training set for individual RBF neural network is generated by the algorithm based on Bootstrap and the result can be obtained by using majority voting method or simple averaging method. Experimental results show that BAGAEN has preferable. performance in generating ensembles with strong generalization ability. Finally, BAGAEN is applied to predict the magnitude of earthquake.

This paper addresses the problem of feature selection for machine learning through a correlation and MSVM (Modified Support Vector Machines) based approach. The central hypothesis is that a good feature set contains features that are highly correlated with the class, yet uncorrelated with each other. So we introduce the CMFS (Correlation and MSVM-based Feature Selection). First, CMFS ranks the features using MSVM according to their correlation with the class. Secondly, CMFS uses a forward selection search with correlation-based method to form feature subset. A feature can be added to the feature set or not decided by the class separability of the feature and the correlation with the already chosen features. Experiments on artificial and natural datasets show that, compared with other algorithms, CMFS typically eliminates well much more features with less time and higher accuracy.

Symbolic machine learning algorithms, contrary to numerical type learning like regression and neural networks, try to predict a target concept, but at the same time also explain and justify it's prediction by inducing a rule set. Fuzzy sets are a generalization of crisp sets, and recently much attention was given to fuzzy generalizations of decision trees. Fuzzy rules have also been learned by neural networks and genetic algorithms. However, thus far very little has been done to provide fuzzy generalizations of set covering algorithms. In this paper we present an algorithm that can induce fuzzy conjunctive rules by following a fuzzy set covering approach. We show the Inductive bias of the algorithm is to prefer more general rules with good classification accuracy. We show results on real world domains, and compare the algorithm with other fuzzy and non-fuzzy learning algorithms.

The attackers attempt to exhaust the resource of the service provider in order to prevent legitimate. users from, using the system. Most of the detecting DoS tools, such as rule-based and threshold detection approaches, rely on the objective opinion of the domain experts. This paper aims to apply machine learning techniques, such as radial-basis function neural network (RBFNN) and support vector machines (SVM), to solved the DoS problem and compare which technique is better to detect DoS. The main advantage of this detection method is that it has the ability to detect or predict new attacks when some patterns are similar to the attack patterns learnt in the past. So it can detect novel attacks for which, signatures have not been defined.

Some pronunciation rides exist, but their precision is not sufficient for efficient speech synthesis. Therefore a machine-learning technique (decision trees or boosted decision trees) was applied in order to achieve better results. The paper presents a two level lexical stress assignment model for out of vocabulary Slovenian words used in our text-to-speech system. First, each vowel is determined, whether it is stressed or unstressed, and a type of lexical stress is assigned for every stressed vowel. Then, some corrections are made on the word level, according the number of stressed vowels and the length of the word. For data sets we used the MULTEXT-East Slovene Lexicon, which was supplemented with lexical stress marks. The accuracy achieved by decision trees significantly outperforms all previous results. However, the sizes of the trees indicate that the accentuation in the Slovenian language is a very complex problem and a simple solution in the form of relatively simple rides is not possible.

We adopt a patient-specific approach to exploit the consistency of an individual patient's seizure and non-seizure EEG. Our method uses a wavelet decomposition to construct a feature vector that captures the morphology and spatial distribution of an EEG epoch, and then determines whether that vector is representative of a patient's seizure or non-seizure EEG using the support-vector machine classification algorithm. Our completely automated method was tested on non-invasive EEG from thirty-six pediatric subjects suffering from a variety of seizure types. It detected 131 of 139 seizure events within 8.0 +/- 3.2 seconds following electrographic onset, and declared 15 false-detections in 60 hours of clinical EEG. Our patient-specific method can be used to initiate delay-sensitive clinical procedures following seizure onset; for example, the injection of an imaging radiopharmaceutical or stimulation of the vagus nerve.

This means a BCI allows a user to act on his environment only by using his thoughts, without using peripheral nerves and muscles. Nearly all BCIs contain as a core part a machine learning algorithm, which learns from training data a function, that can be used to discriminate different brain activities. In the present work we use a bayesian framework for machine learning, the evidence framework [1], [2], to develop a variant of linear discriminant analysis for the use in a BCI based on electroencephalographic measurements (EEG). Properties of the resulting algorithm are: a) a continuous probabilistic output is given, b) fast estimation of regularization constants, and c) the possibility to select among different feature sets, the one which is most promising for classification. The algorithm has been tested on one dataset from the BCI competition 2002 and two datasets from the BCI competition 2003 and provides a classification accuracy of 95%, 81%, and 79% respectively.

In order to understand the biological role of a specific gene, we will require knowledge of the corresponding protein's structure and function[1]. In this paper, we present a support vector machines based method for determining a protein's fold from sequence information alone where this sequence has little similarity with sequences with known structures. We have focused on improvement in multi-class classification, parameter tuning, descriptor design, and feature selections. The current implementation showed better performance than previous similar approaches.

Analysis of such data can help us identifying different clinical outcomes using only expressions of a few predictive genes. This paper presents an application of multi-agent system to the analysis of gene expression data. Our goal is to find significant classification genes using simple classifiers that can be used by agents when exploring the gene expression database. We present our results on two well-known publicly available gene expression problems where we try to achieve the highest possible accuracy of classification using the smallest possible set of genes.

Our approaches are orthogonal to existing algorithms and are based on the observation that typical mass spectrometry data contains a large amount of noise that can lead to wasteful computation. Our first improvement uses standard machine learning techniques with novel feature vectors derived from the mass spectra to identify and filter the noisy spectra. We demonstrate this approach results in computational gains of around 38% with less than 10% loss of peptides. Additionally we present a hierarchical searching scheme in which most samples are matched against a small database at low computational cost, leaving only a small number of samples to be searched against larger databases. Combining this scheme with the machine learning filters leads to a further performance improvement of 3%.

So far, the applicability of such an interface is strongly limited by low bit-transfer rates, slow response times and long training sessions for the subject. The Berlin Brain-Computer Interface (BBCI) project is guided by the idea to train a computer by advanced machine learning techniques both to improve classification performance and to reduce the need of subject training. In this paper we present two directions in which Brain-Computer Interfacing can be enhanced by exploiting the lateralized readiness potential: (1) for establishing a rapid response BCI system that can predict the laterality of upcoming finger movements before EMG onset even in time critical contexts, and (2) to improve information transfer rates in the common BCI approach relying on imagined limb movements.

The ID3 and C4.5 are the well-known algorithms for mining classification rules. However, The rules induced by ID3 are not optimal. Thus, Hu X. G propose a novel approach that inducing classification rules in Extended Concept Lattice (ECL) which improve Concept Lattice by introducing the equivalent intent. The approach is superior to ID3 and C4.5. But the new features of database such as the high-dimensionality and heterogeneity make the parallel/distributed data mining a hot research domain. Under this circumstance, we propose the parallel ECL for data mining from large scale database. In this paper, inducing classification rules in parallel ECL is investigated both theoretically and experimentally.

They compute a weighted sum of a number of criteria that must be satisfied. The central element of the OWA operators is that the criteria are reordered before aggregation and therefore a particular weight is associated to a position. Relevance Learning Vector Quantization (RLVQ) [2] is an extension of the Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) algorithm [3] and performs a heuristic determination of the relevance factors of the input dimensions. This method is based on Hebbian learning and associates a weight factor to each dimension of the input vectors. We present a LVQ method for on-line computing of the OWA weights as relevance factors. The method uses a weighted metric based on OWA restrictions. The principal benefit of our algorithm is that it connects two distinct topics: RLVQ algorithm and the consistent mathematical model of the OWA operators.

There are many choice points in the planning process, but lack of information precludes proper decision. In this paper, we introduce a new method for adding automatic learning capability to a forward planning system. Our idea is based on a dynamic voting algorithm to choose the best action to proceed to the next state. In every planning cycle, applicable actions (i.e. those actions whose preconditions are satisfied in the current world state) vote to, and compete with each other. As a result of this voting, gradually more useful actions are chosen. This idea has been applied to the blocks world domain, and the preliminary results show significant improvement in the performance of the planner, particularly for larger problems.

The mass of content available on the Web raises important questions over its effective use. To cope with such environments, the promise of information customization systems is becoming highly attractive. In this paper we present MASACAD, a multi-agent system that learns to advise students by mining the Web and discuss important problems in relationship to information customization systems and smooth the way for possible solutions. The main idea is to approach information customization using a multi-agent paradigm in combination with a number of aspects from the domains of machine learning, user modeling, and Web mining.

A classical method based on a systematic search of the whole solution space is inefficient due to its non-polynomial time complexity. In this paper, a heuristic method for the input variable partitioning is proposed and discussed The method is based on the application of evolutionary algorithms that allows exploring the possible solution space of a problem while keeping the high-quality solutions in this reduced space. The experimental results show that the proposed heuristic method is able to construct an optimal or near optimal solution very efficiently even for large systems. It is much faster than the systematic method while delivering results of comparable quality.

Support Vector Machines are fast emerging as a powerful machine-learning tool for pattern recognition, decision-making and classification. Logarithmic Number Systems (LNS) utilize the property of logarithmic compression for numerical operations. Within the logarithmic domain, multiplication and division can be treated simply as addition or subtraction. Hardware computation of these operations is significantly faster with reduced complexity. Leveraging the inherent properties of LNS, we are able to achieve significant savings over double-precision floating point in an implementation of a SVM classification algorithm.

Selectivity reduces the dimensionality of the feature space that in turn results in significant speed up during online classification. We compare our method with another leading margin-based classifier, the Support Vector Machines (SVM) and identify the advantages of using AdaBoost over SVM in this context. We use histograms of Gabor and Gaussian derivative responses as the appearance features. We apply our approach to the face expression recognition problem where local appearances play an important role. Finally, we show that though SVM performs equally well, AdaBoost feature selection provides a final hypothesis model that can easily be visualized and interpreted, which is lacking in the high dimensional support vectors of the SVM.

It represents a visualization framework that is based on the combination of four components, namely, metric learning, intrinsic dimensionality estimation, feature extraction and feature selection. Thus, we view the visualization of high-dimensional data as a more complex process than the conventional dimensionality reduction. Though many successful applications of dimensionality reduction techniques for visualization are known, we believe that the sophisticated nature of high-dimensional data often needs a concentration of several machine learning methods to solve the task, which is provided by the framework in experiments with real-world data.

Unlike other methods. NMF is based on non-negative constraints, which allow to learn parts from objects. In this paper, we combine NMF with four classifiers (nearest neighbor, kernel nearest neighbor, k-local hyperplane distance nearest neighbor and support vector machine) in order to investigate the influence of dimensionality reduction performed by NMF on the accuracy rate of the classifiers and establish when NMF is useless. Experiments were conducted on three real-world datasets (Japanese Female Facial Expression, UCI Sonar and UCI BUPA liver disorder). The first dataset contains face images as patterns whereas patterns in two others are composed of numerical measurements not constituting any real physical objects when assembled together. The preliminary conclusion is that while NMF turned out to be useful for lowering a dimensionality of face images, it caused a degradation in classification accuracy when applied to other two datasets. It indicates that NMF may not be good for datasets where patterns cannot be decomposed into meaningful parts, though this thought requires further, more detailed, exploration. As for classifiers, k-local hyperplane distance nearest neighbor demonstrated a very good performance, often outperforming other tested classifiers.

We present implementation of Knowledge Discovery techniques for regularities search in tables of context features of DNA sequences involved in gene transcription regulation. Results: Discovery of regularities is based on construction of complex signals of these features including experimental information on gene expression and prediction of potential transcription factor binding sites. The search patterns for regularities have been constructed in the first-order logic with probabilistic estimates. The sets of promoter nucleotide sequences were selected from TRRD and EMBL databases based on tissue-specificity, type of gene regulation or joint expression in a functional system. Set of regularities relating the nucleotide sequences and gene functional class were found. Prediction by regularities of tissue-specific promoters in long genomic DNA showed high accuracy.

The algorithm uses incremental learning to select and update the set of exemplar points. The clustering of the data is based on the CHAMELEON algorithm which uses a k-sparse graph approach. Our algorithm has the advantages that it can handle clusters that have irregular shapes and varying sizes while still allowing an incremental processing of the data. We describe the algorithm and present results obtained from generated datasets. We also compare its clustering performance with the CURE algorithm which is another algorithm that uses representative points to cluster data.

Past methods developed to track drift only use previously observed data to detect changes that occur in the concept, thus they are simply reacting to change. We present a method that not only uses previous knowledge to interpret the data but also to predict future data streams and identify possible changes in the concept. To track the drift, the algorithm also combines the concept change estimate with the prediction trend in order to control the forgetting mechanism used to discard old data. The advantages of the new approach are that it helps the system converge faster to the target concept and it provides the system with a more effective way to interpret the data. We present the algorithm and analyse its performance using the STAGGER concept benchmark problem.

Ensembles with randomly ordered classifiers usually exhibit a generalization error that decreases as the number of classifiers that are aggregated increases. If an appropriate order for aggregation is chosen, the generalization error reaches, at intermediate numbers of classifiers, a minimum, which lies below the asymptotic error of the ensemble. This work presents some heuristics that exploit the relations between the classifiers in a bagging ensemble to identify the appropriate ordering and then select a subset for aggregation according to a desired amount pruning. The resulting subensembles are smaller and improve the classification performance of the original ensemble.

The vacillating nature of the stock market requires the use of data mining techniques like clustering for stock market analysis and prediction. Genetic algorithms and neural networks have the ability to handle complex data and are immune to noise in the input. In this paper, we propose an algorithm Evolutionary Approach to Self Organizing Map(EASOM) to cluster stock market data. Genetic algorithms are used to train the Kohonen network for better and effective prediction. Fuzzy logic is used to fix learning rate for faster convergence. The algorithm was tested on real stock market data of companies like Intel, General Motors, Infosys, Wipro, Microsoft, IBM, etc. The algorithm consistently outperformed regression model, backpropagation algorithm and Kohonen network in predicting the stock market values.

However, since it requires multiple database scans, applying the EM algorithm to large databases is not realistic. In this paper we propose a variant of the EM algorithm which requires only one database scan and works within a confined memory space. The algorithm is based on a generalization of the EM algorithm proposed for learning of hierarchical mixture models. A notable advantage of our algorithm over existing variants of the EM algorithm for large databases lies in its simplicity. Our algorithm preserves the theoretical clearness of the EM algorithm.

One method of business is market segmentation analysis. Consequently, the classical approaches to segmentation such as demographic and behavioral segmentation schemes are well known. Entrepreneurs may segment their market on the basis of demographic characteristics such as age, income, or gender and geographic concentrations of consumers with the desired attributes. Demographic variables are a critical component to market segmentation because DEMAND for most products is related to factors such as age, income, and race. This research analyzes about automobile data by Back propagation artificial neural networks which one of machine learning technique for determining market plans. It used for classifying the group of geographic concentrations of consumers. When the segment model finished, it shown classifying model for analyzing concentrations of consumers. The third segment of the automobile is favorable, the mostly of group C is the Japanese car. The result from this analysis can be used to help determine marketing plans, particularly promotion, and to help companies retain and regain market share.

The most crucial problem confronting TTS systems is the generation of natural sounding voice. In order to obtain natural sounding synthetic speech, prosodic attributes of speech such as pitch frequency, duration and intensity should be modelled appropriately. This paper summarizes the efforts to obtain duration models to be utilized in Turkish TTS systems via machine-learning algorithms. In natural speech, segment durations are highly correlated to context. Similar/same phones differ from each other in their energy, duration and fundamental frequency depending on their context. To obtain natural speech thru TTS, prosodic variations due to context should be modeled. Different methods of modeling duration have been applied over the years. Two corpus-based statistical systems - Linear regression and C4.5 decision tree - are employed in modeling segment durations in Turkish.

We investigated two symbolic supervised machine teaming techniques - logistic regression analysis (LRA) and decision trees (DT), where the knowledge is represented in an explicit way - to find classification rules for the presence of PKU. Our experiments were performed on pre-classified newborn screening data including a metabolite spectrum of 14 amino acids. LRA and.. DT classifiers showed high classification performance with a sensitivity of >= 97.7% and a specificity of >= 99.8%. In addition to the established diagnostic metabolites of phenylalanine and tyrosine, we also included alternative constellations of metabolites in our models showing comparable results in predictive power. The presented machine learning techniques are appropriate to investigate metabolic patterns in newborn screening data for constructing classification models for PKU.

Previous studies examined egg-laying events manually. This paper presents a method for automatic detection of egg-laying onset using deformable template matching and other morphological image analysis techniques. Some behavioral changes surrounding egg-laying events are also studied. The results demonstrate that the computer vision tools and algorithm developed here can be effectively used to study C elegans egg-laying behaviors. The algorithm developed will be an essential part of a machine vision system for C elegans tracking and behavioral analysis.

Specifically, we apply the AdaBoost.M2 algorithm - at the level of utterances - to maximum likelihood and discriminative training of the acoustic parameters of a Hidden Markov Model based speech recognizer. In an isolated word recognition task, boosting improves the best test error rates obtained with discriminative training, even when evaluating final classifiers with a comparable number of parameters. This is demonstrated in a matched and a mismatched decoding task. The second issue of our work is the extension of our algorithm to continuous speech recognition. To this end, we propose an approach realizing the combination of boosted acoustic models at a lexical level, allowing for an online (single-pass) decoding setup for the boosted models. First results are presented for maximum likelihood training in a real-life spontaneous speech dictation task with a 60k word vocabulary and about 58h of training data.

Frame theory provides a well founded mathematical framework for representing data in many different ways. We analyze the effects of sparse and dense data representations on the generalization error of such learning machines measured by using leave-one-out error Given a finite number of training data. We show that, in the case of sparse data representation, the Generalization capacity of an SVM trained by using polynomial or Gaussian kernel functions is equal to the one of a linear SVM. We show that sparse data representations reduce the generalization error as long as the representation is not too sparse, as in the case of very large dictionaries. Very sparse representations increase drastically the Generalization error of kernel based methods. Dense data representations, on the contrary, reduce the Generalization error also in the case of very large dictionaries. We use two different schemes for representing data in overcomplete Haar and Gabor dictionaries, and measure SVM Generalization error on bench mark data set.

The learned set of visual parts is optimized to yield an optimal performance for recognition of new objects. We divide the learning strategy into two main steps that follow our proposed, cognitively motivated principles of learning descriptive and distinctive parts Of objects. We first extract the most dissimilar representative parts from all possible parts of all objects in the same class. We then select the most discriminative subset of this set with respect to the classification of shapes into classes. In order to computationally evaluate our approach, we developed a shape similarity measure that is able to compare parts of objects. The obtained measure yields intuitive results for significantly distorted or occluded parts even if parts are given at different scales.

Vector Machine (SVM) is a new kind of machine learning method, which constructs an optimal hyperplane from a small subset of samples, near the boundary, named as support vectors. But in large scale problems choosing these, support vectors by SVM involves a large scale quadratic programming and is thus of high computational cost, which is regarded as one of the bottle-neck for its application. In this paper we present a new algorithm developed from classical SVM, which use Genetic Algorithm (GA) to preprocess the initial training data for a small subset, which may include most of the support vectors, then train a classical SVM with this subset to obtain a classifier. The new method combines the benefits of the generalization ability, of SVM and the capability of GA in dealing large-scale data set. Our experimental results suggest that GA-SVM may have a better performance than SVM in both training speed and generalization accuracy.

The SVM is a new machine learning method introduced recently by Vapnik, well founded in the framework of the statistical learning theory, and appropriate for approaching classification and regression problems. It operates on the principle of structure risk minimization; hence a better generalization ability is guaranteed. This paper discusses the basic principle of the SVM at first, and then uses it as a classifier to identify the gas category. The method can classify complicated patterns and achieve higher identification rate at reasonably small size of training sample set and can overcome disadvantages of the artificial neural networks (ANNs). The experiments of the identification of three different gases, ethanol, gasoline and acetone, have been presented and discussed. The results indicate that the SVM identifier exhibits good generalization performance and enables the average identification rate to reach 87.71% for the testing samples. This means the method proposed is effective for gas identification.

This rapid growth brings with it several interesting issues such as improving the quality of customer service by ensuring that individual customer's needs are reflected in the products offered. However, finding an appropriate insurance product on the Web can be a difficult and time-consuming process. In this paper we analyse the application of machine learning techniques in modeling customers of an electronic insurance market as an approach to better match customers and insurance product offers, reducing the needed effort in negotiating an insurance product, providing a valuable add-on to both customer's and insurers' sides.

The goal consists of discriminating between molecular compounds exhibiting or not certain pharmacological activities. Different machine learning approaches have been recently applied to different drug design problems leading to competitive results in pointing at particular compounds with high probability of exhibiting activity. The present work first deeps into the natural trade-off between accuracy in the much less populated active group and false alarm rate which could lead to too many expensive laboratory tests. Preliminary results show how different classification techniques are suited for this particular problem and throw light to keep improving the results by considering also the acceptance/rejection trade-off.

Whether the support design of it is successful or not direct relates to the safe of construction and operation. By now, there isn't a very good design method due to the high complexity of its deformation mechanism. A new machine learning algorithm-support vector machines (SVM) is introduced into the field of soft rock engineering supporting design. An improved SVR algorithm is presented to meet the needs of this problem and the corresponding calculation code is programmed. It can be concluded that a high degree of prediction accuracy and a very good generalization can be obtained in little learning samples using this algorithm from the calculation result of engineering instance in this paper. It can avoid difficulty in collecting samples in geotechnical engineering and the over-fitting problem of artificial neural network (ANN) which brings the difficulty in determining parameters of ANN It facilitates user to a great extent and provides a new way in supporting design of similar engineering.

Software metrics provide quantitative means to control the software development and the quality of software products. The ISO/IEC international standard (14598) on software product quality states, "Internal metrics are of little value unless there is evidence that they are related to external quality". Many different approaches have been proposed to build such empirical assessment models. In this work, different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are explored with regard to their capacities of producing assessment/predictive models, for three quality characteristics.

Knowledge in an OAT is expressed in terms of a collection of examples exhibiting a set of properties or attributes, in such a way each example belongs to a given class of concepts. Thus, each example constitutes a concrete portion of knowledge about the concepts of the corresponding class. The task of the inductive leaming mechanism consist of finding intensional descriptions of every concept present in the OAT in terms of the properties exhibited by the examples. Situations with incompletely described attribute properties are widely present in real world applications. In these cases the OAT is said to contain "unknown" or "partially unknown" knowledge about the values of certain attributes, which are named incompletely specified attributes. Surprisingly, research on this field has received poor attention. A generic language to represent discrete, incompletely specified attributes is described in [11], in such a way completely and incompletely specified attributes are treated in an unified way. That is, there is no need for different processing mechanisms for completely and incompletely specified values of the attributes. Moreover, the proposed language is independent of the particular characteristics of the values of the discrete attributes, in such a way a general inductive procedure working on arbitrary attributes can be implemented. In this work an extension of [11] covering the treatment on continuous, incompletely specified attributes is presented. The final proposed language allows an unified representation of discrete and continuous attributes with completely and incompletely specified values.

Recent studies have shown that XCS is highly competitive with respect to other classifier schemes. However, these studies have been mainly based on the analysis and improvement of the classification accuracy, paying few attention to the explanatory ability of the system. This paper focuses on the latter aspect. We highlight the high number of rules that XCS evolves in real-world datasets, which makes the human interpretation of the extracted knowledge difficult. Therefore, we investigate several algorithms that reduce the ruleset after training, with the aim of obtaining a simpler explanation of the dataset without loosing much generalization ability. We compare three algorithms in terms of the number of rules that are finally obtained, the loss in classification accuracy and the CPU cost. We also find that training XCS during high number of iterations does not improve the classification accuracy of the system but increases the reliability of the reduction algorithms.

Having detected such signs, IDSs trigger alerts to report them. These alerts are presented to a human analyst, who evaluates them and initiates an adequate response. In practice, IDSs have been observed to trigger thousands of alerts per day, most of which are false positives (i.e., alerts mistakenly triggered by benign events). This makes it extremely difficult for the analyst to correctly identify the true positives (i.e., alerts related to attacks). In this paper we describe ALAC, the Adaptive Learner for Alert Classification, which is a novel system for reducing false positives in intrusion detection. The system supports the human analyst by classifying alerts into true positives and false positives. The knowledge of how to classify alerts is learned adaptively by observing the analyst. Moreover, ALAC can be configured to process autonomously alerts that have been classified with high confidence. For example, ALAC may discard alerts that were classified with high confidence as false positive. That way, ALAC effectively reduces the analyst's workload. We describe a prototype implementation of ALAC and the choice of a suitable machine learning technique. Moreover, we experimentally validate ALAC and show how it facilitates the analyst's work.

Neural network ensemble is one such modular system that uses this divide-and-conquer strategy. Diverse set of networks improves ensemble's performance over its constituent networks. Artificial speciation is used here to produce this diverse set of networks that solve different parts of a data classification task and complement each other in solving the complete problem. Fitness sharing is used in evolving the group of neural networks to achieve the required speciation. Sharing is performed at phenotypic level using modified Kullback-Leibler entropy as the distance measure. The group as a unit solves the classification problem and outputs of all the networks are used in finding the final output. For the combination of neural network outputs 3 different methods - Voting, averaging and recursive least square are used. The evolved system is tested on two data classification problems (Heart Disease Dataset and Breast Cancer Dataset) taken from UCI machine learning benchmark repository.

Recently, there is an increasing demand for information on actual land cover resp. land use from planning, administration and science institutions. Remote sensing provides timely information products in different geometric and thematic scales. The effort to manually classify land use data is still very high. Therefore a new approach is required to incorperate automated image classification to human image understanding. The proposed approach couples object-based clasification technique - a rather new trend in image classification - with machine learning capacities (Support Vector Classifier) depending on information levels. To ensure spatial and spectral transferability of the classification scheme, the data has to be passed through several generalisation levels. The segmentation generates homogeneous and contiguous image objects. The hierarchical rule type uses direct and derived spectral attributes combined with spatial features and information extracted from the metadata. The identified land cover objects can be converted into the current CORINE classes after classification.

It is useful to automatically identify attributes of these subfields, since they are used for linking a citation with the actual cited article. In this article, we employ a Support Vector Machine (SVM), a method of machine learning, to automatically identify subfields. We then employ a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to improve the identification accuracy. Information from the subfields identified by the SVM, and syntactic information analyzed by the HMM, are integrated to make an accurate identification.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS XX	BCS CONFERENCE SERIES		English	Proceedings Paper	23rd International Conference on Innovative Techniques and Applications of Artificial Intelligence	DEC, 2003	Cambridge, ENGLAND	SGAI		decision tree; comprehensibility; performance; multiobjective; genetic programming	RAZOR	Decision tree induction has been studied extensively in machine learning as a solution for classification problems. The way the linear decision trees partition the search space is found to be comprehensible and hence appealing to data modelers. Comprehensibility is an important aspect of models used in medical data mining as it determines model credibility and even acceptability. In the practical sense though, inordinately long decision trees compounded by replication problems detracts from comprehensibility. This demerit can be partially attributed to their rigid structure that is unable to handle complex non-linear or/and continuous data. To address this issue we introduce a novel hybrid multivariate decision tree composed of polynomial, fuzzy and decision tree structures. The polynomial nature of these multivariate trees enable them to perform well in non-linear territory while the fuzzy members are used to squash continuous variables. By trading-off comprehensibility and performance using a multi-objective genetic programming optimization algorithm, we can induce polynomial-fuzzy decision trees (PFDT) that are smaller, more compact and of better performance than their linear decision tree (LDT) counterparts. In this paper we discuss the structural differences between PFDT and LDT (C4.5) and compare the size and performance of their models using medical data.

For the approach to be generic, all these methods are applied directly on pixel values without any feature extraction. We compared them on four publicly available datasets corresponding to representative applications of image classification problems: handwritten digits (MNIST), faces (ORL), 3D objects (COIL-100), and textures (OUTEX). A comparison with studies from the computer vision literature shows that generic methods can come remarkably close to specialized methods. In particular, our sub-window algorithm is competitive with the state of the art, a remarkable result considering its generality and conceptual simplicity.

Proposed algorithms can be used to increase efficiency of supervised learning. A reduced training set consisting of selected instances is used as an input for the machine-learning algorithm. This may result in reducing time needed for learning or increasing learning quality or both. The paper presents a collection of four algorithms, which are used to reduce the size of a training set. The algorithms are based on calculating for each instance in the original training set the value of its similarity coefficient. Values of the coefficient are used to group instances into clusters. Out of each cluster only a limited number of instances is selected to form a reduced training set. One of the proposed algorithms uses population-learning algorithm for selection of instances. The approach has been validated by means of computational experiment.

That is Light Dual-Schemata Model. Light Dual-Schemata Model is a framework for subjective symbol formation. Robots equipped with Light Dual-Schemata Model can differentiate their concepts about environmental dynamics, which are called "perceptional schema". This differentiation comes out by a robot's subjective error estimates, rather than an objective error defined by a designer, which enables a robot's subjective differentiation process. An experiment is shown to prove its reasonableness. In the experiment, a facial robot forms appropriate schemas so as to chase a moving ball in a simulation world. This formation process deeply depends on the interaction context which is designed not by a designer who produced the robot, but by a caregiver who interacts with the robot.

The Role Graph Model is the only RBAC system which has the notion of a group graph. We show how using the group graph to assign users to groups rather than directly to roles helps with this security design. We also show how a machine-learning based classifier can be used to do user-group assignment.

Despite the number of machine learning algorithms applied to KDD 99 cup, none of them have introduced a pre-model to reduce the huge information quantity present in the different KDD 99 datasets. We introduce a method that applies to the different datasets before performing any of the different machine learning algorithms applied to KDD 99 intrusion detection cup. This method enables us to significantly reduce the information quantity in the different datasets without loss of information. Our method is based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It works by projecting data elements onto a feature space, which is actually a vector space R-d, that spans the significant variations among known data elements. We present two well known algorithms we deal with, decision trees and nearest neighbor, and we show the contribution of our approach to alleviate the decision process. We rely on some experiments we perform over network records from the KDD 99 dataset, first by a direct application of these two algorithms on the rough data, second after projection of the different datasets on the new feature space.

Therefore ontologies are unlikely to identify every useful or interesting classification possible in a problem domain, for example these might be of a personalised nature and only appropriate for a certain user in a certain context, or they might be of a different granularity than the initial scope of the ontology. We argue that machine learning techniques will be essential within the Semantic Web context to allow these unspecified classifications to be identified. In this paper we explore the application of machine learning methods to FOAF, highlighting the challenges posed by the characteristics of such data. Specifically, we use clustering to identify classes of people and inductive logic programming (ILP) to learn descriptions of these groups. We argue that these descriptions constitute re-usable, first class knowledge that is neither explicitly stated nor deducible from the input data. These new descriptions can be represented as simple OWL class restrictions or more sophisticated descriptions using SWRL. These are then suitable either for incorporation into future versions of ontologies or for on-the-fly use for personalisation tasks.

Manually creating such metadata is tedious and error-prone, and many software engineers, accustomed to tools that automatically generate WSDL, might not want to invest the additional effort. We therefore propose ASSAM, a tool that assists a user in creating semantic metadata for Web Services. ASSAM is intended for service consumers who want to integrate a number of services and therefore must annotate them according to some shared ontology. ASSAM is also relevant for service producers who have deployed a Web Service and want to make it compatible with an existing ontology. ASSAM's capabilities to automatically create semantic metadata are supported by two machine learning algorithms. First, we have developed an iterative relational classification algorithm for semantically classifying Web Services, their operations, and input and output messages. Second, to aggregate the data returned by multiple semantically related Web Services, we have developed a schema mapping algorithm that is based on an ensemble of string distance metrics.

Following a Machine Learning approach, this setting can be cast as a search problem to be solved employing operators that traverse the search space expressed in a structural representation, aiming at correct concept definitions. The progressive refinement of such definitions in a terminology is driven by the available extensional knowledge (metadata). A knowledge-intensive inductive approach to this task is presented, that can deal with on the expressive Semantic Web representations based on Description Logics, which are endowed with well-founded reasoning capabilities. The core inferential mechanism, based on multilevel counterfactuals, can be used for either inducing new concept descriptions or refining existing (incorrect) ones. The soundness of the approach and its applicability are also proved and discussed(1).

To date the semantic indexing of images has concentrated on applying machine-learning techniques to a set of manually-annotated images in order to automatically label images with keywords. In this paper we propose a new hybrid, user-assisted approach, Rules-By-Example (RBE), which is based on a combination of RuleML and Query-By-Example. Our RBE user interface enables domain-experts to graphically define domain-specific rules that can infer high-level semantic descriptions of images from combinations of low-level visual features (e.g., color, texture, shape, size of regions) which have been specified through examples. Using these rules, the system is able to analyze the visual features of any given image from this domain and generate semantically meaningful labels, using terms defined in the domain-specific ontology. We believe that this approach, in combination with traditional solutions, will enable faster, more flexible, cost-effective and accurate semantic indexing of images and hence maximize their potential for discovery, re-use, integration and processing by Semantic Web services, tools and agents.

The methodology is based on a combination of information extraction, information integration and machine learning techniques. Learning is seeded by extracting information from structured sources (e.g. databases and digital libraries) or a user-defined lexicon. Retrieved information is then used to partially annotate documents. Annotated documents are used to bootstrap learning for simple Information Extraction (IE) methodologies, which in turn will produce more annotation to annotate more documents that will be used to train more complex IE engines and so on. In this paper we describe the methodology and its implementation in the Armadillo system, compare it with the current state of the art, and describe the details of an implemented application.

When there exist complicated constraints, direct selection could be very inefficient since many candidates may not be feasible but cannot be excluded beforehand. To meet the challenge, machine learning method is introduced in this paper to perform feasibility analysis. The Rough Set Theory is first applied to establish the relationship between a plan and its feasibility and an iterative reinforcement process is applied to enhance confidence. It offers a very efficiency way to determine the feasibility of a remanufacturing plan. Based this, a Constrained Ordinal Optimization method is developed to find good enough plans in massive number of choices. The numerical testing results show this method is promising and scalable for the large-scale problems. The results lay a basis for developing simulation based optimization methods with complicated constraints.

These intelligent service networks provide a critical opportunity for companies to gain additional revenues at the same time that they reduce costs for the companies and their customers alike. Intelligent service models are emerging first in complex industries such as automotive, defense, power and aerospace. In this paper we develop a framework for real-time agent-enabled intelligent service provisioning using a new machine learning algorithm called associative memory. Specifically, we discuss developments in the aviation industry that are part of the PILOT (Prognostics-Integrated Logistics) Project.

In the environment internet service provisioning cannot be expected executing in a single close organization [1]. Identity management in cross-organization becomes an issue for handling Internet service and distributive business process. The "identity" in cross-organization web service is defined as global identity rather than private identity from client. Global identity searching; table that registers all related service organization is the normal way we used to [2]. Through global identity searching table the target service organization can be looked up directly. For some business program, however, global identity is not necessary registered in specific service organization, e.g. IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identification) registration in NP (Number Portability) Service [3], for instance. In NP Service each IMSI can be re-assigned to different mobile service provider if the IMSI apply the re-assigmnent. In the example about IMSI in NP service mentioned above, if there is an internet service will be executed according to identity management with IMSI, then it will be a challenge to find the organization for available IMSI in very short response time. To dynamically re-assign a IMSI in different mobile service provider, the traditional global identity searching table will not be practical due to frequently changing the registration of IMSI in different service provider. To give an intelligent searching model for cross-organization global identity management is a better way than a static global identity searching table management in Web service. In this article the XCS (eXtended Classifier System) classifier system [4] will be proposed as the kernel system. With the characteristics in machine learning and rules management, the XCS-based intelligent searching model can help to predict where the web service can find the global identity in the open and cross-organization environment.

Some researchers have tried to apply SVMs to Intrusion Detection recently and got desirable results. By analyzing C-SVM theoretically and experimentally, we found that C-SVM had some properties which showed C-SVM was not most suitable for Network Intrusion Detection. First, C-SVM has different classification error rates on different classes if the sizes of training classes are uneven. Second. C-SVM is over-dependent on every training sample, even if the samples are duplicated. Third, C-SVM does not make a difference between training samples. According to these characteristics of C-SVM and the fact that the size of network normal data is always much larger than that of intrusion data and the fact that the importance of attack data is different from each other, an extended C-SVM, termed weighted C-SVM is proposed in this paper. Weighed C-SVM introduces two parameters, class weights and sample weights. Class weights are used to adjust false negative rate and false positive rate of each intrusion class. And sample weights are used to emphasize importance of some intrusion samples. Experiments showed that Weighted C-SVM was more effective than C-SVM in network intrusion detection systems.

IMC tuning rules have a number of advantages for enhancing control performance. IMC can minimize disturbance and use only one tuning parameter, so that it is attractive for industrial users. For more aggressive control, we decrease the tuning parameter(more rapid response); for more robust response, we increase the tuning parameter(slower response). Usually we design the tuning parameter by trials and errors. But it is not so easy to design an optimal parameter for a specific system, especially for a nonlinear system. A neural networks(NN) based IMC for pneumatic servo system has been proposed by the authors. On the other hand, in the last twenty years, GA is attractive as a method which gives an optimal answer for global search, optimization and machine learning problems. In this paper, we propose an intelligent control scheme in which IMC is combined with GA. GA will get the optimal or "near optimal" tuning parameter on-line after some generations. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is confirmed by experiments using the existent pneumatic servo system.

By using a similarity threshold and local error based insertion criterion, the system is able to grow incrementally and to accommodate input patterns of on-line non-stationary data distribution. The definition of a utility parameter - "error-radius" enables this system to learn the number of nodes needed to solve a current task. The usage of a new technique for removing nodes in low probability density regions can separate the clusters with low-density overlaps and dynamically eliminate the noise in the input data. The design of two-layer neural network makes it possible for this system to represent the topological structure of unsupervised on-line data, report the reasonable number of clusters and give typical prototype patterns of every cluster without any priori conditions such as suitable number of nodes or a good initial codebook.

Data-mining systems based on machine-learning usually need a large number of iterations to acquire correct solutions, whereas people usually find appropriate hidden rules after only a small number of observations of the instances in a dataset. We think that this quick learning is the result of using tentative hypothesis as the data-model in the early steps of the learning. If the hypothesis happens to be accurate, the learning will be completed immediately after the hypothesis is applied. We therefore reduce the effort required for learning by gambling on the possibility that the tentative hypothesis is accurate. Our new machine learning system emulates this process by minimizing an objective function that represents not only the likelihood of error but also the predicted learning-cost. In experiments, the new system yields appropriate solutions to function approximation problems with only a small number of observations of instances. This system will be helpful for emergent problem solving.

After exploring the quite well known theory of discrete and continuous Bayesian networks, we introduce an almost instant reasoning scheme to the hybrid Bayesian networks. In addition to illustrate the similarities of the dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) and the Kalman filter, we present a computationally efficient approach for the inference problem of hybrid dynamic Bayesian networks (HDBN). The proposed method is based on the separations of the dynamic and static nodes, and following hypercubic partitions via the Decision tree algorithm (DT). Experiments show that with high statistical confidence the novel algorithm used in the HDBN performs favorably in the tradeoffs of computational complexities and accuracy performance when compared to Junction tree and Gaussian mixture models on the task of classifications.

A human subject is first recorded using a videocamera as he/she utters a pre-determined speech corpus. After processing the corpus automatically, a visual speech module is learned from the data that is capable of synthesizing the human subject's mouth uttering entirely novel utterances that were not recorded in the original video. The synthesized utterance is re-composited onto a background sequence which contains natural head and eye movement. The final output is videorealistic in the sense that it looks like a video camera recording of the subject. At run time, the input to the system can be either real audio sequences or synthetic audio produced by a text-to-speech system, as long as they have been phonetically aligned.

For modeling face, we express face by a multi-view face texture space model with the aid of 3D Point Distribution Model space to express the shape variation in compact way, which can result in synthesis of the novel view face texture with various realistic expressions and poses. The appearance space and shape space are connected by bridge of 2D mesh structures. Following the idea of Analysis-by-Synthesis, we employed model fitting analysis using Levenberg-Marquardt optimization and trajectory training for smooth and continuous animation. The encouraging experimental results are shown.

One of these skills is the ability to understand the emotional state of the person. The most expressive way humans display emotions is through facial expressions. In most facial expression systems and databases, the emotion data was collected by asking the subjects to perform a series of facial expressions. However, these directed or deliberate facial action tasks typically differ in appearance and timing from the authentic facial expressions induced through events in the normal environment of the subject. In this paper, we present our effort in creating an authentic facial expression database based on spontaneous emotions derived from the environment. Furthermore, we test and compare a wide range of classifiers from the machine learning literature that can be used for facial expression classification.

In the proposed system, hand gestures are represented by the 3D trajectories of blobs. Blobs are obtained by tracking colored body parts in real-time using the EM algorithm. In most of the studies on hand gestures, only small vocabularies have been used In this paper, we study the results obtained on a more complex database of mono- and bi-manual gestures. These results are obtained by using a state-of-the-art sequence processing algorithm, namely Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), implemented within the framework of an open source machine learning library.

We derive the differential equations by which we attempt to maximize the marginal likelihood function with respect to hyper-parameters. Average-case performance and linear stability of the algorithm are evaluated exactly at the mean-field level. We conclude that the solution of the Boltzmann-machine learning equation is asymptotically stable as long as the solution is identical to the correct value of the hyper-parameters.

Specifically, we use Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Conducting the occupation coding manually is expensive and sometimes leads to inconsistent coding results when the coders are not experts of the occupation coding. For this reason, a rule-based automatic method has been developed and used. However, its categorization performance is not satisfiable. Therefore, we adopt SVMs, which show high performance in various fields, and compare it with the rule-based method. We empirically show that SVMs outperform the rule-based method in the occupation coding with JGSS(Japanese General Social Surveys) data set. These two methods can be expanded to apply to responses to open-ended questions similar to occupation data.

We focus on the particular form of the latter, the Grade of Membership (GoM) model, which was developed in the 1970s in the context of medical diagnosis. Other examples of partial membership models include Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model, developed in machine learning; and a genetics clustering model for multilocus genotype data. All these models represent individuals as having partial membership in several subpopulations. Latent class models provide an example of full membership structure. The GoM model is related to traditional latent class models, but it employs the concept of partial rather than full membership. We illustrate a special case of 2-profile GoM model on a subset of disability data from the National Long Term Care Survey. We use a Bayesian framework for estimation of the GoM model parameters, and compare the results to those of the 2-class latent class model. In the final section, we discuss the broader class of partial membership models.	Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA	Erosheva, EA (reprint author), Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.

A range of glasses-free multi-viewer screens have been developed that require as many as 9 views generated for each frame of video. This presents difficulties in both view generation and transmission bandwidth. This paper examines the use of stereo video capture as a means to generate multiple scene views via disparity analysis. A machine learning approach is applied to learn relationships between disparity generated depth information and source footage, and to generate depth information in a temporally smooth manner for both left and right eye image sequences. A view morphing approach to multiple view rendering is described which provides an excellent 3D effect on a range of glasses-free displays, while providing robustness to inaccurate stereo disparity calculations.

Classification errors occur when the classes overlap in the feature space. We examine a different situation, occurring when the classes are, by definition, not mutually exclusive. Such problems arise in scene and document classification and in medical diagnosis. We present a framework to handle such problems and apply it to the problem of semantic scene classification, where a natural scene may contain multiple objects such that the scene can be described by multiple class labels (e.g., a field scene with a mountain in the background). Such a problem poses challenges to the classic pattern recognition paradigm and demands a different treatment. We discuss approaches for training and testing in this scenario and introduce new metrics for evaluating individual examples, class recall and precision; and overall accuracy. Experiments show that our methods are suitable for scene classification; furthermore, our work appears to generalize to other classification problems of the same nature.

In statistical PR, there are two classical categories for unsupervised learning methods and models: first, variations of Principal Component Analysis and Factor Analysis, and second, learning vector coding or clustering methods. These are the starting-point in this article. The more recent trend in unsupervised learning is to consider this problem in the framework of probabilistic generative models. If it is possible to build and estimate a model that explains the data in terms of some latent variables, key insights may be obtained into the true nature and structure of the data. This approach is also reviewed, with examples such as linear and nonlinear independent component analysis and topological maps.

If the patterns are represented using graphs, the sample's graph is matched against a database of model graphs and the pattern recognition problem is turned into a graph matching problem. Graph matching is a powerful yet computationally expensive procedure. If the unknown sample is matched against a whole database of prototypes, the size of the database is introduced as an additional factor into the overall complexity of the matching process. To reduce the influence of that factor an approach based on machine learning techniques is proposed in this paper. The graphs are represented using feature vectors. Based on these vectors a decision tree is built to index the database. The decision tree allows at runtime to eliminate a number of graphs from the database as possible matching candidates. Experimental results are reported demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed filtering procedure. The work presented in this paper extends previous studies from the case of graph-isomorphism to the problem of subgraph-isomorphism.

Recently, a number of classifier creation and combination methods, known as ensemble methods, have been proposed in the field of machine learning. They have shown improved recognition performance over single classifiers. In this paper a number of ensemble methods for handwritten word recognition are described, experimentally evaluated, and compared to each other. Those methods include classical, general purpose ensemble methods as well as novel ensemble methods specifically developed by the authors for handwritten word recognition. The aim of the paper is to investigate the potential of ensemble methods for improving the performance of handwriting recognition systems. The base recognition systems used in this paper are hidden Markov model classifiers.

Practical problems in bioinformatics and in vision however show that this setting often is an oversimplification of reality. While label information is of course invaluable in most cases, it would be a huge waste to ignore the information on the cluster structure that is present in an (often much larger) unlabeled sample set. Several recent contributions deal with this topic: given partially labeled data, exploit all information available. In this paper, we present an elegant and efficient algorithm that allows to deal with very general types of label constraints in class learning problems. The approach is based on spectral clustering, and leads to an efficient algorithm based on the simple eigenvalue problem.

Some of the systems are semiautomatic, requiring user input to begin processing, and others are fully automatic, producing output from the input corpus without guidance. For each Emerging Trend Detection (ETD) system we describe components including linguistic and statistical features, learning algorithms, training and test set generation, visualization, and evaluation. We also provide a brief overview of several commercial products with capabilities of detecting trends in textual data, followed by an industrial viewpoint describing the importance of trend detection tools, and an overview of how such tools are used. This review of the literature indicates that much progress has been made toward automating the process of detecting emerging trends, but there is room for improvement. All of the projects we reviewed rely on a human domain expert to separate the emerging trends from noise in the system. Furthermore, we discovered that few projects have used formal evaluation methodologies to determine the effectiveness of the systems being created. Development and use of effective metrics for evaluation of ETD systems is critical. Work continues on the semiautomatic and fully automatic systems we are developing at Lehigh University [HDD].

This algorithm divides the closure search space into several subspaces in accordance with criterions prescribed ahead and introduces an efficient scheme to recognize the valid ones, in which the searching for closures is bounded An intermediate structure is employed to judge the validity of a subspace and compute closures more efficiently. Since the searching in subspaces are independent tasks, a parallel algorithm based on search space partition can be directly reached.

In this paper, we present an innovative technique for dealing with MWEs in the context of MT. The technique permits bilinguals to give translations of MWEs in the form of patterns, without requiring them to be trained linguistically. The interpretation of the patterns is done by a dynamic machine learning algorithm, which allows the main rule-based MT system to operate based on linguistic rules. Thus, the bilingual patterns (without any explicit linguistic input) are used in conjunction with the main linguistic system. This is made possible by the learning pathway templates. These templates need to be specially prepared by trained linguists only once. After that they help to process potentially a large number of patterns. The implemented system is being used with a large-scale rule-based MT system to improve its performance. This framework can also be extended to help example-based or statistical MT systems to deal with MWEs.

While previous statistical approaches, such as Hidden Markov Models, are based on theoretical assumptions that are not always met in natural language, we propose a methodology which incorporates fundamental elements of two distinct machine learning disciplines. We make use of Bayesian knowledge representation to provide a robust classifier, namely a Probabilistic Neural Network one, with additional context information in order to better infer on the correct Part-of-Speech label. As for training material, we make use of minimal linguistic information, i.e. only a small lexicon which contains the words that belong to non-declinable POS categories and closed-class words. Such minimal information is augmented by statistical parameters generated by Bayesian networks learning and the outcome is fed into the Probabilistic Neural Network classifier for the task of Part-of-Speech tagging. Experimental results portray satisfactory performance, in terms of 3.5%-4% error rate.

The prediction of these elements robustly relies on the accuracy and the quality of error-prone linguistic procedures, such as the identification of the part-of-speech and the syntactic tree. Additional linguistic factors, such as rhetorical relations, improve the naturalness of the prosody, but are hard to extract from plain texts. In this work, we are proposing a method to generate enhanced prosodic events for TtS by utilizing accurate, error-free and high-level linguistic information. We are also presenting an appropriate XML annotation scheme to encode syntax, grammar, new or given information, phrase subject/object information, as well as rhetorical elements. These linguistically enriched has have been utilized to build realistic machine learning models for the prediction of the prosodic structures in terms of segmental information and ToBI marks. The methodology has been applied by exploiting a Natural Language Generator (NLG) system. The trained models have been built using classification via regression trees and the results strongly indicate the realistic effect on the generated prosody. The evaluation of this approach has been made by comparing the models produced by the enriched documents to those produced by plain text of the same domain. The results show an improved accuracy of up to 23%.

For our purpose we used a database consisted of 5.500 words, distributed in 500 paragraphs. In the present study, pitch accent placement was treated as a binary classification task. Hence, given a word form in its sentential context, it was decide whether it should be unaccented or bear a pitch accent tone.

This "semantic" infrastructure is becoming to be referred as Semantic Grid. In this paper we propose an original approach to the development of a system for the creation of the Knowledge Layer of the Semantic Grid, that is, the layer which carries the informative content that the community shares. Using well-assessed Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning methodologies and techniques, our goal is to acquire and organize the information stored in the Grid, where this information is supposed to be represented in unstructured documents. Our intent is to extract and shape knowledge in syntactic patterns and organize them into a hierarchy of relational concepts, whose goal is to improve the process of knowledge retrieval and maintenance.

The execution is done in three steps; first, the given mapping is divided into some Q-equivalent classes; second, the distances between the mapping and each local fuzzy logic function are calculated by a simplified logic formula; and last, the shortest distance is obtained by a modified graph-theoretic algorithm. After a fundamental algorithm for fitting is provided, fuzzy logic functions are applied to a more practical example of classification problem, in which expressiveness of fuzzy logic functions is examined for a well-known machine learning database.

We present in this paper the ContextCam, a prototype of a consumer video camera that provides point of capture annotation of time, location, person presence and event information associated to recorded video. Both low- and high-level metadata are discovered via a variety of sensing and active tagging techniques, as well as through the application of machine learning techniques that use past annotations to suggest metadata for the current recordings. Furthermore, the ContextCam provides users with a minimally intrusive interface for correcting predicted high-level metadata during video recording.

Currently,Web personalization is the most, promising approach to remedy this problem, and Web usage mining, is considered a crucial component of any effective Web personalization system. Web usage mining techniques such as clustering and association rules, which rely on offline pattern discovery from user transactions, can be used to improve searching in the Web. We present the Profile Extractor, a personalizadon component based on machine learning techniques, which allows for the discovery of preferences and interests of users that have access-to a Web site. More specifically, we present the module that exploits unsupervised learning techniques for the creation of communities of users and-usage patterns applied to customers of an on-line bookshop. To support our work, we have performed several experiments and discussed the results.

On the other hand, fast and efficient initialization of the student model is necessary. Otherwise the tutoring system may lose its credibility in the first interactions with the student. In this paper we describe a framework for the initialization of student models in Web-based educational applications. The framework is called ISM. The basic idea of ISM is to set initial values for all aspects of student models using an innovative combination of stereotypes and the distance weighted k-nearest neighbor algorithm. In particular, a student is first assigned to a stereotype category concerning her/ his knowledge level of the domain being taught. Then, the model of the new student is initialized by applying the distance weighted k-nearest neighbor algorithm among the students that belong to the same stereotype category with the new student. ISM has been applied in a language learning system, which has been used as a test-bed. The quality of the student models created using ISM has been evaluated in an experiment involving classroom students and their teachers. The results from this experiment showed that the initialization of student models was improved using the ISM framework.

The approach applies Hidden Markov Models and Multidimensional Scaling to analyze and assess sequences of coded online student interaction. These analysis techniques were used to train a system to dynamically recognize ( 1) when students are having trouble learning the new concepts they share with each other, and ( 2) why they are having trouble. The results of this research may assist an instructor or intelligent coach in understanding and mediating situations in which groups of students collaborate to share their knowledge.

Though visual representations are applicable to several stages of the knowledge discovery process, a common use of visualization is in the initial stages to explore and organize a sometimes unknown and complex data set. In this context, the integrated and coordinated - that is, user actions should be capable of affecting multiple visualizations when desired - use of multiple graphical representations allows data to be observed from several perspectives and offers richer information than isolated representations. In this paper we propose an underlying model for an extensible and adaptable environment that allows independently developed visualization components to be gradually integrated into a user configured knowledge discovery application. Because a major requirement when using multiple visual techniques is the ability to link amongst them, so that user actions executed on a representation propagate to others if desired, the model also allows runtime configuration of coordinated user actions over different visual representations. We illustrate how this environment is being used to assist data exploration and organization in a climate classification problem.

Searching for relevant information can be overwhelming, thus contributing to the user's sense of information overload. Building systems for assisting users in this task is often complicated by the difficulty in articulating user interests in a structured form - a profile - to be used for searching. Machine learning methods offer a promising approach to solve this problem. Our research focuses on supervised methods for learning user profiles which axe predictively accurate and comprehensible. The main goal of this paper is the comparison of two different approaches for inducing user profiles, respectively based on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) and probabilistic methods. An experimental session has been carried out to compare the effectiveness of these methods in terms of classification accuracy, learning and classification time, when coping with the task of learning profiles from textual book descriptions rated by real users according to their tastes.

The solutions are design motifs which software engineers imitate and introduce in the architecture of their program. It is important to identify the design motifs used in a program architecture to understand solved design problems and to make informed changes to the program. The identification of micro-architectures similar to design motifs is difficult because of the large search space, i.e., the many possible combinations of classes. We propose an experimental study of classes playing roles in design motifs using metrics and a machine learning algorithm to fingerprint design motifs roles. Fingerprints are sets of metric values characterising classes playing a given role. We devise fingerprints experimentally using a repository of micro-architectures similar to design motifs. We show that fingerprints help in reducing the search space of micro-architectures similar to design motifs efficiently using the Composite design motif and the JHOTDRAW framework.

Such prediction models are especially beneficial for large-scale systems, where verification experts need to focus their attention and resources to problem areas in the system under development. This paper presents a novel methodology for predicting fault prone modules, based on random forests. Random forests are an extension of decision tree learning. Instead of generating one decision tree, this methodology generates hundreds or even thousands of trees using subsets of the training data. Classification decision is obtained by voting. We applied random forests in five case studies based on NASA data sets. The prediction accuracy of the proposed methodology is generally higher than that achieved by logistic regression, discriminant analysis and the algorithms in two machine learning software packages, WEKA [32] and See5 [5]. The difference in the performance of the proposed methodology over other methods is statistically significant. Further the classification accuracy of random forests is more significant over other methods in larger data sets.

Since many abbreviations represent important content in biomedical literature, information retrieval and extraction benefits from identifying the meanings of biomedical abbreviations. Since many abbreviations are ambiguous, it would be important to map abbreviations to their full forms, which ultimately represent the meanings of the abbreviations. In this study, we present a novel unsupervised method that applies MEDLINE records as a knowledge source for disambiguating abbreviations in full-text biomedical journal articles. We first automatically generated from MEDLINE records a knowledge source or dictionary of abbreviation-full pairs. We then trained on MEDLINE records and predicted the full forms of abbreviations in full-text journal articles by applying supervised machine-learning algorithms in an unsupervised fashion. We report up to 92% prediction precision and up to 91 % coverage.

Because experience is very subjective different experts propose different diagnosis and decision based on the same facts gathered with observation of a patient. Machine learning methods also poses background knowledge encoded in theirs induction algorithms. In this paper we present a method for modifying this background knowledge and can therefore produce different hypothesis on same observation that therefore exposes different aspects e.g. opinions of experts. We also present a method for combining these hypotheses in combined, hopefully highly accurate, hypothesis by using boosting and multimethod approach.

Introduced to overcome the main drawbacks encountered by text-based images retrieval, which are the subjective and manual annotation of images, content based images retrieval (CBIR) systems index images according to low-level visual features such as color, texture, shape to retrieve similar images. However, despite the progress achieved in the content based image retrieval, in particular with the relevance feedback approach where the user refine the search via the specification of relevant or not relevant items, the current CBIR systems still have a major difficulty that it has yet to overcome: how to negotiate the "semantic gap"? This problem comes from the mismatch between their capabilities and the needs of users. In this paper, we address the problem of how relate low-level features to high level to bring out semantic concepts from images. Our aim is to combine content-based and metadata-based approaches for image retrieval from a user perspective to yield better results and overcome to the lacks of these techniques when they are taken separately. To represent the semantic content of images, we propose a model which takes account of the interaction between the user and the metadata. In particular, we model the semantic user' preference by analyzing its answers through the Relevance Feedback process. Furthermore, we introduce a new machine learning technique that modify the weights (i.e. relative importance) of metadata representing the semantic content of images.

The channelized Hotelling observer (CHO) is a well-known numerical observer, which is used as a surrogate for human observers in assessments of lesion detectability. We explore the possibility of replacing the linear CHO with nonlinear algorithms that learn the relationship between measured image features and lesion detectability obtained from human observer studies. Our results suggest that both support vector machines and neural networks can offer improved performance over the CHO in predicting the human-observer performance.

It is observed that pixel intensity of a PVE pixel depends on the proportions of each tissue type present. It is very important to estimate the partial volume effect, in order to increase the accuracy of the quantitative measurements made from magnetic resonance images (MRI). The main objective of this paper is to classify the PVE pixels present in a MR image with low probability of error by using information theoretic penalization to the log-likelihood of the given image and address the model initialization issue properly. We employ mixtures models for this purpose, which are flexible and powerful probabilistic modeling tool for univariate and multivariate data. There usefulness is acknowledged in any area which involves statistical modeling of data, for example, image analysis, machine learning, computer vision and medical imaging. Furthermore, we use MML based penalization for unsupervised model selection and estimation of model parameters is accelerated by using non-informative initializations and component-wise EM.

These methods have been applied to the problem of aided feature extraction (AFE) from remote sensing airborne multispectral and hyperspectral imaging systems, and space-based multi-platform multi-modality imaging sensors. The methods enable color fused 36 visualization, as well as interactive exploitation and data mining in the form of human-guided machine learning & search for objects, landcover, and cultural features. This technology has been evaluated on space-based imagery for the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, and real-time implementation has also been demonstrated for terrestrial fused-color night imaging. We have recently incorporated these methods into a commercial software platform (ERDAS Imagine) for imagery exploitation. We describe the approach and user interfaces, and show results for a variety of sensor systems with application to remote sensing feature extraction including EO/IR/MSI/SAR imagery from Landsat & Radarsat, multispectral Ikonos imagery, and Hyperion and HyMap hyperspectral imagery.

Two machine learning approaches, i.e., decision tree classifier (DTC) and support vector machine (SVM), are implemented as multisource geospatial data classifiers in the AFIRS. Specifically, we apply the AFIRS to the mapping of United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) tracts in Texas County, Oklahoma. CRP is a nationwide program, and recently USDA announced payments of nearly $1.6 billion for new CRP enrollments. It is imperative to obtain accurate CRP maps for effective and efficient management and evaluation of the CRP program. However, most existing CRP maps are inaccurate and few work has been done to improve their accuracy. The proposed AFIRS is capable of handling the complex CRP mapping problem with high accuracy when limited training samples are available. Simulation results show that 5 - 10% improvements can be obtained by incorporating GIS ancillary data and other derived features in addition to multispectral imagery. This work validates the applicability of machine learning approaches to the complex realworld remote sensing applications.

The study implements the SVM structural risk minimization concept in searching for the optimal setting of the classifier kernel and parameters. We propose thresholding the distance of tested patterns from the SVM separating hyperplane as a way of rejecting a percentage of the miss-classified patterns thereby allowing reduction of the expected risk. Results shou, accurate performance of the SVM in classifying FISH signals in comparison to other state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers, indicating the potential of an SVW-based genetic diagnosis system.

The agents consist of multiple modules that individually perform simple tasks but collectively exhibit complex behavior. The agents themselves are able to interact with one another in order to process the information. Knowledge gathered by the agent system is employed to augment an existing knowledge base that in conjunction with an expert system is used for fault identification. This is achieved by means of an incremental learning algorithm. The agent system is an improvement on the conventional labor intensive and potentially error-prone procedures for the gathering and integration of new knowledge for fault identification systems.

In order to automate this process, pattern recognition methods are used in the present work for computer-aided diagnosis, considering a variety of morphometric features, expressing size and shape, color and texture, which are combined in order to achieve more accurate results. The large number of measurements implies selection methods to be applied to the identification of the most discriminative subset. This paper describes 62 cell morphological attributes extracted, selected and analyzed using a system under development. We validate our results by using the Weka (Waikato Environment Knowledge Analysis) machine learning algorithms. The obtained results illustrate the importance of feature selection for improving the classification of leukocytes from blood smears.

In these tests performance is often strongly related to or solely based on the accuracy of the classifier on a limited set of instances. The use of measure functions has been suggested as a promising approach to deal with this limitation. However, no usable implementation of a measure function has yet been presented. This article presents such an implementation and demonstrates its usage through a set of experiments. The results indicate that there are cases for which measure functions may be able to capture important aspects of the evaluated classifier that cannot be captured by cross-validation tests.

For large learning tasks with many training examples, the general quadratic programs quickly become intractable in their memory and time requirements. Thus the decomposition method is essential for the support vector machine learning. The working set selection is the most important issue of the decomposition method. Convergence of problems depends on the working set selection. In this paper we propose a working set selection method that can be applicable to large working set. Experimental results on various problems show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods.

In this study, we assess the feasibility of kernel based learning machines to estimate the photocatalyst activity using high-throughput screening data. Nanoparticular anatase-based photocatalyst specimens were characterized in a two dimensional feature space and their activity in emulated daylight was determined in a high-throughput screening procedure. Using this data, a kernel based support vector machine (SVM) was applied to model the relation between the feature space and the activity. After the learning, our scheme provided reasonable estimations of the activity of independent test specimens. It is concluded that kernel based SVMs are feasible for the estimation of photocatalyst activity.

In this paper,,the estimation of drag coefficient is treated as a regression problem in the machine learning setting and application of Support Vector Regression is proposed as the solution. Separate Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are used for subsonic, transonic and supersonic regions. The inputs to the SVMs consist of physical parameters and Mach number and the output is the zero-yaw drag coefficient. The use of SVM with sufficient training data set obviates the need for post-estimation corrections with real firing data. The method of Support Vector regression call be used for the estimation of other aerodynamic coefficients also.

In this paper, an integrated approach for an ontology-based leaf classification system is proposed, wherein machine teaming techniques play a crucial role for the automatization of the system. For the leaf contour classification, a sealed CCD code system is proposed to categorize the basic shape and margin type of a leaf by using the similar taxonomy principle adopted by the botanists. Then a trained neural network is employed to recognize the detailed tooth patterns. The measurement on an unlobed leaf is also conducted automatically according to the method used in botany. For the leaf vein recognition, the vein texture is extracted by employing an efficient combined thresholding and neural network approach so as to obtain more vein details of a leaf Compared with the past studies, the proposed method integrates low-level features of an image and the specific knowledge in the domain (ontology) of botany, and therefore provides a more practical system for users to comprehend and handle. Primary experiments have shown promising results and proven the feasibility of the proposed system.

It is very important to identify probability distributions or estimate density functions fast and efficiently. Support vector machine(SVM) based on statistical learning theory has been used generally in machine learning because of its good generalization ability. By using SVM we can classify and identity some probability distributions appeared in queuing system and solve the density function regression problem through using support vector regression (SVR). Some other problems need to be solved are formulated in the end.

The ASE software uses onboard continuous planning, robust task and goal-based execution, and onboard machine learning and pattern recognition to radically increase science return by enabling intelligent downlink selection and autonomous retargeting. In this paper we discuss how these AI technologies are synergistically integrated in multi-layer control architecture to enable a virtual spacecraft science agent. We will also present the preliminary results from flight validation of this experiment. This software will demonstrate the potential for space missions to use onboard decision-making to detect, analyze, and respond to science events, and to downlink only the highest value science data. As a result, ground-based mission planning and analysis functions will be simplified, thus reducing operations cost.(1).

High accuracy is achieved by combining the decisions of multiple methods using the consensus of a committee (or an ensemble) classifier Our technique is rooted in machine learning which shows that by judicially employing component classifiers, an ensemble classifier can be constructed to outperform its components. We use two sequence- and three structure-comparison tools as component classifiers. Given a protein structure, using the joint hypothesis, we first determine if the protein belongs to an existing category (family, superfamily. fold) in the SCOP hierarchy. For the proteins that are predicted as members of the existing categories, we compute their family-, superfamily-, and fold-level classifications using the consensus classifier We show that we can significantly improve the classification accuracy compared to the individual component classifiers. In particular, we achieve error rates that are 3-12 times less than the individual classifiers' error rates at the family level, 1.5-4.5 times less at the superfamily level, and 1.1-2.4 times less at the fold level.

With more attention being paid on full-text mining in bioinformatics, we initiated an effort of studying figures in full articles. FigSearch is a prototype figure legend indexing and classification system, using both text-mining and supervised machine learning. We defined schematic representations of protein interactions and signaling events as an interesting figure type. A maximum entropy classifier was used in categorizing each figure, by assigning an estimated likelihood, as being relevant/non-relevant according to our definition. One advantage of the maximum entropy principle is that it provides a probability of decision, instead of a binary assignment. In our pilot study, FigSearch showed satisfactory performance in a preliminary validation by domain experts. Such a system can be useful in applications such as for a publisher's website, in bio-picture gallery constructions, or as an aid for other complicated text-mining projects.

Classification based on microarray data is very different from previous classification problems in that the number of features (genes) greatly exceeds the number of instances (tissue samples). It has been shown that selecting a small set of informative genes can lead to improved classification accuracy. It is thus important to first apply feature selection methods prior to classification. In the machine learning field one of the most successful feature filtering algorithms is the Relief-F algorithm. In this work, we empirically evaluate its performance on three published cancer classification data sets. We use the linear SVM and the kappa-NN as classifiers in the experiments, and compare the performance of Relief-F with other feature filtering methods, including Information Gain, Gain Ratio, and chi(2)-statistic. Using the leave-one-out cross validation, experimental results show that the performance of Relief-F is comparable with other methods.

We describe the development of a machine learning method for predicting biological process as defined by the Gene Ontology (GO). The algorithm uses features that can be generated from amino acid sequence alone, and does not require further experimental studies such as microarrays, 2-hybrid screens or systematic 'pull-down' assays. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used because of its comprehensive set of functional annotations, but the approach is sufficiently general for application to other eukaryote genomes. The input data include phylogenetic profiles, which represent the distribution of orthologous proteins in the genomes of other organisms, position-specific scoring matrices, and secondary structure and dynamic disorder predictions. These are encoded using diffusion kernels, which are used to represent pair-wise relationships such as sequence or secondary structure element similarity between nodes (proteins) in a graph. These kernels are benchmarked on the process prediction problem using a maximal margin (SVM) learning algorithm.

Inputs to the models were FES pulse width and vastus lateralis length and velocity, while the output was the vastus lateralis contractile force. Three types of models were developed for comparison purposes: 1) a Hill-based descriptive model without machine-learning elements, 2) 2 types of Hill-based models with several machine-learning elements, and 3) pure machine learning models using Multilayer Perceptron (MLPs) and Adaptive NeuroFuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS). The results revealed that the pure descriptive Hill model and two of the pure machine learning model configurations were the most inadequate in modeling electrically stimulated muscle. On the other hand, mixed models (i.e., Hill models that incorporated several machine learning elements), yielded the best results, giving mean force prediction errors of less than 3.3 % for the testing set.

In this paper, an approach based on transduction of labeled data is proposed to improve current classification methods. The general knowledge about the attribute of data distribution is used to carry out transduction. Employing this kind of knowledge, the commonly existent mode of the distribution corresponding to each labeled sample can be effectively found by mean shift, and the data at the mode can be regarded as having the same label with the original labeled sample with high confidence. Using the mode data instead of the original labeled data for classification can be capable of improving classification performance. Encouraging experimental results both on synthetic data and real-world handwritten characters validate the applicability and effectiveness of the approach.

The system has been operated daily from November, 2002 to provide visitors a speech interface for information retrievals. This system also aims at the field test of a speech interface and collecting actual utterance data. By analyzing and evaluation of the collected utterances, necessities of flexible processing according to the user's age group are discovered. It becomes impossible to disregard the increase of child users when the system is installed in a public place. This paper proposes an automatic approach discriminating speakers between adult and child users, which is based on a statistical learning. This proposal realizes a flexible spoken dialogue to both adult and child users. As for parameter vectors in machine learning, acoustic and linguistic properties extracted from speech recognition logarithm likelihood scores are adopted to discriminate user's age group. Although GMM-based recognition uses only acoustic properties, this method can also consider linguistic properties. In the experiments with the SVM-based screening, we obtained 92.4% discrimination rate to the actual users' utterances. The advantage of using linguistic properties is also shown. This paper also describes an overview of the Takemaru-kun system and the data collection status via the field test. Performances of child speech recognition are evaluated using collected utterances.

The approach uses neural networks as a statistical or machine learning technique for an accurate and fast emulation or statistical approximation of model physics parameterizations. It is applied to the development of an accurate and fast approximation of an atmospheric long wave radiation parameterization for the NCAR Community Atmospheric Model, which is the most time consuming component of model physics. The developed neural network emulation is two orders of magnitude, 50-80 times, faster than the original parameterization. A comparison of the parallel 10-year climate simulations performed with the original parameterization and its neural network emulations, confirmed that these simulations produce almost identical results. The obtained results show the conceptual and practical possibility of an efficient synergetic combination of deterministic and statistical learning components within an atmospheric climate or forecast model.

The main task today is to shift what is natural and atrophic variability and the assessment of trophic status to forecast the future ecosystem behavior. Sometimes it is necessary to use the data to build a model of the environmental processes that we want to manage. In other cases, we must identifiy and understand the interrelationships of different physical, chemical and biological parameters. The case studied is the algal community growth in coastal upwelling area of Cabo Frio Island at Rio de Janeiro state, southeastern of Brazil as a bioindicator since this place is becoming a operational support base of a oil drilling companies. We used a machine learning approach to elicit regularities\dependences that include both numerical and logical conditions.

Intrusion detection is a classification task that attempts to discern if a given request for network service is an intrusion attempt or a safe request. Since the creation of the 1999 KDD Cup network intrusion data set, several machine learning approaches to this task have been found to be successful. In this work we propose using the successful Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning approach to classify network requests. We use computational experiments to explore two factors that influence SVM performance in this task and demonstrate two novel approaches to this task.

In contrast to fuzzy controllers that were rapidly picked up in the 1990s this has so far not happened for fuzzy data analysis or fuzzy knowledge-based approaches. We believe this is mainly due to not enough easy to use software being available. Software manufactures in the area of data analysis concentrate on statistical approaches and well-known machine learning approaches like decision trees. Typically, neural networks are the only soft computing technique that is sometimes provided. In order to push fuzzy systems and re ate technology into industrial data analysis applications we need to provide appropriate software. We have developed an IDA platform that automates the data analysis process to a large extent. It uses fuzzy knowledge bases to match user requirements to features of analysis methods and to select, configure and execute IDA processes automatically. Although the platform can use any type of data analysis method we have focused on soft computing methods.

Intelligent analysis of such data helps to reveal as much information about the production process as possible. This information is most useful if it is available in the form of interpretable and predictive models. Such models can be generated from data by means of (fuzzy logic based) machine learning methods. In this contribution we will describe industrial applications in the areas of process optimization and quality control where we have successfully established machine-learning methods as intelligent data analysis tools. Based on these applications, we will report the characteristics of machine-learning tools which according to our experience support successful applications in an industrial environment. Furthermore we describe some methodical aspects resulting from this applications.

A primary issue is that any condition detected by a learning system acquires multiple behavioural meanings. As learning continues, the need to preserve these meanings severely constrains the architectural form of the system. A hybrid architecture called the recommendation architecture in which the preservation of such meanings is explicitly managed is compared with a wide range of alternative learning approaches. It is concluded that systems with this recommendation architecture have the capability to learn to solve complex control problems.

Pawlak in 1982 has been applied successfully in such fields as machine learning, data mining, intelligent data analyzing, control algorithm acquiring, etc. In our paper, we apply this theory to recognize characters printed on the surface of electronic component. According to the properties of these characters, we propose a new method based on Mathematical Morphology to extract feature. Here, we propose a new algorithm to generate rules from decision table, and classify character based on the prior probability derived from such rule set. In order to reduce the complexity further, we design a flow to pick train samples. The result of experiment shows our methods are useful and efficiency.

Video annotation, however is a very expensive process. Tools that allow users to annotate video shots with scenes, events, and objects should minimize user interaction. These tools should particularly leverage redundancy in content and advances in machine learning and human computer intelligent to reduce the amount of human interaction needed to annotate large corpora. As corpora sizes and the lexicon grows, this is increasingly relevant. Active Learning can play a critical role in reducing the amount of supervision. In this paper we apply active learning to the simultaneous annotation of multiple binary concepts. The challenge is to minimize the total number of samples to be annotated across all concepts. Preliminary experiments with the simultaneous annotation of two concepts Outdoors and Indoors using the TRECVID corpus are promising and reduce annotation workload significantly.

Obstacle detection, road following and terrain classification are examples of tasks which have been successfully approached using supervised machine learning techniques for classification. Large amounts of training data are usually necessary in order to achieve satisfactory generalization. In such cases, manually labeling data becomes an expensive and tedious process. This paper describes a method for reducing the amount of data that needs to be presented to a human trainer. The algorithm relies on kernel density estimation in order to identify "interesting" scenes in a dataset. Our method does not require any interaction with a human expert for selecting the images, and only minimal amounts of tuning are necessary. We demonstrate its effectiveness in several experiments using data collected with two different vehicles. We first show that our method automatically selects those scenes from a large dataset that a person would consider "important" for classification tasks. Secondly, we show that by labeling only few of the images selected by our method, we obtain classification performance that is comparable to the one reached after labeling hundreds of images from the same dataset.

We are focusing on outdoor obstacle detection, and we present techniques that leverage on data fusion and machine learning for increasing the reliability of obstacle detection systems. We are combining color and infrared (IR) imagery with range information from a laser range finder. We show that in addition to fusing data at the pixel level, performing high level classifier fusion is beneficial in our domain. Our general approach is to use machine learning techniques for automatically deriving effective models of the classes of interest (obstacle and non-obstacle for example). We train classifiers on different subsets of the features we extract from our sensor suite and show how different classifier fusion schemes can be applied for obtaining a multiple classifier system that is more robust than any of the classifiers presented as input. We present experimental results we obtained on data collected with both the experimental Unmanned Vehicle (XUV) and a CMU developed robotic tractor.

Due to the turbulent character of gas transport in a natural indoor environment, it is not sufficient to search for instantaneous concentration maxima, in order to solve this task. Therefore, this paper introduces a method to classify whether an object is a gas source or not from a series of concentration measurements, recorded while the robot performs a rotation manoeuvre in front of a possible source. For three different gas source positions, a total of 288 declaration experiments were carried out at different robot-to-source distances. Based on these readings, two machine learning techniques (ANN, SVM) were evaluated in terms of their classification performance. With learning parameters that were optimised by grid search, a maximal hit rate of approximately 87.5% could be obtained using a support vector machine.

This framework is demonstrated on, and in part motivated by, the task of human-robot interaction. There are three main parts on this framework. The first is the person's face detection used as a preprocessing system to the second stage which is the recognition of the face of the person interacting with the robot, and the third one is the hand detection. The detection technique is based on Haar-like features introduced by Viola et al. [1] and then improved by Lienhart et al. [2]. The eigenimages and PCA [3] are used in the recognition stage of the system. Used in real-time human-robot interaction applications the system is able to detect and recognise races at 10.9 frames per second in a PIV 2.2GHz equipped with a USB camera.

We implement and test our approach on a commercially available quadrupedal robot platform, namely the Sony Aibo robot. After about three hours of learning, all on the physical robots and with no human intervention other than to change the batteries, the robots achieved a gait faster than any previously known gait known for the Aibo, significantly outperforming a variety of existing hand-coded and learned solutions.

The space of grasping parameters coupled with the degrees-of-freedom and geometry of the object to be grasped creates a high-dimensional, non-smooth manifold. Traditional search methods applied to this manifold are typically not powerful enough to find appropriate stable grasping solutions, let alone optimal grasps. We address this issue in this paper, which attempts to find optimal grasps of objects using a grasping simulator. Our unique approach to the problem involves a combination of numerical methods to recover parts of the grasp quality surface with any robotic hand, and contemporary machine learning methods to interpolate that surface, in order to find the optimal grasp.

To obtain such information, many data analysis techniques can be applied, including statistical analysis, clustering algorithms and modeling techniques using neural nets or machine learning. Unfortunately, in practice, missing data is common and most analysis techniques are not applicable to incomplete data. This paper investigates an approach to handling missing data, using heuristics, in a machine learning system, SORCER. We applied SORCER to decide if certain characteristics of COLIA1 gene mutations are or are not associated with fatal type of OI (Osteogenesis imperfecta), a genetic disease. We compare the accuracies of SORCER's decisions with a high performing machine learning system, See5 with different percentages of missing data. The results show that average accuracies obtained from See5 tend to decline as the degree of incompleteness increases at a greater rate than those obtained from SORCER.

A machine learning technique is used to extract, from simulated data, models representing regularities in system behavior. A heuristic based on the degree of coverage of the model on the data is then applied to isolate faults. To test tolerance to incomplete models, our simulation model only requires i/o functions of relevant system processes that can be observed. We view our approach as an incremental filtering process which is useful for diagnosis of large scale systems. To illustrate the approach, we describe experiments in two examples including a well known three-tank system. Preliminaiy results show that, on the average, different locations such as a leaked tank and a blocked pipe can be isolated effectively more than 99% at a time. Results are promising but more in-depth study is required.	Texas Tech Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Abilene, TX USA	Hewett, R (reprint author), Texas Tech Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Abilene, TX USA.

We explored recognition of facial actions from the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), as well as recognition of full facial expressions. Each video-frame is first scanned in real-time to detect approximately upright-frontal faces. The faces found are scaled into image patches of equal size, convolved with a bank of Gabor energy filters, and then passed to a recognition engine that codes facial expressions into 7 dimensions in real time: neutral, anger, disgust, feat; joy, sadness, surprise. We report results on a series of experiments comparing recognition engines, including AdaBoost, support vector machines, linear discriminant analysis, as well as feature selection techniques. Best results were obtained by selecting a subset of Gabor filters using AdaBoost and then training Support Vector Machines on the outputs of the filters selected by AdaBoost. The generalization performance to new subjects for recognition of full facial expressions in a 7-way forced choice was 93% correct, the best performance reported so far on the Cohn-Kanade FACS-coded expression dataset. We also applied the system to fully automated facial action coding. The present system classifies 18 action units, whether they occur singly or in combination with other actions, with a mean agreement rate of 94.5% with human FACS codes in the Cohn-Kanade dataset. The outputs of the classifiers change smoothly as a function of time and thus can be used to measure facial expression dynamics.

The algorithm works by initially quantizing each feature with at least ten discrete levels (via percentiles), where the BDRA then proceeds to reduce this to a number of levels yielding best performance. The BDRA then trains on all independently quantized features simultaneously, finding the best overall quantization complexity of the data that minimizes the training error. Results are demonstrated illustrating the performance of the new modified algorithm for various data sets found at the University of California at Irvine's (UCI) Repository of Machine Learning Databases.

Dual-Schemata Model is a framework for subjective symbol generation. Light Dual-Schemata model is a specialized version of a general Dual-Schemata model. In the context of machine-learning research, machine designers and/or task designers decide most problems for an agent to learn. In the future, however, they must find target concepts to learn thorough interactions with environments and/or other agents by themselves. Our Dual-Schemata model gives an autonomous agent an ability to notice differences among dynamic environments. This concept is inspired by Piaget's Schema model. Dual-Schemata model realizes apart of this cognitive development model as computational Model. An experiment is shown as an actual example of the model. In this experiment an autonomous facial robot becomes able to chase each ball movements, to create symbols corresponding to environmental dynamics, and to recognize each Movement, without any leaching signals.

Because the set of possible haptic signals and driver responses is huge, it is desirable to automatically learn which signals are most useful to drivers. Thus, it is instructive to explore how machine learning techniques can be used as a step in the design of a haptic interface system. In this paper, we present a learning algorithm that learns useful haptic feedback and apply the algorithm to learning feedback for automobile drivers. We present evidence to show that the algorithm. is sensitive enough to learn useful feedback under some circumstances, but that its scope may be limited by people's ability to act as admittance controllers.

In this paper we show how to extend the so-called set covering approach to learn classification rules based on fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic classifications. This increases the expressive power of the learning algorithm for real-valued data, and consequently extends the range of problems that can be addressed using set covering. Since instances belong to fuzzy sets to a certain degree, we design an algorithm that uses the partial ordering of fuzzy sets to construct a fuzzy lattice of concept descriptions. We illustrate the algorithm on a toy example, and present the results of real-world data sets, substantiating the claim that the increased expressive power classifies at least as well and better than comparable crisp learning algorithms.

It is a method implementing inverse discrete wavelet transform with coefficient optimization techniques from machine learning field. However, conventional ways to construct wavelet networks are based on empirical risk minimization (ERM) principle, which has been proven not as robust as structural risk minimization (SRM) principle. Thus, to explore the optimal architecture of wavelet networks, we constructed wavelet networks based on SRM principle. This paper describes the kernel-based way to optimize the architecture of wavelet networks. Based on the frame theory, wavelet kernel functions are found. After that, the wavelet network is constructed with support vectors generated by the wavelet kernel Junctions.

All the coverage rules gathered together can cover all the given training examples. Unknown values are first assumed to be any possible values and are gradually refined according to the incomplete lower and upper approximations derived from the given incomplete training examples. One of the best equivalence classes in incomplete lower or upper approximations is chosen according to some criteria. The objects covered by the incomplete equivalence class are then removed from the incomplete training set. The same procedure is repeated to find the coverage set of rules. The training examples and the approximations then interact on each other to find the maximally general coverage rules and to estimate appropriate unknown values. The rules derived can then be used to build a prototype knowledge base.

This paper presents a knowledge discovery frame work to detect DoS attacks at the boundary controllers (routers). The idea is to use machine learning approach to discover network features that can depict the state of the network connection. Using important network data (DoS relevant features), we have developed kernel machine based and soft computing detection mechanisms that achieve high detection accuracies. We also present our work of identifying DoS pertinent features and evaluating the applicability of these features in detecting novel DoS attacks. Architecture for detecting DoS attacks at the router is presented. We demonstrate that highly efficient and accurate signature based classifiers can be constructed by using important network features and machine learning techniques to detect DoS attacks at the boundary controllers.

All SLAM algorithms to date can only be applied in one environment at a time. In this paper we propose to extend SLAM to multi-environments. In SmartSLAM the robot first classifies its entourage using environment recognition code and then performs SLAM using landmarks that are appropriate for its surrounding milieu. One thousand images of various indoor and outdoor environments were collected and used as training data for a three-layered feedforward backpropagation neural network. This neural network was then tested on two sets of query images of indoor environments and another two sets of outdoor environments, yielding 83% and 95% correct classification rates for the indoor images and 80% and 79% success rates for the outdoor images.

One of the common approaches is to add training data to the support vector machine(SVM) and retrain SVM, but retraining for each new data point or data set can be very expensive. In view of the learning method of human beings, it seems natural to build posterior learning results upon prior results. In this paper, we propose an incremental batch training method which are called Support Vector Pursuit Learning(SVPL). SVPL uses an incremental updating model similar to Standard SVM to update the trained SVM parameters. SVPL provides the same learning performance as that obtained by batch learning, but is faster more decuple than other methods. The effectiveness of the presented method is demonstrated through experiments.

Systems often already contain sufficient data such that by adding the ability to reason about this data a bit, the data becomes knowledge. The system can act on that knowledge and its performance can improve in a measurable manner, often dramatically. This incremental approach to software improvement mimics the evolution of biological organisms. In this paper we describe how we were able to improve the performance of a large-scale logistics analysis system by adding the ability to remember its previous computations, and to modify its behavior based on this recall.

It has attracted much attention of many researchers and practitioners all over the world, and has been applied to many fields successfully such as knowledge discovery, decision support, pattern recognition, machine learning, etc. Though the rough set theory is founded upon the solid mathematics base, there are still many theoretical problems to be solved. In this paper, the relationship between the rough set theory and the DS evidence theory and the relationship between the rough set theory and the fuzzy set theory are discussed, the extension of the rough set theory and the rough set theory based reasoning (abbr. rough reasoning) mechanism are emphasized, and a new effective algorithm for finding all the absolute reductions in a given information system is presented.

In this paper, we apply 5 different supervised classification algorithms from the machine learning field on both the original dataset and a dataset with the best features selected using mutual information. The classifiers are compared by employing McNemar's test. We find that SVMs and MLPs outperform the other classifiers and that preprocessing to select features works well.

Softprop is a novel learning approach presented here that is reminiscent of the softmax explore-exploit Q-learning search heuristic. It fits the problem while delaying settling into error minima to achieve better generalization and more robust learning. This is accomplished by blending standard SSE optimization with lazy training, a new objective function well suited to learning classification tasks, to form a more stable learning model. Over several machine learning data sets, softprop reduces classification error by 17.1 percent and the variance in results by 38.6 percent over standard SSE minimization.

To alleviate this situation this paper builds on the theory of nonextensive statistical mechanics to develop a new adaptive gradient-based learning scheme that applies a sign-based weight adjustment, inspired from the Rprop algorithm, on a perturbed version of the original error function. The perturbations are characterized by the q entropic index of the nonextensive entropy, and their impact is controlled by means of regularization. This approach modifies the error landscape at each iteration allowing the algorithm to explore previously unavailable regions of the error surface, and possibly escape undesired local minima. The performance of the adaptive scheme is empirically evaluated using problems from the UCI Repository of Machine Learning Databases and other classic benchmarks.

The generalization error achieved by an ensemble of linear perceptrons having homogeneous initial weight vectors is precisely calculated at the thermodynamic limit of a large number of input elements and shows rich behavior. Our main findings are as follows. The generalization error using an infinite number of linear student perceptrons is equal to only half that of a single linear perceptron, and converges with that of the infinite case with O(1/K) for a finite number of K linear perceptrons.

Novel neural network dimensionality reduction with a mixture-of-experts classifier ensures that only relevant information is processed while handling missing sensor data. A Genetic optimisation algorithm is used to control the system in the presence of dynamic events, while ensuring that system constraints are met. This tight integration of control optimisation and machine learning algorithms results in a highly efficient intelligent sensor network.

This paper suggests the use of the permutation test instead because it calculates the exact p-value instead of an estimate. The permutation test is also distribution free and the time complexity is trivial for the commonly used 10-fold cross-validation paired-difference test. Results of experiments on real-world problems suggest it is not uncommon to see the t-test estimate deviate up to 30-50% from the exact p-value.

But its only utilizing positive constraints weakens this algorithm's performance and robustness, especially when there are few positive constraints - a common case in practice. To overcome this drawback, in this paper we propose an extended algorithm named self-enhanced relevant component analysis (SERCA). Through a boosting procedure in the product space, it efficiently uses both the given side-information and unlabeled data. The experimental results on several data sets show that SERCA achieves an obvious improvement compared with RCA.

This paper discusses binary reinforcement in the context of three Adaptive Critic methods: Heuristic Dynamic Programming (HDP), Dual Heuristic Programming (DHP), and Globalized Dual Heuristic Programming (GDHP). Binary reinforcement arises when the qualitative measure of success is simply "pass" or "fail". We implement binary reinforcement with Adaptive Critic methods for the pole-cart benchmark problem. Results demonstrate two qualitatively dissimilar classes of controllers: those that replicate the system stabilization achieved with quadratic utility, and those that merely succeed at not dropping the pole. It is found that the GDHP method is effective for learning an approximately optimal solution, with results comparable to those obtained via DHP that uses a more informative, quadratic utility function.

We present a generic machine learning method to improve results of RBRS. The rout-algorithm of reinforcement learning is combined with the support vector machine (SVM) to learn an appropriate value function which guides the search strategy given by RBRS. The specific properties of the SVM allow to reduce the size of the training set and show improved results even a er a short period of training as demonstrated for benchmark instances of the RCPSP.

We present a method for encoding fuzzy classification rules derived from a machine learning algorithm based on a fuzzy set covering framework. The inductive bias of the encoding can be adjusted to allow further rule refinement and acquisition. We investigate the effect of these parameters, and show that the classification results correspond exactly to the prior knowledge.

The methodology of developing Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) is easily adaptable and relies on human expert experience and knowledge, but it exhibits weaknesses in utilization of learning methods. The external intervention (typically from experts) for the determination of FCM parameters and the convergence to undesired steady states are significant FCM deficiencies. Thus, it is necessary to overcome these deficiencies in order to improve efficiency and robustness of FCM. Weight adaptation methods can alleviate these problems by allowing the creation of less error prone FCMs where causal links-weights are adjusted through a learning process.

Data-mining systems based on machine-learning usually need a large number of iterations to acquire correct solutions, whereas people usually find appropriate hidden rules after only a small number of observations of the instances in a dataset. We think that this quick learning is the result of using tentative hypothesis as the data-model in the early steps of the learning. If the hypothesis happens to be accurate, the learning will be completed immediately after the hypothesis is applied. We therefore reduce the effort required for learning by gambling on the possibility that the tentative hypothesis is accurate. Our new machine learning system emulates this process by minimizing an objective function that represents not only the likelihood of error but also the predicted learning-cost. In experiments, the new system yields appropriate solutions to function approximation problems with only a small number of observations of instances. This system will be helpful for emergent problem solving.

This method is based on the technique of second order cone programming. We reformulate the SVM's quadratic problem into the second order cone problem. The proposed method requires to decompose the kernel matrix of SVM optimization problem. In this paper we apply Cholesky decomposition method. Since the kernel matrix is positive semidefinite, some columns of the decomposed matrix diminish. The performance of the proposed method depends on the reduction of dimensionality of the decomposed matrix. Computational results show that when the columns of decomposed matrix are small enough, the proposed method is much faster than the quadratic programming solver LOQO.

Actions by embodied agents automatically generate training data for the learning mechanisms, so that a humanoid robot develops categorization autonomously. Cognitive capabilities of the humanoid robot are developmentally created, starting from abilities for detecting, segmenting, and recognizing objects. Such mature abilities are integrated with the deeper developmental learning mechanisms required to create those abilities out of the robot's physical experiences. This paper presents strategies for learning task sequences and to recognize objects employed on such tasks from human-robot interaction cues. Learning strategies are also presented for the control of both oscillatory and non-oscillatory movements for the execution of these learned tasks. Self-exploration of the world automatically introduces the robot to new training data.

The input is a set of data representing the pre-contingency power system state (voltages, angles, etc.), and the output is the possible system status (stable/unstable) after contingency. Data clustering is applied to reduce the number of input representing the cases. The reduced input data are then used to train the neural network that learns the input patterns for a possible post-contingency status.

Machine learning methods including decision trees and artificial neural networks have the potential to be applied to the problem. To counter the inefficiency of common machine learning methods in learning new information, an incremental learning algorithm is employed to train an artificial neural network for real-time transient stability prediction. The resulted learning framework can readily be integrated into on-line dynamic security assessment. The effectiveness of such prediction model is demonstrated by the simulation results of a practical power system.

XLearner is novel in that it learns XQuery queries consistent with given examples (fragments) of intended query results. XLearner combines known learning techniques, incorporates mechanisms to cope with issues specific to the XQuery learning context, and provides a systematic way for the semi-automatic development of queries. This paper describes the XLearner system. It presents algorithms for learning various classes of XQuery, shows that a minor extension gives the system a practical expressive power, and reports experimental results to demonstrate how XLearner outputs reasonably complicated queries with only a small number of interactions with the user.

We are focusing on outdoor obstacle detection, and we present techniques that leverage on data fusion and machine learning for increasing the reliability of obstacle detection systems. We are combining color and IR imagery with range information from a laser rangefinder We show that in addition to fusing data at the pixel level, performing high level classifier fusion is beneficial in our domain. Our general approach is to use machine learning techniques for automatically deriving effective models of the classes of interest (obstacle and non-obstacle for example). We train classifiers on different subsets of the features we extract from our sensor suite and show how different classifier fusion schemes can be applied for obtaining a multiple classifier system that is more robust than any of the classifiers presented as input. We present experimental results we obtained on data collected with both the Experimental Unmanned Vehicle (XUV) and a CMU developed robotic vehicle.

(2) In post-silicon phase, path-based learning can be used as a vehicle to derive critical paths based on the pass/fail behavior observed from the test chips. Our path-based learning methodology consists of four major components: a delay test pattern set, a logic simulator, a set of selected paths as the basis for learning, and a machine learner. We explain the key concepts in this methodology and present experimental results to demonstrate its feasibility and applications.

Generally, IR systems obtain retrieval information through parsing natural language queries and formalize the queries based on this information. As queries contain few terms, the problem of word mismatch emerges frequently. In this paper, we explore the correlation between question and answer (CQA) by conducting unsupervised machine learning on FAQs (frequently asked questions) via a probabilistic latent semantic analysis model (PLSA). Meanwhile, in order to investigate its effect on IR, we also design an inference network in which the correlation was employed. Experimental results show that our inference net, by taking advantages of CQA, outperforms traditional vector space based tfidf models in information retrieval.

Main machine learning based approaches to the task are Naive Bayesian, Back Propagation, and Support Vector Machine. Resampling is the process of manipulating the distribution of training examples to improve the performance of classifiers. The primary goal of this report is to observe how much resampling methods provide effect on the performance of machine learning based approaches to text categorization. The secondary goal is to compare main machine learning based approaches with a symbolic neural network called NTC (Neural Text Categorizer) in their performance and to observe the effect of resampling methods on the symbolic neural network. This report will validate that resampling methods contribute the performance of machine learning based approaches to text categorization and NTC (Neural Text Categorizer) has better performance than other approaches, though two test beds, news articles from the site, "www.newspages.com" and Reuter 21578.

Emails or newsgroup messages are usually organized as threads - a strict tree structure with the original message on the top and the responses at the bottom of the tree. Such a tree models the message-response relationship as a parent-child relationship. In addition to the parent-child relationship between an email and response, we claim that a rhetorical relation also exists between them. These rhetorical relations reflect the nature of exchanges and can be used in tasks like thread summarization. In this paper, we present a framework for Email Discourse Analysis and also an algorithm that learns to characterize the rhetorical relationships in an email thread.

This paper presents a hybrid approach of a text-mining technique for measuring semantic relatedness among texts. In this work we develop an approach applying a text categorization technique with Support Vector Machines (SVM) method to supporting analysis of semantic relatedness among texts. We utilized our developed text mining algorithms and platforms, including text mining techniques based on Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for performing clustering and classification of texts in several text collections. After that, we employ SVM methods to deal with analysis of semantic relatedness of the target documents of clustering and classification mining process, in order to find the semantic connections and relatedness among the mined texts. The research approach can also be applied to other general applications, such as re-categorizing texts according to the results of semantic relatedness measured by the developed algorithms.

Data miners are certainly motivated by the prospect of discovering a financial "Holy Grail." However, designing and implementing a model poses many intellectual challenges. These include securing and cleaning data; acquiring a sufficient amount of financial domain knowledge; bounding the complexity of the problem; and properly validating results. Financial data mining in an academic context is especially difficult due to the student's limited financial domain knowledge and the relatively short period (one semester) for building a financial model. This paper describes an application of a financial data mining project, called the GDB Cup, within an academic setting and discusses various "lessons learned" from assigning the GDB Cup over three different semesters. Case study results are presented.

The data model is established from a data set by learning. For the functional attribute relation determination a novel method is developed. The method consists of repeated application of the data set to the data model where one of the independent variables at the input is stepwise incremented from an initial starting attribute value while the rest of the data set and the model remains to be the same. By means of this process, the variation of each dependent variable at the output of the model is established as a function of each independent variable at the input. For the methods and techniques used, data mining is central to their developments.

The SONG is composed of plural self-generating neural trees (SGNTs) each of which is independently generated by bagging sampling of the given training data. The output of the SONG is voted all outputs of those SGNTs. We investigate the relation between the number of SGNTs in SONG and the classification accuracy and the computational cost using a collection of machine-learning benchmarks. Experimental results show that the SONG can improve its classification accuracy in proportion to increase the number of SGNTs as well as reducing the computational cost.

The method for classification of multivariate data is based on local estimate of distribution mapping exponent for each point. Distances of all points of a given class of the training set from a given (unknown) point are searched and it is shown that the sum of reciprocals of DME-th power of these distances can be used as the probability density estimate. The classification quality was tested and compared with other methods using multivariate data from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The method has no tuning parameters.

An accurate model can not only be used to predict the behavior of a molecule and understand how structural variations may influence molecular property, but also to identify regions of molecular space that hold promise in context of a specific investigation. However, a variety of factors contribute to the difficulty of constructing robust structure activity models in real-world problems. These include conceptual issues related to how well the true biological problem is accounted for in the computational solution, algorithmic issues associated with determining the proper molecular descriptors, access to small quantities of data (possibly on tens of molecules only) due to the high cost and complexity of the experimental process, and the complex nature of bio-chemical phenomena underlying the data. This paper attempts to address this problem from the rudiments. We first identify and discuss the salient computational issues that span (and complicate) structure-property modeling formulations. We then consider a specific problem: that of modeling intestinal drug absorption, where many of the aforementioned factors play a role. In addressing them, our solution uses a novel characterization of molecular space based on the notion of surface-based molecular similarity. This is followed by identifying a statistically relevant set of molecular descriptors, which along with an appropriate machine learning technique is used to build the structure-property model. To ensure robustness, we propose simultaneous use of both ratio and ordinal error-measures for model construction and validation. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated through the predictive capability of the model in real world situations.

For that it is essential to develop crawling strategies which provide the most relevant pages. A number of algorithms claim to address this scheduling problem drawing on different machine-learning ideas. In order to compare those algorithms objectively it is necessary to evaluate them by employing a number of metrics. We present a framework for evaluating focused crawling algorithms and considering the performance on multimedia data. Also the framework allows one to evaluate crawling strategies for personal robots up to highly distributed crawling systems for search engines.

Therefore, the automated assessment of software, in terms of defect prediction, is an important issue to the software engineering community. Researchers seek to build accurate and reliable predictors using legacy data. However, it is a difficult task when one realizes that this is an "implicitly data starved" domain due to the skewed distribution of the data. The problem is heightened because the interesting instances (modules with moderate to high defect rates) represent a significant portion of the "starved data." One potential solution is to balance the data, referred to as equalized learning, in order to compensate for the skewness. This is accomplished by replicating the starved data in order to emphasize items of interest. To assess the feasibility of this technique, a series of Genetic Programming experiments are conducted using a NASA-based repository of defect data.

Both linear and nonlinear SVMs have been used for this purpose. The diagnostic algorithms have been developed using spectral data acquired in a clinical in-vivo laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopic study conducted on patients being screened for cancer of oral cavity and normal volunteers. For linear SVM a dot product kernel was used and for nonlinear SVMs polynomial and Gaussian radial basis functions (RBF) were used as kernels. Algorithms based on SVM provided significantly improved diagnostic performance as compared to that based on classical Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as well as Fisher's Linear Discriminant (FLD) in discriminating cancerous tissue sites of oral cancer patients from healthy squamous tissue sites of normal volunteers as well as uninvolved tissue sites of patients with cancer of oral cavity.

The conceptualization of new genetic machine learning relies on the specification model of Entity-Relation. According to this perspective, the learning behavior is decomposed in two evolution dimensions. In addition to some added concepts, the model uses the learning metaphor of coarse adaptability. The configuration of the system leads to a decentralized architecture where entities and interactions provide more reality to the overall genetic machinery. Based upon an adaptation function, the learning put emphasizes on adjustments of mutation rates through generations. This landscape draws the best strategy to control the intensity of convergence velocity along of evolution.

In this paper, we present a new discretization method called MODL, based on a Bayesian approach. The MODL method relies on a model space of discretizations and on a prior distribution defined on this model space. This allows the setting up of an evaluation criterion of discretization, which is minimal for the most probable discretization given the data, i.e. the Bayes optimal discretization. We compare this approach with the MDL approach and statistical approaches used in other discretization methods, from a theoretical and experimental point of view. Extensive experiments show that the MODL method builds high quality discretizations.								BERTIER P., 1981, ANAL DONNEES MULTIDI; Blake C.

In this context, a solution given by GP generally consists of a sole predictor. In contrast, Stack-based GP systems manipulate structures containing several predictors, which can be considered as teams of predictors. Work in Machine Learning reports that combining predictors gives good results in terms of both quality and robustness. In this paper, we use Stack-based GP to study different linear cooperations between predictors. Preliminary tests and parameter tuning are performed on a GP benchmark. A comparative study with standard methods has shown limits and advantages of teams prediction, leading to encourage the use of combinations taking into account the response quality of each team member.

We present an algorithm for inducing wrappers belonging to this class, and hence introduce an algorithm for wrapper reinduction. The reinduction algorithm requires examples to be provided exactly once and thereafter the algorithm can detect the layout changes and re-induce wrappers automatically. Experimental studies indicate that the algorithm is able to achieve near perfect performance.

In the presence of white and I/f additive spectral noises of approximately -16 db intensity, L V(k) are further more stable than the Basic Strategy on average by [1/2] db which is statistically significant. Finally, using the noise models, we show that the L V(k) strategies are unique alternatives to, rather than chance variations on, the Basic Strategy.

It is offering new possibilities and benefits in real-world applications, helping us understand better mechanisms of our own methods of knowledge acquisition. Genetic programming as learning algorithm posses certain advantages that make it suitable for forecasting and mining the financial data. Especially the stock time series have a large number of specific properties that together makes the prediction task unusual. This paper presents the results of using genetic programming to forecast the Egyptian Sock Market return. Experiments results demonstrate the capability of genetic programming to predict accurate results, comparable to traditional machine learning algorithms i.e., neural networks.

Generating ontological information from the web automatically using machine learning shows great promise towards this goal. We present LASSO, an architecture that combines distributed components for training web page classifiers via machine learning and information extraction, and then labels new pages with the classifiers. LASSO's results are semantic models of web pages stored in a database back end, and the models are defined with respect to whatever ontology the user chooses. LASSO can be used to build a wide varierty Of applications or can be used as a collaborative experimentation workbench. We give as part of our proof-of-concept prototype an application of an enhanced ontological search engine. We also describe how LASSO can be used to compare machine learning algorithms and analyze our system with a code reuse metric.

Therefore, various generalization error estimators have been proposed so far, in the presence of noise in output values. On the other hand, noise often exists in input values as well as output values. In this paper, we therefore investigate the influence of input noise on a generalization error estimator. We focus on a particular generalization error estimator called the subspace information criterion (SIC), which is shown to be unbiased in the absence of input noise. Intuitively, small input noise does not seem to affect the unbiasedness of SIC severely because small input noise varies the output values only slightly if the learning target function is continuous. On the contrary to this intuition, we show that even small input noise can totally corrupt the unbiasedness of SIC. This fact casts doubt on the use of SIC in the presence of input noise. To cope with this problem, we provide a sufficient condition to guarantee that SIC is unbiased in the limit of small input noise. We finally show that this condition is always fulfilled when the standard ridge estimation is used for learning, which allows us to use SIC without concern even in the presence of small input noise.

Since XML and XSLT are term languages, we use an approach to inductive synthesis of functional programs. Synthesis is divided in two steps: First, a straight-forward, non-recursive program is generated which transforms a given set of input examples into the desired outputs; second, the straight-forward program is folded into a generalized recursive program based on recurrence detection. For our application, starting point is a single input/output example, that is, an XML document in its given form as input and in its desired form as output. A non-recursive XSLT is constructed via genetic programming. To apply our folding algorithm, the transformation is rewritten in standard term form. The resulting recursive XSLT is transformed back into XSL syntax.

Discriminative models, because of their nature to focus on the boundary between classes rather than data itself, usually do not have the capability to deal with noisy training data. We propose the use of generative models as filters to make discriminative models more robust against noise. Firstly the distribution of the training data is estimated, then examples which do not satisfy some criterion, like having low likelihood, will be considered as outliers and discarded before training discriminative models. The idea was tested on a noisy data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

On the other hand, when the test in-put points (without output values) are available in advance, it is more effetive to choose a model so that the test error only at the test input points at hand is minimized. In this paper, we follow this idea and derive an estimator of the test error at the given test input points for linear regression. Our estimator is proved to be an unbiased estimator of the test error at the given test input points under certain conditions. Through the simulations with artificial and standard benchmark data sets, we show that the proposed method is successfully applied in test error estimation and is compared favorably to the standard cross-validation and an empirical Bayesian method in ridge parameter selection.

Network administrators are looking for new ways to protect their resources from hackers. There is a strong need for novel strategies for infrastructure protection. The present available techniques are versatile towards misuse detection and difficult to detect the anomalies. Researchers used neural network models, decision trees, statistical models, and rule-based systems with limited success in detecting anomalies. In recent years, research was diverted towards the application of data mining models [10-13, 18] to intrusion detection. More explorations are continuing for new paradigms and programming techniques. Application of genetic algorithm (GA) models is one of the recent explorations. Researchers have better hope with genetic algorithms [7. 17] and bioinformatics [8] applications. In this paper, we select the key attributes from audit data and presented in patterns to compute inductively learned classifiers that,an recognize anomalies and known intrusions. We used the Bucket Bridge algorithm of the genetics based machine learning to identify the anomalies. Simulation results were presented to detect the anomalies.

Machine learning has become a key solution to complicated multi agent tasks. In this paper, using machine learning as a tool for arriving at intelligent and efficient behaviors for Rescue robots involves layering increasingly complex learned behaviors. We describe multiple levels of learned behaviors. First the robots try to team basic knowledge about their environment's characteristics like the spreading speed of fire in the city after earthquake, or their ability to extinguish fires in different situations. ANN has been used to achieve these goals. Afterwards, using these learned components, they learn low level skills for fire extinguishment. Finally, in the next level they exploit fuzzy logic for planning their high level strategy toward their goal.

By metalearning, we mean the following simple idea: a family of IR algorithms is applied to a corpus of documents in which relevance is known to produce a learning set. A machine learning algorithm is then applied to this data set to produce a classifier that combines the different IR algorithms. In experiments with TREC-3 data, we could significantly improve precision at the same level of recall with this technique. Most prior work in this area has focused on combining different IR algorithms with various averaging schemes or has used a fixed combining function. The combining function in metalearning is a statistical model itself which in general depends on the document, the query, and the various scores produced by the different component IR algorithms.

The Maximum Likelihood (ML) criterion is generally used to create HMM topologies. However, it has an over-fitting problem. Information criteria have been used to overcome this problem, but theoretically they cannot be applied to complicated models like HMMs. Recently, to avoid these problems, the VB approach has been developed in the machine-learning field. We introduce the VB approach to the Successive State Splitting (SSS) algorithm, which can create both contextual and temporal variations for HMMs. We define the prior and posterior probability densities and free energy with latent variables as split and stop criteria.

This dissimilarity measure possesses the interesting, property of being asymptotically equivalent to the Fisher ratio when dealing with radial Gaussian probability density functions. More generally, it can be efficiently applied to non-connected quantiles, and to noisy data sets, as outliers are taken into account by the SVM. A generalisation of D-S is then proposed, which results in the design of a more general class of dissimilarity measures, also defined in feature space and with the same properties.

In most cases, this leads to an O(n(2)) cost in time and space per iteration, where n is the number of parameters, which is prohibitive for large n. We propose instead a study of the Hessian before training. Based on a second order analysis, we show that a block-diagonal Hessian yields an easier optimization problem than a full Hessian. We also show that the condition of block-diagonality in common machine learning models can be achieved by simply selecting an appropriate training criterion. Finally, we propose a version of the SVM criterion applied to MLPs, which verifies the aspects highlighted in this second order analysis, but also yields very good generalization performance in practice, taking advantage of the margin effect. Several empirical comparisons on two benchmark datasets are given to illustrate this approach.	IDIAP, Martigny, Switzerland	Collobert, R (reprint author), IDIAP, Martigny, Switzerland.

Using a one dimensional mixture of Gaussians to model each band source leads to fast tractable inference for the source signals. Simulations with separation of a male and female speaker using priors trained on the same speakers show comparable performance with the blind separation approach of Jang and Lee [1] with a SNR improvement of 4.9 dB for both the male and female speaker. Mixing coefficients can be estimated quite precisely using ML-II, but the estimation is quite sensitive to the accuracy of the priors as opposed to the source separation quality for known mixing coefficients which is quite insensitive to the accuracy of the priors. Finally, we discuss how to improve our approach while keeping the complexity low using machine learning and CASA approaches [1, 2, 3, 4].

With large-scale of sequencing data growth, an efficient approach to analysis protein is more Important. Protein function and structure are foundations for drug design and protein based product. However, it's difficult to predict protein function and structure (three-dimension) directly from protein (amino acids) sequence. Therefore, analyzing protein secondary structure Is Indispensable. In the previous work, researchers always focused on classifying three states of protein secondary structure: helix, strand and coil classes. It's a common classification problem for the prediction of protein secondary structure. Comparing with other machine learning methods for this problem, many studies usually ignore the protein local sequence/structure properties. It concerns the accuracy of prediction bemuse there exists a large number of proteins that are homologous but whose sequences are only remotely related. In this paper, we propose to use sequence similarity and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to predict protein secondary structure. First, we adopt RS126 and CB513 as experiment dataset. In this process, we try to encode the amino acids sequences and transform sequence segments into vectors for training. Second, we construct the SVM classifiers for classifying each residue of each sequence into the 3 secondary structure classes (Le. H, E, or C). SVM has been successfully applied in pattern recognition problem. SVMs are learning systems that use a hypothesis space of linear functions In a high dimensional feature space, trained with a learning algorithm from optimization theory that implements a learning bins derived from statistical learning theory. It's very suitable to compute with large-scale protein sequences. We have a better accuracy than traditional machine learning methods for protein secondary prediction.

The approach presented here includes methods for equation discovery: unlike mainstream system identification methods, which work under the assumption that the form of the equations is known, equation discovery systems explore a space of possible equation structures. We propose a formalism for representing knowledge about processes in population dynamics domains, and a method to transform such knowledge into an operational form that could be used by equation discovery systems. We also describe the extensions of the equation discovery system LAGRAMGE necessary to incorporate this kind of knowledge in the process of equation discovery. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we present an approach that uses new or recent observational data to improve an existing equation-based model. The approach is used to reduce the error of the Earth,ecosystem model of the net production of carbon in the atmosphere. We revise the initial ecosystem model in two directions. First, we calibrate the values of the constant parameters in the model on new observational data. Second, we allow the use of alternative equation structures for some of the sub-models of the initial model and use our approach to choose among them. Experiments show that both revision of values of the constant parameters and revision of the structures of sub-models can considerably reduce the error of the initial model. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

As human activities continue to force substantial impacts on coral reef ecosystems, the management of inshore fisheries has become an increasingly important priority. Knowledge of the distribution, biology and habitat requirements of a species can significantly enhance conservation efforts. The sea cucumber (Holothuria leucospilota) forms an important part of the traditional subsistence fishery on Rarotonga, Cook Islands, yet little is known of this species' present spatial distribution and abundance around the island. We apply two machine learning approaches and a classical statistical approach to predict the number of sea cucumber individuals from site characteristics. The machine learning methods used are induction of regression trees and instance-based learning. These are compared to the classical statistical approach of linear regression. The most accurate predictions are obtained using instance-based learning, while the most understandable descriptions are obtained using regression tree induction. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

J	Knuth, KH				Knuth, KH			Intelligent machines in the twenty-first century: foundations of inference and inquiry	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						inference; probability; entropy; Bayesian methods; lattice theory; machine intelligence	MATHEMATICAL-THEORY; INFORMATION; COMMUNICATION; PROBABILITIES; MECHANICS	The last century saw the application of Boolean algebra to the construction of computing machines, which work by applying logical transformations to information contained in their memory. The development of information theory and the generalization of Boolean algebra to Bayesian inference have enabled these computing machines, in the last quarter of the twentieth century, to be endowed with the ability to learn by making inferences from data. This revolution is just beginning as new computational techniques continue to make difficult problems more accessible. Recent advances in our understanding of the foundations of probability theory have revealed implications for areas other than logic. Of relevance to intelligent machines, we recently identified the algebra of questions as the free distributive algebra, which will now allow us to work with questions in a way analogous to that which Boolean algebra enables us to work with logical statements. In this paper, we examine the foundations of inference and inquiry. We begin with a history of inferential reasoning, highlighting key concepts that have led to the automation of inference in modern machine-learning systems. We then discuss the foundations of inference in more detail using a modern viewpoint that relies on the mathematics of partially ordered sets and the scaffolding of lattice theory. This new viewpoint allows us to develop the logic of inquiry and introduce a measure describing the relevance of a proposed question to an unresolved issue. Last, we will demonstrate the automation of inference, and discuss how this new logic of inquiry will enable intelligent machines to ask questions. Automation of both inference and inquiry promises to allow robots to perform science in the far reaches of our solar system and in other star systems by enabling them not only to make inferences from data, but also to decide which question to ask, which experiment to perform, or which measurement to take given what they have learned and what they are designed to understand.

J	Bratko, I; Suc, D				Bratko, I; Suc, D			Learning qualitative models	AI MAGAZINE			English	Article							SYSTEM-IDENTIFICATION	In general, modeling is a complex and creative task, and building qualitative models is no exception. One way of automating this task is by means of machine learning. Observed behaviors of a modeled system are used as examples for a learning algorithm that constructs a model that is consistent with the data. In this article, we review approaches to learning qualitative models, either from numeric data or qualitative observations. We describe the QUIN program that looks for qualitative patterns in numeric data and outputs the results of learning as "qualitative trees." We illustrate this using applications associated with systems control, in particular, the identification and optimization of controllers and human operator's control skill. We also review approaches that learn models in terms of qualitative differential equations.

MVL functions are applied in logic design of multi- valued circuits and machine learning applications. Bi- decomposition is a method to decompose a function into two decomposition functions that are connected by a two- input operator called gate. Each of the decomposition functions depends on fewer variables than the original function. Recursive bi- decomposition represents a function as a structure of interconnected gates. For logic synthesis, the type of the gate can be chosen so that it has an efficient hardware representation. For machine learning, gates are selected to represent simple and understandable classification rules. Algorithms are presented for non- disjoint bi- decomposition, where the decomposition functions may share variables with each other. Bi- decomposition is discussed for the min- and max- operators. To describe the MVL bi- decomposition theory, the notion of incompletely specified functions is generalized to function intervals. The application of MVL differential calculus leads to particular efficient algorithms. To ensure complete recursive decomposition, separation is introduced as a new concept to simplify non- decomposable functions. Multi- decomposition is presented as an example of separation. The decomposition algorithms are implemented in a decomposition system called YADE. MVL test functions from logic synthesis and machine learning applications are decomposed. The results are compared to other decomposers. It is verified that YADE finds decompositions of superior quality by bi- decomposition of MVL function sets.

This approach optimally exploits functional properties of a Boolean function in order to find an associated multilevel circuit representation having a very short delay by using simple two input gates. The machine learning process is based on the Boolean Differential Calculus and is focused on the aim of detecting the profitable functional properties available for the Boolean function. For clear understanding the bi- decomposition of completely specified Boolean functions is introduced first. Significantly better chance of success are given for bi- decomposition of incompletely specified Boolean functions, discussed secondly. The inclusion of the weak bi-decomposition allows to prove the the completeness of the suggested decomposition method. The basic task for machine learning consists of determining the decomposition type and dedicated sets of variables. Lean on this knowledge a complete recursive design algorithm is suggested. Experimental results over MCNC benchmarks show that the bi- decomposition outperforms SIS and other BDD- based decomposition methods in terms of area and delay of the resulting circuits with comparable CPU time. By switching from the ON- set/ OFF- set model of Boolean function lattices to their upper- and lower- bound model a new view to the bi- decomposition arises. This new form of the bi- decomposition theory makes a comprehensible generalization of the bi- decomposition to multivalued function possible.

Thus, many optimization problems in Multiple- valued Logic Design have been successfully approached using ideas and techniques from Artificial Intelligence. In particular, improvements in multiple- valued logic design have been made by exploiting information/ uncertainty measures. In this paper, we review well- known information measures in the multiple- valued domain and consider some methods of finding information measures for completely or incompletely specified functions with multiple- valued and continuous attributes. In this respect, the paper addresses the problem known as discretization and introduces a method of finding an optimal representation of continuous data in the multiple- valued domain. We also propose a technique for efficient calculation of different information measures using Multiple-valued Decision Diagrams. As one application of our technique, we outline an approach to synthesizing digital circuits derived from decision diagrams that can yield to reduction in power dissipation. The paper also shows the impact in several important areas of multiple-valued system design including ( i) fuzzy logic, ( ii) quantum computing systems, and ( iii) data mining.

J	Soinov, LA				Soinov, LA			Supervised classification for gene network reconstruction	BIOCHEMICAL SOCIETY TRANSACTIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Focused Meeting of the Biochemical-Society	JUL   21, 2003	SHEFFIELD, ENGLAND	Biochem Soc	UNIV SHEFFIELD	gene network; microarray; supervised learning	EXPRESSION DATA; MICROARRAY DATA; CELL-CYCLE; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; CANCER; PREDICTION; MAPS	one of the central problems of functional genomics is revealing gene expression networks-the relationships between genes that reflect observations of how the expression level of each gene affects those of others. Microarray data are currently a major source of information about the interplay of biochemical network participants in living cells. Various mathematical techniques, such as differential equations, Bayesian and Boolean models and several statistical methods, have been applied to expression data in attempts to extract the underlying knowledge. Unsupervised clustering methods are often considered as the necessary first step in visualization and analysis of the expression data. As for supervised classification, the problem mainly addressed so far has been how to find discriminative genes separating various samples or experimental conditions. Numerous methods have been applied to identify genes that help to predict treatment outcome or to confirm a diagnosis, as well as to identify primary elements of gene regulatory circuits. However, less attention has been devoted to using supervised learning to uncover relationships between genes and/or their products. To start filling this gap a machine-learning approach for gene networks reconstruction is described here. This approach is based on building classifiers - functions, which determine the state of a gene's transcription machinery through expression levels of other genes. The method can be applied to various cases where relationships between gene expression levels could be expected.

Even at the level of exon definition, pseudo exons defined by such false splices sites outnumber real exons by an order of magnitude. We used a support vector machine to discover sequence information that could be used to distinguish real exons from pseudo exons. This machine learning tool led to the definition of potential branch points, an extended polypyrimidine tract, and C-rich and TG-rich motifs in a region limited to 50 nt upstream of constitutively spliced exons. C-rich sequences were also found in a region extending to 80 nt downstream of exons, along with G-triplet motifs. In addition, it was shown that combinations of three bases within the splice donor consensus sequence were more effective than consensus values in distinguishing real from pseudo splice sites; two-way base combinations were optimal for distinguishing 3' splice sites. These data also suggest that interactions between two or more of these elements may contribute to exon recognition, and provide candidate sequences for assessment as intronic splicing enhancers.

J	Chen, YX; Wang, JZ				Chen, YX; Wang, JZ			Support vector learning for fuzzy rule-based classification systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Fuzzy classifier; fuzzy systems; kernel methods; pattern classification; statistical learning theory; support vector machines	UNIVERSAL APPROXIMATORS; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; LOGIC CONTROLLER; NUMERICAL DATA; MACHINES; CLASSIFIERS; NETWORKS; IDENTIFICATION; CONSTRUCTION	To design a fuzzy rule-based classification system (fuzzy classifier) with good generalization ability in a high dimensional feature space has been an active research topic for a long time. As a powerful machine learning approach for pattern recognition problems, support vector machine (SVM) is known to have good generalization ability. More importantly, an SVM can work very well on a high- (or even infinite) dimensional feature space. This paper investigates the connection between fuzzy classifiers and kernel machines, establishes a link between fuzzy rules and kernels, and proposes a learning algorithm for fuzzy classifiers. We first show that a fuzzy classifier implicitly defines a translation invariant kernel under the assumption that all membership functions associated with the same input variable are generated from location transformation of a reference function. Fuzzy inference on the IF-part of a fuzzy rule can be viewed as evaluating the kernel function. The kernel function is then proven to be a Mercer kernel if the reference functions meet certain spectral requirement. The corresponding fuzzy classifier is named positive definite fuzzy classifier (PDFC). A PDFC can be built from the given training samples based on a support vector learning approach with the IF-part fuzzy rules given by the support vectors. Since the learning process minimizes an upper bound on the expected risk (expected prediction error) instead of the empirical risk (training error), the resulting PDFC usually has good generalization. Moreover, because of the sparsity properties of the SVMs, the number of fuzzy rules is irrelevant to the dimension of input space. In this sense, we avoid the "curse of dimensionality." Finally, PDFCs with different reference functions are constructed using the support vector learning approach. The performance of the PDFCs is illustrated by extensive experimental results. Comparisons with other methods are also provided.

J	Kwiatkowska, EJ; Fargion, GS				Kwiatkowska, EJ; Fargion, GS			Application of machine-learning techniques toward the creation of a consistent and calibrated global chlorophyll concentration baseline dataset using remotely sensed ocean color data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						chlorophyll; data merger; fusion; machine learning; moderate resolution Imaging spectroradiometer; (MODIS); ocean color; regression; sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS); support vector machines	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; TEMPERATURE SCANNER; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SEAWIFS; ALGORITHMS; RADIANCE; MODEL; MODIS; ERA	This paper introduces a machine-learning approach to satellite ocean color sensor cross calibration. The cross-calibration objective is to eliminate incompatibilities among sensor data from different missions and produce merged daily global ocean color coverage. The approach is designed and investigated using data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard of the Terra satellite and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS). Data from these two sensors show apparent discrepancies originating from differences in sensor design, calibration, processing algorithms, and from the rate of change in the atmosphere and ocean within 1(1/2) h between sensor imaging of the same regions on the ground. The discrepancies have complex, noisy, and often contradictory time and space variabilities. Support vector machines are used to bring MODIS data to the SeaWiFS representation where SeaWiFS data are considered to exemplify a consistent ocean color baseline. Support vector machines are effective in learning and resolving convoluted data relationships between the two sensors given a variety of bio-optical, atmospheric, viewing geometry, and ancillary information. The method works accurately in low chlorophyll waters and shows a potential to eliminate sensor problems, such as scan angle dependencies and seasonal and spatial trends in data. The results illustrate that MODIS and SeaWiFS differences are noisy and highly variable, which makes it difficult to extrapolate the cross-calibration knowledge onto new time and space domains and to define representative global ocean color datasets for support vector machine training.

Path prediction allows the network and services to further enhance the quality of service levels the user enjoys. Such mechanisms are mostly meaningful in infrastructures like wireless LANs. In this article we present a path prediction algorithm that exploits the machine learning algorithm of learning automata. The decision of the learning automaton is driven by the movement patterns of a single user but is also affected by the aggregated patterns demonstrated by all users. Simulations of the algorithm, performed using the Realistic Mobility Pattern Generator, show increased prediction accuracy.

J	Ragothaman, S; Naik, B; Ramakrishnan, K				Ragothaman, S; Naik, B; Ramakrishnan, K			Predicting corporate acquisitions: An application of uncertain reasoning using rule induction	INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS			English	Article						mergers and acquisitions; rule induction; machine learning; expert systems; uncertain reasoning	EXPERT SYSTEMS; RISK; STOCK	Artificial Intelligence ( AI)- based rule induction techniques such as IXL and ID3 are powerful tools that can be used to classify firms as acquisition candidates or not, based on financial and other data. The purpose of this paper is to develop an expert system that employs uncertainty representation and predicts acquisition targets. We outline in this paper, the features of IXL, a machine learning technique that we use to induce rules. We also discuss how uncertainty is handled by IXL and describe the use of confidence factors. Rules generated by IXL are incorporated into a prototype expert system, ACQTARGET, which evaluates corporate acquisitions. The use of confidence factors in ACQTARGET allows investors to specifically incorporate uncertainties into the decision making process. A set of training examples comprising 65 acquired and 65 non- acquired real world firms is used to generate the rules and a separate holdout sample containing 32 acquired and 32 non- acquired real world firms is used to validate the expert system results. The performance of the expert system is also compared with a conventional discriminant analysis model and a logit model using the same data. The results show that the expert system, ACQTARGET, performs as well as the statistical models and is a useful evaluation tool to classify firms into acquisition and non- acquisition target categories. This rule induction technique can be a valuable decision aid to help financial analysts and investors in their buy/ sell decisions.

Basically, it symmetrises the classical nearest neighbor relationship from which are computed the points voting for some instances. Experiments on 29 datasets, most of which are readily available, show that the method significantly outperforms the traditional Nearest Neighbors methods. Experiments on a domain of interest related to tropical pollution normalization also show the greater potential of this method.

As a result techniques for extracting useful information from the data are developed. In particular, microarray technology has been applied to prediction and diagnosis of cancer, so that it expectedly helps us to exactly predict and diagnose cancer. To precisely classify cancer we have to select genes related to cancer because the genes extracted from microarray have many noises. In this paper, we attempt to explore seven feature selection methods and four classifiers and propose ensemble classifiers in three benchmark datasets to systematically evaluate the performances of the feature selection methods and machine learning classifiers. Three benchmark datasets axe leukemia cancer dataset, colon cancer dataset and lymphoma cancer data set. The methods to combine the classifiers are majority voting, weighted voting, and Bayesian approach to improve the performance of classification. Experimental results show that the ensemble with several basis classifiers produces the best recognition rate on the benchmark datasets.

J	Domingos, P; Hulten, G				Domingos, P; Hulten, G			A general framework for mining massive data streams	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Statistical Analysis of Massive Data Streams	DEC 13-14, 2002	WASHINGTON, D.C.			data mining; Hoeffding bounds; machine learning; scalability; subsampling		In many domains, data now arrive faster than we are able to mine it. To avoid wasting these data, we must switch from the traditional "one-shot" data mining approach to systems that are able to mine continuous, high-volume, open-ended data streams as they arrive. In this article we identify some desiderata for such systems, and outline our framework for realizing them. A key property of our approach is that it minimizes the time required to build a model on a stream while guaranteeing (as long as the data are iid) that the model learned is effectively indistinguishable from the one that would be obtained using infinite data. Using this framework, we have successfully adapted several learning algorithms to massive data streams, including decision tree induction, Bayesian network learning, k-means clustering, and the EM algorithm for mixtures of Gaussians. These algorithms are able to process on the order of billions of examples per day using off-the-shelf hardware. Building on this, we are currently developing software primitives for scaling arbitrary learning algorithms to massive data streams with minimal effort.

JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE			English	Article							INTENSIVE-CARE-UNIT; COMBINING MATHEMATICAL-MODELS; MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES; NOISE; INTEGRATION; GUIDELINES; FREQUENCY; SETTINGS	Purpose: Evaluation of a protocol of activation-deactivation of alarm soundings on noninvasive mean arterial pressure (MAP) monitoring. Materials and Methods: 103 patients were analyzed. Alarm soundings on noninvasive MAP were either activated (group A) or inactivated (group NA) according to a protocol based on patient's hemodynamic status. Results: In the first part of the study (11 periods of 24 hours), we informed the nursing staff before data collection. In the second part of the study (11 periods of 24 hours), we did not inform the nursing staff before data collection. Results of the two parts were assembled and the final analysis consisted of 3,304 hours of monitoring with 12,839 noninvasive MAP measurements, 6,354 in group A and 6,485 in group NA. In group A, 75 of 944 (8%) of abnormal measurements were detected or managed with a delay > 15 minutes and among them 16 required a therapeutic adjustment. In group NA, 140 of 265 (53%) of abnormal measurements were detected or managed with a delay > 15 minutes and among them, only one required a therapeutic adjustment. The number of alarm soundings avoided in group NA was 286. Conclusion: In this study, a systematic activation of alarm soundings for non-invasive blood pressure monitoring seemed unnecessary for the safety of ICU patients. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

J	McKee, TE				McKee, TE			Rough sets bankruptcy prediction models versus auditor signalling rates	JOURNAL OF FORECASTING			English	Article						rough sets; bankruptcy prediction; going-concern; corporate failure; knowledge discovery; machine learning	GOING-CONCERN OPINIONS; FINANCIAL RATIOS; FAILURE PREDICTION; NEURAL NETWORKS; BANK FAILURE; CLASSIFICATION; DECISION; DISTRESS	Both international and US auditing standards require auditors to evaluate the risk of bankruptcy when planning an audit and to modify their audit report if the bankruptcy risk remains high at the conclusion of the audit. Bankruptcy prediction is a problematic issue for auditors as the development of a cause-effect relationship between attributes that may cause or be related to bankruptcy and the actual occurrence of bankruptcy is difficult. Recent research indicates that auditors only signal bankruptcy in about 50% of the cases where companies subsequently declare bankruptcy. Rough sets theory is a new approach for dealing with the problem of apparent indiscernibility between objects in a set that has had a reported bankruptcy prediction accuracy ranging from 76% to 88% in two recent studies. These accuracy levels appear to be superior to auditor signalling rates, however, the two prior rough sets studies made no direct comparisons to auditor signalling rates and either employed small sample sizes or non-current data. This study advances research in this area by comparing rough set prediction capability with actual auditor signalling rates for a large sample of United States companies from the 1991 to 1997 time period. Prior bankruptcy prediction research was carefully reviewed to identify 11 possible predictive factors which had both significant theoretical support and were present in multiple studies. These factors were expressed as variables and data for I I variables was then obtained for 146 bankrupt United States public companies during the years 1991-1997. This sample was then matched in terms of size and industry to 145 non-bankrupt companies from the same time period. The overall sample of 291 companies was divided into development and validation subsamples. Rough sets theory was then used to develop two different bankruptcy prediction models, each containing four variables from the 11 possible predictive variables. The rough sets theory based models achieved 61% and 68% classification accuracy on the validation sample using a progressive classification procedure involving three classification strategies. By comparison, auditors directly signalled going concern problems via opinion modifications for only 54% of the bankrupt companies. However, the auditor signalling rate for bankrupt companies increased to 66% when other opinion modifications related to going concern issues were included. In contrast with prior rough sets theory research which suggested that rough sets theory offered significant bankruptcy predictive improvements for auditors, the rough sets models developed in this research did not provide any significant comparative advantage with regard to prediction accuracy over the actual auditors' methodologies. The current research results should be fairly robust since this rough sets theory based research employed (1) a comparison of the rough sets model results to actual auditor decisions for the same companies, (2) recent data, (3) a relatively large sample size, (4) real world bankruptcy/non-bankruptcy frequencies to develop the variable classifications, and (5) a wide range of industries and company sizes.

The algorithms are problem-independent: the chemistry and physics of the problem being studied are contained in the descriptors used to represent the known data. The application of a variety of machine-learning methods to the prediction of ferromagnetism in ordered and disordered transition metal alloys is presented. Applying a decision tree algorithm to build a predictive model for ordered phases results in a model that is 100% accurate.

J	Giorgetti, D; Sebastiani, F				Giorgetti, D; Sebastiani, F			Automating survey coding by multiclass text categorization techniques	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							CLASSIFICATION	Survey coding is the task of assigning a symbolic code from a predefined set of such codes to the answer given in response to an open-ended question in a questionnaire (aka survey). This task is usually carried out to group respondents according to a predefined scheme based on their answers. Survey coding has several applications, especially in the social sciences, ranging from the simple classification of respondents to the extraction of statistics on political opinions, health and lifestyle habits, customer satisfaction, brand fidelity, and patient satisfaction. Survey coding is a difficult task, because the code that should be attributed to a respondent based on the answer she has given is a matter of subjective judgment, and thus requires expertise. It is thus unsurprising that this task has traditionally been performed manually, by trained coders. Some attempts have been made at automating this task, most of them based on detecting the similarity between the answer and textual descriptions of the meanings of the candidate codes. We take a radically new stand, and formulate the problem of automated survey coding as a text categorization problem, that is, as the problem of learning, by means of supervised machine learning techniques, a model of the association between answers and codes from a training set of precoded answers, and applying the resulting model to the classification of new answers. In this article we experiment with two different learning techniques: one based on naive Bayesian classification, and the other one based on multiclass support vector machines, and test the resulting framework on a corpus of social surveys. The results we have obtained significantly outperform the results achieved by previous automated survey coding approaches.

Materials and Methods: Several machine learning prediction methods are compared with Cox proportional hazards regression using 3 large urological datasets. As a measure of predictive ability, discrimination that is similar to an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve is computed for each. Results: In all 3 datasets Cox regression provided comparable or superior predictions compared with neural networks and other machine learning techniques. In general, this finding is consistent with the literature. Conclusions: Although theoretically attractive, artificial neural networks and other machine learning techniques do not often provide an improvement in predictive accuracy over Cox regression.

J	Zhang, DQ; Chen, SC				Zhang, DQ; Chen, SC			Clustering incomplete data using kernel-based fuzzy C-means algorithm	NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						clustering; fuzzy c-means; incomplete data; Kernel methods		There is a trend in recent machine learning community to construct a nonlinear version of a linear algorithm using the 'kernel method', e.g. Support Vector Machines (SVMs), kernel principal component analysis, kernel fisher discriminant analysis and the recent kernel clustering algorithms. In unsupervised clustering algorithms using kernel method, typically, a nonlinear mapping is used first to map the data into a potentially much higher feature space, where clustering is then performed. A drawback of these kernel clustering algorithms is that the clustering prototypes lie in high dimensional feature space and hence lack clear and intuitive descriptions unless using additional projection approximation from the feature to the data space as done in the existing literatures. In this paper, a novel clustering algorithm using the 'kernel method' based on the classical fuzzy clustering algorithm (FCM) is proposed and called as kernel fuzzy c-means algorithm (KFCM). KFCM adopts a new kernel-induced metric in the data space to replace the original Euclidean norm metric in FCM and the clustered prototypes still lie in the data space so that the clustering results can be reformulated and interpreted in the original space. Our analysis shows that KFCM is robust to noise and outliers and also tolerates unequal sized clusters. And finally this property is utilized to cluster incomplete data. Experiments on two artificial and one real datasets show that KFCM has better clustering performance and more robust than several modi. cations of FCM for incomplete data clustering.

J	Kim, SW; Oommen, BJ				Kim, SW; Oommen, BJ			A brief taxonomy and ranking of creative prototype reduction schemes	PATTERN ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						machine learning; Prototype Reduction Schemes (PRS); Learning Vector Quantisation (LVQ); Support Vector Machines (SVM)	NEAREST-NEIGHBOR RULE; CLASSIFIER DESIGN; ALGORITHM; SELECTION	Various Prototype Reduction Schemes (PRS) have been reported in the literature. Based on their operating characteristics, these schemes fall into two fairly distinct categories - those which are of a creative sort, and those which are essentially selective. The norms for evaluating these methods are typically, the reduction rate and the classification accuracy. It is generally believed that the former class of methods is superior to the latter. In this paper, we report the results of executing various creative PRSs, and attempt to comparatively quantify their capabilities. The paper presents a brief taxonomy of the various reported PRS schemes. Our experimental results for three artificial data sets, and for samples involvingreal-life data sets, demonstrate that no single method is uniformly superior to the others for all kinds of applications. This result, though consistent with the findings of Bezdek and Kuncheva [1], is, in one sense, counter-intuitive, because the various researchers have presented their specific PRS with the hope that it would be superior to the previously reported methods. However, the fact is that while one method is superior in certain domains, it is inferior to another method when dealing with a data set with markedly different characteristics. The conclusion of this study is that the question of determining when one method is superior to another remains open. Indeed, it appears as if the designers of the pattern recognition system will have to choose the appropriate PRS based to the specific characteristics of the data that they are studying. The paper also suggests answers to various hypotheses that relate to the accuracies and reduction rates of families of PRS.

It has been observed that the predictive accuracy of a combination of independent classifiers excels that of the single best classifier. While ensembles of classifiers have been mostly employed to achieve higher recognition accuracy, this paper focuses on the use of combinations of individual classifiers for handling several problems from the practice in the machine learning, pattern recognition and data mining domains. In particular, the study presented concentrates on managing the imbalanced training sample problem, scaling up some preprocessing algorithms and filtering the training set. Here, all these situations are examined mainly in connection with the nearest neighbour classifier. Experimental results show the potential of multiple classifier systems when applied to those situations.

J	Amin, A				Amin, A			Recognition of hand-printed characters based on structural description and inductive logic programming	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						pattern recognition; Arabic characters; hand-printed characters; parallel thinning; feature extraction; structural classification; inductive logic programming	SYSTEM	Character recognition systems can contribute tremendously to the advancement of the automation process and can improve the interaction between man and machine in many applications, including office automation, cheque verification and a large variety of banking, business and data entry applications. The main theme of this paper is the automatic recognition of hand-printed Arabic characters using machine learning. Conventional methods have relied on hand-constructed dictionaries which are tedious to construct and difficult to make tolerant to variation in writing styles. The advantages of machine learning are that it can generalize over the large degree of variation between writing styles and recognition rules can be constructed by example. The system was tested on a sample of handwritten characters from several individuals whose writing ranged from acceptable to poor in quality and the average correct recognitions rate obtained using cross-validation was 86.65%.

J	Lee, WP; Lu, CC				Lee, Wei-Po; Lu, Cheng-Che			Customising WAP-based information services on mobile networks	PERSONAL AND UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING			English	Article						Customisation; Machine learning; Mobile information services; Software agents; WAP devices		In addition to voice transmission over mobile networks, the demand of data communication has been increasing. To deploy data-oriented applications for mobile terminals, the wireless application protocol (WAP) has provided a promising solution. However, as in the World Wide Web (WWW), the increasing information leads to the problem of information overload. One way to overcome such a problem is to build intelligent recommender systems to provide customised information services. By analyzing the information collected from the user, a customised recommender system is able to reason his personal preferences and to build a model of predictions. In this way, only the information predicted as user-interested can reach the end user. This paper presents a multi-agent framework in which a decision tree-based approach is employed to learn a user's preferences. To assess the proposed framework, a mobile phone simulator is used to represent a mobile environment and a series of experiments are conducted. The experimental studies have concentrated on how to recommend appropriate information to the individual user, and on how the system can adapt to a user's most recent preferences. The results and analysis show that based on our framework the WAP-based customised information services can be successfully performed.

J	Zhang, SW; Pan, Q; Chen, RS; Zhang, HC				Zhang, SW; Pan, Q; Chen, RS; Zhang, HC			Classification of protein homo-oligomers using support vector machine	PROGRESS IN BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS			Chinese	Article						support vector machine; Bayes covariant discriminant; classification; homo-dimer; homo-trimer; homo-tetramer; homo-hexamer	SUBCELLULAR LOCATION; STRUCTURAL CLASS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; PREDICTION; LOCALIZATION; SEQUENCE	The homo-dimer, homo-trimer, homo-tetramer and homo-hexamer of protein were classified using both of support vector machine and Bayes covariant discriminant methods. It was found that the total accuracies of "one-versus-rest" and "all-versus-all" are 77.36% and 93.43% respectively using support vector machine in jackknife test, which are 26.72 and 42.79 percentile higher respectively than that of Bayes covariant discriminant method in the same test. These results show that the support vector machine is a specially effective method for classifying the higher protein homo-oligomers from protein primary sequences. Using "all-versus-all" policy is better than "one-versus-rest" policy for classifying homo-oligomers; based on the same machine learning method ( such as support vector machine). And it was also indicated that the primary sequences of homo-oligomeric proteins contain quaternary information.
