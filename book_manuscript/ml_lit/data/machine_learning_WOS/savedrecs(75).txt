Thus, Machine Learning algorithms should be able to operate in massive datasets. When a dataset is too large for a particular learning algorithm to be applied, there are other ways to make learning feasible; preprocessing techniques and dataset sampling can be used to scale up classifiers to large datasets. In this work we propose a computational environment based on two architectures, one for data pre-processing and one for post-processing which allow evaluation of induced knowledge. The two architecture share a set of learning systems, which can be enhanced to support new ones. The environment is designed as a test-bed for Data Mining research, as well as a generic knowledge discovery tool for varied database domains. Flexibility is achieved by an open-ended design for extensibility, enabling integration of existing Machine Learning algorithms, support functions for pre-processing as well as new locally developed algorithm and functions.

By this way, the old process of discovery has experienced amazing improvements by: (a) allowing well-known Machine Learning and Statistical algorithms run for larger data sets with good performance; and (b) making easier tasks like data gathering and cleansing, parameter and model selection, and so on. In this paper we take the Combinatorial Neural Model (CNM), proposed by Machado and Rocha ([6], [7], and [8]), and explore the adoption of a committee machine to cope with the complexity problem present in this model. In our proposal, a static committee machine is built on a certain number of CNMs. The committee machine takes the discrete outputs from the individual models, and proceeds by choosing the most accurate output using a voting process. Many works has been presented to alleviate the complexity problem in CNM and this one represents an alternative that can be combined with other solutions. The results from the experiments point out that, by means of a committee machine, one can reach a better trade-off between predictive accuracy and complexity. To evaluate the effectiveness of the technique, we apply it to some well-known data sets from the UCI repository [2]. Finally it is suggested some extensions to improve the committee machine in order to obtain a better generalization performance, towards a universal approximator.

The idea is to redefine the set of classes that must be learned by the classification system, mapping them into another set which the Voronoi vectors can successfully classify a sample into one of the original classes. The main objective of this approach is to find the minimum number of classification rules (by minimizing the number of classes in the new set) that maximizes the number of correct classifications. To accomplish that, a genetic algorithm was design. In the genetic model, a classical fixed length genotype encodes the vectors positions in such a way that a variable number of vectors is allowed. The objective function is designed so that it rewards the correctness in the classification and penalize high number of vectors. In order to verify the accuracy and robustness of the genetic algorithm in finding the optimum Voronoi vectors set, simple benchmarks, which the expected optima are well known, were used. The success obtained in the tests with benchmarks has motivated the application of the methodology in the design of a nuclear power plant transients diagnosis system. The obtained results reveal the ability of the genetic algorithm in learning optimized classification rules that lead to efficient diagnosis, dealing with the compromise between number of rules and certainty in the classification.

All objects contained in the same group have similar characteristics. Grouping multivariate data is a difficult data mining task when no domain knowledge on data structure is available. In this paper we describe the use of a well known linear projection technique, called singular value decomposition (SVD), to discover clusters in the pattern space by projecting it into a subspace that constitutes its best approximation and preserves the character of data. Experimental results on rear datasets from the UCI Machine Learning repository assess the quality of the clustering obtained.

Regression obviously becomes more accurate by assessing a regression surface to each of a given class of a finite sample set compared to one regression surface for the sample as a whole. For class formation, a tree of regression surfaces is constructed that balances minimization of the regression error and "stabilization" towards unseen data. Common tree-structured regression algorithms split nodes according to an independent variable. Terminal nodes correspond to one specific class. Such constructions gave rise to less complicated approaches that have mainly been used for adaptive classification in machine learning. The considerable advantage of regression trees over a single regression is often set off by trees' poor behaviour on unseen data of supposedly the same nature. Also, a tree formation solely based on minimizing the regression error may not generate information by which to assign new data to terminal nodes. Generalization is addressed by a stabilization operation. Each sample vector is assigned to its nearest neighbour which in turn is assigned to its nearest neighbour etc. This results in so-called neighbour chains that partition the sample set. Class splitting during tree formation is here restricted to classes that contain neighbour chains completely. For classification, unseen sample data are assigned to its closest neighbour used in tree formation. The regression surface of the class containing the corresponding neighbour chain is then used for estimation.

Properly mining this extracted data can generate useful knowledge for providing personalized product recommendation services. In general, recommender systems use two complementary techniques. Content-based systems match customer interests with products attributes, while collaborative filtering systems utilize preference ratings from other customers. In this paper, we address some problems faced by these two systems, and study how machine learning techniques, namely the support vector machine and the latent class model, can be used to alleviated them.

Many machine learning methods have been proposed that learn from the feedback information in a longterm fashion. In this paper, we present an approach that builds on user feedback across multiple queries in order to improve the retrieval quality of novel queries. This allows users of an IR system to retrieve relevant documents at a reduced effort. Two algorithms for long-term learning across multiple queries in the scope of the retrieval system Latent Semantic Indexing have been implemented in a system, REGRESSOR, in order to test these ideas. The algorithms are based on k-nearest-neighbor searching and back propagation neural networks. Training examples are query vectors, and by using Latent Semantic Indexing, the examples are reduced to a fixed and manageable size. In order to evaluate the methods, we performed a set of experiments where we compared the performance of Latent Semantic Indexing and REGRESSOR. The results demonstrate that REGRESSOR automatically improves on the performance of Latent Semantic Indexing by utilizing the feedback information from past queries.

Our approach to solving it strives for the application of machine learning techniques throughout, i.e., for avoiding knowledge elicitation by any other means as much as possible. In particular, we build upon existing work on the operationalization of advice by machine and assume that advice is already available in operational form. The relative importance of this advice is, however, not yet known and can therefore not be utilized well by a program. This paper presents an approach to determine the relative importance for a given situation through reinforcement learning. We implemented this approach for the game of Hearts and gathered some empirical evidence on its usefulness through experiments. The results show that the programs built according to our approach learned to make good use of the given operational advice.

In the past few years several context-based probabilistic and machine learning methods for WSD have been presented in literature. However, an important area of research that has not been given the attention it deserves is a formal analysis of the parameters affecting the performance of the learning task faced by these systems. Usually performance is estimated by measuring precision and recall of a specific algorithm for specific test sets and environmental conditions. Therefore, a comparison among different learning systems and an objective estimation of the difficulty of the learning task is extremely difficult. In this paper we propose, in the framework of Computational Learning theory, a formal analysis of the relations between accuracy of a context-based WSD system, the complexity of the context representation scheme, and the environmental conditions (e.g. the complexity of language domain and concept inventory).

The SmartCar's perceptual input is multi-modal: four video signals capture the surrounding traffic, the driver's head position and the driver's viewpoint; and a real-time data acquisition system records the car's brake, gear, steering wheel angle, speed and acceleration throttle signals. We have carried out driving experiments with the instrumented car over a period of 2 months. Over 70 drivers have driven the SmartCar for 1.25 hours in the greater Boston area. Dynamical Graphical models, HMMs and potentially extensions (CHMMs), have been trained using the experimental driving data to create models of seven different driver maneuvers: passing, changing lanes right and left, turning right and left, starting and stopping. These models are essential to build more realistic automated cars in car simulators, to improve the human-machine interface in driver assistance systems, to prevent potential dangerous situations and to create more realistic automated cars in car simulators.

The diagnostic accuracy of genetic algorithm was compared to accuracy of discriminant analysis. Patient data contained case history, signs, and neurotologic and other test results, that are used in the reasoning process of ONE. For the comparison we retrieved 564 patients from the database of neurotologic expert system ONE belonging to six patient groups, which were Meniere's disease, vestibular schwannoma, benign positional vertigo, traumatic vertigo, vestibular neuritis and sudden deafness. The patients were divided into learning set (70% of the patients) and testing set (30%). Genetic algorithm was applied to the original data containing missing values while discriminant analysis was conducted with data repaired using means and expectation-maximization imputation methods. The accuracy of diagnostic rules was 91% in vestibular schwannoma, 36% in benign positional vertigo, 81% in Meniere's disease, 95% in sudden deafness, 92% in traumatic vertigo and 98% in vestibular neuritis. Discriminant analysis proved to be better with Meniere's disease, worse with sudden deafness disease and was approximately equally effective with the other diseases in the diagnostic procedure with vertiginous patients in comparison to genetic algorithm.

The real domain problem was the prediction and diagnosis of product quality issues in a Steel Hot Strip Mill. The properties of the data from this environment include multimodality (several optima), poor separation between fault levels and high dimensionality (many parameters). The method to develop the Learning Classifier System technique, based on deterministic simulated data, is presented. The advances made in the technique, which enhance its functionality in this type of industrial environment, are given. The novel methods developed are core to the Learning Classifier System technique and are not 'fixes' for given problems. They address the fitness measure, encoding alphabet, population scope, phases of training, genetic operators, life limits and removal of taxation schemes. These improvements allow the industrial LCS to function correctly in the simulated domain. Encouraging results from diagnosis of real data are presented; however, further work is needed for greater accuracy and to allow the prediction function to be used on-line. Learning Classifier Systems represent a potentially useful tool that combines the transparency of symbolic approaches (such as Decision Trees) with the learning ability of connectionist approaches (such as Artificial Neural Networks) to machine learning.

With a huge amount of information available on various Web sites, it is important that the relevant and useful information favored by individual visitors is delivered to the destinations in a timely manner. The two traditional approaches for sorting web information including search engines and hierarchical indices require specific input by the visitors who may not have any specific favorite sites in mind. In most cases, site surfers are just "window-shopping" on the Internet, looking for "exciting" things. This paper proposes the development of an Intelligent Internet Information Delivery System (IIIDS) which is characterized by its machine learning capability based on the data of site spots "movements" by the users within the Web pages and then evaluates the site preferences of the relevant users by means of fuzzy logic principle. The development of IIIDS and the test of a prototype to evaluate its feasibility are covered in this paper. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Such what-if queries can generate an overwhelming amount of data. We describe here a general method for understanding that data. Large scale what-if queries can guide Monte Carlo simulations of a model. Machine learning can then be used to summarize the output. The summarization is an ensemble of decision trees. The TARZAN system can poll the ensemble looking for majority conclusions regarding what factors change the classifications of the data. TARZAN can succinctly present the results from very large what-if queries. For example, in one of the studies presented here, we can view on 1/2 a page the significant features from 10(9) what-ifs.

To do that, we assume a semantic hierarchy among classes which is ignored in conventional stories. The basic idea comes from relaxing class membership by using the hierarchy and we explore how to preserve the precision of classification in a sense of entropy.

However constructing such reams remains a difficult challenge. In particular current approaches to designing agent teams are highly labor-intensive. Human designers must deal with ovenwhelming complexity in thing to manage the large number of interactions and dependencies that may exist between agent activities. Even if the designer is able to come lip with a plan that seems to work, he cannot be sure that it will continue to work in all possible situations. In this work, we propose To use machine learning techniques to assist a user in building robust, multiagent team plans. This is done by logging information during team plan executions and attempting to find the cause of failure from this data. We present a method for learning temporal coordination constraints on actions in a multiagent reactive plan. We also briefly discuss the effect of new coordination constraints on team organization.

However, the relevance and properties of the activities that should be recognized depend on both the application and the user. This requires an adaptive recognition of the activities where the user, instead of the designer, can reach the device what he/she is doing. As a case study we connected a pair of pants with accelerometers to a laptop lo interpret the raw sensor data. Using a combination of machine learning techniques such as Kohonen maps and probabilistic models, we build a system that is able to learn activities while requiring minimal user attention.

Concretely, classical processes from philosophy of science and machine learning such as hypothesis generation, refinement, confirmation and revision have their counterpart in requirement engineering, program construction, validation and modification in SD, respectively. Consequently, we have investigated the appropriateness for software modelling of the most important paradigms of modelling selection in machine learning. Under the notion of incremental learning, we introduce a new factor, predictiveness, as the ability to foresee future changes in the specification, thereby reducing the number of revisions. As a result, other quality factors are revised. Finally, a predictive software life cycle is outlined as an incremental learning session, which may or may not be automated.

Typically neural net structures would be extended to permit fuzzy inputs and to allow the outputs to be interpreted as fuzzy. The last step would defuzzify these outcomes producing a classifier which would consist of a family of threshold ("partitioning") values. This chapter focuses on fuzzy modelling as a formalism for representing and inferring knowledge. It is mainly concerned with the investigation of the use of a neurofuzzy system for inducing fuzzy knowledge in the form of fuzzy if-then rules from a set of preclassified instances. We describe the experimental studies which we conducted in a few different knowledge domains. The motivation of our work is to evaluate the possibilities offered by this approach, to learn about its contributions and to establish situations where its use is appropriate. We close by discussing fines of further reearch into performance of such systems.

For this purpose, genetic programming (GP) is applied to a set of benchmark classification problems. Using GP we are able to induce decision trees with a linear combination of variables in each function node. A new representation of decision trees using strong typing in GP is introduced. With this representation it is possible to let the GP classify into any number of classes. Results indicate that GP can be applied successfully to classification problems. Comparisons with current state-of-the-art algorithms in machine learning are presented and areas of future research are identified.

This includes the use of unsupervised neural networks for the detection of the most significant temporal patterns in multivariate time series, as well as the use of Machine Learning-algorithms for the generation of a rule-based description of primitive patterns. The main idea lies in introducing several abstraction levels for the pattern discovery process. The results of the previous step then are used to induce temporal grammatical rules at different abstraction levels. This approach was successfully applied to a problem in medicine, called sleep apnea.

In this paper, we explore a partial solution to this problem which lets the user coach animated characters by sketching their trajectories on the ground plane. The details of the motion are then computed with simulation. We create memory-based control functions for the high-level behaviors from examples supplied by the user and from real-world data of the behavior. The control function for the desired behavior is implemented through a lookup table using a K-nearest neighbor approximation algorithm. To demonstrate this approach, we present a system for defining the behaviors of defensive characters playing American football. The characters are implemented using either point masses or dynamically simulated biped robots. We evaluate the quality of the coached behaviors by comparing the resulting trajectories to data from human players. We also assess the influence of the user's coaching examples by demonstrating that a user can construct a particular style of play.

In recent years, with the massive increase in the amount of available information on the Internet, a need has arisen for being able to organize and access that data in a meaningful and directed way. Many well-explored techniques from the field of Al and machine learning have been applied in this context. In this paper, special emphasis is placed on neural network approaches in implementing a learning agent. First, various important approaches are summarized. Then, an approach for neural learning internet agents is presented, one that uses recurrent neural networks for the learning of classifying a textual stream of information. Experimental results are presented showing that a neural network model based on a recurrent plausibility network can act as a scalable, robust and useful news routing agent concluding section examines the need for a hybrid integration of various techniques to achieve optimal results in the problem domain specified, in particular exploring the hybrid integration of Preference Moore machines and recurrent networks to extract symbolic knowledge.

Enough work has been done to verify the fact that a computer can be programmed so that it will learn to play a better game of checkers than can be played by the person who wrote the program. Furthermore, if can learn to do this in a remarkably short period of time (8 or 10 hours of machine-playing time) when given only the rules of the game, a sense of direction, and a redundant and incomplete list of parameters which are thought to have something to do with the game, but whose correct signs and relative weights are unknown and unspecified.

A variety of techniques from statistics, machine learning, and neural networks have been applied to databases in the hopes of mining knowledge from data. Although many approaches produce results whose accuracy rivals or exceeds human experts, there is still resistance to trusting important tasks to automated induction of knowledge. This paper explores factors that affect the acceptance of automatically acquired knowledge.

We concentrate on univariate induction algorithms, in particular on decision tree learning, even though the results that we cover are more general and find application, e.g., in rule learning, case-based methods, inductive logic programming, and Bayesian approaches. We focus on (numerical) attribute domain partitioning and decision tree pruning, which are the main subtasks in decision tree learning and, at the same time, constitute the main research problems within the field. In recent years important analytical developments in these problems have been obtained.

We demonstrate a behavior in a simulated world, collect training examples during the demonstration, and derive the parameters of fuzzy systems through backpropagation. However, not all behaviors can be described as functions from sensory inputs to motor outputs: the outputs also depend on the internal state of the robot. We extend our methodology by introducing an additional fuzzy variable, representing internal state, and adding a fuzzy controller to determine state transitions.

The error detection problem is the first step in providing intelligent responses, and the problem is distributed in nature. We observe that knowledge satisfy the building block principle, namely, knowledge are composed of multiple pieces of supporting knowledge. To support intelligent activities, we also observe the dynamic and distributed nature of knowledge. In other words, there are many different kinds of knowledge. Each has its own functionalities, composition, and relationships with other kinds of knowledge. A piece of knowledge may be used in multiple ways and places. It should be dynamically created, and composed/taught by making use of existing knowledge. It should also be invoked dynamically when being used in leaning other knowledge and solving problems. Each functionality of a piece of knowledge is distributed to the different components that made tip the knowledge. We propose to use the Object-Oriented paradigm to attack the machine learning problem, and provide the reasons why this is an appropriate approach.

Let us consider that all attributes are discrete. In this situation we develop a method (CIDIM) that improves any TDIDT algorithm. With this method we obtain a little tree, few rules, but a better success index than the version of the algorithm without this improvement. This method has two new characteristics: the induction process is controlled and the attribute values are grouped in a dynamic and local way during the decision tree construction. The experiences set is divided in three sets: the classical test set and, fbr constructs the tree, we split the remainder experiences in two sets. training set and control set. The training set is used for construct the tree. The control set verifies if the expansion of a node improves the prediction. This supervision is achieved by means of two indexes. In each step of the CIDIM method a node is expanded if these indexes increase.

In particular, an unsupervised self-organised growing cell structures network has been successfully used for high-dimensional input data clustering. However, the interpretation of the clustering results requires much manual effort. In this paper, a novel feature selection algorithm is presented and applied to a self-organised growing cell structures network in an attempt to discover associations among documents represented by the clusters generated by the network. The benefit of the approach is demonstrated by a document clustering example, in that the various document clusters are characterised in terms of shared keywords, thus making it easier for user to explore the contents of an unknown document archive.

This explosive growth is evidenced by the rapid expansion in the number and size of digital collections of documents. Simultaneously, fully automatic content-based techniques of indexing have been under development at a number of institutions. The time is thus ripe for the development of scalable knowledge management systems capable of handling extremely large textual collections distributed across multiple repositories. This paper introduces a technique for identifying regions of semantic locality within a collection of documents represented as a semantic network. Semantic locality imbues semantics to statistically based measures of graph connectedness. Such semantics become the basis for several applications in scalable knowledge management.

The algorithm carries out discretisation in such a way that the quantisation levels obtained embed the local and the global information contained in the data set. The paper defines some terms that give a measure of the local and global information present in the data set. The quantisation procedure is carried out by minimising the disorder measure defined in the paper A low disorder measure ensures the embedding of local and global information in the quantisation levels. The algorithm is used as a front end for a number of inductive learning algorithms and tested on a bench marking data set. The paper compares the results of the suggested algorithm with that of RULES2 and RULES3 algorithms.

We have integrated a numerical method based on fuzzy rules to deal with uncertainty. This method is used to optimize the analysis process and the cooperation between the different experts. On the other hand, the goal of our recent researches is to ease or eliminate the knowledge-acquisition bottleneck for expert system creation and to make a connectionist model behave as much as possible like an expert system.

In this way, this controller possesses the adaptive ability. Furthermore a new evolutionary computing way mind-evolutionary-based machine learning (MEBML)([1-3]) is adopted in this paper. MEBML inherits "colony" and "evolution" of the evolutionism. It jumps the traces of the gene and solves successfully encoding problem of genetic algorithm. Simulation illustrates that this new adaptive fuzzy controller not only can self-tune parameters of controllers on-line and increase control system qualifies, but also its algorithm is sample and easy to be established.

These include estimating the state of a nonlinear dynamic system, estimating parameters for nonlinear system identification (e.g., learning the weights of a neural network), and dual estimation (e.g., the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm) where both states and parameters are estimated simultaneously. This paper points out the flaws in using the EKF, and introduces an improvement, the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), proposed by Julier and Uhlman [5]. A central and vital operation performed in the Kalman Filter is the propagation of a Gaussian random variable (GRV) through the system dynamics. In the EKE the state distribution is approximated by a GRV, which is then propagated analytically through the first-order linearization of the nonlinear system. This can introduce large errors in the true posterior mean and covariance of the transformed GRV, which may lead to sub-optimal performance and sometimes divergence of the filter. The UKF addresses this problem by using a deterministic sampling approach. The state distribution is again approximated by a GRV, but is now represented using a minimal set of carefully chosen sample points. These sample paints completely capture the true mean and covariance of the GRV, and when propagated through the true nonlinear system, captures the posterior mean and covariance accurately to the 3rd order (Taylor series expansion) for any nonlinearity. The EKE in contrast, only achieves first-order accuracy. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the UKF is the same order as that of the EKF. Julier and Uhlman demonstrated the substantial performance gains of the UKF in the context of state-estimation for nonlinear control. Machine learning problems were not considered. We extend the use of the UKF to a broader class of nonlinear estimation problems, including nonlinear system identification, training of neural networks, and dual estimation problems. Our preliminary results were presented in [13]. in this paper, the algorithms are further developed and illustrated with a number of additional examples.

We therefore monitor normal activities using inductive logic programming (ILP) which is one of machine learning and detect anomalies. To ensure effective monitoring, we think the following two points must be considered. One point is automation of detection by ILP system, which is a rule generation engine, that always induces and updates effective rules. The other point is providing a visualization tool that reflects induced rules to the detection system. This tool enables an administrator to understand detection situations. For automated detection, we provide the ILP system with an automatic parameter adjustment function. For the visualization tool, we apply the visualization technology of a hyperbolic tree.

In this paper, we survey theoretical foundations of ILP from the viewpoints of Logic of Discovery and Machine Learning, and try to unify these two views with the support of the modern theory of Logic Programming. Firstly, we define several hypothesis construction methods in ILP and give their proof-theoretic foundations by treating then as a procedure which complete incomplete proofs. Next, we discuss the design of individual learning algorithms using these hypothesis construction methods. We review known results on learning logic programs in computational learning theory, and show that these algorithms are instances of a generic learning strategy with proof completion methods.

This hyper-parameter is usually chosen by trial and error with a model selection criterion. In this paper we present a methodology to optimize several hyper-parameters, based on the computation of the gradient of a model selection criterion with respect to the hyper-parameters. In the case of a quadratic training criterion, the gradient of the selection criterion with respect to the hyper-parameters is efficiently computed by back-propagating through a Cholesky decomposition. In the more general case, we show that the implicit function theorem can be used to derive a formula for the hyper-parameter gradient involving second derivatives of the training criterion.

Under this circumstance, in particular, it has been observed that additional learning plays an effective role. However, since the rule for classification becomes more and more complex with only additional learning, some appropriate forgetting is also necessary. It seems natural that many data are forgotten as the time elapses. On the other hand, it is expected more effective to forget unnecessary data actively. In this paper, several methods for active forgetting are suggested. The effectiveness of active forgetting is shown by examples in stock portfolio problems.

J	Beal, DF; Smith, MC				Beal, DF; Smith, MC			Temporal difference learning for heuristic search and game playing	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						learning; chess; games; heuristic; temporal difference	COMPUTER-CHESS; CONVERGENCE	Temporal difference (TD) learning is a natural method of reinforcement learning that is particularly appropriate for learning in heuristic search and game playing. Sutton [Machine Learning 3 (1988) 9-44] introduced the TD(lambda) method which is an elegant integration of supervised learning with TD learning. TD(lambda) enabled Tesauro's backgammon program to reach world championship standard. But it can be slow. Tesauro's program was trained on 1 500 000 games. Recent work [D.F. Beal, M.C. Smith, Temporal coherence and prediction decay in temporal difference learning. Technical Report no. 756, Department of Computer Science, Queen Mary and Westfield College, University of London, 1998] has described a significant algorithmic improvement (temporal coherence) that controls learning rates, and produces more stable final values. Results from a random walk task, and two complex real-world games are presented here to show that temporal coherence (TC) produces faster learning than earlier methods, and that TD learning can produce values that are superior to standard values for specified search regimes, without any domain-specific information or human assistance. In the chess domain, we also describe the emergence of classic human elementary knowledge in the pattern of weights learnt from self-play, starting with weights initialised to zero.

Machine learning techniques has been applied to learn these controllers. Classifier Systems (CS) have proven their ability of continuos learning in these domains. However, CS have some problems in reactive systems. In this paper, a modified CS is proposed to overcome these problems. Two special mechanisms are included in the developed CS to allow the learning of both reactions and sequences of actions. The learning process has been divided in two main tasks: first, the discrimination between a predefined set of rules and second, the discovery of new rules to obtain a successful operation in dynamic environments. Different experiments have been carried out using a mini-robot Khepera to find a generalised solution. The results show the ability of the system to continuous learning and adaptation to new situations.

In many cases, the fitness function is composed of several aspects. Simple implementation to cope with the multiple fitness function is a weighted summation. This paper presents an adaptive fitness function for the evolutionary computation to obtain the purposive behaviors through changing the weights for the fitness function. As an example task, a shooting behavior in a simplified soccer game is selected to show the validity of the proposed method. Simulation results and real experiments are shown, and a discussion is given.

For continuous features linguistic variables used in conditions of the rules are defined by membership functions. These linguistic variables should be optimized at the level of single rules or sets of rules. Assuming the Gaussian uncertainty of input values allows to increase the accuracy of predictions and to estimate probabilities of different classes. Detailed interpretation of relevant rules is possible using (probabilistic) confidence intervals. A real life example of such interpretation is given for personality disorders. The approach to optimization and interpretation described here is applicable to any rule-based system.

It has been designed to handle autonomous agents, evolutionary computing, neural nets, expert systems, machine learning, and distributed interactive AI systems, in general. $-calculus has built-in cost-optimization mechanism allowing to deal with nondeterminism, incomplete and uncertain information. In this paper, we investigate expressiveness of $-calculus. We show that due to infinitary means, it allows to express models having richer behavior than Turing machine, including cellular automata, interaction machines, neural networks, and random automata networks. We also investigate the importance of synchronization, representation of continuity, and higher-order.

Their knowledge bases contain knowledge on diagnostic relationships between a technical state of a given machine, its operating conditions and observable symptoms of this state. This knowledge may be acquired either from human experts or from databases containing examples. The paper focuses on problems of knowledge acquisition from examples. It concerns the whole range of problems starting from preparation of examples up to the verification and validation of the knowledge base at the end of the proceeding. To acquire diagnostic knowledge from a set of examples we apply both machine learning and knowledge discovery methods. An example of the application of described methods for the acquisition of knowledge suitable for diagnosing complex technical states of rotating machinery is also given.

In contrast to conventional Darwinian-type evolutionary algorithms that employ mutation and/or recombination, LEM employs machine learning to generate new populations. Ar each step of evolution, LEM determines hypotheses explaining why certain individuals in the population are superior to others in performing the designated class of tasks. These hypotheses are then instantiated to create a next generation. In the testing studies described here, we compared a program implementing LEM with selected evolutionary computation algorithms on a range optimization problems and a filter design problem. In these studies, LEM significantly outperformed the evolutionary computation algorithms, sometimes speeding up the evolution by two or more orders of magnitude in the number of evolutionary steps (births). LEM was also applied to a real-world problem of designing optimized heat exchangers. The resulting designs matched or outperformed the best human designs.

These structures drive vision process, resolving ambiguity and uncertainty via feedback, and provide image understanding, that is an interpretation of visual information in terms of such knowledge models. The solution to Image Understanding problems is suggested in form of active multilevel hierarchical networks represented dually as discrete and continuous structures. Computational intelligence methods transform images into model-based knowledge representation. Certainty Dimension converts attractors in neural networks into fuzzy sets, preserving input-output relationships. Symbols naturally emerge in such networks. Symbolic Space is a dual structure that combines closed distributed space split by the set of fuzzy regions, and discrete set of symbols equivalent to the cores of regions represented as points in the Certainty dimension. Model Space carries knowledge in form of links and relations between the symbols, and supports graph, diagrammatic and topological operations. Composition of spaces works similar to M. Minsky frames and agents, Gerard Edelman's "maps of maps", etc., combining machine learning, classification and analogy together with induction, deduction and other methods of higher level model-based reasoning. Based on such principles, an Image Understanding system can convert images into knowledge models, effectively resolving uncertainty and ambiguity via feedback projections and does not require supercomputers.

To simplify off-line programming (OLP) for robotic are welding, we develop an are welding expert system which can generate welding process parameters automatically. Its input data come from the feature database of welding part, which is set up by our feature modeling system The expert system has become an important module of our RAWTOLPS (Robotic Are Welding Task-level Off-Line System). It combines case-based reasoning with heuristic rule-based reasoning methods to deal with the welding process design. Moreover, artificial neural networks are introduced to the systems for reasoning and machine learning, and several network modules are developed to learn from welding process database, based on backpropagation neural networks. After some groups of actual welding process data were used to train the network models, several network models are established both to design the welding process and to predict the weld bead shape. Besides the ANN-based learning, cased-based learning are used in the expert system. These two methods have respectively their own characteristics, and can meet qualifications of different users. The experimental data show that the system can accomplish re-learning and expanding of welding process knowledge, and satisfy the command of the off-line programming system.

The core of intelligent interface under development is a system whose task is continuous monitoring of operator's Psychical state. This state is estimated by operator's physiological parameters that are continuously measured. They are preprocessed using statistical methods. Selection of physiological parameters monitored on the operator has been based on preliminary tests investigating influence of individual types of load on these parameters. Preprocessed data are passed in the form of a database to an expert system that performs their evaluation using an adaptive knowledge base. The aim of the evaluation is to determine operator's psychical state and in case of need to warn of stress or fatigue of the operator. The first knowledge base has been designed using results of consultations with medical doctors. Since success rate of this knowledge base has not been high, we have developed new methodology of knowledge base creation. It uses a machine learning method (based on ID3 algorithm) for the building of the knowledge base. Success rate of the intelligent interface is very closely linked with success rate of the expert system that represents the core of this interface. Success rate of the expert system is given above all by the quality of its knowledge base. Therefore the proposed methodology has its justification. Planned applications of the adaptive interface include control rooms of power plants, incinerators, and companies distributing earth gas.

Rather than focusing on whether the student knows a particular piece of knowledge, the learning agent determines how likely the student is to answer a problem correctly and how long he will take to generate this response. To construct this model, we used traces from previous users of the tutor to train the machine learning agent. This agent used information about the student, the current topic, the problem, and the student's efforts to solve this problem to make its predictions. This model was very accurate at predicting the time students required to generate a response, and was somewhat accurate at predicting the likelihood the student's response was correct. We present two methods for integrating such an agent into an intelligent tutor.

J	Sester, M				Sester, M			Knowledge acquisition for the automatic interpretation of spatial data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article							COMPUTER VISION; MODELS	In order to handle the ever increasing amount of digital data efficiently, methods and techniques for automation have to be available. A key issue is the use of knowledge-based systems to interpret the data and operate on it in an automatic way. Interpretation requires knowledge about the underlying concepts in the data. Providing the necessary knowledge, however, is a bottleneck in automation. In this paper, an approach to semi-automatic knowledge acquisition is described. The knowledge is derived from given example data using supervised machine learning. An application of the approach in the domain of the interpretation of unstructured spatial data is given, and possible further applications are outlined.

This paper describes some research into the transfer of human control skill into an automatic controller. Controllers are generated from examples of control traces. This process can be aided by techniques of Machine Learning (ML), and is also called "behavioural cloning". The paper gives a review of ML-based approaches to behavioural cloning, representative experiments, and an assessment of the results. Some recent work is discussed, including the extraction of the operator's subconscious sub-goals and the use of qualitative representations. It is argued that the key to success is a suitable representation and decomposition of the machine learning problem involved.

J	Baxter, J				Baxter, J			A model of inductive bias learning	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article							CLASSIFICATION	A major problem in machine learning is that of inductive bias: how to choose a learner's hypothesis space so that it is large enough to contain a solution to the problem being learnt, yet small enough to ensure reliable generalization from reasonably-sized training sets. Typically such bias is supplied by hand through the skill and insights of experts. In this paper a model for automatically learning bias is investigated. The central assumption of the model is that the learner is embedded within an environment of related learning tasks. Within such an environment the learner can sample from multiple tasks, and hence it can search for a hypothesis space that contains good solutions to many of the problems in the environment. Under certain restrictions on the set of all hypothesis spaces available to the learner, we show that a hypothesis space that performs well on a sufficiently large number of training tasks will also perform well when learning novel tasks in the same environment. Explicit bounds are also derived demonstrating that learning multiple tasks within an environment of related tasks can potentially give much better generalization than learning a single task.

The probabilistic automata typically built in these contexts are subtended by uniform, fixed-memory Markov models. In practice, such automata tend to be unnecessarily bulky and computationally imposing both during their synthesis and use. Recently, D. Ron, Y. Singer, and N. Tishby built much more compact, tree-shaped variants of probabilistic automata under the assumption of an underlying Markov process of variable memory length. These variants, called Probabilistic Suffix Trees (PSTs) were subsequently adapted by G. Bejerano and G. Yona and applied successfully to learning and prediction of protein families. The process of learning the automaton from a given training set S of sequences requires Theta (Ln(2)) worst-case time, where n is the total length of the sequences in S and L is the length of a longest substring of S to be considered for a candidate state in the automaton. Once the automaton is built, predicting the likelihood of a query sequence of m characters may cost time Theta (m(2)) in the worst case. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce automata equivalent to PSTs but having the following properties: Learning the automaton, for any L, takes O(n) time. Prediction of a string of m symbols by the automaton takes O (m) time. Along the way, the paper presents an evolving learning scheme and addresses notions of empirical probability and related efficient computation, which is a by-product possibly of more general interest.

In this work, we propose an extension to this method, called distribution-balanced stratified cross-validation (DBSCV), which improves the estimation quality by providing balanced intraclass distributions when partitioning a data set into multiple folds. We have tested DBSCV on nine real-world and three artificial domains using the C4.5 decision trees classifier. The results show that DBSCV performs better (has smaller biases) than the regular stratified cross-validation in most cases, especially when the number of folds is small. The analysis and experiments based on three artificial data sets also reveal that DBSCV is particularly effective when multiple intraclass clusters exist in a data set.

J	Zheng, ZJ				Zheng, ZJ			Constructing conjunctive attributes using production rules	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND PRACTICE IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						constructive induction; decision tree learning; classification; machine learning	MINIMUM DESCRIPTION LENGTH; DECISION TREES; INDUCTION	Many existing constructive decision tree learning algorithms such as Fringe and Citre construct conjunctions or disjunctions directly from paths of decision trees. This paper investigates a novel attribute construction method for decision tree learning It creates conjunctions from production rules that are transformed from decision trees. Irrelevant or unimportant conditions are eliminated when paths are transformed into production rules. Therefore, this new method is likely to construct new attributes with relevant conditions. Three constructive induction algorithms based on this basic idea are described and are empirically evaluated by comparing with C4.5 and a Fringe-like algorithm in a set of artificial and natural domains. The experimental results reveal that constructing conjunctions using production rules can significantly improve the performance of decision tree learning in the majority of the domains tested in terms of both higher prediction accuracy and lower theory complexity. These results suggest an advantage of the attribute construction method that uses production rules over the method of constructing new attributes directly from paths in noisy domains.

J	Carter, JH				Carter, JH			The immune system as a model for pattern recognition and classification	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article							IDIOTYPIC NETWORKS; LEARNING ALGORITHMS; CONNECTIVITY; MEMORY; SIZE	Objective: To design a pattern recognition engine based on concepts derived from mammalian immune systems. Design: A supervised learning system (Immunos-81) was created using software abstractions of T cells, B cells, antibodies, and their interactions. Artificial T cells control the creation of a-cell populations (clones), which compete for recognition of "unknowns." The B-cell clone with the "simple highest avidity" (SHA) or "relative highest avidity" (RHA) is considered to have successfully classified the unknown. Measurement: Two standard machine learning data sets, consisting of eight nominal and six continuous variables, were used to test the recognition capabilities of Immunos-81. The first set (Cleveland), consisting of 303 cases of patients with suspected coronary artery disease, was used to perform a ten-way cross-validation. After completing the validation runs, the Cleveland data set was used-as-a training set prior to presentation of the second data set, consisting of 200 unknown cases. Results: For cross-validation runs, correct recognition using SHA ranged from a high of 96 percent to a low of 63.2 percent. The average correct classification for all runs was 83.2 percent. Using the RHA metric, 11.2 percent were labeled '"too close to determine" and net further attempt was made to classify them. Of the remaining cases, 85.5 percent were correctly classified. When the second data set was presented, correct classification occurred in 73.5 percent of cases when SHA was used and in 80.3 percent of cases when RHA was used. Conclusions: The immune system offers a viable paradigm for the design of pattern recognition systems. Additional research is required to fully exploit the nuances of immune computation.

Limitations of existing statistical risk models lead to explore machine-learning methods. This study evaluates the implementation and performance of a decision free (CART) and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to predict cardiovascular risk from real data. The study population was randomly splitted in a learning set (n=10,296) and a test set (n=5,148). CART and the MLP were implemented at their best performance on the learning set and applied on the test set and compared to a logistic model. Implementation, explicative and discriminative performance criteria are considered, based on ROC analysis. Areas under ROC curves and their 95% confidence interval are 0.78 (0.75-0.81), 0.78 (0.75-0.80) and 0.76 (0.73-0.79) respectively for logistic regression, MLP and CART Given their implementation and explicative characteristics, these methods can complement existing statistical models and contribute to the interpretation of risk.

Increasingly, this information is collected and stored for its potential utility in advancing health care. Knowledge-based systems, for example, might be able to apply rules to the collected data to determine whether a patient has a certain condition. Often, however; the underlying knowledge needed to write such rules is not welt understood. How could these clinical data be useful then? Use of machine learning is one answer. We present a pipeline for discovering the knowledge needed for event detection in medical time-series data. We demonstrate how this process can be applied in the development of intelligent patient monitoring for the intensive care unit (ICU). Specifically, we develop a system for detecting Otrue alarms situations in the ICU, wherecurrently as many as 86% of bedside monitor alarms are false.

Many of these proposed techniques differ in the way the text is represented for use by the learning algorithms. Slight differences can occur between representations that may be chosen arbitrarily, but such differences can significantly affect classification algorithm performance. We examined 8 different data representation techniques used for medical text, and evaluated their use with standard machine learning algorithms. We measured the loss of classification-relevant information due to each representation. Representations that captured status information explicitly resulted in significantly better performance. Algorithm performance was dependent on subtle differences in data representation.

Our proposal relies on a machine learning technique for predicting the correctness of partial syntactic structures that are built during the parsing process. A recursive neural network architecture is employed for computing predictions after a training phase on examples drawn from a corpus of parsed sentences, the Penn Treebank. Our results indicate the viability of the approach and lay out the premises for a novel generation of algorithms for natural language processing which more closely model human parsing. These algorithms may prove very useful in the development of efficient parsers and have an immediate application in the construction of semiautomatic annotation tools.

In this paper, Resilient Backpropagation (RPROP) with a weight decay term is proposed to train RBF networks and used to differentiate surfaces of 3D object in range images and to classify eight different Machine Learning data set for classification purpose. We show the advantages of resilient backpropagation for the RBF network structure within this classification context. The network structure is a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning layers. Experimental results show that radial basis function network trained with resilient backpropagation can be successfully applied to differentiate of surfaces of 3D object in range images as well as to the classification of Machine learning problems.

But, It is difficult to define its parameters without experience. We propose a rule generation technique from a database using GP combined with association rule algorithm. It rakes rules generated hy the association rule algorithm as initial individual of GP. The learning speed of GP is improved hy the combined algorithm. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we apply it to the decision tree construction problem from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

In this paper, we expand the capability of the Graph-Based Induction to handle not only tree structured data but also multi-inputs/outputs nodes and loop structure (including a self-loop) which cannot be treated in the conventional way. The method is verified to work as expected using artificially generated data and we evaluated experimentally the computation time of the implemented program.

First, sentences are broken into segments by special cue markers. Each segment is represented by a set of predefined features (e.g. location of the segment, number of title words in the segment). Then supervised learning algorithms are used to train the summarizer to extract important sentence segments, based on the feature vector. Results of experiments indicate that the performance of the proposed approach compares quite favorably with other approaches (including MS Word summarizer).

Most notable is the use of the scheme in building a knowledge base for interpreting pathology results. Unlike machine learning algorithms which construct theories for raw data, the commercial system using the RDR scheme requires some interaction with an expert to correct erroneous interpretations. However, the frequency of such interactions is very low. Furthermore, the simplicity of the interaction means that a knowledge engineer is not required when updating a knowledge base. A number of RDR variants have been devised for different applications. While Scheffer has given operational semantics to one variant of RDR, translations of RDR into classical logics has not yet been presented in the literature. This paper will show how two variants of RDR, single classification RDR (SCRDR) and multiple classification RDR (MCRDR), have a propositional or first-order core tied with case specific defaults. Such a translation will be used to highlight properties of the RDR scheme which make it successful. Similarities and differences in the two variants will be discussed and RDR revision will also be analysed.

S	Beydoun, G; Hoffmann, A		Dieng, R; Corby, O		Beydoun, G; Hoffmann, A			Monitoring knowledge acquisition instead of evaluating knowledge bases	KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT, PROCEEDINGS: METHODS, MODELS, AND TOOLS	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management	OCT 02-06, 2000	JUAN LES PINS, FRANCE	INRIA, AAAI, AFIA, Club CRIN, GRACQ, IIIA, MLNET, Ingenierie Traitment Informat			RULES; RIPPLE	Evaluating the success of a knowledge acquisition (KA) task is difficult and expensive. Most evaluation approaches rely on the expert themselves, either directly, or indirectly by relying on data previously prepared with the help of experts. In incremental KA, knowledge base (KB) errors are monitored and corrected by an expert. Thus, during its evolution a record of the knowledge based system (KBS) performance is usually easy to keep. We propose to integrate with the incremental KA process, an evaluation process based on a statistical analysis to estimate the effectiveness of the KBS, as the KBS is actually evolved. We tailor such an analysis for Ripple Down Rules (RDR), which is an effective incremental KA methodology where a record of the KBS performance can be easily derived and updated as new cases are processed by the system. An RDR KB is a collection of rules with hierarchical exceptions, which are entered and validated by the expert in the context of their use. This greatly facilitates the knowledge maintenance task which, characteristically in RDR, overlaps with the incremental KA process. The work in this paper aims to overlap evaluation with maintenance and development of the knowledge base. It also minimises the major expense in deploying the RDR KBS, that of keeping a domain expert on-line during maintenance and the initial period of deployment. The expert is not kept on-line longer than it is absolutely necessary. We use the structure and semantics of an evolving RDR KB, combined with proven machine learning statistical methods, to estimate the added value in every KB update, as the KB evolves. Using these values, the decision-makers in the organisation employing the KBS can apply a cost-benefit analysis of the continuation of the incremental KA process. They can then determine when this process, involving keeping an expert on-line, should be terminated.

This paper explores the use of machine learning techniques, concentrating on genetic algorithms, to design laser beam shaping systems using geometrical optics. Specifically, a three-element GRIN laser beam shaping system has been designed to expand and transform a Gaussian input beam profile into one with a uniform irradiance profile. Solution to this problem involves the constrained optimization of a merit function involving a mix of discrete and continuous parameters. The merit function involves terms that measure the deviation of the output beam diameter, divergence, and irradiance from target values. The continuous parameters include the distances between the lens elements, the thickness, and radii of the lens elements. The discrete parameters include the GRIN glass types from a manufacturer's database, the gradient direction of the GRIN elements (positive or negative), and the actual number of lens elements in the system (one to four).

J	Tsymbal, A; Puuronen, S				Tsymbal, Alexey; Puuronen, Seppo			Bagging and Boosting with Dynamic Integration of Classifiers	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE <D>			English	Article								One approach in classification tasks is to use machine learning techniques to derive classifiers using learning instances. The cooperation of several base classifiers as a decision committee has succeeded to reduce classification error. The main current decision committee learning approaches boosting and bagging use resampling with the training set and they can be used with different machine learning techniques which derive base classifiers. Boosting uses a kind of weighted voting and bagging uses equal weight voting as a combining method. Both do not take into account the local aspects that the base classifiers may have inside the problem space. We have proposed a dynamic integration technique to be used with ensembles of classifiers. In this paper, the proposed dynamic integration technique is applied with AdaBoost and bagging. The comparison results using several datasets of the UCI machine learning repository show that boosting and baggingwith dynamic integration of classifiers results often better accuracy than boosting and bagging result with their original voting techniques.

Landmarking is a novel and promising meta-learning approach to model selection. It uses accuracy estimates from simple and efficient learners to describe tasks and subsequently construct meta-classifiers that predict which one of a set of more elaborate learning algorithms is appropriate for a given problem. Experiments show that landmarking compares favourably with the traditional statistical approach to meta-learning.

J	Geurts, P; Wehenkel, L				Geurts, Pierre; Wehenkel, Louis			Temporal Machine Learning for Switching Control	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE <D>			English	Article								In this paper, a temporal machine learning method is presented which is able to automatically construct rules allowing to detect as soon as possible an event using past and present measurements made on a complex system. This method can take as inputs dynamic scenarios directly described by temporal variables and provides easily readable results in the form of detection trees. The application of this method is discussed in the context of switching control. Switching (or discrete event) control of continuous systems consists in changing the structure of a system in such a way as to control its behavior. Given a particular discrete control switch, detection trees are applied to the induction of rules which decide based on the available measurements whether or not to operate a switch. Two practical applications are discussed in the context of electrical power systems emergency control.

In many data exploration algorithms, dissimilarity functions do not use domain knowledge for the cases comparison. The Iterative Knowledge Base System (IKBS) has been designed to improve generalization accuracy of exploration algorithms through the use of structural properties of domain models. A general mathematical framework for utilizing structural properties of the domain model encompassing the definition of a Dissimilarity Function for Structured Descriptions is proposed. Applications are conducted with the help of IKBS on a set of databases from the UCI machine learning repository and on structured domain definition data.

This paper aims to improve such an exhaustive search based classification system CBA (Classification Based on Associations). The main strength of this system is that it is able to use the most accurate rules for classification. However, it also has weaknesses. This paper proposes two new techniques to deal with these weaknesses. This results in remarkably accurate classifiers. Experiments on a set of 34 benchmark datasets show that on average the new techniques reduce the error of CBA by 17% and is superior to CBA on 26 of the 34 datasets. They reduce the error of C4.5 by 19%, and improve performance on 29 datasets. Similar good results are also achieved against RIPPER, LB and a Naive-Bayes classifier.

In this paper, we review some symbolic machine learning methods which can be used to add new lexical material to the lexicon by automatically inducing the regularities implicit in lexical representations already present. We introduce the general methodology for the construction of inductive lexica, and discuss empirical results on extending lexica with two types of information: pronunciation and gender.

This has led to the development of the subject of Logic Programming (LP), which can be viewed as a key part of Logic-Based Artificial Intelligence. The subtopic of LP concerned with Machine Learning is known as "Inductive Logic Programming" (ILP), which again can be broadened to Logic-Based Machine Learning by dropping Horn clause restrictions. ILP has its roots in the ground-breaking research of Cordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro. This paper provides a brief survey of the state of ILP applications, theory and techniques.

In contrast to Darwinian-type evolution that relies on mutation, recombination, and selection operators, LEM employs machine learning to generate new populations. Specifically, in Machine Learning mode, a learning system seeks reasons why certain individuals in a population (or a collection of past populations) are superior to others in performing a designated class of tasks. These reasons, expressed as inductive hypotheses, are used to generate new populations. A remarkable property of LEM is that it is capable of quantum leaps ("insight jumps") of the fitness function, unlike Darwinian-type evolution that typically proceeds through numerous slight improvements. In our early experimental studies, LEM significantly outperformed evolutionary computation methods used in the experiments, sometimes achieving speed-ups of two or more orders of magnitude in terms of the number of evolutionary steps. LEM has a potential for a wide range of applications, in particular, in such domains as complex optimization or search problems, engineering design, drug design, evolvable hardware, software engineering, economics, data mining, and automatic programming.

However, the accuracy of such systems is often highly dependent upon the accuracy of a human expert's domain theory. When human experts learn or create a set of rules, they are subject to a number of hindrances. Most significantly experts are, to a greater or lesser extent, restricted by the tradition of scholarship which has preceded them and by an inability to examine large amounts of data in a rigorous fashion without the effects of boredom or frustration. As a result, human theories are often erroneous or incomplete. To escape this dependency, machine learning systems have been developed to automatically refine and correct an expert's domain theory. When theory revision systems are applied to expert theories, they often concentrate on the reformulation of the knowledge provided rather than on the reformulation or selection of input features. The general assumption seems to be that the expert has already selected the set of features that will be most useful for the given task. That set may, however, be suboptimal. This paper studies theory refinement and the relative benefits of applying feature selection versus more extensive theory reformulation.

In this paper, are study the problem of building cost-sensitive intrusion detection models to be used for realtime detection. We briefly discuss the major cost factors in IDS, including consequential and operational costs. We propose a multiple model cost-sensitive machine learning technique to produce models that are optimized for user-defined cost metrics. Empirical experiments in offline analysis show a reduction of approximately 97% in operational cost over a single model approach, and a reduction of approximately 30% in consequential cost over a pure accuracy-based approach.

The different learning algorithms, that have been proposed, share some restrictions, which may prevent them from being used in practice. Approaches applying techniques from grammatical inference are restricted to sequential workflows. Other algorithms allowing concurrency require unique activity nodes. This contribution shows how the basic principle of our previous approach to sequential workflow induction can be generalized, so that it is able to deal with concurrency. It does not require unique activity nodes. The presented approach uses a log-likelihood guided search in the space of workflow models, that starts with a most general workflow model containing unique activity nodes. Two split operators are available for specialization.

The algorithm is applicable to a wide range of machine learning and data mining problems where continuous attributes need to be discretized. In this paper, we evaluate its utility in a regression-by-classification setting. Preliminary experimental results indicate that the decision trees induced using this discretization strategy are significantly smaller and thus more comprehensible than those learned with standard discretization methods, while losing only minimally in numerical prediction accuracy. This may be a considerable advantage in machine learning and data mining applications where comprehensibility is an issue.

The first method is based on a particular statistic which allows us to select a discrete value for a new continuous value from the series. The second one is based on a concept of significant distance between consecutive values from time series which is defined. This definition is based on qualitative changes in the time series values. In both methods, the conversion process of continuous values into discrete values is dynamic in opposition to static classical methods used in machine learning. Finally, we use the proposed methods in a practical case. We transform the daily clearness index time series into discrete values. The results display that the series with discrete values obtained from the dynamic process captures better the sequential properties of the original continuous series.

We have developed a system called PROMETHEE, which incrementally extracts lexico-syntactic patterns for a specific conceptual relation from a technical corpus. However, these patterns are often too general and need to be manually validated. In this paper, we demonstrate how PROMETHEE has been interfaced with the machine learning system EAGLE in order to automatically refine the patterns it produces. The empirical results obtained with this technique show that the refined patterns allows to decrease the need for the human validation.

Layered learning applies to tasks for which learning a direct mapping from inputs to outputs is intractable with existing learning algorithms. Given a hierarchical task decomposition into subtasks, layered learning seamlessly integrates separate learning at each subtask layer. The learning of each subtask directly facilitates the learning of the next higher subtask layer by determining at least one of three of its components: (i) the set of training examples; (ii) the input representation; and/or (iii) the output representation. We introduce layered learning in its domain-independent general form. We then present a full implementation in a complex domain, namely simulated robotic soccer.

The results of these experiments were evaluated by the medical expert for their soundness with respect to the existing knowledge in the domain, and potential for the generation of new and useful medical knowledge. The performed experiments generally verify the existing medical practice in non-invasive diagnosis of atherosclerotic coronary heart disease, but also demonstrate how the synergy of medical and machine learning expertise helps in the inference of a new knowledge and potentially could increase efficiency and reliability of the medical diagnostic process.

We compared two Minkowskian distance functions with three heterogeneous proximity functions to test whether these functions were better in data sets with attributes of mixed type. Significant differences in nearest neighbour classification accuracy were found in 11 of all the 21 data sets. City-block and Euclidean distance functions outperformed Cower's similarity Function and Heterogeneous Euclidean-Overlap Metric, while Heterogeneous Value Difference Metric (HVDM) was better than the other functions. HVDM classified mixed data best, because it treats nominal attributes more carefully than the other functions.

The system processed real-life medical data of 566 new-borns; 528 survived and were classified as "alive", the remaining 38 did not survive and were classified as "died". The state of each new-born was described by values of 112 attributes. The system detected five of the attributes as the best predictors for survival (asphyxia, apnoea, birth weight, reanimation and gestation age). To evaluate are the selected attributes relevant for prediction, the following procedure was used: 566 newborns were divided into two groups by random selection; 396 (70%) randomly selected new-horns formed the learning group, the remaining 170 new-borns formed the test group. The system acquired prediction knowledge by processing data of the learning group new-borns. Using the knowledge thus acquired, the system predicted survival for each new-born from the test group several times, each time using another set of attributes: once, using all 112 attributes; once, using attributes detected by the system as the best predictors; once, using remaining attributes without the best predictors. After the predictions for all new-borns from the test group had been finished, classification accuracy, sensitivity (accuracy for "alive") and specificity (accuracy for "died") were calculated as measures of prediction success with particular sets of attributes. The results have shown that the best prognostic accuracies were achieved when prediction was done using those attributes which the system detected as the best predictors for new-born survival.

One of these aspects is related to the difference between the number of examples belonging to each class, When the difference is large, the learning system may have difficulties to learn the concept related to the minority class. In this work, we discuss some methods to decrease the number of examples belonging to the majority class, in order to improve the performance of the minority class. We also propose the use of the VDM metric in order to improve the performance of the classification techniques.

One of the most critical resources in mobile computing environments is battery life, and good energy conservation methods increase the utility of mobile systems. We use a simple and efficient algorithm based on machine learning techniques that has excellent performance. Using trace data, the algorithm outperforms several methods that are theoretically optimal under various worst-case assumptions, as well as the best fixed time-out strategy. In particular, the algorithm reduces the power consumption of the disk to about half of the energy consumed by a one minute fixed time-out policy. Furthermore, the algorithm uses as little as 88% of the energy consumed by the best fixed time-out computed in retrospect.

The original ensemble method is Bayesian averaging, but more recent algorithms include error-correcting output coding, Bagging, and boosting. This paper reviews these methods and explains why ensembles can often perform better than any single classifier. Some previous studies comparing ensemble methods are reviewed, and some new experiments are presented to uncover the reasons that Adaboost does not overfit rapidly.

And while its primary focus is the development of a mathematically rigorous, theoretical foundation for the field of supervised learning, including a discussion of what constitutes a "solvable pattern recognition problem", it will also provide some algorithmic detail for implementing the general classification method derived from the theory, a method based on classifier combination, and will discuss experimental results comparing its performance to other well-known methods on standard benchmark problems from the U.C. Irvine,and Statlog, collections. The practical consequences of this work are consistent with the mathematical predictions. Comparing our experimental results on 24 standard benchmark problems taken from the U.C. Irvine, and Statlog, collections, with those reported in the literature for other well-known methods, our method placed Ist on 19 problems, 2nd on 2 others, 4th on another, and 5th on the remaining 2.

The identification of non-nominal pronouns is important in information retrieval, machine translation and automatic summarisation. Given that previous work has only tackled a subset of those non-nominal uses, a machine learning method for identification of all instances of non-nominal it is presented. The machine learning method is compared with a rule-based approach. The performance of each implementation is evaluated. The construction of an annotated corpus and training data are also described.

The four competing translations axe combined by a selection procedure so as to form a single optimized output for each input utterance. This selection procedure relies on confidence values that axe delivered together with each of the alternative translations. Since the confidence values are computed by four independent modules that are fundamentally different from one another, they axe not directly comparable and need to be rescaled in order to gain comparative significance. In this paper we describe a machine learning method tailored to overcome this difficulty by using off line human feedback to determine an optimized confidence rescaling scheme.

The need to identify such novel uses, and augment machine-readable dictionaries is a constant battle for professional lexicographers that need to update their resources in order to keep up with the development of the dynamic and evolving aspects of human language. Of equal importance is the need to devise automatic means upon which we can evaluate to what extent a (defining) dictionary accounts for what we find in corpus data. A combination of both semi-, and automatic means have been explored, and it seems that Machine Learning might be a plausible solution towards the stated goals.

The distinguishing characteristic of our work from most of the related work in the field is that we aim at the disambiguation of all content words in the text, rather than focussing on a small number of words. In an earlier study we have shown that a decision tree induction algorithm performs well on this task. This study compares decision tree induction with other popular learning methods and discusses their advantages and disadvantages. Our results confirm the good performance of decision tree induction, which outperforms the other algorithms, due to its ability to order the features used for disambiguation, according to their contribution in assigning the correct sense.

The robot visually searches and identifies persons and objects in real space that it has learned in advance (registered space, which was our office in this case), manages the history information of the places and times it found objects and/or persons, and tells the user, indicating their three-dimensional positions with line of sight and its finger. It interactively learns new objects and persons together with their names and owners. By using this function, the robot can engage in simple dialogue (do a task) with the user.

J	Kakas, AC; Riguzzi, F				Kakas, AC; Riguzzi, F			Abductive concept learning	NEW GENERATION COMPUTING			English	Article						machine learning; inductive logic programming; abductive logic programming; non-monotonic reasoning		We investigate how abduction and induction can be integrated into a common learning framework. In particular, we consider an extension of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) for the case in which both the background and the target theories are abductive logic programs and where an abductive notion of entailment is used as the basic coverage relation for learning. This extended learning framework has been called Abductive Concept Learning (ACL). In this framework, it is possible to learn with incomplete background information about the training examples by exploiting the hypothetical reasoning of abduction. We also study how the ACL framework can be used as a basis for multiple predicate learning. An algorithm for ACL is developed by suitably extending the top-down ILP method: the deductive proof procedure of Logic Programming is replaced by an abductive proof procedure for Abductive Logic Programming. This algorithm also incorporates a phase for learning integrity constraints by suitably employing a system that learns from interpretations like ICL. The framework of ACL thus integrates the two ILP settings of explanatory (predictive) learning and confirmatory (descriptive) learning. The above algorithm has been implemented into a system also called ACL*(I) Several experiments have been performed that show the effectiveness of the ACL framework in learning from incomplete data and its appropriate use for multiple predicate learning.

First we examine the performance of each approach by computer simulations on commonly used data sets. Simulation results clearly demonstrate that each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages. While the Michigan approach has high search ability to efficiently find good fuzzy rules in large search spaces for high-dimensional pattern classification problems, it can not directly optimize fuzzy rule-based systems. On the other hand, the Pittsburgh approach can directly optimize fuzzy rule-based systems while its search ability to find good fuzzy rules is not high. Then we combine these two approaches into a single hybrid algorithm. Our hybrid algorithm is based on the Pittsburgh approach where a set of fuzzy rules is coded as a string. The Michigan approach is used as a mutation operation in our hybrid algorithm for partially modifying each string (i.e., each rule set) by generating new rules from existing good rules. In this manner, our hybrid algorithm utilizes the advantages of the two approaches.

However, they have suffered from overfitting in noisy domains. This problem has been remedied, in C4.5 for example, by tree pruning, resulting in improved performance. More recently, fuzzy representations have been combined with decision trees. How does the performance of fuzzy decision trees compare to that of pruned decision trees? In this paper, we propose a comparative study of pruned decision trees and fuzzy decision trees. Further, for continuous inputs, we explore different ways (1) for selecting the granularity of the fuzzy input variables, and (2) for defining the membership functions of the fuzzy input values. We carry out an empirical study using 12 data sets. The results show that a fuzzy decision tree constructed using FID3, combined with fuzzy clustering (to build membership functions) and cluster validity (to decide on granularity), is superior to pruned decision trees.

The useful information may be expressed as relationships between propositions or variables or data elements, which can be used to predict future patterns or behaviour. The present paper investigates evolutionary computing techniques for data mining tasks in form of discovery of association rules and presents a brief review of evolutionary computation techniques for machine learning systems. The evolution of association rules as subset selection in the best form is comprehensible and modular knowledge for understanding. The experimental results and examples for binary data set are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of evolutionary computation for rule discovery tasks in form of association rules.

While the original algorithm is computationally attractive and is also able to handle both nominal and continuous attributes efficiently, our algorithm further improves it by taking into account of the recent advances in the rule induction and evolutionary computation communities. The refined system has been compared to other GA-based and non GA-based rule learning algorithms on a number of benchmark datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. Results show that the proposed system can achieve higher performance while still produces a smaller number of rules.

Such information systems will generally involve various computational and data nodes, managed by various organisations with differing policies and needs. Furthermore, in the absence of a centralised manager, co-ordination and interaction policies between such nodes become crucial. Aspects of coordination can range from data formats describing shared information to convergence time to a desired goal. Each entity within such a networked environment operates with incomplete knowledge about the state of others, and makes nse of an asynchronous mode of operation, An overview of techniques for supporting coordination in such an environment is first provided, followed by a proposed technique that makes use of Q-learning and data sharing between a collection of nodes, each of which is modelled as a neural network. We propose a de-centralised technique for managing a cluster of nodes, where emergence is used to converge towards a 'useful' result.

The central new idea of LEM is that it generates new individuals not by mutation and/or recombination, but by processes of hypothesis generation and instantiation. The hypotheses are generated by a machine learning system from examples of high and low performance individuals. When applied to problems of function optimization and parameter estimation for nonlinear filters, LEM significantly outperformed the standard evolutionary computation algorithms used in experiments, sometimes achieving two or more orders of magnitude of evolutionary speed-up (in terms of the number of births). An application of LEM to the problem of optimizing heat exchangers has produced designs equal to or exceeding the best human designs. Further research needs to explore trade-offs and determine best areas for LEM application.

They generally investigate distributed complex processes, perhaps with the ability to interact. It seems to be natural to study their behavior using process algebras, which were designed to handle distributed interactive systems. $-calculus is a higher-order polyadic process algebra for resource bounded computation. It has been designed to handle autonomous agents, evolutionary computing, neural nets, expert systems, machine learning, and distributed interactive Al systems, in general. $-calculus has built-in cost-optimization mechanism allowing to deal with nondeterminism, incomplete and uncertain information. In this paper, we express in $-calculus several subareas of evolutionary computation, including genetic programming, artificial life, autonomous agents and DNA-based computing.

This paper describes an innovative technique which can be used to automate these processes. The techniques described have been demonstrated through the implementation of a prototype automatic scheduler for meetings. The software uses an incremental learning algorithm to determine user preferences. The preferences are applied to a dedicated negotiation protocol to shot-ten the cycle of negotiation and to produce a result acceptable to all the users. The prototype system utilises mobile objects and autonomous agents with dedicated communication protocols. A test bed was developed to evaluate the performance of the system.

Conventional parsing techniques based on Machine Learning framework, such as Decision Trees and Maximum Entropy Models, have difficulty in selecting useful features as well as finding appropriate combination of selected features. On the other hand, it is well-known that SVMs achieve high generalization performance even with input data of very high dimensional feature space. Further-more, by introducing the Kernel principle, SVMs can carry out the training in high-dimensional spaces with a smaller computational cost independent of their dimensionality. We apply SVMs to Japanese dependency structure identification problem. Experimental results on Kyoto University corpus show that our system achieves the accuracy of 89.09% even with small training data (7958 sentences).

Aiming at a difficult problem for the accurate mixture ratio of raw materials of cement processing, MEBML is proposed, which calculates the mixture ratio of raw materials of cement and overcomes the defects of general calculation methods. The simulation example is given to show that this algorithm not only has rapid convergence rate and high calculation accuracy, but also has not prematurity of genetic [1]. This algorithm can be applied to any mixture ratio calculation of other materials.

Nevertheless there are some very challengeous problems in completing the Machine Learning in such a complex environment. One of them is how to construct an appropriate state space, which should have two main features: to well describe the main characters of the environment states and to be small enough to be processed by ANN, RL, or other methods. In This paper, a new method to construct an appropriate state space In the complex environment is proposed, which fit into above two requirements. Author also has completed a sample state space to describe the middle field situation in RoboCup simulation game, which can be used to do the attach-route decision in RoboCup.

It has been used in machine learning, knowledge discovery, decision support systems and pattern recognition. Traditionally, the algorithm to obtain the deduction of decision rule in rough sets theory always take more into account of the number of decision rules than the cost of the rules. In this paper, we introduce how to reconcile the conflict of the simplicity and the cost of rules by using multiple objectives decision-making (MOD), and the efficiency and effectiveness of rough set can be improved.

Granular Computing (GrC) is a superset of various theories (such as rough sets, fuzzy sets and interval computation) used to handle incompleteness, uncertainty, vagueness, etc. in information systems. This paper investigates the feasibility of applying GrC (especially the rough set theory) to deal with imperfect data in ILP. We list various kinds of imperfect data in ILP (including noise data, too sparse data, missing data, indiscernible data, and too strict bias). For each kind of imperfect data, we try to point out the resulting problem and the potential solution using GrC (or a particular form of GrC such as the rough set theory). The presentation includes formalisms suggested by the authors or other researchers, as well as some general ideas which may give rise to more concrete results in future research.

Our approach uses a rule set induction technique based on second-order tables (database relations in which tuples have sets of atomic values as components). In this theoretical framework, learning can be viewed as a table compression problem in which a table consisting of training set data is transformed into a second-order table with fewer rows by merging rows in consistency preserving ways. Given a data set of global climate conditions, solar variability, and inflows for Lake Okeechobee, we apply table compression to produce rules for predicting future Lake Okeechobee inflows, which can then be incorporated in an operational schedule for managing the lake. The paper presents preliminary results.

In this paper, we first analyze the general problems of these two paradigms, and some successful techniques for boosting their performance. Then we propose a novel algorithm that can overcome some of existing problems through a mixture of these two paradigms. The algorithm is tested with a robot language-learning task. Equipped with this algorithm, our robot is able to acquire short audio information on-line, and gradually understand the audio input through human's intensive teaching.

A rule construction algorithm forms rules that summarize data sets. These rules can be used in a large spectrum of data mining activities. In ILP, the rules are constructed with a target predicate as the consequent, or head, of the rule, and with high-ranking literals forming the antecedent, or body, of the rule. The predicate rankings are obtained by applying predicate ranking algorithms to a domain (background) knowledge base. In this work, we present three new predicate ranking algorithms for the inductive logic programming system, INDED (pronounced "indeed"). The algorithms use a grouping technique employing basic set theoretic operations to generate the rankings. We also present results of applying the ranking algorithms to several problem domains, some of which are universal like the classical genealogy problem, and others, not so common. In particular, diagnosis is the main thread of many of our experiments. Here, although our experimentation relates to medical diagnosis in diabetes and Lyme disease, many of the same techniques and methodologies can be applied to other forms of diagnosis including system failure, sensor detection, and trouble-shooting.

The perceptual input is multi-modal: four video signals capture the contextual traffic, the driver's head and the driver's viewpoint; and a real-time data acquisition system records the car's brake, gear, steering wheel angle, speed and acceleration throttle signals. Over 70 drivers have driven the SmartCar for 1.25 hours in the greater Boston area. Graphical models, HMMs and potentially extensions (CHMMs), have been trained using the experimental driving data to create models of seven different driver maneuvers: passing, changing lanes right and left, turning right and left, starting and stopping. We show that, on average, the predictive power of our models is of 1 second before the maneuver starts taking place. Therefore, these models would be essential to facilitate operating mode transitions between driver and driver assistance systems to prevent potential dangerous situations and to create more realistic automated cars in car simulators.

In this paper we describe some simple rules for selection of discourse markers. These rules were derived for use in an intelligent tutoring system by applying decision-tree machine learning to human tutoring language. The fact that these selection rules operate within the environment of an intention-based planner encouraged us to derive our decision tree partly based an intention-based features. The resulting tree, when applied to the generation task, is relatively easy to understand because it can be referred to traditional intention-based linguistic explanations of discourse marker behavior.

The information from the users is not only a important original knowledge source for updating and learning-the knowledge of the knowledge base in diagnosis center, but also a indispensable tache in information feedback of equipment' life cycle. However, it is difficult that maintenance data could be fed back and directly transformed into the knowledge in knowledge base in time, and consequently became the public information in Internet. To solve these problems, this article proposed a intelligent maintenance system in remote monitoring of mechatronical equipment, and also founded a framework of Maintenance Database System based on user-server structure. Maintenance Database System can be divided into four parts, Maintenance Record Database, Maintenance Knowledge Database, Equipment's Usage Database and the Equipment's Appliance Database. In this article, We presented the data structure of Maintenance Database System and the knowledge expression of Maintenance Database; and founded the machine learning module, which based on the conception trees and remote man-machine interactive manner. This system is used in remote monitoring of FMS equipment and fault diagnosis, and its running status is quite well.

PROTEIN ENGINEERING			English	Article						machine-learning; neural-networks; secondary structure; statistics	PROTEIN SECONDARY STRUCTURE; AMINO-ACID SEQUENCE; RECOGNITION; ALGORITHMS; ACCURACY	We have compared the accuracy of the individual protein secondary structure prediction methods: PHD, DSC, NNSSP and Predator against the accuracy obtained by combing the predictions of the methods. A range of ways of combing predictions were tested: voting, biased voting, linear discrimination, neural networks and decision trees. The combined methods that involve 'learning' (the non-voting methods) were trained using a set of 496 non-homologous domains; this dataset was biased as some of the secondary structure prediction methods had used them for training, We used two independent test sets to compare predictions: the first consisted of 17 non-homologous domains from GASPS (Third Community Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction); the second set consisted of 405 domains that were selected in the same way as the training set, and were non-homologous to each other and the training set. On both test datasets the most accurate individual method was NNSSP, then PHD, DSC and the least accurate was Predator; however, it was not possible to conclusively show a significant difference between the individual methods. Comparing the accuracy of the single methods with that obtained by combing predictions it was found that it was better to use a combination of predictions. On both test datasets it was possible to obtain a similar to 3% improvement in accuracy by combing predictions. In most cases the combined methods were statistically significantly better (at P = 0.05 on the CASP3 test set, and P = 0.01 on the EBI test set). On the CASP3 test dataset there was no significant difference in accuracy between any of the combined method of prediction: on the EBI test dataset, linear discrimination and neural networks significantly outperformed voting techniques. We conclude that it is better to combine predictions.

Existing systems that employ this approach are anomaly detectors, meaning that they model a program's normal behavior and signal deviations from that behavior. Unfortunately, many program-based exploits of NT systems use specialized malicious executables. Anomaly detection systems cannot deal with such programs because there is no standard of "normalcy" that they deviate from. This paper is a preliminary report on an attempt to remedy that situation. We report on a prototype system that learns to identify specific program behaviors. Though the goal is to identify malicious behavior, in this paper we report on experiments seeking to identify the behavior of the web-browser, since we did not have enough exemplars of malicious behavior to use as training data. Using automatically generated finite automata, we search for features in execution traces that allow us to distinguish browsers from other programs. In our experiments, we find that this technique does, in fact, allow us to distinguish traces Internet Explorer from traces of programs that are not web browsers, after training with Netscape and a different set of non-browsers.

One effective way to detect intrusive activity before system damage is perpetrated is to detect misuse of privileged programs in real-time. In this paper, we describe three machine learning algorithms that learn the normal behavior of programs running on the Solaris platform in order to detect unusual uses or misuses of these programs. The performance of the three algorithms has been evaluated by an independent laboratory in an off-line controlled evaluation against a set of computer intrusions and normal usage to determine rates of correct detection and false alarms. A real-time system has since been developed that will enable deployment of a program-based intrusion detection system in a real installation.

One of the difficulties with learning about tasks requiring planning is the utility problem: as more knowledge is acquired by the learner, the utilisation of that knowledge takes on a complexity which overwhelms the mechanisms of the original task. This problem does not, however, occur with human learners: on the contrary, it is usually the case that, the more knowledgeable the learner, the greater the efficiency and accuracy in locating a solution. The reason for this lies in the types of knowledge acquired by the human learner and its organisation. We describe the basic representations which underlie the superior abilities of human experts, and describe algorithms fcr using equivalent representations in a machine learning architecture.

We have taken a step towards building such a tool by creating an automated analyst agent called ISAAC for post-hoc, off-line agent-team analysis, ISAAC's novelty stems from a key design constraint that arises in team analysis: multiple types of models of team behavior are necessary to analyze different granularities of team events, including agent actions, interactions, and global performance. These heterogeneous team models are automatically acquired via machine learning over teams' external behavior traces, where the specific learning techniques are tailored to the particular model learned. Additionally, ISAAC employs multiple presentation techniques that can aid human understanding of the analyses. This paper presents ISAAC's general conceptual framework, motivating its design, as well as its concrete application in the domain of RoboCup soccer. In the RoboCup domain, ISAAC was used prior to and during the RoboCup'99 tournament, and was awarded the RoboCup scientific challenge award.

The objects which must be manipulated are not well known in advance. Multifingered dexterous grippers are useful for grasping objects in uncertain environments. A fully enveloping grasp, also called a power grasp, is well suited for stable grasping in such unstructured environments. This paper describes the development of an adaptive power grasp planner. The system is based on a neural network which is trained on a variety of primitive shapes. When presented with a new object, the planner can generalize to achieve a secure grasp. Essential to the training of the neural network is the concept of grasp quality, which is determined from the convex hull of applied unit forces in wrench space. The mathematical framework and examples of grasp quality are presented, along with a description of the dexterous hand used for experimentation.

To achieve this goal, robots should learn from operators how and what to do considering hard- and software constraints. Various approaches modelling the man-machine skill transfer have been proposed. Systems following the Programming by Demonstration (PbD) paradigm that were developed within the last decade are getting closer to this goal. However, most of these systems lack the possibility for the user to supervise and influence the process of program generation after the initial demonstration was performed. In this paper a principle learning methodology is discussed, which allows to transfer human skills and to supervise the learning process including subsymbolic and symbolic task knowledge. Here, several existing approaches will be discussed and compared to each other. Moreover, a system approach is presented, integrating the overall process of skill transfer from a human to a robotic manipulation system. One major goal is to modify information gained by the demonstration in that way that different target systems are supported. The resulting PbD-system yields towards a hybrid learning approach in robotics to support natural programming based on human demonstrations and user advice.

Billions of nucleotides and millions of aminoacids are already filling the electronic files of the data bases presently available, which contain a tremendous amount of information on the most biologically relevant macromolecules, such as DNA, RNA and proteins. The most urgent problem originates from the need to single out the relevant information amidst a wealth of general features. Intelligent tools are therefore needed to optimise the search. Data mining for sequence analysis in biotechnology has been substantially aided by the development of new powerful methods borrowed from the machine learning approach. In this paper we discuss the application of artificial feedforward neural networks to deal with some fundamental problems tied with the folding process and the structure-function relationship in proteins.

This paper describes a new neural processing algorithm inspired by a deeper understanding of the workings of real, biological synapses. It is shown that a multi-time domain adaptation approach to encoding causal correlation solves the destructive interference problem encountered by more commonly used learning algorithms. It is also shown how this allows an agent to adapt to nonstationary environments in which longer-term changes in the statistical properties occur and are inherently unpredictable, yet not completely lose useful prior knowledge. Finally, it is suggested that the use of causal correlation coupled with value-based learning may provide pragmatic solutions to some other classical problems in machine learning.

The method assumes that each classifier stands in it's own context, and the contexts are partially ordered. The order is defined by monotonous quality function that maps each context to the value from the interval [0,1]. The classifier that has the context with better quality is supposed to predict better than the classifier from worse quality. The objective is to generate the opinion of 'virtual' classifier that stands in the context with quality equal to 1. This virtual classifier must have the best accuracy of predictions due to the best context. To do this we build the regression where each prediction is put with the weight, equal to quality evaluation of the context of the correspondent classifier. This regression will give us the best opinion in the point 1. Some experiments on the vowel recognition tasks showed validity of the approach.

Even the interaction between various components cannot be reduced to simple rules, as the complexities of realistic dynamic environments become unwieldy to characterize manually. To cope with these challenges, we propose an architecture for inter-layer learning where each layer is constructed with a higher level of complexity and control. Using RoboCup soccer as a testbed, we demonstrate the potential of this architecture for the development of effective, cooperative, multi-agent systems. At the lowest layer, individual basic skills are developed and refined in isolation through supervised and reinforcement learning techniques. The next layer uses machine learning to decide, at any point in time, which among a subset of the first layer tasks should be executed. This process is repeated for successive layers, thus providing higher levels of abstraction as new layers are added. The inter-layer learning architecture provides an explicit learning model for deciding individual and cooperative tactics in a dynamic environment and appears to be promising in real-time competition.

Conventional approaches to this task are based on Ideal Shortest Path routing Algorithm (ISPA), under which at each moment each agent in the network sends all of its traffic down the path that will incur the lowest cost to that traffic. We demonstrate in computer experiments that due to the side-effects of one agent's actions on another agent's traffic, use of ISPA's can result in large global cost. In particular, in a simulation of Braess' paradox we see that adding new capacity to a network with ISPA agents can decrease overall throughput. The theory of COllective INtelligence (COIN) design concerns precisely the issue of avoiding such side-effects. We use that theory to derive an idealized routing algorithm and show that a practical machine-learning-based version of this algorithm, in which costs are only imprecisely estimated substantially outperforms the ISPA, despite having access to less information than does the ISPA. In particular, this practical COIN algorithm avoids Braess' paradox.	NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA	Tumer, K (reprint author), NASA, Ames Res Ctr, Moffett Field, CA 94035 USA.

To accommodate a diverse range of users, many computer applications therefore include an interface that can be customized - e.g., by adjusting parameters, or defining macros. This allows each user to have his "own" version of the interface, honed to his specific preferences. However, most such interfaces require the user to perform this customization by hand - a tedious process that requires the user to be aware of his personal preferences. We are therefore exploring adaptive interfaces, that can autonomously determine the user's preference, and adjust the interface appropriately. This paper describes such an adaptive system-here a UNIX-shell that can predict the user's next command, and then use this prediction to simplify the user's future interactions. We present a relatively simple model here, then explore a variety of techniques to improve its accuracy, including a "mixture of experts" model. In a series of experiments, on real-world data, we demonstrate (1) that the simple system can correctly predict the user's next command almost 50% of the time, and can do so robustly - across a range of different users; and (2) that it is extremely difficult to further improve this result.

We therefore need a method that allows characters to learn. But simply adding traditional machine learning algorithms without considering the characters' own motivations and desires will break the illusion of life. Intentional characters require interactive learning. In this paper, we present the results of Sydney K9.0, a project based on the Synthetic Characters creature kernel framework. Inspired by pet training, we have implemented a character that can be trained using the "clicker training" technique. Clicker training utilizes the natural desires of an animal and employs operant conditioning procedures for shaping their behavior. The necessary plasticity of system interconnections shaped by associations and rewards that is required by clicker training was integrated into the creature kernel framework. The implemented system also includes a module named DogEar that is designed for collecting real-world acoustic data, such as human voice commands, integrated into the creature kernel's perception system. This provides a seamless interface between the simulated and real worlds. Detailed implementation and interaction results are presented.

The purpose of this architecture is to centralize the reasoning of an ITS into a single component to allow customization of teaching goals and to simplify improving the ITS. The first agent is responsible for learning a model of how students perform using the tutor in a variety of contexts. The second agent is provided this model of student behavior and a goal specifying the desired educational objective. Reinforcement learning is used by this agent to derive a teaching policy that meets the specified educational goal. Component evaluation studies show each agent performs adequately in isolation. We have also conducted an evaluation with actual students of the complete architecture. Results show ADVISOR was successful in learning a teaching policy that met the educational objective provided. Although this set of machine learning agents has been integrated with a specific intelligent tutor, the general technique could be applied to a broad class of ITS.

It was originally developed for squared loss. In recent years, several authors have proposed decompositions for zero-one loss, but each has significant shortcomings. In particular, all of these decompositions have only an intuitive relationship to the original squared-loss one. In this paper, we define bias and variance for an arbitrary loss function, and show that the resulting decomposition specializes to the standard one for the squared-loss case, and to a close relative of Kong and Dietterich's (1995) one for the zero-one case. The same decomposition also applies to variable misclassification costs. We show a number of interesting consequences of the unified definition. For example, Schapire et al.'s (1997) notion of "margin" can be expressed as a function of the zero-one bias and variance, making it possible to formally relate a classifier ensemble's generalization error to the base learner's bias and variance on training examples. Experiments with the unified definition lead to further insights.

For suitably regular domains, existing wrapper induction algorithms can efficiently learn wrappers that are simple and highly accurate, but the regularity bias of these algorithms makes them unsuitable for most conventional information extraction tasks. Boosting is a technique for improving the performance of a simple machine learning algorithm by repeatedly applying it to the training set with different example weightings. We describe an algorithm that learns simple, low-coverage wrapper-like extraction patterns, which we then apply to conventional information extraction problems using boosting. The result is BWI, a trainable information extraction system with a strong precision bias and Fl performance better than state-of-the-art techniques in many domains.

Unfortunately, such measures are often expensive or impossible to obtain. Herein, we propose a machine-learning approach to recognizing end-user transactions consisting of sequences of remote procedure calls (RPCs) received at a server. Two problems are addressed. The first problem is labeling an RPC sequence that corresponds to one transaction instance with the correct transaction type. This is akin to text classification. The second problem is transaction recognition, a more comprehensive task that involves segmenting RPC sequences into transaction instances and labeling those instances with transaction types. This problem is similar to segmenting sounds into words as in speech understanding. Using Naive Bayes approach, we tackle the labeling problem with four combinations of feature vectors and probability distributions: RPC occurrences with the Bernoulli distribution and RPC counts with the multinomial, geometric, and shifted geometric distributions. Our approach to transaction recognition uses a dynamic-programming Viterbi algorithm that searches for a most likely segmentation of an RPC sequence into a sequence of transactions, assuming transaction independence and using our classifiers to select a most likely transaction label for a given RPC sequence. For both problems, good accuracies are obtained, although the labeling problem achieves higher accuracies (up to 87%) than does transaction recognition (64%).

Disjuncts that correctly classify few training examples are known as small disjuncts and are interesting to machine learning researchers because they have a much higher error rate than large disjuncts. Previous research has investigated this phenomenon by performing ad hoc analyses of a small number of datasets. In this paper we present a quantitative measure for evaluating the effect of small disjuncts on learning and use it to analyze 30 benchmark datasets. We investigate the relationship between small disjuncts and pruning, training set size and noise, and come up with several interesting results.

In contrast to conventional Darwinian-type evolutionary computation algorithms that use various forms of mutation and/or recombination operators, LEM employs machine learning to guide the process of generating new individuals. A system, ISHED1, based on LEM, automatically searches for the highest capacity heat exchangers under given technical and environmental constraints. The results of experiments have been highly promising, often producing solutions exceeding the best human designs.

The recent incorporation of ideas from many areas of AI, including planning, probabilistic modeling, machine learning, and knowledge representation) have made these models much more widely applicable. I briefly survey recent advances within AI in the use of fully-and partially-observable MDPs as a modeling tool, and the development of computationally-manageable solution methods. I will place special emphasis on factored problem representations such as Bayesian networks and algorithms that exploit the structure inherent in these representations.

This is particularly true for reusable class libraries since the user interface must be preserved for version compatibility Thus, the symptomatic detection of potential instabilities during the design phase of such libraries may help avoid later problems. This paper introduces a fuzzy logic-based approach for evaluating the stability of a reusable class library interface. using structural metrics as stability indicators. To evaluate this new approach, we conducted a preliminary study on a set of commercial C++ class libraries. The obtained results are very promising when compared to those of two classical machine learning approaches, Top Down Induction of Decision Trees and Bayesian classifiers.

Unfortunately despite extensive research over more than 30 years, this remains a significant problem for many practitioners. A major obstacle is the absence of reliable and systematic historic data, yet this is a sine qua non far almost all proposed methods: statistical, machine learning or calibration of existing models. In this paper we describe our sparse data method (SDM) based upon a pairwise comparison technique and Saaty's Analytic Hierarchy Process. Our minimum data requirement is a single known point. The technique is supported by a software tool known as DataSalvage. We show, for data from two companies, how our approach - based upon expert judgement - adds value to expert judgement by producing significantly more accurate and less biased results. A sensitivity analysis shows that our approach is robust to pairwise comparison errors. We then describe the results of a small usability trial with a practising project manager. From this empirical work we conclude that the technique is promising and may help overcome some of the present barriers to effective project prediction.

However, it does not need to be positioned this way, and in the liberal arts curriculum in particular, there are advantages to offering this course to undergraduate students. An undergraduate course in machine learning is easily and naturally structured to introduce research concepts and to work within a research paradigm. It also introduces the use of statistics, reflected both in the machine learning systems studied and in the experimental methodology. Furthermore, it allows for an interdisciplinary perspective, as students can be encouraged to work on problems from other departments in the college. This paper describes the benefits of offering such a course and outlines a course structure and resources for doing so.

A critical issue in case-based reasoning is to select the correct and enough features to represent a case. For this reason, the analysis of cases and extraction the necessary features to represent a case are highly recommended in building a CBR system. However, this task is difficult to carry out since such knowledge often cannot be successfully and exhaustively captured and represented. In this paper, a framework of features mining system for the case-based reasoning including two phases has been proposed. The techniques of features selection, data analysis and machine learning can thus be effectively integrated. This will promote flexibility and expandability of case-based reasoning system.

By quantifying the frustration as the human manipulates the machines from the biomedical signal and making it to be teaching signals of machine leaning (ML), we aim at the development of the system in which the machine adapts to the human. In this paper, we extract the characteristic vector whether the examinee is discomfort or not-discomfort from electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG). The artificial neural network (ANN) is employed to extract the vector. For the machine learning, reinforcement learning will be used and their rewards are extracted signal from physiological signals. As a basic experiment for extracting discomfort and not-discomfort from the physiological signals, the EEG measurement experiment was carried out under unpleasant sound environment for 20 examinees. The input signals to ANN for the characteristic vector extraction was examined By affixing the piezoelectric films on the eyebrow, the movement of the eyebrow was measured Finally, the results of measuring EEG and EMG simultaneously under the situation in which the frustration accumulated for the examinee is shown We will be used for the rewards of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to control the behavior of the Khepera robot.

Consequently, the multi-parameter combination mind-evolutionary-based machine learning (MPCMEBML) is established. MPCMEBML can solve efficiently the searching problem of multi-dimension parameter space. In MDPMEML, the whole parameter space is separated and combined into several sub parameter spaces and the global billboard is endowed the interactive function. Not every single group searches the whole parameter spaces. Information exchange will supplement the insufficient knowledge that not every group can get by itself. The new fuzzy logic controller is constructed by using MPCMEBML. Simulation results show that MPCMEBML is possessed of strong ability of searching in the multi-dimension parameter space and the new FLC has good performance.

It aims to adapt an agent to a given environment with a clue to a reward. In general, the purpose of reinforcement learning system is to acquire an optimum policy that can maximize expected reward per an action. However, it is not always important for any environment. Especially, if we apply reinforcement learning system to engineering, we expect the agent to avoid all penalties. In Markov Decision Processes, we call a rule penalty if and only if it has a penalty or if can transit to a penalty state where it does not contribute to get any reward. After suppressing all penalty rules, we aim to make a rational policy whose expected reward per an action is larger than zero. In this paper, we propose the Penalty Avoiding Rational Policy Making algorithm that can suppress any penalty as stable as possible and get a reward constantly. By applying the algorithm to the tick-tack-toe, its effectiveness is shown.

To take self-organization simulation model as the basic complex system theory to analyze the complex interactive mode inside the decision supporting problems, firstly, the paper briefly introduced machine learning based decision learning strategy, which could automatically lead to the differentiation of different decision rules. Then, for only learning strategy could hardly discover the best solutions in quite large problem space, evolutionary algorithm (EA) is imported and designed to help the decision rule discovery procedure. As has been found of great difficulty to combine EA into rear decision scenario in enterprise life, this paper has put forward an integration simulation model and corresponding algorithm structures which result in satisfying outcomes.

An agent used the reinforcement learning can obtain purposive behavior autonomically. However, there are problems that reinforcement learning takes a long time because it advances while repeating trial-and-error, and an acquired action is not necessarily optimal. In this paper, we propose reinforcement learning using state transition rates, and compare it with hitherto method. As a result, our method shows the capability of learning purposive behavior efficiently.

Inside of which, self-organization principle is deeply investigated to explain the secret of complexity form. In the paper, firstly, a three-layer based self-organization simulation framework is introduced, which could be regarded as the basic idea to simulate the system self-organization behavior. Then, a whole self-organization simulation model is introduced in detail, which is enlightened from both machine learning and evolutionary algorithms in AI area. Further more, to take an application view A prototype system, named "SOS-PS" (Self-Organization Simulation in Partnership Selection) is put forward. Using the given self-organization simulation model, the prototype system could help give valuable decision supports to the complex partnership selection problems in virtual enterprise life.

The two models reflect short term and middle-long term trends of economic series respectively. The prediction system with double models can solve the problems of overfit or underfit that may take in prediction systems with single model. MEBML (mind-evolution-based machine learning) is a new method of evolution computation that was proposed by the authors of this paper recently. MEBML is better in convergence performance and computational efficiency than genetic algorithms. The prediction system using MEBML can determine the forms, the orders and optimum parameters of the models, compared with other methods.

After discussing the rationale behind this choice, we describe the structural character shape representation adopted and the coding scheme for transforming such a two dimensional representation into a vector-based one, especially suitable for genetic programming. Then, the basic principles according to which the approach has been designed are presented, together with the genotype's structure, the fitness function and the genetic operators devised to deal with the problem at hand. The results of a preliminary experiment performed on a standard database of handwritten characters are eventually reported.

The process of a classical optical character recognition system consists of a series of stages, such as format analysis, text segmentation, feature extraction and classification. This paper will. focus on the last two stages, and two contributions can be claimed: First, Rapid transformed stroke density features (SDF) are used for preliminary classification and outline primitive structural features for final classification. Second, the original extension matrix algorithm is improved by heuristic path searching on the basis of information entropy as well as Laplace error rate evaluation function. Our experimental results prove that the Rapid Transformed SDFs are insensitive to image translation or rotation, and that the improved extension matrix algorithm outperform other inductive approaches based on AE1 and AQ15. The excellent performance with respect to a large data set also indicates our proposed approach is effective and efficient. Taking into consideration of both the image and structural information, our proposed approach is able to solve the problem of noise which unavoidably exists in the practical case of handwritten Chinese character recognition. However, on account of great distortion and connection of strokes in low-constrained handwritten Chinese character recognition, we consider that it is necessary to incorporate the context-based post processing into character recognition so that the system will suit for practical use.

The complexity of many real world systems has lead to sophisticated modelling approaches, where both the accuracy and readability of the models are of great importance. Fuzzy modelling is such an approach, which uses well-established machine learning techniques, producing models with the capacity of integrating expert knowledge with real world observations. The behaviour of these models is described as a series of linguistic rules. The readability of the models is related to the number of rules used to describe the system. In order to define methodologies for organising the information describing a system, it is important to define metrics for the relative importance of a set of rules in the description of a given region of the input/output space. This paper addresses this problem, and a new concept is proposed: the relevance of a set of rules. The concept is defined by a set of intuitive axioms, leading to a set of properties that any function of relevance must obey. In order to corroborate the validity of the new concept, a new methodology is presented. It has been called SLIM (Separation of Linguistic Information Methodology). It is useful for organising the information in a fuzzy system: a system f(x) is organised as a set of n fuzzy systems f(1)(x), f(2)(x), ..., f(n)(x). Each of these systems may contain information related with particular aspects of the system f(x). The application of the SLIM methodology in a hierarchical structure is described. The structure, HPS (Hierarchical Prioritised Structure), has been first proposed by Yager [1,2,3]. SLIM is used to organise the information in the various layers of the structure. It is also possible to reduce the number of rules representing the original system by discarding rules with lower relevance values. In order to corroborate the proposed concepts, experimental results are presented for the fuzzy identification of a surface with the form of a volcano. The description of this surface by a fuzzy rules system, using a nearest neighbourhood identification method, produces a system containing a high number of rules (400 rules). With the new approach, the surface can be described with only 51 fuzzy rules, in a hierarchical structure. The new system, with three rules, is obtained using SLIM from the initial system with 400 fuzzy rules, without significant loss of information content. To further corroborate the usefulness of the concept of relevance, experiments have been conduced in the identification of environmental variables in a agricultural greenhouse (temperature and humidity). The results of using SLIM in the "organisation" of the identification system are briefly described. A summary of the critical analysis of these results is also presented. They indicate, once more, the validity of the concept.

In contrast to qualitative reasoning, we do not use discrete symbolic models. Instead, relations between pairs of objects are represented by parameterized homogeneous transformation matrices with numerical constraints. A textual description of a spatial scene is transformed into a graph with objects and annotated local reference systems as nodes and relations as arcs. Inference is realized by multiplication of transformation matrices, constraint propagation and verification. Constraints consisting of equations and inequations containing trigonometric functions can be solved using machine learning techniques. By assigning values to the parameters and using heuristics for the placement of objects, a visualization of the described spatial layout can be generated from the graph.

Human performance is modeled by CLARET, a machine learning and matching system, based on inductive logic programming and graph matching principles. The model is applied to data of a learning experiment addressing the role of prior experience in the ontogenesis of mental object representations. Prior experience was varied in terms of sensory modality, i.e. visual versus haptic versus visuohaptic. The analysis revealed distinct differences between the representational formats used by subjects with haptic versus those with no prior object experience. These differences suggest that prior haptic exploration stimulates the evolution of object representations which are characterized by an increased differentiation between attribute values and a pronounced structural encoding.

We provide a brief overview of MML inductive inference (Wallace C.S. and Boulton D.M. 1968. Computer Journal, 11: 185-194; Wallace C.S. and Freeman P.R. 1987. J. Royal Statistical Society (Series B), 49: 240-252; Wallace C.S. and Dowe D.L. (1999). Computer Journal), and how it has both an information-theoretic and a Bayesian interpretation. We then outline how MML is used for statistical parameter estimation, and how the MML mixture modelling program, Snob (Wallace C.S. and Boulton D.M. 1968. Computer Journal, 11: 185-194; Wallace C.S. 1986.

(Eds.), Proc. 7th Australian Joint Conf. on Artif. Intelligence. World Scientific, Singapore, pp. 37-44. See http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/-dld/Snob.html) uses the message lengths from various parameter estimates to enable it to combine parameter estimation with selection of the number of components and estimation of the relative abundances of the components. The message length is (to within a constant) the logarithm of the posterior probability (not a posterior density) of the theory. So, the MML theory can also be regarded as the theory with the highest posterior probability. Snob currently assumes that variables are uncorrelated within each component, and permits multi-variate data from Gaussian, discrete multi-category (or multi-state or multinomial), Poisson and von Mises circular distributions, as well as missing data. Additionally, Snob can do fully-parameterised mixture modelling, estimating the latent class assignments in addition to estimating the number of components, the relative abundances of the parameters and the component parameters. We also report on extensions of Snob for data which has sequential or spatial correlations between observations, or correlations between attributes.

In our approach, based on performance, visual features and classifiers are selected automatically. In earlier work, we presented the Visual Apprentice, in which users can define visual object models via a multiple-level object definition hierarchy (region, perceptual-area, object-part, and object). Visual Object Detectors are learned, using various learning algorithms- as the user provides examples from images or video, visual features are extracted and multiple classifiers ate learned for each node of the hierarchy. In this paper, features and classifiers are selected automatically at each node, depending on their performance over the training set provided by the user. Thus, changes in the training data yield dynamic changes in the features and classifiers used. We introduce the concept of Recurrent Visual Semantics and show how it can be used to identify domains in which performance-based learning techniques such as the one presented can be applied. We then show experimental results in detecting Baseball video shots, images that contain handshakes, and images that contain skies. These results demonstrate the importance, feasibility, and usefulness of dynamic feature/classifier selection far classification of visual information, and the performance benefits of using multiple learning algorithms to build classifiers. Based on our experiments, we also discuss some of the issues that arise when applying learning techniques in real-world content-based applications.

This approach considers sentences as tree-like structures and decides on the prosody from a corpus of such structures using machine learning techniques. The prediction is achieved from the prosody of the closest sentence of the corpus through tree similarity measurements in a nearest neighbour context. We introduce a syntactic structure and a performance structure representation, the tree similarity metrics considered, and then we discuss the prediction method. Experiments are currently under process to qualify this approach.

This simple representation of knowledge the concept maps - is widely accepted as a promising device for helping in complex tasks such as planning and learning. Moreover, several psychologists (mainly from the constructivist stream) argue that the use of concept maps in teaching can bring relevant improvements in students. Nevertheless, as far as we know, these tools for interactive construction of concept map diagrams have a passive role in the sense that their main concerns rely upon interface and generality. If a Machine Learning based module was added to such frameworks, the computer could have an active role in participating in the concept map construction. This paper presents Clouds, a module that uses Inductive Learning methods to help a user build her own concept maps. It uses each new entry on the map as an input for the learning algorithms, which can be used later for suggesting new concepts and relations.

J	Billsus, D; Pazzani, MJ				Billsus, D; Pazzani, MJ			User modeling for adaptive news access	USER MODELING AND USER-ADAPTED INTERACTION			English	Article						user modeling; machine learning; information retrieval; intelligent agents; recommender systems		We present a framework for adaptive news access, based on machine learning techniques specifically designed for this task. First, we focus on the system's general functionality and system architecture. We then describe the interface and design of two deployed news agents that are part of the described architecture. While the first agent provides personalized news through a web-based interface, the second system is geared towards wireless information devices such as PDAs (personal digital assistants) and cell phones. Based on implicit and explicit user feedback, our agents use a machine learning algorithm to induce individual user models. Motivated by general shortcomings of other user modeling systems for Information Retrieval applications, as well as the specific requirements of news classification, we propose the induction of hybrid user models that consist of separate models for short-term and long-term interests. Furthermore, we illustrate how the described algorithm can be used to address an important issue that has thus far received little attention in the Information Retrieval community: a user's information need changes as a direct result of interaction with information. We empirically evaluate the system's performance based on data collected from regular system users. The goal of the evaluation is not only to understand the performance contributions of the algorithm's individual components, but also to assess the overall utility of the proposed user modeling techniques from a user perspective. Our results provide empirical evidence for the utility of the hybrid user model, and suggest that effective personalization can be achieved without requiring any extra effort from the user.

Even very advanced low-level image processing can not give any advantages without a highly effective knowledge-representation and reasoning system that is the solution of image understanding problem. Methods of image analysis and coding are directly based on the methods of knowledge representation and processing. Article suggests such models and mechanisms in form of Spatial Turing Machine that in place of symbols and tapes works with hierarchical networks represented dually as discrete and continuous structures, Such networks are able to perform both graph and diagrammatic operations being the basis of intelligence. Computational intelligence methods provide transformation of continuous image information into the discrete structures, making it available for analysis. Article shows that symbols naturally emerge in such networks, giving opportunity to use symbolic operations. Such framework naturally combines methods of machine learning, classification and analogy with induction, deduction and other methods of higher level reasoning. Based on these principles image understanding system provides more flexible ways of handling with ambiguity and uncertainty in the real images and does not require supercomputers. That opens way to new technologies in the computer vision and image databases.								BEZDEK JC, 1992, FUZZY MODELS PATTERN; BURNOD Y, 1988, ADAPTIVE NEURAL NETW; Calvin W.

In this study, a new method is proposed in which data mining procedure is accomplished by the walkthrough of a business expert in the artificial space of preprocessed data. The features of this new method are the coupling of visualization and analytical procedure in data mining process, using the knowledge of the business expert as the heuristics of the data mining algorithm, and using artificial 3-dimensional immersive data space in which the business expert can exist, investigate, and manipulate data. The artificial immersive data space is generated by the techniques in virtual reality.

Self-organizing maps (SOMs) can be used to map large data sets to a simpler usually two-dimensional, topological structure. This mapping is able to illustrate dependencies in the data in a very intuitive manner and allows fast location of clusters. However because of the black-box design of neural networks, it is difficult to get qualitative descriptions of the data. In our approach, we identify regions of interest in SOMs by using unsupervised clustering methods. Then we apply inductive learning methods to find fuzzy descriptions of these clusters. Through the combination of these methods, it is possible to use supervised machine learning methods to find simple and accurate linguistic descriptions of previously unknown clusters in the data.

In this paper we suggest a technique that searches for a strategic splitting of the feature space identifying the best subsets of features for each instance. Our technique is based on the wrapper approach where a classification algorithm is used as the evaluation function to differentiate between several feature subsets. We apply the recently developed technique for dynamic integration of classifiers and use decision trees. For each test instance we consider only those feature combinations that include features present in the path taken by the test instance in the decision tree. We evaluate our technique on medical datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. The experiments show that the local feature selection is often advantageous in comparison with feature selection on the whole space.

It was introduced for the mean square error in [3]. The bias/variance decomposition includes the concept of the average predictor. The bias is the error of the average predictor, and the systematic part of the generalization error, while the variability around the average predictor is the variance. We present a large group of error functions with the same desirable properties as the bias/variance decomposition in [3]. The error functions are derived from the exponential family of distributions via the statistical deviance measure. We prove that this family of error functions contains all error functions decomposable in that manner. We stare the connection between the bias/variance decomposition and the ambiguity decomposition [7] and present a useful approximation of ambiguity that is quadratic in the ensemble coefficients.

In particular we consider how both Recursive Modular Neural Networks(RMNN) and Hidden Markov Models(HMM) can provide reasonably robust models for such tasks. Finally, we investigate how well they can predict human performance and so provide a reasonable basis for the development of more efficient and reliable human-machine annotation systems. Examples in sketching and cartography are discussed.

A systematic segmentation. :.: method using (epsilon (H), epsilon (C))-CCS is also presented in the paper. The similarity of pixels is measured in the IHC (Intensity, Hue and Chroma) color space, which was proposed by the authors of this paper recently, and the similar pixels in a given image are grouped into (epsilon (H), epsilon (C))-CCS. Experiment results demonstrate that color images can be effectively segmented in accordance with the perception of human using the definition of (epsilon (H), epsilon (C))-CCS and the systematic method. A hybrid system composed of MEBML (Mind-Evolution-Based Machine Learning) and MLCNN (Maximum likelihood Clustering Neural Network) is used to cluster features of small windows of an image. The hybrid system has good performances on clustering and makes the color images segmentation algorithm efficient.

A general model for multimodal information retrieval is proposed by which a user's information need is expressed through composite, multimodal queries, and the most appropriate weighted combination of indexing techniques is determined by a machine learning approach in order to best satisfy the information need.

A representative set of system operating states are classified as transiently stable or unstable by the Extended Equal Area Criterion (EEAC) for fast evaluation of transient stability and used as a training set for the decision tree, which outputs a set of classification rules. Security control is achieved by selecting optimal control actions to change the current, insecure state into a state within a secure region, without violating the acquired security rules. The technique is demonstrated on the 39 bus New England test system.

The technique employs a machine learning method. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), for synthesizing first order logic formulas that describe the valid operations of a program from the normal runs of the program. ILP, backed by theories and techniques extended from computational logic, allows the use of complex domain-specific background knowledge in the learning process to produce sound and consistent knowledge. A specification induction engine has been developed by extending and existing ILP tool and has been used to construct specifications for several (> 10) privileged programs in Unix. Coupling with rich background knowledge in systems and security, the prototype induction engine generates human understandable and analyzable specifications that are as good as those specified by a human. Preliminary experiments with existing attacks show that the generated specifications are highly effective in detecting attacks that subvert privileged programs to gain unauthorized accesses to resources.

A modular neural network architecture is adapted for encoding our usual notion of a perceptually important region in such a way that generalization of this knowledge to previously unseen images is possible. Specifically, users are allowed to specify examples of perceptually significant regions in images, which are then incorporated as training data for the network. An important characteristic of this approach is its provision for grouping distinct regions into a single perceptually significant area through the previous user guidance, unlike conventional segmentation approaches which partition the image into homogeneous regions without further specifying the relationship between these regions.

The procedure is capable of accurately evaluating head orientations over a complete 360 degree interval and has been designed to function as part of an existing real-time, multi-talker tracking system. By relying on a facial criterion that is easily extracted from video images acquired across a range of lighting and zooming conditions, the estimator is designed to be effective in practical situations such as those encountered in video conferencing or surveillance scenarios.

Research to extract maximum benefit from the Internet is still in its infancy. Different research areas like data mining, information retrieval, machine learning and knowledge discovery, are giving the problem due attention and all seem to converge onto a common theme - wrappers. Wrappers provide access to heterogeneous information sources by converting: or translating queries into source specific queries or commands. We discuss improvements on a distinctive approach, wrapper conduction, to automatically generate a wrapper once an information source has been identified. We will show how different information filtering systems we developed employ numerous Internet information sources in an attempt to exploit this knowledge base by automatically wrapping the source to safeguard the evolvability of the same system once new sources become available on the WWW. We examine and compare the performance these systems achieved when employing wrapper-conducted queries in contrast to tailored hand-coded ones; comparative results are presented.

We have developed, within a machine learning framework, two classes of multiresolution models for integrating scale information for object detection and classification - a discriminative model called the hierarchical pyramid neural network (HPNN) and a generative model called a hierarchical image probability (HIP) model. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, we show that these models can significantly, reduce the false positive rates for a well-established computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system.

In this paper, we report results from using machine learning to train and test a nominal-expression generator on a set of 393 nominal descriptions from the COCONUT corpus of task-oriented design dialogues. Results show that we can achieve a 50% match to human performance as opposed to a 16% baseline for just guessing the most frequent type of nominal expression in the COCONUT corpus. To our surprise our results indicate that many of the central features of previously proposed selection models did not improve the performance of the learned nominal-expression generator.

In this paper we apply this idea to the recognition of noun phrases. We generate different classifiers by using different representations of the data. By combining the results with voting techniques described in (Van Halteren et al., 1998) we manage to improve the best reported performances on standard data sets for base noun phrases and arbitrary noun phrases.

How can one apply standard machine learning algorithms? We describe the Parallel Problems Server (PPServer) and MATLAB*P. In tandem they allow users of networked computers to work transparently on large data sets from within Matlab. This work is motivated by the desire to bring the many benefits of scientific computing algorithms and computational power to machine learning researchers. We demonstrate the usefulness of the system on a number of tasks. For example, we perform independent components analysis on very large text corpora consisting of tens of thousands of documents, making minimal changes to the original Bell and Sejnowski Matlab source (Bell and Sejnowski, 1995). Applying ML techniques to data previously beyond their reach leads to interesting analyses of both data and algorithms.

The methods used were k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines. The data sets were used to train the algorithms on the following tasks: to distinguish common nevi from dysplastic nevi and melanoma, and to distinguish melanoma from common nevi and dysplastic nevi. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to summarize the performance of the models. Three of the methods (logistic regression, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines) achieved very good results (area under curve values about 0.96) on the problem of distinguishing melanoma from common and dysplastic nevi, and good results (area under curve values about 0.82) for the problem of distinguishing common nevi from dysplastic nevi and melanoma. The performance of k-nearest neighbors models was about 3 percentage points worse than that of the other methods. These results show that for classification problems in the domain of pigmented skin lesions, excellent results can be achieved with several algorithms.

In order to extract the vector artificial neural networks (ANNs) are adopted. The extracted vector will be used for training signals which is necessary to Machine Learning (ML). As a fundamental research we make an experiment - to measure EEG for 20 examinees under the situation of comfort and discomfort about sounds. At first we confirm the characteristic of EEG per examinee with frequency analysis. Then we show the results of the recognition from not-discomfort to discomfort by adapting ANNs.

These methods can be used in the manufacturing stage to determine whether components pass or fail given their parameters. The current practice in the industry fails a component if any one of its parameters is out of specification range. Because the performance of the storage system is determined by the combination of multiple component parameters, the current method inevitably eliminates components that in fact have adequate performance. The k-nearest neighbor and neural network classifiers implemented in this paper tackle this problem by using multiple parameters as inputs. The performance of the KNN and neural network classifiers are tested using the training samples and test samples obtained from the numerical simulation of the disk drive level bit error rate performance. Our results show that the MLP classification has better performance than the KNN algorithm and is a viable method for evaluation of storage device components to improve yield.

The Information Research Intelligent Assistant (IRIA) addresses this problem by acting as an autonomous assistant to a user, unobtrusively building a map of accessible relevant information and using it to enable users to find information quickly. To do so, IRIA applies experience-based agency, a cognitive science approach to managing information access in large databases, to information search. In empirical tests, IRIA demonstrated the ability to monitor both user and workgroup web searches to preactively find and recommend relevant information.

Testing can be costly in terms of both time and required resources. Market pressures are for more functionality to be delivered in a shorter timeframe. Testing is an obvious target for compression since it requires so much of the development lifecycle. This paper presents an evolutionary development in the testing process that has revolutionary results. Automation offers many advantages including a shorter development lifecycle and reduced costs. The main disadvantage is that the live experimental approach to testing is lost. This paper also introduces how this is being addressed using data mining and machine learning techniques.

Two of the four predictive models are based on machine learning techniques - neural networks and decision trees, while the third and fourth are statistical approaches -- multiple discriminant analysis and logistic regression. Three different feature selection methods ANOVA, principal component, and computation plus human judgement are used for prediction. From our empirical study, we found, as far as the total accuracy is concerned, the machine learning methods - neural networks and decision trees performed best. For feature selection, we found computation and human judgement feature selection, with just 3 variables, gave the best result on average. If we also take into account failed prediction accuracy, time consumption and easy of use, then discriminant analysis is a very competitive model in the prediction of corporate failure.

Finally we extract the characteristic vector from the physiological signals which will be used for the rewards of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to control the behavior of the Khepera robot.

No detailed grading specifications exist and they are graded based on the experience of the growers (experts). The requirements of consumers are three or four steps removed in the value chain. The objective of this research has been to develop a quantitative set of descriptors which describe the quality grading criteria actually used by the graders, and to develop a similar set of criteria for the consumer. These two sets of descriptors were then compared to determine the differences in the two interpretations of quality. Generally the consumers are classifing solely on visual attributes. There was disagreement between the consumer and the grower that suggested that the grower has adopted a quality profile which considerably exceeds that expected by the consumer group studied here. The Machine Learning technique has been shown to produce a useful set of quality characterisation models for consumers. These have easily interpretable decision trees which are built on the objective attributes measured. The techniques help to provide an insight into the complex decisions made by consumers considering the purchase of mushrooms.

J	Wilbur, WJ				Wilbur, WJ			Boosting nai ve Bayesian learning on a large subset of MEDLINE (R)	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Symposium of the American-Medical-Informatics-Association	NOV 04-08, 2000	LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA	Amer Med Informat Assoc				We are concerned with the rating of new documents that appear in a large database (MEDLINE) and are candidates for inclusion in a small specialty database (REBASE (R). The requirement is to rank the new documents as nearly in order of decreasing potential to be added to the smaller database as possible, so as to improve the coverage of the smaller database without increasing the effort of those who manage this specialty database. To perform this ranking task we have considered several machine learning approaches based on the not ve Bayesian algorithm. We find that adaptive boosting outperforms nai ve Bayes, but that a new form of boosting which we term staged Bayesian retrieval outperforms adaptive boosting. Staged Bayesian retrieval involves two stages of Bayesian retrieval and we further end that if the second stage is replaced by a support vector machine we again obtain a significant improvement over the strictly Bayesian approach.

One of the most promising techniques is Reinforcement Learning. This paper presents the MCOE system, a learning environment for teaching Ecology to children, describing one of its limitations: the low flexibility on the generation of simulated situations for the students. We propose modifications on its architecture to make it more dynamic and adaptable through the generation of a wider set of natural and adaptation-like effects. Instead of building a complex, more deliberative solution, we propose solving the problem using a decentralized and more reactive solution by using reinforcement learning concepts, while keeping the simplicity of the architecture, an important feature in systems designed for small school applications.

While the experimental literature on text categorization emphasizes effectiveness comparisons, we list a variety of other characteristics of learning approaches that are equally important to consider. Research on machine learning for text categorization, already advancing at a rapid pace, could be further accelerated if better test collections were available.

The algorithm projects the raw sensor-observed signals into perceptually appropriate feature spaces. Lexicon and grammar are respectively represented in stochastic form in the feature space and in the possible grammar parameter space. Their learning is based on the association between speech and perceptual information. The syntactic structure is inferred from the conceptual structure obtained by analyzing the conceptual patterns in the perceptual information. The grammar is generalized according to the similarity of concept distributions in the feature space. The algorithm is robust against noise, ambiguity, and sparseness in the learning data because it uses statistical learning, such as Bayesian learning As a whole, cross-situational learning is implemented in a statistical way. The implemented algorithm includes the processes of the speech recognition and the analysis of graphical scenes containing stationary or moving objects. A preliminary experiment is also described here.

Texture segmentation using six features based on the fractal dimension has been used elsewhere. This paper studies properties of these features from the point of view of dimensionality reduction, mutual relation, differential relevance, discrete quantization, and classification ability. In an experimental framework, a set of statistical, soft computing, data mining and machine learning methods were used on a set different textures (multidimensional scaling, rough sets, factor analysis, cluster analysis and inductive classification). It was found that fractal features effectively have texture recognition ability. Some of these are very relevant (the fractal dimension of smoothed versions of the original image and the multi-fractal dimension). Not so many quantization levels of fractal dimension variables are required in order to achieve high recognition performance.

We have discovered prosodic features which more accurately predict when a recognition hypothesis contains a word error than the acoustic confidence score thresholds traditionally used in automatic speech recognition. We present analytic results indicating that there are significant prosodic differences between correctly and incorrectly recognized turns in the TOOT train information corpus. We then present machine learning results showing how the use of prosodic features to automatically predict correct versus incorrectly recognized turns improves over the use of acoustic confidence scores alone.

Such interactions are social in the sense that they depend on socially-agreed market regulations and communication protocols, and are collective in the sense that global market dynamics depend on the interactions of groups of traders. Moreover, the tools and techniques of adaptive behavior research could be profitably employed to build predictive models of existing or planned market systems. Despite these potential applications, we note that there is a near-total absence of papers in the adaptive behavior literature that deal with autonomous agents capable of exhibiting trading behaviors. We summarize work in experimental economics where human trading behavior is studied under laboratory conditions. We propose that such experiments could and should be used as 'benchmarks' for evaluating and comparing different architectures and strategies For trading animals. We present results From experiments where an elementary machine learning technique endows simple autonomous-software agents with the capability co adapt while interacting via price-bargaining in market environments. The environments are based on artificial retail markets used in experimental economics research. We demonstrate that groups of simple agents can exhibit human-like collective market behaviors. These results invite a Braitenberg-style eliminative materialism perspective on the dynamics of experimental retail markets.

This paper presents an information theoretic approach for extracting knowledge from databases in the form of inductive rules using Hellinger measure, an entropy function which is utilized as a criteria for selecting rules generated fi om databases. In order to reduce the complexity of rule generation, the characteristics of Hellinger measure ale analyzed and used to prune the search space of hypothesis. The system is implemented and tested on some well-known machine-learning databases.

A consensus prediction constructed from the output of several methods should yield more reliable results than each of the individual methods. Method: We present an approach that reveals subtle but systematic differences in the output of different secondary structure prediction methods allowing the derivation of coherent consensus predictions. The method uses a machine learning technique that builds decision trees from existing data. Results: The first results of our analysis show that consensus prediction of protein secondary structure may be improved both quantitatively and qualitatively.

J	Ishibuchi, H; Nakashima, T				Ishibuchi, H; Nakashima, T			Improving the performance of fuzzy classifier systems for pattern classification problems with continuous attributes	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						fuzzy systems; genetic algorithms; machine learning; pattern classification; rule generation	NEURAL NETWORKS; RULES	In this paper, various methods are introduced for improving the ability of fuzzy classifier systems to automatically generate fuzzy if-then rules for pattern classification problems with continuous attributes. First, we describe a simple fuzzy classifier system where a randomly generated initial population of fuzzy if-then rules Is evolved by typical genetic operations, such as selection, crossover, and mutation. By computer simulations on a real-world pattern classification problem with many continuous attributes, we show that the search ability of such a simple fuzzy classifier system is not high. Next, we examine the search ability of a hybrid algorithm where a learning procedure of fuzzy if-then rules is combined with the fuzzy classifier system. Then, we introduce two heuristic procedures for improving the performance of the fuzzy classifier system. One is a heuristic rule generation procedure for an initial population where initial fuzzy if-then rules are directly generated from training patterns. The other is a heuristic population update procedure where new fuzzy if-then rules are generated from misclassified and rejected training patterns, as well as from existing fuzzy if-then rules by genetic operations. By computer simulations, we demonstrate that these two heuristic procedures drastically improve the search ability of the fuzzy classifier system. We also examine a variant of the fuzzy classifier system where the population size (i.e., the number of fuzzy if-then rules) varies depending on the classification performance of fuzzy if-then rules in the current population. Finally, the generalization ability of the fuzzy classifier system for test data is evaluated by computer simulations on a real-world pattern classification problem with both continuous and discrete attributes.

CAN approach distinguishes itself from other approaches by being direct, meaning that there are no intermediate representations, an induced rule is never altered in later stages and only tests that appear in the final solution are generated. In the selection of rule conditions (tests) existing rule induction algorithms do not provide a satisfactory answer to the partitioning of the feature spate of discrete feature variables with nonordered qualitative values (i.e., categorical attributes) for multiclass problems. Existing algorithms have exponential complexity in N, where N is the number of feature values. Therefore, heuristic algorithms are employed at this step. An important contribution of this paper is to show that in test selection within CAN framework optimal partitions are achieved in linear time in N for the multiclass case.

J	Lee, WP				Lee, WP			Evolving complex robot behaviors	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						evolutionary computing; genetic programming; computational intelligence; robot learning; automatic robot programming	MOBILE ROBOT; NAVIGATION	Building robots is a tough job because the designer has to predict the interactions between the robot and the environment as well as to deal with them. One solution to such difficulties in designing robots is to adopt learning methods. The evolution-based approach is a special method of machine learning and it has been advocated to automate the design of robots. Yet, the tasks achieved so far are fairly simple. In this work, we first analyze the difficulties of applying evolutionary approaches to synthesize robot controllers for complicated tasks, and then suggest an approach to resolve them. Instead of directly evolving a monolithic control system, we propose to decompose the overall task to fit in the behavior-based control architecture, and then to evolve the separate behavior modules and arbitrators using an evolutionary approach. Consequently, the job of defining fitness functions becomes more straightforward and the tasks easier to achieve. To assess the performance of the developed approach, we evolve a control system to achieve an application task of box-pushing as an example. Experimental results show the promise and efficiency of the presented approach. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Bui, HH; Venkatesh, S; Kieronska, D				Bui, HH; Venkatesh, S; Kieronska, D			Learning other agents' preferences in multi-agent negotiation using the Bayesian classifier	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COOPERATIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						multi-agent systems; cooperative problem solving; negotiation; machine learning		In multi-agent systems, most of the time, an agent does not have complete information about the preferences and decision making processes of other agents. This prevents even the cooperative agents from making coordinated choices, purely due to their ignorance of what others want. To overcome this problem, traditional coordination methods rely heavily on inter-agent communication, and thus become very inefficient when communication is costly or simply not desirable (e.g. to preserve privacy). In this paper, we propose the use of learning to complement communication in acquiring knowledge about other agents. We augment the communication-intensive negotiating agent architecture with a learning module, implemented as a Bayesian classifier. This allows our agents to incrementally update models of other agents' preferences from past negotiations with them. Based on these models, the agents can make sound predictions about others' preferences, thus reducing the need for communication in their future interactions.

This paper reviews the important techniques and algorithms for regression developed by both communities. Regression is important for many applications, since lots of real life problems can be modeled as regression problems. The review includes Locally Weighted Regression (LWR), rule-based regression, Projection Pursuit Regression (PPR), instance-based regression, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and recursive partitioning regression methods that induce regression trees (CART, RETIS and M5).

Our method induces 'operational rules' that determine operational conditions to obtain products that meet a given quality specification. In our application, an operational condition decides the appropriate ranges of chemical composition and heat input to obtain sinter with desirable properties. Our approach consists of two stages. First, backpropagation (BP) training is performed to obtain a NN which decides whether a given condition is appropriate or not. Secondly, from the trained NN, we extract rules which explain what operational conditions are appropriate. In spite of the effective learning capability, a major drawback of a NN is 'unreadability' of the learned knowledge, or the lack of an explanatory capability, which is crucial in the second stage.

Much work has been done on formulating guidelines for model selection. However, by and large, these guidelines are conservative or too specific. Instead of using general guidelines, models could be selected for a particular task based on statistical tests. When selecting one model, others are discarded. Instead of losing potential sources of information, models could be combined to yield better performance. We review the basics of model selection and combination and discuss their differences. Two examples of opportunistic and principled combinations are presented. The first demonstrates that mediocre quality models could be combined to yield significantly better performance. The latter is the main contribution of the paper; it describes and illustrates a novel heuristic approach called the SG(k-NN) ensemble for the generation of good-quality and diverse models that can even improve excellent quality models.

J	Lakshminarayan, K; Harp, SA; Samad, T				Lakshminarayan, K; Harp, SA; Samad, T			Imputation of missing data in industrial databases	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						missing data; industrial databases; multiple imputation; machine learning		A limiting factor for the application of IDA methods in many domains is the incompleteness of data repositories. Many records have fields that are not filled in, especially, when data entry is manual. In addition, a significant fraction of the entries can be erroneous and there may be no alternative but to discard these records. But every cell in a database is not an independent datum. Statistical relationships will constrain and, often determine, missing values. Data imputation, the filling in of missing values for partially missing data, can thus be an invaluable first step in many IDA projects. New imputation methods that can handle the large-scale problems and large-scale sparsity of industrial databases are needed. To illustrate the incomplete database problem, we analyze one database with instrumentation maintenance and test records for an industrial process. Despite regulatory requirements for process data collection, this database is less than 50% complete. Next, we discuss possible solutions to the missing data problem. Several approaches to imputation are noted and classified into two categories: data-driven and model-based. We then describe two machine-learning-based approaches that we have worked with. These build upon well-known algorithms: AutoClass and C4.5. Several experiments are designed, all using the maintenance database as a common test-bed but with various data splits and algorithmic variations. Results are generally positive with up to 80% accuracies of imputation. We conclude the paper by outlining some considerations in selecting imputation methods, and by discussing applications of data imputation for intelligent data analysis.

Presently, the best predictors are based on machine learning approaches, in particular neural network architectures with a fixed and relatively short, input window of amino acids, centered at the prediction site. Although a fixed small window avoids overfitting problems, it does not permit capturing variable long-rang information. Results: We introduce a family of novel architectures which can learn to make predictions based on variable ranges of dependencies. These architectures extend recurrent neural networks, introducing non-causal bidirectional dynamics to capture both upstream and downstream information. The prediction algorithm is completed by the use of mixtures of estimators that leverage evolutionary information, expressed in terms of multiple alignments, both at the input and output levels. While our system currently achieves an overall performance close to 76% correct prediction - at least comparable to the best existing systems - the main emphasis here is on the development of new algorithmic ideas. Availability: The executable program for predicting protein secondary structure is available from the authors free of charge.

Conventional systems often operate at the wrong level, indexing words when people think in terms of topics, and returning documents when people want a broader view. As a result, users cannot easily determine what is in a collection, how well a particular topic is covered, or what kinds of queries will provide useful results. We have built a new kind of search engine, Keyphind, that is explicitly designed to support browsing. Automatically extracted keyphrases form the basic unit of both indexing and presentation, allowing users to interact with the collection at the level of topics and subjects rather than words and documents. The keyphrase index also provides a simple mechanism for clustering documents, refining queries, and previewing results. We compared Keyphind to a traditional query engine in a small usability study. Users reported that certain kinds of browsing tasks were much easier with the new interface, indicating that a keyphrase index would be a useful supplement to existing search tools.

J	Fu, LM				Fu, LM			Knowledge discovery by inductive neural networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						knowledge discovery; neural network; rule extraction; machine learning; certainty factor		A new neural network model for inducing symbolic knowledge from empirical data is presented. This model capitalizes on the fact that the certainty-factor-based activation function can improve the network generalization performance from a limited amount of training data. The formal properties of the procedure far extracting symbolic knowledge from such a trained neural network are investigated. In the domain of molecular genetics, a case study demonstrated that the described learning system effectively discovered the prior domain knowledge with some degree of refinement. Also, in cross-validation experiments, the system outperformed C4.5, a commonly used rule learning system.

The bounds apply when in-sample and out-of-sample data are drawn from the same distribution. Partition-based bounds are stronger than Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) bounds, but they require more computation.

J	Wang, XZ; Li, RF				Wang, XZ; Li, RF			Combining conceptual clustering and principal component analysis for state space based process monitoring	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							NEURAL NETWORKS; PROCESS TRENDS; STEADY-STATES; SIMULATION; REPRESENTATION; DISTILLATION; DIAGNOSIS; DESIGN; PCA	Multivariate statistics and unsupervised machine learning have recently been studied by many researchers for process monitoring and fault diagnosis. These approaches often depend on calculating a similarity or distance measure to group data sets into clusters. Apart from giving predictions, they are not able to give causal explanations on why a specific set of data is assigned to a particular cluster. In this work, a conceptual clustering approach is presented for designing state space based monitoring systems, which is able to generate conceptual knowledge on the major variables which are responsible for clustering, as well as projecting the operation to a specific operational state. A critical issue in this approach is how to conceptually represent dynamic trend signals. For this purpose, principal component analysis is used for concept extraction from real-time dynamic trend signals. The method is introduced using a continuous stirred tank reactor as a case study. Application of the approach to a refinery methyl tert-butyl ether process is also presented.

J	Hilderman, RJ; Hamilton, HJ; Cercone, N				Hilderman, RJ; Hamilton, HJ; Cercone, N			Data mining in large databases using domain generalization graphs	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						data mining; knowledge discovery; machine learning; knowledge representation; attribute-oriented generalization; domain generalization graphs	KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; CONCEPT LATTICES; ALGORITHMS; SYSTEMS	Attribute-oriented generalization summarizes the information in a relational database by repeatedly replacing specific attribute values with more general concepts according to user-defined concept hierarchies. We introduce domain generalization graphs for controlling the generalization of a set of attributes and show how they are constructed. We then present serial and parallel versions of the Multi-Attribute Generalization algorithm for traversing the generalization state space described by joining the domain generalization graphs for multiple attributes. Based upon a generate-and-test approach, the algorithm generates all possible summaries consistent with the domain generalization graphs. Our experimental results show that significant speedups are possible by partitioning path combinations from the DGGs across multiple processors. We also rank the interestingness of the resulting summaries using measures based upon variance and relative entropy. Our experimental results also show that these measures provide an effective basis for analyzing summary data generated from relational databases. Variance appears more useful because it tends to rank the less complex summaries (i.e., those with few attributes and/or tuples) as more interesting.

One part of this project is a learning system that intends to capture knowledge from historic information collected during the operation of water distribution networks. The captured knowledge is expected to contribute to the improvement of the operation of the network. Presented ideas correspond to the first development phase of the learning system, focusing specially on the adopted methodology. The interactions between different classes of human experts and the learning system are also discussed. Finally some experimental results are presented.

J	Lee, CH; Shin, DG				Lee, CH; Shin, DG			Using Hellinger distance in a nearest neighbour classifier for relational databases	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						machine learning; nearest neighbour algorithm; classification		Nearest neighbour algorithms classify a previously unseen input case by finding similar cases to make predictions about the unknown features of the input case. The usefulness of the nearest neighbour algorithms has been demonstrated in many real-world domains. Unfortunately, most of the similarity measures discussed in the current nearest neighbour learning literature handle only limited data types, thus limiting their applicability to relational database applications. In this paper, we propose an enhanced nearest neighbour learning algorithm that is applicable to relational databases. The proposed method allows one to define similarity on a wide spectrum of attribute types. It automatically assigns to each attribute a weight of its importance with respect to the target attribute. The method has been implemented as a computer program and its effectiveness has been tested on four publicly available machine learning databases. Its performance is compared to another well-known machine learning method, C4.5. Our experimentation with the system demonstrates that the classification accuracy of the proposed system was superior to that of C4.5 in most cases. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Forster, MR				Forster, MR			How do simple rules 'fit to reality' in a complex world?	MINDS AND MACHINES			English	Article						Bayesianism; complexity; decision theory; fast and frugal heuristics; machine learning; philosophy of science; predictive accuracy; simplicity	PHILOSOPHERS STONE; FREEDMANS CRITIQUE; CAUSAL DISCOVERY; HUMPHREYS; SEARCH	The theory of fast and frugal heuristics, developed in a new book called Simple Heuristics that make Us Smart (Gigerenzer, Todd, and the ABC Research Group, in press), includes two requirements for rational decision making. One is that decision rules are bounded in their rationality-that rules are frugal in what they take into account, and therefore fast in their operation. The second is that the rules are ecologically adapted to the environment, which means that they 'fit to reality.' The main purpose of this article is to apply these ideas to learning rules-methods for constructing, selecting, or evaluating competing hypotheses in science, and to the methodology of machine learning, of which connectionist learning is a special case. The bad news is that ecological validity is particularly difficult to implement and difficult to understand. The good news is that it builds an important bridge from normative psychology and machine learning to recent work in the philosophy of science, which considers predictive accuracy to be a primary goal of science.

Instead of the predictive accuracy, the values of the predicted class labels are used to characterize the classification models. Over these predicted class labels Bayesian networks are induced. Using these Bayesian networks, several assertions are extracted about the nature of the classification models induced by Machine Learning algorithms. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Soh, LK; Tsatsoulis, C				Soh, LK; Tsatsoulis, C			Unsupervised segmentation of ERS and Radarsat sea ice images using multiresolution peak detection and aggregated population equalization	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							TEXTURED IMAGES; RANDOM-FIELDS; SCALE-SPACE; SAR DATA; CLASSIFICATION; REDUCTION; SYSTEM; EDGES	In this paper we describe Automated Sea Ice Segmentation (ASIS), a system that automatically segments Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sea ice imagery. This system integrates image processing, data mining, and machine learning methodologies to determine the number of visually separable classes in ERS and Radarsat sea ice images. We introduce two new techniques: multiresolution peak detection and spatial clustering. The detection is a noise-resistant data discretization methodology that results in an initial segmentation of the image. The clustering is based on an innovative concept called Aggregated Population Equalization that utilizes spatial relationships among classes to merge and split the population environment. Its self-organizing ability produces the final segmentation and automates ASIS. In addition, we have designed a Java-based graphical user interface that facilitates post-segmentation human evaluation and classification. Thus, ASIS can be used as a pre-processor to help analyse sea ice images as well as a basis for human classification of sea ice images. We have tested the system on more than 300 ERS-1, ERS-2 and Radarsat SAR sea ice images and analysed the results to point out the strengths and weaknesses of ASIS in the automated segmentation of sea ice images.

It presents a modular and distributed software architecture, which integrates localization, mapping, collision avoidance, planning, and various modules concerned with user interaction and Web-based telepresence. At its heart, the software approach relies on probabilistic computation, on-line learning, and any-time algorithms. It enables robots to operate safely, reliably, and at high speeds in highly dynamic environments, and does not require any modifications of the environment to aid the robot's operation. Special emphasis is placed on the design of interactive capabilities that appeal to people's intuition. The interface provides new means for human-robot interaction with crowds of people in public places, and it also provides people all around the world with the ability to establish a "virtual telepresence" using the Web, To illustrate our approach, results are reported obtained in mid-1997, when our robot "RHINO" was deployed for a period of six days in a densely populated museum. The empirical results demonstrate reliable operation in public environments. The robot successfully raised the museum's attendance by more than 50%. In addition, thousands of people all over the world controlled the robot through the Web. We conjecture that these innovations transcend to a much larger range of application domains for service robots. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Muggleton, S				Muggleton, S			Inductive logic programming: Issues, results and the challenge of learning language in logic	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						inductive logic programming; machine learning; scientific discovery; protein prediction; learning of n; natural language	FIRST-ORDER; MUTAGENICITY; PROGOL	Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is the area of AI which deals with the induction of hypothesised predicate definitions from examples and background knowledge. Logic programs are used as a single representation for examples, background knowledge and hypotheses. ILP is differentiated from most other forms of Machine Learning (ML) both by its use of an expressive representation language and its ability to make use of logically encoded background knowledge. This has allowed successful applications of ILP in areas such as molecular biology and natural language which both have rich sources of background knowledge and both benefit from the use of an expressive concept representation languages. For instance, the ILP system Progol has recently been used to generate comprehensible descriptions of the 23 most populated fold classes of proteins, where no such descriptions had previously been formulated manually. In the natural language area ILP has not only been shown to have higher accuracies than various other ML approaches in learning the past tense of English but also shown to be capable of learning accurate grammars which translate sentences into deductive database queries. The area of Learning Language in Logic (LLL) is producing a number of challenges to existing ILP theory and implementations. In particular, language applications of ILP require revision and extension of a hierarchically defined set of predicates in which the examples are typically only provided for predicates at the top of the hierarchy. New predicates often need to be invented, and complex recursion is usually involved. Advances in ILP theory and implementation related to the challenges of LLL are already producing beneficial advances in other sequence-oriented applications of ILP. In addition LLL is starting to develop its own character as a sub-discipline of AI involving the confluence of computational linguistics, machine learning and logic programming.

J	Ishibuchi, H; Nakashima, T; Murata, T				Ishibuchi, H; Nakashima, T; Murata, T			Performance evaluation of fuzzy classifier systems for multidimensional pattern classification problems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS			English	Article							GENETIC ALGORITHMS; NEURAL-NETWORK; MEMBERSHIP FUNCTIONS; RULES; CONTROLLERS; REPRESENTATION; LOGIC; SETS	We examine the performance of a fuzzy genetics-based machine learning method for multidimensional pattern classification problems with continuous attributes. In our method, each fuzzy if-then rule is handled as an individual, and a fitness value is assigned to each rule. Thus, our method can be viewed as a classifier system. In this paper, we first describe fuzzy if-then rules and fuzzy reasoning for pattern classification problems. Then we explain a genetics-based machine learning method that automatically generates fuzzy if-then rules for pattern classification problems from numerical data. Because our method uses linguistic values with fixed membership functions as antecedent fuzzy sets, a linguistic interpretation of each fuzzy if-then rule is easily obtained. The fixed membership functions also lead to a simple implementation of our method as a computer program. The simplicity of implementation and the linguistic interpretation of the generated fuzzy if-then rules are the main characteristic features of our method. The performance of our method is evaluated by computer simulations on some well-known test problems. While our method involves no tuning mechanism of membership functions, it works very well in comparison with other classification methods such as nonfuzzy machine learning techniques and neural networks.

J	Sasaki, Y				Sasaki, Y			On the necessity of special mechanisms for handling types in inductive logic programming	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						inductive logic programming; machine learning; type hierarchy		This paper demonstrates the necessity of special handling mechanisms for type (or sort) information when learning logic programs on the basis of background knowledge that includes type hierarchy. We have developed a novel relational learner RHB, which incorporates special operations to handle the computing of the least general generalization (lgg) of examples and the code length of logic programs with types. It is possible for previous learners, such as FOIL, GOLEM and Progol, to generate logic programs that include type information represented as is-a relations. However, this expedient has two problems: one in the computation of the code length and the other in the performance. We will illustrate that simply adding is_a relations to background knowledge as ordinary literals causes a problem in computing the code length of logic programs with is_a literals. Experimental results on artificial data show that the learning speed of FOIL exponentially slows as the number of types in the background knowledge increases. The hypotheses generated by GOLEM are about 30% less accurate than those of RHB. Furthermore, Progol is two times slower than RHB. Compared to the three learners, RHB can efficiently handle about 3000 is a relations while still achieving a high accuracy. This indicates that type information should be specially handled when learning logic programs with types.

J	Hansen, JV				Hansen, JV			Combining predictors: comparison of five meta machine learning methods	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						machine learning; combining predictors; mixtures of experts; ensemble; neural network		For some years there has been a trend towards combining predictors, and away from monolithic predictors. Two groups of meta machine learning (MML) methods are the ensemble methods and the Mixtures of Experts (ME) methods. In this article, five different representatives are presented, discussed, and compared. Three from the ensemble group, and two from the ME group. The selected methods are Simple ensemble, AdaBoost, Bagging, Hierarchical MEs, and a Variation on the ME method found in R.A. Jacobs, M.I. Jordan, S.J. Nowlan, G.E. Hinton (Neural Computation 3 (1) (1991) 79-87), called Dynamic Coefficients (DynCo). DynCo can use any type of predictors that can be trained with gradient descent. It has a powerful combination method, and it encourages cooperation among the experts. DynCo compares favorably with the other four methods. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Lam, W				Lam, W			Intelligent content-based document delivery via automatic filtering profile generation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article								We develop an intelligent document delivery approach for filtering text information. Our approach can conduct content-based filtering via a machine learning technique which automatically constructs a filtering profile from training examples. The profiles, encoded in rule representation, are easily understood by human. Good features of high predictive power for the learning process are automatically extracted from the document content. As a result, our approach is able to operate without any prior information or restriction of the topic areas and yet achieve the filtering task. We have conducted an extensive simulation study to analyze the performance of our approach. We have also implemented a practical intelligent news article delivery system based on our approach. Both simulation study as well as practical experiments use real-world document collections and the results demonstrate that our approach is effective. (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

J	Baldwin, JF; Lawry, J; Martin, TP				Baldwin, JF; Lawry, J; Martin, TP			A mass assignment method for prototype induction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article							FUZZY-LOGIC; PROBABILITY; UNCERTAINTY	A form of prototypes defined as tuples of marginal probability distributions is introduced. Addition and subtraction operations on such prototypes are then described. A brief introduction to the mass assignment theory of the probability of fuzzy events is given, and it is shown how fuzzy sets can serve as conceptual descriptions of probability distributions. Hence fuzzy descriptions of prototypes can be derived and these can be used for inference as well as enabling rule based representations of a set of prototypes to be formed. A prototype induction algorithm, based on these ideas together with the addition and subtraction operations, is described. The potential of this approach is then illustrated by its application to a number of model and rear world machine learning problems. (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Three different families algorithms have been analyzed: divide and conquer (top down induction decision tree), covering, and inductive logic programming (ILP). We have used (1) fault data collected on corrective maintenance activities for the Generalized Support Software reuse asset library located at the Flight Dynamics Division of NASA's GSFC and (2) product measures extracted directly from the faulty components of this library. In our data set, the software quality models generated by both C4.5-rules (a divide and conquer algorithm) and FOIL (an inductive logic programming one) presented the best results from the point of view of model accuracy.

In this paper, we present a prototype NER system for Greek texts that we developed based on a NER system for English. Both systems are evaluated on corpora of the same domain and of similar size. The time-consuming process for the construction and update of domain-specific resources in both systems led us to examine a machine learning method for the automatic construction of such resources for a particular application in a specific language.

Since the attribute selected by the algorithm at a given node is often the best attribute according to the Quinlan's information gain criterion, the decision tree it induces is often identical to the ID3 tree when the number of attributes is small. In problem-solving applications of the induced decision tree, an advantage of the approach is that the relevance of a selected attribute or test can be explained in strategic terms. An implementation of the algorithm in an environment providing integrated support for incremental learning, problem solving and explanation is presented. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this article, we examine and compare a number of techniques for pruning a classifier ensemble which is overfit on its training set and find that a real valued GA is at least as good as the best heuristic search algorithm for choosing an ensemble weighting.

J	Ragel, A; Cremilleux, B				Ragel, A; Cremilleux, B			MVC - a preprocessing method to deal with missing values	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th SGES International Conference on Knowledge-Based Systems and Applied Artificial Intelligence (ES98)	DEC 14-16, 1998	CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND	Specialist Grp Expert Syst		association rules; missing values; preprocessing; decision trees		Many of analysis tasks have to deal with missing values and have developed specific and internal treatments to guess them. In this paper we present an external method, MVC (Missing Values Completion), to improve performances of completion and also declarativity and interactions with the user for this problem. Such qualities will allow to use it for the data cleaning step of the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD process (U.M. Fayyad, G. Piatetsky-Shapiro, P. Smyth, From data mining to knowledge discovery: an overview, in: Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, USA, 1996, pp. 1-36). The core of MVC, is the Robust Association Rules (RAR) algorithm that we have proposed earlier (A. Ragel, B Cremilleux, Treatment of missing values for association rules, in: Proceedings of the Second Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD-98), Melbourne, Australia, Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence 1394, Springer, Berlin, 1998, pp. 258-270). This algorithm extends the concept of association rules CR. Agrawal, T. Imielinski, A. Swami, Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases, in: Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD Conference on Management of Data, Washington, DC, USA, 1993, pp. 207-216) for databases with multiple missing values. It allows MVC to be an efficient preprocessing method: in our experiments with the c4.5 (J.R. Quilan, C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning, Morgan Kaufmann, San Mateo, CA, USA, 1993) decision tree program, MVC has permitted to divide, up to two, the error rate in classification, independently of a significant gain of declarativity.

The construction of a knowledge base for an expert system may be a difficult task; to automate this task several machine learning methods have been developed. These methods can be also used in the refinement of knowledge bases for removing inconsistencies and redundancies, and for simplifying decision rules. In this study, decision tree induction was employed to acquire diagnostic knowledge for otoneurological diseases and to extract relevant parameters from the database of an otoneurological expert system ONE. The records of patients with benign positional vertigo, Meniere's disease, sudden deafness, traumatic vertigo, vestibular neuritis and vestibular schwannoma were retrieved from the database of ONE, and for each disease, decision trees were constructed. The study shows that decision tree induction is a useful technique for acquiring diagnostic knowledge for otoneurological diseases and for extracting relevant parameters from a large set of parameters.

J	Bridges, S; Hodges, J; Wooley, B; Karpovich, D; Smith, GB				Bridges, S; Hodges, J; Wooley, B; Karpovich, D; Smith, GB			Knowledge discovery in an oceanographic database	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						knowledge discovery; machine learning; texture; feature selection; image processing; clustering		Knowledge discovery from image data is a multi-step iterative process. This paper describes the procedure we have used to develop a knowledge discovery system that classifies regions of the ocean floor based on textural features extracted from acoustic imagery. The image is subdivided into rectangular cells called texture elements (texels); a gray-level co-occurence matrix (GLCM) is computed for each texel in four directions. Secondary texture features are then computed from the GLCM resulting in a feature vector representation of each texel instance. Alternatively, a region-growing approach is used to identify irregularly shaped regions of varying size which have a homogenous texture and for which the texture features are computed. The Bayesian classifier Autoclass is used to cluster the instances. Feature extraction is one of the major tasks in knowledge discovery from images. The initial goal of this research was to identify regions of the image characterized by sand waves. Experiments were designed to use expert judgements to select the most effective set of features, to identify the best texel size, and to determine the number of meaningful classes in the data. The region-growing approach has proven to be more successful than the texel-based approach. This method provides a fast and accurate method for identifying provinces in the ocean floor of interest to geologists.

J	Khardon, R				Khardon, R			Learning action strategies for planning domains	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						learning to act; planning; supervised learning; decision lists; structural domains	STRIPS	This paper reports on experiments where techniques of supervised machine learning are applied to the problem of planning. The input to the learning algorithm is composed of a description of a planning domain, planning problems in this domain, and solutions for them. The output is an efficient algorithm-a strategy-for solving problems in that domain. We test the strategy on an independent set of planning problems from the same domain, so that success is measured by its ability to solve complete problems. A system, L2ACT, has been developed in order to perform these experiments. We have experimented with the blocks world domain and the logistics transportation domain, using strategies in the form of a generalisation of decision lists. The condition of a rule in the decision list is an existentially quantified first order expression, and each such rule indicates which action to take when the condition is satisfied. The learning algorithm is a variant of Rivest's (1987) algorithm, improved with several techniques that reduce its time complexity. The experiments demonstrate that the approach is feasible, and generalisation is achieved set that unseen problems can be solved by the learned strategies. Moreover, the learned strategies are efficient, the solutions found by them are competitive with those of known heuristics for the domains, and transfer from small planning problems in the examples to larger ones in the test set is exhibited.

J	Suzuki, H				Suzuki, H			An approach to biological computation: Unicellular core-memory creatures evolved using genetic algorithms	ARTIFICIAL LIFE			English	Article						core memory; unicellular creature; membrane; biological computation; algorithmic complexity; machine language genetic programming; genetic algorithms	EVOLUTION; COMPLEXITY	A novel machine language genetic programming system that uses one-dimensional core memories is proposed and simulated. The core is compared to a biochemical reaction space, and in imitation of biological molecules, four types of data words (Membrane, Pure data, Operator, and Instruction) are prepared in the core. A program is represented by a sequence of Instructions. During execution of the sore, Instructions are transcribed into corresponding Operators, and Operators modify, create, or transfer Pure data. The core is hierarchically partitioned into sections by the Membrane data, and the data transfer between sections by special channel Operators constitutes a tree data-flow structure among sections in the core. In the experiment, genetic algorithms are used to modify program information. A simple machine learning problem is prepared for the environment data set of the creatures (programs), and the fitness value of a creature is calculated from the Pure data excreted by the creature, Breeding of programs that can output the predefined answer is successfully carried out. Several future plans to extend this system are also discussed.

From the perspective of statisticians, this paper surveys techniques used and contributions from fields such as data warehousing, machine learning from artificial intelligence, and visualization as well as statistics. It concludes that statistical thinking and design of analysis, as exemplified by achievements in clinical epidemiology, may fit well with the emerging activities of data mining and 'knowledge discovery in databases' (DM&KDD).

Modelling, 108, 1998), we use machine learning techniques to conduct a more detailed analysis of the interactions among the red deer population, meteorological parameters and new forest growth. We use the machine learning program M5 (Quinlan, Proc. 10th Int. Conf. Machine Learning, Morgan Kaufmann, San Mateo CA, 1993) that learns regression trees to automate the modelling of dynamic interactions. An area of 40 000 hectares of naturally regenerated forest on the high Dinaric Karst of Notranjska, Slovenia, is studied. The analysis uses data collected during the period 1976-1993, which include several meteorological parameters, the degrees of browsing intensity of new growth of woody plants (beech and maple), and parameters about the population of red deer. Models of the degree of beech browsing and calf weight were studied earlier; here, we automatically induce models of the red deer population size, the degree of beech and maple browsing, calf weight for 1- and 2-year-olds, and hind weight. The induced models are evaluated in terms of predictive accuracy and interpreted for their explanatory power. The models show that the meteorological parameters, the parameters of the red deer population and the rates of the browsing intensity of the new growth form a complex system with closely related parameters. While these interactions can be mainly explained by our current knowledge, we still gain some new knowledge from the automatically induced models. The results emphasise the importance of a pluralistic approach and a holistic perception of the system formed by meteorological conditions, the red deer population and the new growth in a forest ecosystem.

The proposed belief network contains hidden variables that play a role similar to nodes in decision trees and each of their states either corresponds to a class label or to a single attribute test. As a major difference with respect to decision trees, the selection of the attribute to be tested is probabilistic. Thus, the model can be used to assess the probability that a tuple belongs to some class, given the predictive attributes. Unfolding the network along the hidden states dimension yields a trellis structure having a signal flow similar to second order connectionist networks. The network encodes context specific probabilistic independencies to reduce parametric complexity. We present a custom tailored inference algorithm and derive a teaming procedure based on the expectation-maximization algorithm. We propose decision trellises as an alternative to decision trees in the context of tuple categorization in databases, which is an important step for building data mining systems. Preliminary experiments on-standard machine learning databases are reported, comparing the classification accuracy of decision trellises and decision trees induced by C4.5. In particular, we show that the proposed model can offer significant advantages for sparse databases in which many predictive attributes are missing.

J	Li, H; Cao, JN; Love, PED				Li, H; Cao, JN; Love, PED			Using machine learning and GA to solve time-cost trade-off problems	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE			English	Article							GENETIC ALGORITHMS; CONSTRUCTION; NETWORKS	Existing genetic algorithms (GA) based systems for solving time-cost trade-off problems suffer from two limitations. First, these systems require the user to manually craft the time-cost curves for formulating the objective functions. Second, these systems only deal with linear time-cost relationships. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a computer system called MLGAS (Machine Learning and Genetic Algorithms based System), which integrates a machine learning method with GA. A quadratic template is introduced to capture the nonlinearity of time-cost relationships. The machine learning method automatically generates the quadratic time-cost curves from historical data and also measures the credibility of each quadratic time-cost curve. The quadratic curves are then used to formulate the objective function that can be solved by the GA. Several improvements are made to enhance the capacity of GA to prevent premature convergence. Comparisons of MLGAS with an experienced project manager indicate that MLGAS generates better solutions to nonlinear time-cost trade-off problems.

J	Newman, RA				Newman, RA			A new model of computation for learning vision modules from examples	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL IMAGING AND VISION			English	Article						machine learning; theoretical computing; automatic program refinement	COMPUTER VISION; IMAGE SEGMENTATION; ROBOT VISION; RECOGNITION; INFORMATION; INTEGRATION; SYSTEMS; OPTIMIZATION; PERSPECTIVE; TASKS	This paper addresses an important class of mimicry problems, where the goal is to construct a computer program which is functionally equivalent to an observed behaviour. Computer vision research can be considered such a challenge, where a researcher attempts to impart human visual abilities to a computer. Unfortunately this has proved a difficult task, not least because our vision processes occur mostly at a subconscious level. It is therefore useful to study the general mimicry problem in order to develop tools which may assist computer vision research. This paper formalises a mimicry problem as one in which a computer learning system (L) constructs a solution from a given program structure (i.e. template or outline) by posing questions to an Oracle. The latter is an entity which, when given an input value, produces the corresponding output of the function which is to be mimicked. In order to define a program's structure, particularly one which can be extracted from any computer program automatically, a new model of computation is developed. Based on this a fast algorithm which determines the best questions to pose to the Oracle is then described. Thus L relieves the human programmer of the difficulties faced in choosing the examples from which to learn. This is important because a human programmer might inadvertently choose biased, redundant or otherwise unhelpful examples. Results are shown which demonstrate the utility of a complete learning system (L) based on this work. This paper represents background theory and initial algorithms which further work will extend into powerful automatic learning systems, examples of which are found in [36] and [38].

J	Newman, RA				Newman, RA			Madura: A language for learning vision programs from examples	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL IMAGING AND VISION			English	Article						machine learning; theoretical computing; automatic program refinement; computer vision	COMPUTER VISION; MACHINE VISION; SYSTEMS; OPTIMIZATION; INFORMATION; INTEGRATION	Recently the idea of designing a computer system which automatically connects a number of independent vision modules together to solve a given computer vision problem has attracted significant interest. However the main assumption of this endeavour, namely that the modules used as the building blocks of the vision system are essentially fixed, is questionable in the light of previous experience. Therefore it is important to be able to modify even the detailed operation of the basic modules used, something which is not practical using conventional techniques. This paper constructs a general method by which the computer code of a vision module can be altered automatically to make it mimic a desired behaviour. The system which does this, termed L-u, modifies a basic module template using interaction with an Oracle as a guide. The Oracle is an entity which, when given an input value, produces the corresponding output of the function which is to be mimicked. The system developed is based upon a new model of computation which endows it with the important properties that extracting the template (i.e. structure) of any module's computer code, as well as determining the best questions to pose to the Oracle are both performed automatically. Thus the L-u described has significant advantages over many other models which might be used (e.g. Neural Networks). Dealing directly with this new model is not always convenient. Therefore a new computer language Madura is defined which provides a high-level interface to it. As Madura is syntactically similar to JAVA, it is simple to express the code of many basic vision modules in its terms and the results of L-u (the Madura code of a module which mimics the Oracle) are similarly simple to understand and use.

J	Huang, MJ				Huang, MJ			Intelligent diagnosing and learning agents for intelligent tutoring systems	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs); machine learning; similarity-based learning (SBL); explanation-based learning (EBL); case-based reasoning (CBR)		This research suggests two cooperating intelligent agents with new approaches for Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs): one (a diagnosis agent) for correctly diagnosing the student's answers and another one (a learning agent) for intelligently learning from the student's responses. The diagnosis agent incorporates the classification tree concepts to identify the student's misconceptions and to do score assignment that includes the score assignment of partial correctness. The learning agent is a blackboard multistrategy machine learning model. The main purpose of the learning agent is to learn the features of the student's inconsistent behaviors for the system to take effective strategies to prevent the happening of the student's inconsistent behaviors. Importantly, accurate diagnosis on the student's answers is the prerequisite of a successful student model. Then an effective and efficient ITS is required to deal with the student's inconsistent behaviors.

J	Klingberg, G; Sillen, R; Noren, JG				Klingberg, G; Sillen, R; Noren, JG			Machine learning methods applied on dental fear and behavior management problems in children	ACTA ODONTOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA			English	Article							SWEDISH CHILDREN; ANXIETY; CARE	The etiologies of dental fear and dental behavior management problems in children were investigated in a database of information on 2,257 Swedish children 4-6 and 9-11 years old. The analyses were performed using computerized inductive techniques within the field of artificial intelligence. The database held information regarding dental fear levels and behavior management problems, which were defined as outcomes, i.e. dependent variables. The attributes, i.e. independent variables, included data on dental health and dental treatments, information about parental dental fear, general anxiety, socioeconomic variables, etc. The data contained both numerical and discrete variables. The analyses were performed using an inductive analysis program (XpertRule Analyser(R), Attar Software Ltd, Lancashire, UK) that presents the results in a hierarchic diagram called a knowledge tree. The importance of the different attributes is represented by their position in this diagram. The results show that inductive methods are well suited for analyzing multifactorial and complex relationships in large data sets, and are thus a useful complement to multivariate statistical techniques. The knowledge trees for the two outcomes, dental fear and behavior management problems, were very different from each other, suggesting that the two phenomena are not equivalent. Dental fear was found to be more related to non-dental variables, whereas dental behavior management problems seemed connected to dental variables.

J	Cox, MT; Ram, A				Cox, MT; Ram, A			Introspective multistrategy learning: On the construction of learning strategies	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Review						learning-strategy construction problem; blame assignment; learning goals; multistrategy learning; case-based reasoning; meta-reasoning; explanation; planning	REPRESENTATION; MAINTENANCE; SYSTEMS	A central problem in multistrategy learning systems is the selection and sequencing of machine learning algorithms for particular situations. This is typically done by the system designer who analyzes the learning task and implements the appropriate algorithm or sequence of algorithms for that task. We propose a solution to this problem which enables an Al system with a library of machine learning algorithms to select and sequence appropriate algorithms autonomously. Furthermore, instead of relying on the system designer or user to provide a learning goal or target concept to the learning system, our method enables the system to determine its learning goals based on analysis of its successes and failures at the performance task. The method involves three steps: Given a performance failure, the learner examines a trace of its reasoning prior to the failure to diagnose what went wrong (blame assignment); given the resultant explanation of the reasoning failure, the learner posts explicitly represented learning goals to change its background knowledge (deciding what to learn); and given a set of learning goals, the learner uses nonlinear planning techniques to assemble a sequence of machine learning algorithms, represented as planning operators, to achieve the learning goals (learning strategy construction). In support of these operations, we define the types of reasoning failures, a taxonomy of failure causes, a second-order formalism to represent reasoning traces, a taxonomy of learning goals that specify desired change to the background knowledge of a system, and a declarative task-formalism representation of learning algorithms. We present the Meta-AQUA system, an implemented multistrategy learner that operates in the domain of story understanding. Extensive empirical evaluations of Meta-AQUA show that it performs significantly better in a deliberative, planful mode than in a reflexive mode in which learning goals are ablated and, furthermore, that the arbitrary ordering of learning algorithms can lead to worse performance than no learning at all. We conclude that explicit representation and sequencing of learning goals is necessary for avoiding negative interactions between learning algorithms that can lead to less effective learning.

J	Landauer, TK				Landauer, TK			Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), a disembodied learning machine, acquires human word meaning vicariously from language alone	BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Editorial Material							KNOWLEDGE	The hypothesis that perceptual mechanisms could have more representational and logical power than usually assumed is interesting and provocative, especially with regard to brain evolution. However, the importance of embodiment and grounding is exaggerated, and the implication that there is no highly abstract representation at all, and that humanlike knowledge cannot be learned or represented without human bodies, is very doubtful. A machine-learning model, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) that closely mimics human word and passage meaning relations is offered as a counterexample.

J	Tae, KS; Cook, DJ; Holder, LB				Tae, KS; Cook, DJ; Holder, LB			Experimentation-driven knowledge acquisition for planning	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						planning; machine learning; experimentation; plan operators		Knowledge engineering for planning is expensive and the resulting knowledge can be imperfect. To autonomously learn a plan operator definition from environmental feedback, our learning system WISER explores an instantiated literal space using a breadth-first search technique. Each node of the search tree represents a state, a unique subset of the instantiated literal space. A state at the root node is called a seed state. WISER can generate seed states with or without utilizing imperfect expert knowledge. WISER experiments with an operator at each node. The positive state, in which an operator can be successfully executed, constitutes initial preconditions of an operator. We analyze the number of required experiments as a function of the number of missing preconditions in a seed state. We introduce a naive domain assumption to test only a subset of the exponential state space. Since breadth-first search is expensive, WISER introduces two search techniques to reorder literals at each level of the search tree. We demonstrate performance improvement using the naive domain assumption and literal-ordering heuristics. To learn the effects of an operator, WISER computes the delta state, composed of the add list and the delete list, and parameterizes it.

For rule induction learning, we use an entropy function based on Hellinger divergence to measure the amount of information each inductive rule contains. For lazy learning, we also use the Hellinger measure to automatically generate attribute weights and to compute similarities between data values of non-numeric data types. Our system has been implemented and tested extensively on a number of well-known machine learning data sets. The performance of our system was favorable compared to those of other well-known classification learning techniques based on monostrategic learning methods. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, its theoretical meaning is still not clear In this paper, based on information geometry, we give an information-theoretic interpretation of mean-field Boltzmann machine learning and a clear geometrical explanation of the approximation used there. Based on this interpretation, computer simulations for evaluating the effectiveness of mean-field Boltzmann machine learning are carried out for two-unit Boltzmann machines. The necessity of geometrical analysis in demonstrating the effectiveness of meanfield Boltzmann machine learning is, discussed. (C) 1999 Scripta Technica.

Human control skill is exploited as a source of the prior knowledge needed to establish the structure of control rules. This knowledge is first made explicit by means of machine learning, and then a genetic algorithm is used to improve the control performance with respect to chosen criteria. This hybrid control-synthesis scheme was tested in swing control on a model of a container crane. It has proved successful in reducing the number of trials needed for optimisation, which is especially important when dealing with physical devices. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Apolloni, B; Battistini, E; de Falco, D				Apolloni, B; Battistini, E; de Falco, D			Higher-order Boltzmann machines and entropy bounds	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND GENERAL			English	Article							INEQUALITIES	We examine some aspects of the interface area between mathematical statistics and statistical physics relevant to the study of Boltzmann machines. The Boltzmann machine learning algorithm is based on a variational principle (Gibbs' lemma for relative entropy). This fact suggests the possibility of a scheme of successive approximations: here we consider successive approximations parametrized by the order of many-body interactions among individual units. We prove bounds on the gain in relative entropy in the crucial step of adding, and estimating by Hebb's rule, a new parameter. We address the problem of providing, on the basis of local observations, upper and lower bounds on the entropy. While upper bounds are easily obtained by subadditivity, lower bounds involve localization of Hirschman bounds on a dual quantum system.

J	Schadler, K; Wysotzki, F				Schadler, K; Wysotzki, F			Comparing structures using a Hopfield-style neural network	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						neural networks; structured objects; machine learning; classification; similarity; nearest neighbor	GRAPH; ALGORITHM	Labeled graphs are an appropriate and popular representation of structured objects in many domains. If the labels describe the properties of real world objects and their relations, finding the best match between two graphs turns out to be the weakly defined, NP-complete task of establishing a mapping between them that maps similar parts onto each other preserving as much as possible of their overall structural correspondence. In this paper, former approaches of structural matching and constraint relaxation by spreading activation in neural networks and the method of solving optimization tasks using Hopfield-style nets are combined. The approximate matching task is reformulated as the minimization of a quadratic energy function. The design of the approach enables the user to change the parameters and the dynamics of the net so that knowledge about matching preferences is included easily and transparently. In the last section, some examples demonstrate the successful application of this approach in classification and learning in the domain of organic chemistry.

J	Garcez, ASA; Zaverucha, G				Garcez, ASA; Zaverucha, G			The connectionist inductive learning and logic programming system	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						theory refinement; machine learning; artificial neural networks; logic programming; computational biology	NEURAL NETWORKS; KNOWLEDGE; CONSENSUS; RULES	This paper presents the Connectionist Inductive Learning and Logic Programming System (C-(ILP)-P-2). C-(ILP)-P-2 is a new massively parallel computational model based on a feedforward Artificial Neural Network that integrates inductive learning from examples and background knowledge, with deductive learning from Logic Programming. Starting with the background knowledge represented by a propositional logic program, a translation algorithm is applied generating a neural network that can be trained with examples. The results obtained with this refined network can be explained by extracting a revised logic program from it. Moreover, the neural network computes the stable model of the logic program inserted in it as background knowledge, or learned with the examples, thus functioning as a parallel system for Logic Programming. We have successfully applied C-(ILP)-P-2 to two real-world problems of computational biology, specifically DNA sequence analyses. Comparisons with the results obtained by some of the main neural, symbolic, and hybrid inductive learning systems, using the same domain knowledge, show the effectiveness of C-(ILP)-P-2.

J	Vico, FJ; Veredas, FJ; Bravo, JM; Almaraz, J				Vico, FJ; Veredas, FJ; Bravo, JM; Almaraz, J			Automatic design synthesis with artificial intelligence techniques	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						automatic design; architectures for intelligent systems; genetic algorithms; artificial neural networks; optimization		Design synthesis represents a highly complex task in the field of industrial design. The main difficulty in automating it is the definition of the design and performance spaces, in a way that a computer can generate optimum solutions. Following a different line from the machine learning, and knowledge-based methods that have been proposed, our approach considers design synthesis as an optimization problem. From this outlook, neural networks and genetic algorithms can be used to implement the fitness function and the search method needed to achieve optimum design. The proposed method has been tested in designing a telephone handset. Although the objective of this application is based on esthetic and ergonomic cues (subjective information), the algorithm successfully converges to good solutions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, by and large, the development of such applications or their report lack proper evaluation. Deficient evaluation practice was observed in the general neural networks community and again in engineering applications through a survey we conducted of articles published in Al in Engineering and elsewhere. This status hinders understanding and prevents progress. This article goal is to remedy this situation. First, several evaluation methods are discussed with their relative qualities. Second, these qualities are illustrated by using the methods to evaluate ANN performance in two engineering problems. Third, a systematic evaluation procedure for ML is discussed. This procedure will lead to better evaluation of studies, and consequently to improved research and practice in the area of ML in engineering applications. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Lau, HCW; Wong, TT; Pun, KF				Lau, HCW; Wong, TT; Pun, KF			Neural-fuzzy modeling of plastic injection molding machine for intelligent control	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						fuzzy logic; neural networks; injection molding; process parameters; machine learning	EXPERT-SYSTEM	Neural network and fuzzy logic reasoning can complement each other to form an integrated model which capitalizes on the merits and at the same time offsets the pitfalls of the involved computational intelligence technologies. This article presents a neural-fuzzy model which consists of a neural network for suggesting the change of process parameters, together with a fuzzy reasoning mechanism for acquiring modified parameter values based on the induced parameter values from the neural network. This model is particularly useful in parameter-based control situations where there may be multiple inputs and multiple outputs involved. This model, which serves to learn from sample data and allows to extract rules which are then fuzzified prior to fuzzy inference, is implemented for the dimensional control of injection molding parts, the dimensions of which are primarily determined by the molding process parameters such as injection time and cooling temperature.

J	Cardie, C				Cardie, C			Integrating case-based learning and cognitive biases for machine learning of natural language	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						case-based learning; relative pronoun; disambiguation; lexical tagging; feature weighting	INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; INFORMATION EXTRACTION; SENTENCE COMPREHENSION; WORKING MEMORY; ALGORITHMS; CLASSIFICATION; CONTEXT; ADVANTAGE; SELECTION; MENTION	This paper shows that psychological constraints on human information processing can be used effectively to guide feature set selection for case-based learning of linguistic knowledge. Given as input a baseline case representation for a natural language learning task, our algorithm selects the relevant cognitive biases for the task and then automatically modifies the representation in response to those biases by changing, deleting, and weighting features appropriately. We apply the cognitive bias approach to feature set selection to four natural language learning problems and show that performance of the case-based learning algorithm improves significantly when relevant cognitive biases are incorporated into the baseline instance representation. We argue that the cognitive bias approach offers new possibilities for case-based learning of natural language: it simplifies the process of instance representation design and, in theory, obviates the need for separate instance representations for each linguistic knowledge acquisition task. More importantly, the approach offers a mechanism for explicitly combining the frequency information available from corpus-based techniques with cognitively-based preferences employed in traditional linguistic and knowledge-based approaches to natural language processing.

J	Argamon-Engelson, S; Dagan, I; Krymolowski, Y				Argamon-Engelson, S; Dagan, I; Krymolowski, Y			A memory-based approach to learning shallow natural language patterns	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						machine learning; natural language processing; statistical language processing; memory based learning; shallow parsing; chunking; noun-phrases; sequential patterns		Recognizing shallow linguistic patterns, such as basic syntactic relationships between words, is a common task in applied natural language and text processing. The common practice for approaching this task is by tedious manual definition of possible pattern structures, often in the form of regular expressions or finite automata. This paper presents a novel memory-based learning method that recognizes shallow patterns in new text based on a bracketed training corpus. The examples are stored as-is, in efficient data structures. Generalization is performed on-line at recognition time by comparing subsequences of the new text to positive and negative evidence in the corpus. This way, no information in the training is lost, as can happen in other learning systems that construct a single generalized model at the time of training. The paper presents experimental results: for recognizing noun phrase, subject-verb and verb-object patterns in English.

J	Pirrelli, V; Yvon, F				Pirrelli, V; Yvon, F			The hidden dimension: a paradigmatic view of data-driven NLP	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						data-driven NLP; memory-based learning; analogical language learning	ENGLISH; MODEL	Many tasks in language analysis are described as the maximally economic mapping of one level of linguistic representation onto another such level, Over the past decade, many different machine-learning strategies have been developed to automatically induce such mappings directly from data. In this paper, we contend that the way most learning algorithms have been applied to problems of language analysis reflects a strong bias towards a compositional (or biunique) model of interlevel mapping. Although this is justified in some cases, we contend that biunique inter-level mapping is not a jack of all trades. A model of analogical learning, based on a paradigmatic reanalysis of memorized data,is presented here. The methodological pros and cons of this approach are discussed in relation to a number of germane linguistic issues and illustrated in the context of three case studies: word pronunciation, word analysis, and word sense disambiguation, The evidence produced here seems to suggest that the brain is not designed to carry out the logically simplest and maximally economic way of relating form and function in language. Rather we propose a radical shift of emphasis in language learning from syntagmatic inter-level mapping to paradigmatically-constrained intra-level mapping.

J	Ramsey, MC; Chen, HC; Zhu, B				Ramsey, MC; Chen, HC; Zhu, B			A collection of visual thesauri for browsing large collections of geographic images	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article							INFORMATION; RETRIEVAL	Digital libraries of gee-spatial multimedia content are currently deficient in providing fuzzy, concept-based retrieval mechanisms to users. The main challenge is that indexing and thesaurus creation are extremely labor-intensive processes for text documents and especially for images. Recently, 800,000 declassified satellite photographs were made available by the United States Geological Survey. Additionally, millions of satellite and aerial photographs are archived in national and local map libraries. Such enormous collections make human indexing and thesaurus generation methods impossible to utilize. In this article we propose a scalable method to automatically generate visual thesauri of large collections of gee-spatial media using fuzzy, unsupervised machine-learning techniques.

We used TFIDF heuristics to determine term frequency and decision trees to evaluate the quality of sites. Training set for the decision tree contained manually evaluated websites. Each website was described by the combination of various attributes, complexity metrics and the evaluation. The intelligent search tool is equipped with a user-friendly interface, which enables people to exploit the tool to its limits with minimum effort, in their quest for information. For testing purposes, we looked for sites with telemedical content. The set of sites, which was the result of using the intelligent search tool, has been evaluated by a group of students.

The idea is to utilize the sequence of points explored during a search to guide further exploration. The proposed method is particularly suitable for continuous spaces with expensive evaluation functions, such as arise in engineering design. Empirical results in several engineering design domains demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of the GA optimizer.

A Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) model is presented which selects a portion of the available waste containers to process and groups them into processing batches. A machine learning approach was developed to improve optimization performance and extract useful knowledge by examining the optimization results for trends regarding which containers are selected. The learning process captured information about the containers that are usually selected. The optimization performance was not uniformly improved through biasing, indicating that simple biasing is not always effective. Additionally, an on-line method for determining which containers should be processed is described. The learning provides a mechanism for abstracting complex calculations into knowledge relevant to other organizational functions. This technique is applicable to selection-type problems where changes to the input data correspond to small changes in the optimization formulation.

J	Kim, T; Heald, CW				Kim, T; Heald, CW			Inducing inference rules for the classification of bovine mastitis	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						inference rules; machine learning; classification; mastitis	DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; COLIFORM MASTITIS; DAIRY-COWS; PREDICTION; SYSTEM	Mastitis, an inflammation within the mammary gland, can be a challenge to diagnose, based on dairy production records and on-farm observations, by the novice in the absence of culture results. The objective of this research was to establish a set of inference rules to classify bacterial causes of mastitis in dairy herds. Inductive inference utilizes specific observations about objects and an initial inductive hypothesis to obtain an inductive assertion that accounts for the observations. Interactive Dichotomizer 3 technology was used to create decision rules for classifying mastitis. It develops decision trees for discrete classification of data. The attributes adopted in this paper were lactation number, days in milk, persistency of milk production, number of severe cases, and average somatic cell count during the current lactation. The mastitis classification categories were divided into four logical groups based on common mastitis control schemes: no growth, contagious, environmental, and others. Causative organisms were determined by bacteriologic culturing of milk samples collected from 30 herds studied in the US. A total of 1253 sample records were selected to generate and test the rules. The established rules were tested using a randomly selected groups of 50 and 250 cows. The accuracy of mastitis classification using induced rules as compared with actual culture results ranged from 58 to 61%. The induced rules showed good potential for presumptive classification of mastitis based on production records. These diagnostic rules are easily implemented, lend themselves to computer analysis, and are easily understood by field practitioners and producers. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Chen, Z				Chen, Z			Knowledge acquisition assisted by CLIPS programming	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							EXPERT	Knowledge acquisition is important and machine learning techniques can be used to achieve automated knowledge acquisition. This article examines how knowledge acquisition can be assisted by programming using CLIPS (an acronym for C Language Integrated Production System). A machine learning preprocessor has been developed for the CLIPS environment, so that the CLIPS rule-base can be expanded by adding rules generated through machine learning techniques. The paper also shows how knowledge updating can be supported in the CLIPS environment itself. Operational engineering knowledge is captured in a data structure called a decision tree, and its structure can be updated when new knowledge is acquired. In addition, some advanced features are also briefly discussed, including using COOL (the CLIPS object-oriented language) for knowledge acquisition in a software product recommendation system, as well as the design of a self-evolving knowledge-acquisition tool.

J	Piramuthu, S				Piramuthu, S			Feature selection for financial credit-risk evaluation decisions	INFORMS JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article							NEURAL NETWORKS; TREES	Credit-risk evaluation decisions are important for the financial institutions involved due to the high level of risk associates with wrong decisions. Various machine learning methods have been shown to perform reasonably well for this complex and unstructured problem. However, selecting a "good" set of features to be used in any learning system is a hard problem. We survey recent developments in feature selection and propose a new methodology based on the "Blurring" measure. The proposed feature selection method (FSB) is used to preprocess input data for induced decision trees. Three financial credit-risk evaluation data sets are used to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. In addition to FSB, results from randomly selected features, features selected using the Patrick-Fisher probabilistic distance, measure, as well as no feature selection are provided for comparison purposes. Given the characteristics of the financial credit-risk evaluation domain, any improvement in classification performance is deemed beneficial. Preliminary results indicate that far comparable tree size, classification performance of FSB on classifying heretofore unseen examples is good compared to the other three methods evaluated in this study.

J	Gonzalez, A; Perez, R				Gonzalez, A; Perez, R			A study about the inclusion of linguistic hedges in a fuzzy rule learning algorithm	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF UNCERTAINTY FUZZINESS AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						machine learning; fuzzy rules; genetic algorithms; linguistic hedges	LOGIC-CONTROLLER; EXAMPLES	A very important problem associated with the use of learning algorithms consists of fixing the correct assignment of the initial domains for the predictive variables. In the fuzzy case, this problem is equivalent to define the fuzzy labels for each variable. In this work, we propose the inclusion in a learning algorithm, called SLAVE, of a particular kind of linguistic hedges as a way to modify the initial semantic of the labels. These linguistic hedges allow us both to learn and to tune fuzzy rules.

J	Wang, JTL; Rozen, S; Shapiro, BA; Shasha, D; Wang, ZY; Yin, MS				Wang, JTL; Rozen, S; Shapiro, BA; Shasha, D; Wang, ZY; Yin, MS			New techniques for DNA sequence classification	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						algorithms; consensus sequence; DNA sequence recognition; pattern matching; tools for computational biology	ESCHERICHIA-COLI PROMOTERS; MESSENGER-RNA PRECURSORS; NUCLEIC-ACID SEQUENCES; PROTEIN SEQUENCES; BINDING SITES; RECOGNITION; IDENTIFICATION; PREDICTION; SEARCH; SIMILARITY	DNA sequence classification is the activity of determining whether or not an unlabeled sequence S belongs to an existing class C. This paper proposes two new techniques for DNA sequence classification. The first technique works by comparing the unlabeled sequence S with a group of active motifs discovered from the elements of C and by distinction with elements outside of C. The second technique generates and matches gapped fingerprints of S with elements of C. Experimental results obtained by running these algorithms on long and well conserved Alu sequences demonstrate the good performance of the presented methods compared with FASTA. When applied to less conserved and relatively short functional sites such as splice-junctions, a variation of the second technique combining fingerprinting with consensus sequence analysis gives better results than the current classifiers employing text compression and machine learning algorithms.

A set of recorded elbow and shoulder trajectories is used in a learning algorithm to determine the relationships between angular velocities at elbow and shoulder joints, The learning algorithm is based on optimal criteria for obtaining the hierarchy of descriptions of movement trajectories. We show that this method finds complex synergism between optimal joint trajectories for a given set of data and angular velocities at the shoulder and elbow joints. Three other machine learning techniques (ML) are used for comparison with our method of hierarchical clustering of trajectories. These MLs are: (1) radial basis functions (RBF), (2) inductive learning (IL), and (3) adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Better error characteristics were obtained using the method of hierarchical clustering in comparison with the other techniques. The advantage of the method of hierarchical clustering with respect to the other MLs is in integrating the spatial and temporal elements of reaching movements. Determination and analysis of spatio-temporal events of movement trajectories is a useful tool in designing control systems for functional electrical stimulation (FES) assisted manipulation.

The methods were evaluated in the diagnosis of female urinary incontinence in terms of prediction accuracy of classifiers, on the basis of patient data. The best methods were discriminant analysis, logistic regression, C4.5 a nd Galactica. Practically no statistically significant differences existed between the prediction accuracy of these classification methods. We consider that machine-learning systems C4.5 and Galactica are preferable for automatic construction of medical decision aids, because they can cope with missing data values directly and can present a classifier in a comprehensible form. Galactica performed nearly as well as C4.5, The results are in agreement with the results of earlier research, indicating that genetic algorithms are a competitive method for constructing classifiers from medical data.

J	Long, PM; Natsev, AI; Vitter, JS				Long, PM; Natsev, AI; Vitter, JS			Text compression via alphabet re-representation	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						text compression; alphabet re-representation; neural networks; machine learning; over-fitting		This article introduces the concept of alphabet re-representation in the context of text compression. We consider re-representing the alphabet so that a representation of a character reflects its properties as a predictor of future rest. This enables us to use an estimator from a restricted class to map contexts to predictions of upcoming characters. We describe an algorithm that uses this idea in conjunction with neural networks. The performance of our implementation is compared to other compression methods, such as UNIX compress, gzip, PPMC, and an alternative neural network approach. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Ghuloum, AM; Sage, CR; Jain, AN				Ghuloum, AM; Sage, CR; Jain, AN			Molecular hashkeys: A novel method for molecular characterization and its application for predicting important pharmaceutical properties of molecules	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PARTITION-COEFFICIENT; THYMIDYLATE SYNTHASE; SURFACE PROPERTIES; DRUG DESIGN; BINDING; DESCRIPTORS; ABSORPTION; INHIBITORS; RECEPTOR; COMPASS	We define a novel numerical molecular representation, called the molecular hashkey, that captures sufficient information about a molecule to predict pharmaceutically interesting properties directly from three-dimensional molecular structure. The molecular hashkey represents molecular surface properties as a linear array of pairwise surface-based comparisons of the target molecule against a common 'basis-set' of molecules. Hashkey-measured molecular similarity correlates well with direct methods of measuring molecular surface similarity. Using a simple machine-learning technique with the molecular hashkeys, we show that it is possible to accurately predict the octanol-water partition coefficient, log P. Using more sophisticated learning techniques, we show that an accurate model of intestinal absorption for a set of drugs can be constructed using the same hashkeys used in the aforementioned experiments. Once a set of molecular hashkeys is calculated, its use in the training and testing of property-based models is very fast. Further, the required amount of data for model construction is very small. Neural network-based hashkey models trained on data sets as small as 30 molecules yield statistically significant prediction of molecular properties. The lack of a requirement for large data sets lends itself well to the prediction of pharmaceutically relevant molecular parameters for which data generation is expensive and slow. Molecular hashkeys coupled with machine-learning techniques can yield models that predict key pharmacological aspects of biologically important molecules and should therefore be important in the design of effective therapeutics.

J	Cohen, WW; Fan, W				Cohen, WW; Fan, W			Learning page-independent heuristics for extracting data from Web pages	COMPUTER NETWORKS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKING			English	Article						information integration; machine learning; extraction		One bottleneck in implementing a system that intelligently queries the Web is developing 'wrappers' - programs that extract data from Web pages. Here we describe a method for learning general, page-independent heuristics for extracting data from HTML documents. The input to our learning system is a set of working wrapper programs, paired with HTML pages they correctly wrap. The output is a general procedure for extracting data that works for many formats and many pages. In experiments with a collection of 84 constrained but realistic extraction problems, we demonstrate that 30% of the problems can be handled perfectly by learned extraction heuristics, and around 50% can be handled acceptably. We also demonstrate that learned page-independent extraction heuristics can substantially improve the performance of methods for learning page-specific wrappers.

A program accepts a large training set of program material in a conventional compiler intermediate representation (IR) and automatically infers a decision tree that separates IR code into streams that compress much better than the undifferentiated whole. Driving a conventional arithmetic compressor with this model yields code 30% smaller than the previous record for IR code compression, and 24% smaller than an ambitious optimizing compiler feeding an ambitious general-purpose data compressor.

Discriminant analysis identified that the most important species in discriminating among station-groups in terms of numbers were: Pagellus erythrinus, Mullus barbatus, Mullus surmuletus, Diplodus annular-is, Spicara flexuosa, Sardina pilchardus and Parapenaeus longirostris. In terms of weight, the most important discriminating species were: Mullus barbatus, Pagellus erythrinus, Spicara maena, Scyliorhinus canicula, Loligo vulgaris and Parapenaeus longirostris. Supervised machine learning approaches and, in particular, the decision tree construction method were utilized in order to induce rules which determine the station-grouping. Several species, notably, Argentina sphyraena, Aristaeomorpha foliacea, Lepidorhombus bosci, Lepidotrigla cavillone, Mullus barbatus, Serranus cabrilla and Sepia officinalis appeared in most of the rules.

The four diagnostic levels consist of evaluation of signs and symptoms of the disease and ECG (electrocardiogram) at rest, sequential ECG testing during the controlled exercise, myocardial scintigraphy, and finally coronary angiography (which is considered to be the reference method). Machine learning methods may enable objective interpretation of all available results for the same patient and in this way may increase the diagnostic accuracy of each step. We conducted many experiments with various learning algorithms and achieved the performance level comparable to that of clinicians. We also extended the algorithms to deal with non-uniform misclassification costs in order to perform ROC analysis and control the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. The ROC analysis shows significant improvements of sensitivity and specificity compared to the performance of the clinicians. We further compare the predictive power of standard tests with that of machine learning techniques and show that it can be significantly improved in this way. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Dementia staging in clinical settings is at present complex and highly subjective because of the ambiguities and the complicated nature of existing guidelines. Our model abstracts the two-stage process used by physicians to arrive at the global Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDRS) score. The model incorporates learning intermediate concepts (CDRS category scores) in the first stage that then become the feature space for the second stage (global CDRS score). The sample consisted of 678 patients evaluated in the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the University of California, Irvine. The demographic variables, functional and cognitive test results used by physicians for the task of dementia severity staging were used as input to the machine learning algorithms. Decision tree learners and rule inducers (C4.5, Cart, C4.5 rules) were selected for our study as they give expressive models, and Naive Bayes was used as a baseline algorithm for comparison purposes. We first learned the six CDRS category scores (memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, personal care, home and hobbies, and community affairs). These learned CDRS category scores were then used to learn the global CDRS scores. The Two-Stage ML model classified as well as or better than the published inter-rater agreements for both the category and global CDRS scoring by dementia experts. Furthermore, for the most critical distinction, normal versus very mildly impaired, the Two-Stage ML model was 28.1 and 6.6% more accurate than published performances by domain experts. Our study of the CDRS examined one of the largest, most diverse samples in the literature, suggesting that our findings are robust. The Two-Stage ML model also identified a CDRS category, Judgment and Problem Solving, which has low classification accuracy similar to published reports. Since this CDRS category appears to be mainly responsible for misclassification of the global CDRS score when it occurs, further attribute and algorithm research on the Judgment and Problem Solving CDRS score could improve its accuracy as well as that of the global CDRS score.

J	Anandarajan, M; Anandarajan, A				Anandarajan, M; Anandarajan, A			A comparison of machine learning techniques with a qualitative response model for auditor's going concern reporting	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						non-going concern; multiple discriminant analysis; expert systems	DECISION; DEFAULT	Audit reports can take the form of a non-going concern (clean) report or Going concern (financial distress) report. If a firm is facing going concern uncertainty problems the auditor has a further choice of issuing two types of audit reports, namely the modified report or the disclaimer report. The issuance of the wrong type of report can have consequences for the auditor. Prior studies have developed models in an attempt to predict the type of audit report that should be issued to clients. However, all these studies, without exception, focused on the decision whether to issue a non-going concern report or a going concern report. The present study extends this area of research by comparing three predictive models that can help facilitate the decision on the type of going concern report that should be issued. Two of the predictive models are on based machine learning techniques (Artificial Neural Networks and Expert Systems) while the third is a qualitative model (Multiple Discriminant Analysis). The validity of the models are tested by comparing their predictive ability of the type of audit report which should be issued to the client. The results of the study indicate that the artificial neural network model has a superior predictive ability in determining the type of going concern audit report that should be issued to the client.

Hong and Lee proposed a general learning method that automatically derives fuzzy if-then rules and membership functions from a set of given training examples using a decision table. All available attributes were included in the decision table and the initial membership functions for each attribute were built according to the predefined smallest unit. Although Hong and Lee's method accurately derives the fuzzy if-then rules and final membership functions, the decision table and the initial membership functions are complex if there are many attributes or if the predefined unit is small. We improve Hong and Lee's method by first selecting relevant attributes and building appropriate initial membership functions. These attributes and membership functions are then used in a decision table to derive final fuzzy if-then rules and membership functions. Experimental results on Iris data show that the proposed method effectively induces membership functions and fuzzy if-then rules. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The LBWA uses angular and linear positional changes and assigns weights to each of these based on the force sensing information from an assembly path and evolves a best move strategy for the robot to complete the task, The machine learning capability of the robot depends on the discretization of the force-torque information that is monitored and mapped for each position. Prior to commencing the move, the LBWA compares the evaluating functions. A tradeoff is to be made between the information space and the learning time for the robot in a real-life situation. Experimental results are presented to establish the effectiveness of the LBWA in training the robot.

We define an Abductive Learning Problem as an extended Inductive Logic Programming problem where both the background and target theories are abductive theories and where abductive derivability is used as the coverage relation instead of deductive derivability. The two main benefits of this integration are the possibility of learning in presence of incomplete knowledge and the increased expressive power of the background and target theories. We present the system LAP (Learning Abductive Programs) that is able to solve this extended learning problem and we describe, by means of examples, four different learning tasks that can be performed by the system: learning from incomplete knowledge, learning rules with exceptions, learning from integrity constraints and learning recursive predicates.

The: scenarios tested included a network incorporating: all features and two hybrids which combined the outputs of sub-networks corresponding to the image or non-image features. Average areas (A(z)) under the corresponding ROC curves were used as measures of performance. The network incorporating only image based features performed better (A(z)=0.81) than that using nonimage features (A(z) = 0.71). Both hybrid classifiers yielded better performance (A(z) = 0.85 for averaging and A(z) = 0.87 for logistic regression), but neither hybrid was as accurate as the network incorporating all features (A(z) = 0.89). This preliminary study suggests that, like human observers who concurrently consider different types of information, a single classifier that simultaneously evaluates both image and non-image information can achieve better diagnostic performance than the hybrid combinations considered here.

In this representation, the perception space is decomposed into a hierarchical set of worlds reflecting environments which are homogeneous in nature and which vary in complexity in an ordered manner. Each world is used to produce a corresponding decision tree which is trained incrementally. The instantaneous perception of the robot is used to select an appropriate rule from the decision tree and a sequence of rule activations form the complete trajectory. The ability to keep the knowledge complexity manageable and under control is an important aspect of the technique.

J	Cohen, WW; Singer, Y				Cohen, WW; Singer, Y			Context-sensitive learning methods for text categorization	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						algorithms; experimentation; context-sensitive models; mistake-driven algorithms; on-line learning; rule learning; text categorization	RETRIEVAL	Two recently implemented machine-learning algorithms, RIPPER and sleeping-experts for phrases, are evaluated on a number of large text categorization problems. These algorithms both construct classifiers that allow the "context" of a word w to affect how (or even whether) the presence or absence of w will contribute to a classification. However, RIPPER and sleeping-experts differ radically in many other respects: differences include different notions as to what constitutes a context, different ways of combining contexts to construct a classifier, different methods to search for a combination of contexts, and different criteria as to what contexts should be included in such a combination. In spite of these differences, both RIPPER and sleeping-experts perform extremely well across a wide variety of categorization problems, generally outperforming previously applied learning methods. We view this result as a confirmation of the usefulness of classifiers that represent contextual information.

The processes in this class are still Markovian of high order, but with memory of variable length yielding a much bigger and structurally richer class of models than ordinary high-order Markov chains. From an algorithmic view, the VLMC model class has attracted interest in information theory and machine learning, but statistical properties have not yet been explored. Provided that good estimation is available, the additional structural richness of the model class enhances predictive power by finding a better trade-off between model bias and variance and allowing better structural description which can be of specific interest. The latter is exemplified with some DNA data. A version of the tree-structured context algorithm, proposed by Rissanen in an information theoretical set-up is shown to have new good asymptotic properties for estimation in the class of VLMCs. This remains true even when the underlying model increases in dimensionality. Furthermore, consistent estimation of minimal state spaces and mixing properties of fitted models are given. We also propose a new bootstrap scheme based on fitted VLMCs. We show its validity for quite general stationary categorical time series and for a broad range of statistical procedures.

J	Colomb, RM				Colomb, RM			Representation of propositional expert systems as partial functions	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						propositional systems; machine learning; decision tables; decision trees; knowledge filtering		Propositional expert systems classify cases, and can be built in several different forms, including production rules, decision tables and decision trees. These forms are inter-translatable, but the translations are much larger than the originals, often unmanageably large. In this paper a method of controlling the size problem is demonstrated, based on induced partial functional dependencies, which makes the translations practical in a principled way. The set of dependencies can also be used to filter cases to be classified, eliminating spurious cases, and cases for which the classification is likely to be of doubtful validity.

This effectively decomposes the problem into smaller, less complex problems. The method is inspired by the Boolean function decomposition approach to the design of switching circuits. To cope with high time complexity of finding an optimal decomposition, we propose a suboptimal heuristic algorithm. The method, implemented in program HINT(Hierarchy INduction Tool), is experimentally evaluated using a set of artificial and real-world learning problems. In particular, the evaluation addresses the generalization property of decomposition and its capability to discover meaningful hierarchies. The experiments show that HINT performs well in both respects. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

For general English text at least, this is often thought to be a solved problem, with manually-derived linguistic rules assumed capable of handling "novel" words missing from the system dictionary. Data-driven methods, based on machine learning of the regularities implicit in a large pronouncing dictionary, have received considerable attention recently but are generally thought to perform less well. However, these tentative beliefs are at best uncertain without powerful methods for comparing text-to-phoneme subsystems. This paper contributes to the development of such methods by comparing the performance of four representative approaches to automatic phonemization on the same test dictionary. As well as rule-based approaches, three data-driven techniques are evaluated: pronunciation by analogy (PbA), NETspeak and IB1-IG (a modified k-nearest neighbour method). Issues involved in comparative evaluation are detailed and elucidated. The data-driven techniques outperform rules in accuracy of letter-to-phoneme translation by a very significant margin but require aligned text-phoneme training data and are slower. Best translation results are obtained with PbA at approximately 72% words correct on a resonably large pronouncing dictionary, compared with something like 26% words correct for the rules, indicating that automatic pronunciation of text is not a solved problem.

In this paper, an attempt has been made to focus on simulation tools as a means to expand interactivity. The first part deals with the understanding of interactivity. Then the use of simulation as a support for interactivity is developed. In this endeavor, the evolution of understanding of the role played by simulation tools for farm management decision-making has been considered crucial, based on experiments carried out in an interactive manner with both farmers and consultants. Finally, we introduce and discuss numerous potential opportunities provided by the new techniques through automatic machine learning and multi-agent modeling. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Despite its extensive applications, some features of DEA remain unexploited. We aim to show that DEA can be used to evaluate the efficiency of the system integration (SI) projects and suggest the methodology which overcomes the limitation of DEA through hybrid analysis utilizing DEA along with machine learning. In this methodology, we generate the rules for classifying new decision-making units (DMUs) into each tier and measure the degree of affecting the efficiencies of the DMUs. Finally, we determine the stepwise path for improving the efficiency of each inefficient DMU. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The use of computer algorithms to create new decision trees can improve efficiency and increase systematization in the field of microbiology. Preliminary results indicate that decision tree algorithms can create new structures that require fewer tests on average to reach a positive identification of an unknown organism. Including test time and cost factors can make further improvements, resulting in systems that are more time-efficient and/or cost-effective. Machine learning techniques can also create customized ID systems for specific applications. This paper will explain the induction of decision trees and show examples of their use in microbial ID.

The design of learning methods to learn concept descriptions in working with vague data is thus very important. In this paper, we apply fuzzy set concepts to machine learning to solve this problem. A fuzzy learning algorithm based on the maximum information gain is proposed to manage linguistic information. The proposed learning algorithm generates fuzzy rules from "soft" instances, which differ from conventional instances in that they have class membership values. Experiments on the Sports and the Iris Flower classification problems are presented to compare the accuracy of the proposed algorithm with those of some other learning algorithms. Experimental results show that the rules derived from our approach are simpler and yield higher accuracy than those from some other learning algorithms. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the approach proposed here, first, a set of prototypes is extracted during training and, then, a feedback learning algorithm is used to optimize the metric. Even if the prototypes are randomly selected, the proposed metric outperforms, both in compression rate and accuracy, common editing procedures like ICA, RNN, and PNN. Finally, when accuracy is the major concern, we show how compression can be traded for accuracy by exploiting voting techniques. That indicates how voting can be successfully integrated with instance-bases approaches, overcoming previous negative results.

We take both "performance" and "computer systems" quite generally. We assume that samples of performance data are available both in real-time and also historically from past normal performance of the target system. In addition we assume that there is some vector space and each sample is a point in that vector space. Detections are made by comparing the most recent sample of data with the historical data, thus yielding detections in real-time which are adaptive to the particular target system. Our techniques are probabilistic but are distribution-free and otherwise make relatively mild assumptions. We present some supporting mathematics that shows how to select the false alarm rate. We address detection rate with a general theorem and also with a specific simulation experiment. The data used can be of wide variety, possibly finely grained, and can be collected from hardware, system software, software subsystems, applications, or distributed applications. Our techniques may be of value in various aspects of future computer systems and in other systems as well. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Schweitzer, H				Schweitzer, H			Precise induction from statistical data	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						induction; data-mining; machine-learning; PAC-learning		In inductive reasoning one uses a small set of examined instances to infer global relations. The standard approach is to search for relations that can be verified in all the examined instances, and hypothesize that they hold globally Relations that hold only for a subset of the examined instances were previously used only for statistical inference. In this paper it is shown that this statistical information can also be used to infer relations that hold for all instances. The main result is an algorithm that uses statistics to infer Boolean predicates. The analysis includes an investigation of what statistics are relevant for such inference, and what predicates can be inferred.	Univ Texas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA							Abu-Mostafa Y.

We report a study that demonstrates the integration of these approaches can both improve the accuracy of the developed knowledge base and reduce development time. In addition, we found that users expected the expert systems created through the integrated approach to have higher accuracy than those created without machine learning and rated the integrated approach less difficult to use. They also provided favorable evaluations of both the specific integrated software, a system called The Knowledge Factory, and of the general value of machine learning for knowledge acquisition.

Since the accuracy is unknown, we must use the parameter value that makes them weakest (50% accuracy) to be certain that the bounds are valid. For accurate classifiers, we show that the following process can give stronger bounds. First use the Hoeffding method to derive a loose bound. Then restrict the parameter value to the range of the loose bound to produce a stronger bound. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This quantum example oracle is a natural extension of the traditional PAC example oracle, and it immediately follows that all PAC-learnable function classes are learnable in the quantum model. Furthermore, we obtain positive quantum learning results for classes that are not known to be PAC learnable. Specifically, we show that disjunctive normal form (DNF) is efficiently learnable with respect to the uniform distribution by a quantum algorithm using a quantum example oracle. While it was already known that DNF is uniform-learnable using a membership oracle, we prove that a quantum example oracle with respect to uniform is less powerful than a membership oracle.

However, the high cost of this approach and the availability of alternative Knowledge Sources has lead to an increasing use of automatic acquisition approaches. In this paper we present M-TURBIO, a Text-Based Intelligent System (TBIS) that extracts information contained in restricted-domain documents. The system acquires part of its knowledge about the structure of the documents and the way the information is presented (i.e., syntactic-semantic rules) from a training set of these.

J	Pearce, AR; Caelli, T				Pearce, AR; Caelli, T			Interactively matching hand-drawings using induction	COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING			English	Article							STRUCTURAL DESCRIPTIONS; CHARACTER-RECOGNITION; OBJECT RECOGNITION; MODEL	In this paper we consider the task of matching patterns, as occur in hand-drawn symbols and schematic diagrams, by their parts and relationships. Of particular interest for computer vision is the integration of two approaches to the recognition by parts problem-graph matching and syntactic rule-based approaches. A new procedure is developed, named CLARET, which matches parts and relationships by tightly coupling the processes of matching and rule generation at run time. We have developed an interactive system for interpreting hand-drawn symbols and schematic drawings. The system operates invariant to rotation, scale, and position and projects images onto a drawing canvas. The procedure is analyzed for its ability to accommodate new symbols and answer orientation queries, and it is compared empirically with machine learning techniques. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

This approach identifies the relevant variables that influence the success of these mediation efforts as well as the relationships among these variables in influencing mediation outcomes. The framework incorporates techniques that have been developed under the rubric of machine learning, specifically feature selection and induced decision trees. In addition to confirming some results from previous studies, results from this study provide new insights on some of the most important factors affecting international mediation.

The habitat models included single and multiple species artificial neural networks for red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus) and marsh wren (Cistothorus palustris). Data for the study came from two diked wetland basins on southwestern Lake Erie, USA. The single species artificial neural network model performed better than the logistic regression model except in the presence of interspecific interaction with marsh wren. A multiple species habitat model was developed using data from one basin that included both nesting red-winged blackbirds and marsh wrens. The multiple species neural network model performed better than the logistic regression model in the presence of interspecific interaction and could simultaneously predict the nest locations of both species. Using neural interpretation diagrams, relevances, and sensitivity analyses, we determined the mechanisms of habitat selection in red-winged blackbirds and marsh wrens. Habitat selection in marsh-breeding bird species was a non-linear process that could not be sufficiently understood in terms of general linear models. The non-linear structure of the neural network model not only predicts habitat selection better, but with a critical evaluation through neural interpretation diagrams, relevances and sensitivity analyses can lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of habitat selection. As predictive tools single species neural network models were too specific in cases where the system changed to include interacting species. In these cases linear models might be better predictors but not necessarily provide a better understanding. In the presence of two interacting species we suggest the use of a neural network model that is trained with a data set from a wetland where all the interacting species are present. In the absence of the interacting species the dynamics will change and habitat selection can be based on an entirely different set of rules and relationships. Therefore, the decision on which neural network model to use must be based on an in-depth understanding of the ecology of the system under study. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper presents three supervised machine learning (ML) techniques for prediction of the activation patterns of muscles and sensory data, based on the history of sensory data, for walking assisted by a functional electrical stimulation (FES), Those ML's are: 1) a multilayer perceptron with Levenberg-Marquardt modification of backpropagation learning algorithm; 2) an adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS); and 3) a combination of an entropy minimization type of inductive learning (IL) technique and a radial basis function (RBF) type of artificial neural network with orthogonal least squares learning algorithm. Here we show the prediction of the activation of the knee flexor muscles and the knee joint angle for seven consecutive strides based on the history of the knee joint angle and the ground reaction forces, The data used for training and testing of ML's was obtained from a simulation of walking assisted with an FES system [39], The ability of generating rules for an FES controller was selected as the most important criterion when comparing the ML's. Other criteria such as generalization of results, computational complexity, and learning rate were also considered, The minimal number of rules and the most explicit and comprehensible rules were obtained by ANFIS. The best generalization was obtained by the IL and RBF network.

Then, spectral, spatial, and textural features for each region are generated from the thresholded image. Finally, gi,en these features as attributes, an unsupervised machine learning methodology called conceptual clustering is used to cluster the regions found in the image into N classes-thus, determining the number of classes in the image automatically. We have applied the technique successfully to ERS-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR), Landsat thematic mapper (TM), and NOAA advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) data of natural scenes.

J	Davis, R; Prieditis, A				Davis, R; Prieditis, A			Designing optimal sequential experiments for a Bayesian Classifier	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						machine learning; Bayesian classifiers; experimental design		As computing power has grown, the trend in experimental design has been from techniques requiring little computation towards techniques providing better, more general results at the cost of additional computation. This paper continues this trend presenting three new methods for designing experiments. A summary of previous work in experimental design is provided and used to show how these new methods generalize previous criteria and provide a more accurate analysis than prior methods. The first method generates experimental designs by maximizing the uncertainty of the experiment's result, while the remaining two methods minimize an approximation of the variance of a function of the parameters. The third method uses a computationally expensive discrete approximation to determine the variance. The methods are tested and compared using the logistic model and a Bayesian classifier. The results show that at the expense of greater computation. experimental designs more effective at reducing the uncertainty of the decision boundary of the Bayesian classifier can be generated.

In this paper. we propose two axioms for feature subset selection-sufficiency axiom and necessity axiom-based on which this link is formalized: The expected feature subset is the one which maximizes relevance. Finding the expected feature subset turns out to be NP-hard. We then devise a heuristic algorithm to find the expected subset which has a polynomial time complexity. The experimental results show that the algorithm finds good enough subset of features which, when presented to C4.5, results in better prediction accuracy.

J	Bartlett, LM; Andrews, JD				Bartlett, LM; Andrews, JD			Efficient basic event ordering schemes for fault tree analysis	QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						fault tree analysis; binary decision diagrams; variable ordering schemes	BINARY DECISION DIAGRAMS	Fault tree analysis is a commonly used means of assessing the system reliability performance in terms of its components' reliability characteristics. More recently, significant advances have been made in methodologies to analyse the fault tree diagram. The most successful of these developments has been the binary decision diagram (BDD) approach. The binary decision diagram approach has been shown to improve both the efficiency of determining the minimal cutsets of the fault tree and the accuracy of the calculation procedure used to determine the cop event parameters, To utilize the binary decision diagram approach, the fault tree structure is first converted to the BDD format. Implementing the conversion of the tree is relatively straightforward but requires the basic events of the tree to be placed in an ordering. The ordering scheme chosen is critical to the size of the BDD produced and hence the advantages of this technique, Alternative ordering schemes have been investigated and no one scheme is appropriate for every tree structure. The work presented in this paper takes a machine learning approach based on genetic algorithms to select the most appropriate ordering scheme. Features which describe a fault tree structure have been identified and these provide the inputs to the machine learning algorithm. A set of possible ordering schemes has been selected based on previous heuristic work, The objective of the work detailed in the paper is to predict the most efficient of the possible ordering alternatives from parameters which describe a fault tree structure.

As a result, prognostic models form an integral part of a number of systems supporting these tasks. Furthermore, prognostic models constitute instruments to evaluate the quality of health care and the consequences of health care policies by comparing predictions according to care norms with actual results. Approaches to developing prognostic models vary from using traditional probabilistic techniques, originating from the field of statistics, to more qualitative and model-based techniques, originating from the field of artificial intelligence (AI). In this paper, various approaches to constructing prognostic models, with emphasis on methods from the field of AI, are described and compared. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Faid, M; Missaoui, R; Godin, R				Faid, M; Missaoui, R; Godin, R			Knowledge discovery in complex objects	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						knowledge discovery; complex objects; concept lattice; concatenation of contexts; implication rule generation		Learning concepts and rules from structured (complex) objects is a quite challenging but very relevant problem in the area of machine learning and knowledge discovery. In order to take into account and exploit the semantic relationships that hold between atomic components of structured objects, we propose a knowledge discovery process, which starts from a set of complex objects to produce a set of related atomic objects (called contexts). The second step of the process makes use of the concatenation product to get a global context in which binary relations of individual contexts coexist with relations produced by the application of some operators to individual contexts. The last step permits the discovery of concepts and implication rules using the concept lattice as a framework in order to discover and interpret nontrivial concepts and rules that may relate different components of complex objects. This paper focuses on two main steps of the knowledge discovery process, namely data mining and interpretation.

The first is the construction of interactive knowledge acquisition tools and the second is the development of machine learning; methods that automate this procedure. The tool presented here is interactive and gives experts the ability to evaluate an expert system and provide their own diagnoses on specific problems, when the expert system behaves erroneously. We also present a database scheme that supports the collection of specific instances. The second aspect of the tool is that knowledge base refinement and machine learning methods can be applied to the database, in order to automate the procedure refining the knowledge base. In this paper we examine the application of inductive learning algorithms within The proposed framework. Our main goal is to encourage the experts to evaluate expert systems and to introduce new knowledge, based on their experience.

J	Shin, KS; Han, I				Shin, KS; Han, I			Case-based reasoning supported by genetic algorithms for corporate bond rating	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						hybrid system; case-based reasoning; genetic algorithms; corporate bond rating	SYSTEMS; MODELS	A critical issue in case-based reasoning (CBR) is to retrieve not just a similar past case but a usefully similar case to the problem. For this reason, the integration of domain knowledge into the case indexing and retrieving process is highly recommended in building a CBR system. However, this task is difficult to carry out as such knowledge often cannot be successfully and exhaustively captured and represented. This article utilizes a hybrid approach using genetic algorithms (GAs) to case-based retrieval process in an attempt to increase the overall classification accuracy. We propose a machine learning approach using GAs to find an optimal or near optimal weight vector for the attributes of cases in case indexing and retrieving. We apply this weight vector to the matching and ranking procedure of CBR. This GA-CBR integration reaps the benefits of both systems. The CBR technique provides analogical reasoning structures for experience-rich domains while GAs provide CBR with knowledge through machine learning. The proposed approach is demonstrated by applications to corporate bond rating. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Pendharkar, PC				Pendharkar, PC			A computational study on design and performance issues of multi-agent intelligent systems for dynamic scheduling environments	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						distributed artificial intelligence; genetic algorithms	GENETIC ALGORITHM	Multi-Agent Intelligent Systems (MAIS) are loosely-coupled network of problem solving systems that, whenever needed, work together with each other to dynamically solve problems that none of the system can individually solve. Among the advantages of the MAIS, when compared to the centralized systems, are increased reliability, faster problem solving, decreased communication, and more flexibility. Learning to coordinate the actions is one of the most important task in MAIS. In the current research, we use a widely reported dynamic job shop scheduling simulation model that uses distributed genetic learning of job scheduling strategies (Pendharkar, P.C., 1997.

Among the design issue and performance issues considered in this research are coordination between agents, number of agents, and frequency of learning.

J	Shin, CK; Park, SC				Shin, CK; Park, SC			Memory and neural network based expert system	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						machine learning; neural network; memory based reasoning	NEAREST-NEIGHBOR; ALGORITHMS	We suggest a hybrid expert system of memory and neural network based learning. Neural network (NN) and memory based reasoning (MBR) have common advantages over other learning strategies. NN and MBR can be directly applied to the classification and regression problem without additional transform mechanisms. They also have strength in learning the dynamic behavior of the system over a period of time. Unfortunately, they have an achilles tendon. The knowledge representation of NN is unreadable to human being and this 'black box' property restricts the application of NN to areas which needs proper explanations as well as precise predictions. On the other hand, MBR suffers from the feature-weighting problem. When MBR measures the distance between cases, some features should be treated more importantly than others. Although previous researchers provide several feature-weighting mechanisms to overcome the difficulty, those methods were mainly applicable only to the classification problem. In our hybrid system of NN and MBR, the feature weight set calculated from the trained neural network plays the core role in connecting both the learning strategies. Moreover, the explanation on prediction can be given by presenting the most similar cases from the case base. In this paper, we present the basic idea of the hybrid system. We also present an application example with a wafer yield prediction system for semiconductor manufacturing. Experimental results show that the hybrid system predicts the yield with relatively high accuracy and is capable of learning adaptively to changing behavior of the manufacturing system.

We intend to show that fuzzy logic introduces new elements in the identification process, mainly due to the facility to manage imprecise information. An inductive algorithm generating a set of fuzzy rules identifying the system will be achieved. The maximal structure of a fuzzy rule will be found using this algorithm.

J	Tajika, I; Takimoto, E; Maruoka, A				Tajika, I; Takimoto, E; Maruoka, A			An on-line prediction algorithm combining several prediction strategies in the shared bet model	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						on-line prediction model; prediction strategy; minimax strategy; weighted majority algorithm		One of the most important problems in machine learning is to predict a binary value by observing a sequence of outcomes, up to the present time step, generated from some unknown source. Vovk and Cesa-Bianchi ct al. independently proposed an on-line prediction model where prediction algorithms are assumed to be given a collection of prediction strategies called experts and hence be allowed to use the predictions they make. In this model, no assumption is made about the way the sequence of bits to be predicted is generated, and the performance of the algorithm is measured by the difference between the number of mistakes it makes on the bit sequence and the number of mistakes made by the best expert, on the same sequence. In this paper we extend the model by introducing a notion of investment. That is, both the prediction algorithm and the experts are required to make bets on their predictions at each time step, and the performance of the algorithm is now measured with respect to the total money lost, rather than the number of mistakes. We analyze our algorithms in the particular situation where all the experts share the same amount of bets at each time step. In this shared bet model, we give a prediction algorithm that is in some sense optimal but impractical, and we also give an efficient prediction algorithm that turns out to be nearly optimal.

J	Beritelli, F; Casale, S; Russo, M				Beritelli, F; Casale, S; Russo, M			A pattern recognition approach to robust voiced/unvoiced speech classification using fuzzy logic	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						speech classification; signal processing; mobile communications; fuzzy logic; soft computing; machine learning	VARIABLE-RATE	In the field of mobile communications new robust Voiced/Unvoiced (V/UV) classification algorithms are required in that correct voicing detection is a crucial point in the perceived quality and naturalness of a very low bit-fate speech coding system. The paper shows that a valid and more convenient alternative to deal with the problem of voicing decision is to use methodologies like fuzzy logic which are suitable for problems requiring approximate rather than exact solutions, and which can be represented through descriptive or qualitative expressions. The Fuzzy Voicing Detector proposed is based on a pattern recognition approach in which the matching phase is performed using three fuzzy rules. The rules have been obtained using FuGeNeSys, a new hybrid learning tool based on Genetic Algorithm and Neural Networks. The fuzzy classifier is computationally very simple and more efficient than traditional methods, which are affected by misclassification errors, above all in the presence of background noise.

J	Hamzei, GHS; Mulvaney, DJ; Sillitoe, IP				Hamzei, GHS; Mulvaney, DJ; Sillitoe, IP			Multi-layer hierarchical rule learning in reactive robot control using incremental decision trees	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & ROBOTIC SYSTEMS			English	Article						behaviour decomposition; behaviour learning; intelligent navigation; decision trees; ITI; machine learning; robotics		This paper presents a new approach to the intelligent navigation of a mobile robot. The hybrid control architecture described combines properties of purely reactive and behaviour-based systems, providing the ability both to learn automatically behaviours from inception, and to capture these in a distributed hierarchy of decision tree networks. The robot is first trained in the simplest world which has no obstacles, and is then trained in successively more complex worlds, using the knowledge acquired in the previous worlds. Each world representing the perceptual space is thus directly mapped on a unique rule layer which represents in turn the robot action space encoded in a distinct decision tree. A major advantage of the current implementation, compared with the previous work, is that the generated rules are easily understood by human users. The paper demonstrates that the proposed behavioural decomposition approach provides efficient management of complex knowledge, and that the learning mechanism is able to cope with noise and uncertainty in sensory data.

J	Golding, AR; Roth, D				Golding, AR; Roth, D			A Winnow-based approach to context-sensitive spelling correction	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						Winnow; multiplicative weight-update algorithms; context-sensitive spelling correction; Bayesian classifiers		A large class of machine-learning problems in natural language require the characterization of linguistic context. Two characteristic properties of such problems are that their feature space is of very high dimensionality, and their target concepts depend on only a small subset of the features in the space. Under such conditions, multiplicative weight-update algorithms such as Winnow have been shown to have exceptionally good theoretical properties. In the work reported here, we present an algorithm combining variants of Winnow and weighted-majority voting, and apply it to a problem in the aforementioned class: context-sensitive spelling correction. This is the task of fixing spelling errors that happen to result in valid words, such as substituting to for too, casual for causal, and so on. We evaluate our algorithm, WinSpell, by comparing it against BaySpell, a statistics-based method representing the state of the art for this task. We find: (1) When run with a full (unpruned) set of features, WinSpell achieves accuracies significantly higher than BaySpell was able to achieve in either the pruned or unpruned condition; (2) When compared with other systems in the literature, WinSpell exhibits the highest performance: (3) While several aspects of WinSpell's architecture contribute to its superiority over Bay Spell, the primary factor is that it is able to learn a better linear separator than BaySpell learns: (4) When run on a test set drawn from a different corpus than the training set was drawn from, WinSpell is better able than BaySpell to adapt, using a strategy we will present that combines supervised learning on the training set with unsupervised learning on the (noisy) test set.

First, we construct a single decision tree to estimate modification probabilities: how one phrase tends to modify another. Next, we introduce a boosting algorithm in which several decision trees are constructed and then combined for probability estimation. The constructed parsers are evaluated using the EDR Japanese annotated corpus. The single-tree method significantly outperforms the conventional Japanese stochastic methods, Moreover, the boosted version of the parser is shown to have great advantages; (1) a better parsing accuracy than its single-tree counterpart for any amount of training data and (2) no over-fitting to data for various iterations. The presented parser, the first non-English stochastic parser with practical performance, should tighten the coupling between natural language processing and machine learning.

J	Ratnaparkhi, A				Ratnaparkhi, A			Learning to parse natural language with maximum entropy models	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						maximum entropy models; natural language processing; parsing		This paper presents a machine learning system for parsing natural language that learns from manually parsed example sentences, and parses unseen data at state-of-the-art accuracies. Its machine learning technology, based on the maximum entropy framework, is highly reusable and not specific to the parsing problem, while the linguistic hints that it uses to learn can be specified concisely. It therefore requires a minimal amount of human effort and linguistic knowledge for its construction. In practice, the running time of the parser on a test sentence is linear with respect to the sentence length. We also demonstrate that the parser can train from other domains without modification to the modeling framework or the linguistic hints it uses to learn. Furthermore, this paper shows that research into rescoring the top 20 parses returned by the parser might yield accuracies dramatically higher than the state-of-the-art.

J	Gershenfeld, N; Schoner, B; Metois, E				Gershenfeld, N; Schoner, B; Metois, E			Cluster-weighted modelling for time-series analysis	NATURE			English	Article							EM ALGORITHM; MIXTURES; EXPERTS	The need to characterize and forecast time series recurs throughout the sciences, but the complexity of the real world is poorly described by the traditional techniques of linear time-series analysis. Although newer methods can provide remarkable insights into particular domains, they still make restrictive assumptions about the data, the analyst, or the application(1). Here we show that signals that are nonlinear, non-stationary, non-gaussian, and discontinuous can be described by expanding the probabilistic dependence of the future on the past around local models of their relationship. The predictors derived from this general framework have the form of the global combinations of local functions that are used in statistics(2-4), machine learning(5-10) and studies of nonlinear dynamics(11,12). Our method offers forecasts of errors in prediction and model estimation, provides a transparent architecture with meaningful parameters, and has straightforward implementations for offline and online applications, We demonstrate our approach by applying it to data obtained from a pseudo-random dynamic;al system, from a fluctuating laser, and from a bowed violin.

Beside the well-known benefit that students can read the courseware at any place and time, WWW provides another advantage for teachers. That is, the learning behavior of students can be recorded in the web log. Teachers can reorganize the log to obtain students learning portfolios. Hence, they can use the teaming portfolios to analyze and predict students' learning performance. However, in doing so, teachers must still make great efforts to process the web log to discover the relationship between the learning portfolios and learning performance. This paper proposes a methodology to assist teachers in discovering potential rules of performance from web based learning portfolios using database systems and decision tree machine learning technologies. Consequently, teacher can identify the students who will probably have learning problems and stipulate proper strategies for these students in early stage. At the same time, the discovered rules can provide teachers evidence to reflect teaching strategies and suggest the learning direction to students.

The main advantage of the use of approaches that apply machine learning algorithms to economic data is that forecasts largely free of assumptions can be made. This study presents an approach to macro economic forecasting that generates fuzzy rules from data using a fuzzy control system architecture and evolutionary programming. However, the selection of a defuzification method is typically performed subjectively in fuzzy control systems. We demonstrate that the selection of defuzification method makes a substantial impact on forecasts. In order to overcome this subjectivity and further enhance our objectives of developing forecasting systems free of any technical or theoretical assumptions we introduce a neural network to perform the defuzification. The performance of our approach compares very favourably with other data mining techniques on cross validation tests with macro economic data.

The evolved programs use a feature set computed from a square input field large enough to contain each of objects of interest and are applied, in moving window fashion, over the large pictures in order to locate the objects of interest. The fitness function is based on the detection rate and the false alarm rate. We have tested the method on three object detection problems of increasing difficulty with four different classes of interest. On pictures of easy and medium difficulty all objects are detected with no false alarms. On difficult pictures there are still significant numbers of errors, however the results are considerably better than those of a neural network based program for the same problems.

SPIE, AIPR, Execut Comm		Algorithm Quasi-Optimal (AQ); Decision Tree (DT); machine learning; pattern recognition; Principle Component Analysis (PCA); SAR images; whitening transformation		Machine Learning (ML) is the computational study of algorithms that improve performance based on experience learned from examples. Since machine learning technique provides new learning methodologies capable of dealing with the complexities of input signals (imagery), pattern recognition (PR) investigates the applicability of modern machine learning methods to develop recognition systems with learning capabilities. This paper introduces two machine learning techniques Algorithm Quasi-optimal (AQ) and Decision Tree (DT) as the classifiers far undertaking pattern recognition task. Both learn the 2D signal introduced from MSTAR SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) imagery database consisting of three classes of combat vehicles - BMP-2, BTR-70, and T-72 tank. 67 images drawn from the database with similar aspect (+/- 15 degrees) are used for training the classifiers while unseen 47 images are used for testing. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) method and whitening transformation are used to reduce the dimensionality of input vector from 465 extracted features doum to 30 features. We report three experimental results -(i) DT to Learn from the original 465 features without using PCA, (ii) DT algorithm with the use of PCA for reducing input dimensionality, and (iii) AQ algorithm to learn the input features with PCA. The results show that the AQ has better performance than BT in terms of faster learning and higher recognition accuracy when the PCA and whitening transformation are applied.

Recently promising approaches using parallel and distributed computing have been presented. In this paper, we consider an approach that uses classifiers trained on a number of data subsets in parallel as in the arbiter meta-learning technique. We suggest that information is collected during the learning phase about the performance of the included base classifiers and arbiters and that this information is used during the application phase to select the best classifier dynamically. We evaluate our technique and compare it with the simple arbiter meta-learning using selected data sets from the UCI machine learning repository. The comparison results show that our dynamic meta-learning technique outperforms the arbiter meta-learning significantly in some cases but further profound analysis is needed to draw general conclusions.

Different parameters (current, mass and resistance) were collected simultaneously. Then these laboratory measurements are used by an algorithm software as a logged data file, resulting in to inducing a decision tree. Later, a systematic software is designed based on the rules derived from this decision tree, to recognise the type of unknown solution used in the experiment. This is a new approach to data acquisition in chemical industries involving conducting polymers. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

S	Sebban, M; Richard, G		Hand, DJ; Kok, JN; Berthold, MR		Sebban, M; Richard, G			From theoretical learnability to statistical measures of the learnable	ADVANCES IN INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd International Symposium on Advances in Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA 99)	AUG 09-11, 1999	AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS					The main focus of theoretical models for machine learning is to formally describe what is the meaning of learnable, what is a learning process, or what is the relationship between a learning agent and a teaching one. However, when we prove from a theoretical point of view that a concept is learnable, we have no a priori idea concerning the difficulty to learn the target concept. In this paper, after reminding some theoretical concepts and the main estimation methods, we provide a learning-system independent measure of the difficulty to learn a concept. It is based on geometrical and statistical concepts, and the implicit assumption that distinct classes occupy distinct regions in the feature space. In such a context, we assume the learnability to be identify by the separability level in the feature space. Our definition is constructive, based on a statistical test and has been implemented on problems of the UCI repository. The results are really convincing and fit well with theoretical results and intuition. Finally, in order to reduce the computational costs of our approach, we propose a new way to characterize the geometrical regions using a k-Nearest-Neighbors graph. We experimentally show that it allows to compute accuracy estimates near from those obtained by a leave-one-out-cross-validation and with smaller standard deviation.

Bridging machine learning and cognitive science perspectives, I present both theoretical analysis and an empirical study with human subjects for the simple task of learning concepts corresponding to axis-aligned rectangles in a multidimensional feature space. Existing learning models, when applied to this task, cannot explain how subjects generalize from only a few examples of the concept. I propose a principled Bayesian model based on the assumption that the examples are a random sample from the concept to be learned. The model gives precise fits to human behavior on this simple task and provides qualitative insights into more complex, realistic cases of concept learning.

Two different domains are explored: recognition of two-handed motions in the martial art 'Tai Chi', and multiple-person interactions in a visual surveillance task. Our system combines top-down with bottom-up information using a feedback loop, and is formulated with a Bayesian framework. Two different graphical models (HMMs and Coupled HMMs) are used for modeling both individual actions and multiple-agent interactions, and CHMMs are shown to work more efficiently and accurately for a given amount of training. Finally, to overcome the limited amounts of training data, we demonstrate that 'synthetic agents' (Alife-style agents) can be used to develop flexible prior models of the person-to-person interactions.

The present study is to develop a cable-stayed bridge expert system of how knowledge in the cable-stayed bridges may be generated from hypothetical designs with machine learning for the parametric study processed as flexible as possible.

J	Flach, PA; Savnik, I				Flach, PA; Savnik, I			Database dependency discovery: a machine learning approach	AI COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						induction; attribute dependency; database reverse engineering; data mining	FUNCTIONAL-DEPENDENCIES	Database dependencies, such as functional and multivalued dependencies, express the presence of structure in database relations, that can be utilised in the database design process. The discovery of database dependencies can be viewed as an induction problem, in which general rules (dependencies) are obtained from specific facts (the relation). This viewpoint has the advantage of abstracting away as much as possible from the particulars of the dependencies. The algorithms in this paper are designed such that they can easily be generalised to other kinds of dependencies. Like in current approaches to computational induction such as inductive logic programming, we distinguish between top-down algorithms and bottom-up algorithms. In a top-down approach, hypotheses are generated in a systematic way and then tested against the given relation. In a bottom-up approach, the relation is inspected in order to see what dependencies it may satisfy or violate. We give a simple (but inefficient) top-down algorithm, a bi-directional algorithm, and a bottom-up algorithm. In the case of functional dependencies, these algorithms have been implemented in the FDEP system and evaluated experimentally. The bottom-up algorithm is the most efficient of the three, and also outperforms other algorithms from the literature.

Transforming the given representation of observations into a well-suited language L-E may ease learning such that a simple and efficient learning algorithm can solve the learning problem. Learnability is defined with respect to the representation of the output of learning, L-H If the predictive accuracy is the only criterion for the success of learning, the choice of L-H means to find the hypothesis space with most easily learnable concepts, which contains the solution. Additional criteria for the success of learning such as comprehensibility and embeddedness may ask for transformations of L-H such that users can easily interpret and other systems can easily exploit the learning results. Designing a language L-H that is optimal with respect to all the criteria is too difficult a task. Instead, we design families of representations, where each family member is well suited for a particular set of requirements, and implement transformations between the representations. In this paper, we discuss a representation family of Horn logic. Work on tailoring representations is illustrated by a robot application.

J	Krishnan, P; Long, PM; Vitter, JS				Krishnan, P; Long, PM; Vitter, JS			Adaptive disk spindown via optimal rent-to-buy in probabilistic environments	ALGORITHMICA			English	Article						mobile computing; on-line algorithms; machine learning; power conservation; disk spindown; rent-to-buy; multiprocessor spin/block; IP-over-ATM; virtual circuit holding time		In the single rent-to-buy decision problem, without a priori knowledge of the amount of time a resource will be used we need to decide when to buy the resource, given that we can rent the resource for $1 per unit time or buy it once and for all for $c. In this paper we study algorithms that make a sequence of single rent-to-buy decisions, using the assumption that the resource use times are independently drawn from an unknown probability distribution. Our study of this rent-to-buy problem is motivated by important systems applications, specifically, problems arising from deciding when to spindown disks to conserve energy in mobile computers [4], [13], [15], thread blocking decisions during lock acquisition in multiprocessor applications [7], and virtual circuit holding times in IP-over-ATM networks [11], [19]. We develop a provably optimal and computationally efficient algorithm for the rent-to-buy problem. Our algorithm uses O (root t) time and space, and its expected cost for the tth resource use converges to optimal as O (root logt/t), for any bounded probability distribution on the resource use times. Alternatively, using O(1) time and space, the algorithm almost converges to optimal. We describe the experimental results for the application of our algorithm to one of the motivating systems problems: the question of when to spindown a disk to save power in a mobile computer. Simulations using disk access traces obtained from an HP workstation environment suggest that our algorithm yields significantly improved power/response time performance over the nonadaptive 2-competitive algorithm which is optimal in the worst-case competitive analysis model.

In particular, this "knowledge acquisition bottleneck" has significantly slowed the development of intelligent educational software where the domain experts are teachers with little or no experience with knowledge engineering. However, recently there has been a growing recognition of the potential benefits that can be derived from the application of advances in the AI-related fields of machine learning and knowledge acquisition. In this paper, we discuss a full life cycle methodology for building educational agents that can be used in classrooms. This innovative approach synergistically combines methods from machine learning and knowledge acquisition, concepts from intelligent tutoring research and advances in skill assessment from educational research. The result has been a demonstrated methodology for building educational agents that utilizes a multistrategy apprenticeship learning approach, a multi-dimensional evaluation phase and a customized software toolkit that facilitates its application. This methodology has been successfully applied to develop three educational agents that act as indirect communicational channels between the educator and the student. Applied in the areas of American history and statistics, these agents generate test questions and provide tutoring through hints and explanations. One agent has been used to enhance the functionality of an existing educational software package, while the other two have been used in a stand-alone mode. This research demonstrates solutions to the problems involved in building intelligent educational software and prescribes a new approach that draws from the fields of artificial intelligence and educational research.

This is unfortunate, as AI can contribute greatly to the design of intelligent learning environments (ILEs). AI allows the use of more complex models of student behavior, and has the potential to decrease the cost and complexity of building instruction systems. Furthermore, ILEs can be made more adaptive in their interactions with students through the use of AI. We discuss reasons the field may be undergoing this shift in emphasis away from AI. We provide an overview of two promising techniques: machine learning and Bayesian networks. We then describe how these techniques have been applied to existing systems, and how they provide an advantage over traditional methods. We also discuss possible future extensions of these techniques. Finally, we conclude by examining how the use of these techniques changes the knowledge engineering requirements of building an ILE.

Many results, obtained from tests with substantial imperfections, must be integrated into a diagnostic conclusion about the probability of disease in a given patient. A practical approach to this problem is to estimate the pretest probability of disease, and the sensitivity and specificity of different diagnostic tests. With this information, test results can be analyzed by sequential use of Bayes' theorem of conditional probability. The calculated posttest probability is then used as a pretest probability for the next test. This results in a series of tests, where each test is performed independently. Its results may be interpreted with or without any knowledge of other test results. By using Machine Learning techniques for test result evaluation, this process can be almost completely automated. The computer can learn from previously diagnosed patients and apply the acquired knowledge to new patients. Different Machine Learning methods can be used for evaluation of each test result. They may assist the physician as a powerful tool for assistance in pretest probability estimation, interpretation of individual test results and in the final decision making. The presented approach has been successfully evaluated in practice in the problem of clinical diagnosis of coronary artery disease.

This is a retrospective study of 57 mild-to-moderately demented patients of African-American, Caucasian, Chinese, Hispanic, and Vietnamese origin and an equal number of age matched controls from a cross cultural pool, We used a Knowledge Discovery from Databases (KDD) approach. Decision tree learners (C4.5, CART), rule inducers (C4,5Rules, FOCL) and a reference classifier (Naive Bayes) were the machine learning algorithms used for model building. This study identified a clinically useful subset of CASI, consisting of only twenty Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) attributes-CASI-MMSE-M I, saving test time and cost, while maintaining or improving dementia screening accuracy. Also, the machine learning algorithms (in particular C4.5 and CART) gave stable clinically relevant models for the task of screening with CASI-MMSE-M....

To appropriately consider the follow-up time and censoring - both characteristic for survival data - we propose a weighting technique that lessens the impact of data from patients for which the event did not occur and have short follow-up times. A case study on prostate cancer recurrence shows that by incorporating this weighting technique the machine learning tools stand beside or even out perform modem statistical methods and may, by inducing symbolic recurrence models, provide further insight to relationships within the modeled data.

It is based on the windowed construction of dynamic explanatory models, whose evolution over time points to state changes. It has been developed to suit the needs of data monitoring in adult Intensive Care Unit, where data are highly heterogeneous. Changes in the built model are considered to reflect the underlying system state transitions, whether of intrinsic or exogenous origin. We apply this methodology after making choices based on field knowledge and ex-post corroborated assumptions. The results appear promising, although an extensive validation should be performed.

We present in this paper a new method that outperforms the prediction accuracy of each medical standard method by combining them using Machine Learning (ML) inspired classification approaches. We have used different Machine Learning algorithms to compare the accuracy of our new method with other existing approaches used by ML community. The new method is an hybrid made between the Nearest Neighbour and the Naive Bayes classification methods. Experimental results show that this new approach is better than any standard method used in the prediction of survival of ICU patients, and better than the combination of these medical approaches done by using standard ML algorithms.

Amer Soc Informat Sci				Rule learning algorithms, developed by traditional supervised machine learning research community, are being used as data analysis tools for generating accurate concept definitions, given a set of instances (pre-classified) and a goal-task (concept class). Most rule learners use straightforward data driven approaches using information theoretic principles to search for statistically defined "interesting" patterns in the data sets. There are two main drawbacks with such purely data driven approaches. First, they perform poorly when insufficient data is available. Second, when large training data sets are available they tend to generate many uninteresting patterns from data sets, and usually it is left to the domain expert to distinguish the "useful" pieces of information from the rest. The size of this problem (a data mining issue onto itself) suggests the need to guide the learning system's search to relevant sub spaces within the space of all possible hypotheses. This paper explores the utility of using prior domain knowledge (in the form of taxonomies over attributes, attribute values and concept classes) to constrain the rule learner's search by requiring it to be consistent with what is already known about the domain. Spreading Activation Learning (SAL) using marker propagation techniques introduced by Aronis and Provost (1994) is used to efficiently learn over taxonomically structured attributes and attribute values. An extension to the SAL methodology to handle rule learning over concept class values is presented. By representing the range of numeric (continuous) values for attributes in the farm of simplified IS A taxonomies, the SAL methodology is shown to be capable of handling numeric (continuous) attribute values. Large taxonomies over value sets (especially taxonomies over numeric value sets) usually result in too many redundant rules. This problem can be addressed by pruning the rule set using "rule interest" measures. The focus of this study is to explore the utility of taxonomic structures in rule learning and, in particular the use of taxonomic structures as a way of incorporating background knowledge in the rule learning process. Initial results obtained from an ongoing research work are presented.	Lycos Inc, Pittsburgh, PA USA							ARONIS JM, 1994, WORK NOT AAAI 94 WOR; Blake C.

B	Han, TD		Haseman, WD; Nazareth, DL		Han, TD			Automating reuse for systems design	ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS - PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIFTH AMERICAS CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS (AMCIS 1999)			English	Proceedings Paper	5th AIS Americas Conference on Information Systems	AUG 13-15, 1999	MILWAUKEE, WI	Assoc Informat Syst				Reuse is as an important approach to conceptual object-oriented design. A number of reusable artifacts and methodologies to use these artifacts have been developed that require the designer to select to a certain level of granularity and a certain paradigm. This makes retrieval and application of these artifacts difficult and prevents the simultaneous reuse of artifacts at different levels of granularity. The purpose of this research, therefore, is to develop an actionable approach to lowering barriers to reuse. The approach is materialized in automating the conceptual design stage of the systems development process by reusing a new kind of design artifacts, which we call design fragments, which are synthesized with analysis patterns. The goal of the study includes the development of machine learning algorithms generating reusable design fragments and effectively storing/retrieving them.

In this paper, we present a machine learning approach that helps to bootstrap the development of a larger case base from a small collection of marked-up case summaries. It uses the marked-up sentences as training examples to induce a classifier that labels incoming cases whether an indexing concept applies. We illustrate how domain knowledge and linguistic information can be integrated with a machine learning algorithm to improve performance. The paper presents experimental results which indicate the usefulness of learning from sentences and adding a thesaurus. We also consider the chances and limitations of leveraging the learned classifiers for full-text documents.

This paper investigates neural fuzzy-systems to support these processes, For the generation of patterns in the form of fuzzy rules it is necessary that an expert gives the linguistic terms of the chosen variables. For the validation of the generated rules the prognosis results are compared, which were achieved on the one hand by expert-formulated rules and on the other hand by rules generated by the neural fuzzy-system. The generated rules show a clearly better decision behaviour for a special problem in the breast cancer prognosis than the expert rules. An optimization for unsymmetrical costs is still to be made.

For example, the motion for a knife is different when it is used to slice a loaf of bread compared to when it is plunged into an object. In this paper, we explore two issues. The first issue involved the extraction and representation of dynamic components from a sequence of images such that they are representative of a specific action/function. The second issue involves the use of a machine learning technique and the extracted attributes in order to generate a classifier that is capable of classifying correctly the various categories of action/function based on information from motion (as indicated from the experimental results).

Research however has shown the purity of the cases to be of paramount importance to the success of the learning. Where some of the cases are flawed - misrepresenting reality - the resulting rules are likely to be unsound and in many cases unusable. This paper presents the current research on the Hydra system, an inductive system that can improve learning from multiple sources by discriminating against those that are suspected to be erroneous or intentionally misleading.

Transmission problem is characterized by high bandwidth vibration signals and oil analyze data which allow one to diagnose a wide variety of failures from relative few measurements. Unfortunately, viable simulation models do not exist for these systems and fault diagnosis cannot be solved by conventional approaches. Fault diagnosis encompasses a diverse collection of technologies and disciplines such as expert system, neural networks, fuzzy logic, machine learning. The key issue for all of these approaches is finding an effective representation for use in converting raw data to features, reasoning with these features and making recommendations consistent with the uncertainty in the measurements. In this project, neural networks and data fusion technology are introduced in the application of transmission system fault diagnosis.

In an earlier paper, we introduced a new IBL system over lattice theory called IGLUE which, significantly improve both complexity and efficiency of lattice-based learning systems. For this purpose, IGLUE used the entropy function to select lattice nodes, and the Mahanalobis distance as similarity measure. In this paper, we describe experiments we carried out to assess how well IGLUE with other similarity measures and selection functions performs on real problems. We combined three selection functions and three similarity measures, and thus ran nine experiments. We compared the performance of these combined strategies on a collection of machine-learning benchmarks. Empirical results indicated that IGLUE is able to achieve high classification accuracy in a variety of domains, whatever the selection function or the similarity measure. These new functions and measures highlight the importance of instance-based learning through lattice theory.

ART-based automatic generation of membership functions for fuzzy controllers in robotics	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Article							RULES	Designing fuzzy controllers involves both identifying suitable fuzzy dicretizations of the input and output spaces (number of fuzzy terms and related membership functions) and drawing effective rule bases (hopefully compact and complete). Learning from examples is a very efficient way for acquiring knowledge. Moreover, providing reliable examples is easier than directly designing and coding a control strategy. Supervised learning is therefore appealing for automatically building control systems. It may also be used as quick start-up for applications requiring further on-line learning (through reinforce-based techniques or processing of further appropriate examples). Supervised techniques for building rule bases from suitable examples generally rely on pre-defined fuzzy discretizations of the input and output spaces. This paper proposes the use of an ART-based neural architecture for identifying, starting from examples, an appropriate set of fuzzy terms and associated membership functions. These data are then used by an ID3-based machine learning algorithm for building fuzzy control rules. The ART framework provides fast convergence and incremental building of classes, gracefully accounting for the integration of new sample data. The whole chain (the neural architecture for building fuzzy discretizations and the machine learning algorithm for drawing fuzzy rules) has been proved on examples provided by several operators, with different skills, driving a real vehicle along the right-hand wall in an indoor environment. The obtained results are shown, discussed and compared with the performance of controllers using human defined fuzzy partitions.

This comes as a response to the difficulties of complete knowledge representation of term formation as a general set of rules. This paper is a continuation of our initial research into connectionist approaches to term recognition [13]. An extension to the Winner-take-all algorithm is proposed which uses exhaustive testing of weights to elucidate term and non-term forming clusters. This algorithm is applied to automatic term recognition. Initial experiments have shown improved results ranging between 1.31% and 5.86% after initial training.

This class of Algorithms requires an oracle with the ability to randomly select a consistent hypothesis according to some predefined distribution When trying to implement such an oracle, for the linear separators family of hypotheses, various problems should be solved. The major problem is time-complexity where the straight-forward Monte Carlo method takes exponential time. In this paper we address some of those problems and show how to convert them to the problems of sampling from convex bodies or approximating the volume of such bodies. We show that recent algorithms for approximating the volume of convex bodies and approximately uniformly sampling from convex bodies using random walks, can be used to solve this problem, and yield an efficient implementation far the QBC algorithm. This solution suggests a connection between random walks and certain properties known in machine learning such as epsilon-net and support vector machines. Working out this connection is left for future work.

J	Bredensteiner, EJ; Bennett, KP				Bredensteiner, EJ; Bennett, KP			Multicategory classification by support vector machines	COMPUTATIONAL OPTIMIZATION AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						support vector machines; linear programming; classification; data mining; machine learning	DIAGNOSIS; ALGORITHM	We examine the problem of how to discriminate between objects of three or more classes. Specifically, we investigate how two-class discrimination methods can be extended to the multiclass case. We show how the linear programming (LP) approaches based on the work of Mangasarian and quadratic programming (QP) approaches based on Vapnik's Support Vector Machine (SVM) can be combined to yield two new approaches to the multiclass problem. In LP multiclass discrimination, a single linear program is used to construct a piecewise-linear classification function. In our proposed multiclass SVM method, a single quadratic program is used to construct a piecewise-nonlinear classification function. Each piece of this function can take the form of a polynomial, a radial basis function, or even a neural network. For the k > 2-class problems, the SVM method as originally proposed required the construction of a two-class SVM to separate each class from the remaining classes. Similarily, k two-class linear programs can be used for the multiclass problem. We performed an empirical study of the original LP method, the proposed k LP method, the proposed single QP method and the original k QP methods. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

J	Wallace, CS; Dowe, DL				Wallace, CS; Dowe, DL			Minimum message length and Kolmogorov complexity	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article								The notion of algorithmic complexity was developed by Kolmogorov (1965) and Chaitin (1966) independently of one another and of Solomonoff's notion (1964) of algorithmic probability. Given a Turing machine T, the (prefix) algorithmic complexity of a string S is the length of the shortest input to T which would cause T to output S and stop. The Solomonoff probability of S given T is the probability that a random binary string of 0s and 1s will result in T producing an output having S as a prefix, We attempt to establish a parallel between a restricted (two-part) version of the Kolmogorov model and the minimum message length approach to statistical inference and machine learning of Wallace and Boulton (1968), in which an 'explanation' of a data string is modelled as a two-part message, the first part stating a general hypothesis about the data and the second encoding details of the data not implied by the hypothesis, Solomonoff's model is tailored to prediction rather than inference in that it considers not just the most likely explanation, but it also gives weights to all Explanations depending upon their posterior probability, However, as the amount of data increases, we typically expect the most likely explanation to have a dominant weighting in the prediction.

J	Morik, K; Pigeot, I; Robers, U				Morik, K; Pigeot, I; Robers, U			CORA - A knowledge-based system for the analysis of case-control studies	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						case control studies; knowledge based system; machine learning; odds ratio; simulation studies; statistical methods	ESTIMATOR	Carrying out a statistical analysis, the researcher is concerned with the problem of choosing an appropriate statistical technique from a large number of competing methods. Most common statistical software offer different methods for analysing the data without giving any support regarding the adequacy of a method for a particular data set. This paper outlines the main features of the computer system CORA which provides a statistical analysis of stratified contingency tables and additionally supports the researcher at the different steps of this analysis. Here, the support given by the system consists of two different aspects. On the one hand, the help system of CORA contains general information on the implemented statistical methods which can be obtained on request. On the other hand, an advice tool recommends an adequate statistical method which depends on the actual empirical case-control data to be analysed. To build up the advice tool, a set of rules being discovered by machine learning from simulation studies is integrated into the system CORA. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

In the companion paper [8], we present the main results of discussions at two workshops and at the first conference focusing on the notion of context. In this paper, we present a view of how context is considered in knowledge acquisition, machine learning, communication, and databases and ontologies. We describe the way in which context is moldeled and represented in the logic formalism and a rule-based formalism. We present briefly after some of the other approaches, and sum up the different points that may be of interest for modeling context effectively.

The first approach has been used with remarkable success. The latter approach yielded encouraging results in the past, but later results were not so useful, partly because of the limitations of current machine learning algorithms. The focus of this work is the study of techniques for distributed decision making and learning by Multi-Agent DEcision Systems (MADES), by means of their application to the development of a checkers playing program. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for knowledge based systems dedicated to checkers playing. Our aim is to show how the combination of several known models for checkers playing can be integrated into a MADES, that learns how to combine individual decisions, so that the MADES plays better than any of them, without "a priori" knowledge of the quality or area of expertise of each model. In our MADES, we integrate well known search algorithms along standard machine learning algorithms. We present results that clearly show that the team as a single entity plays better than any of its components working in isolation.

J	Englert, R				Englert, R			Acquisition of complex model knowledge by domain theory-controlled generalization	COMPUTING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	ISPRS Commission III Symposium on Object Recognition and Scene Classification from Multispectral and Multisensor Pixels	1998	OHIO			3D object reconstruction; machine learning; statistical analysis; data mining; generic scene knowledge; semantic modeling		Nearly all three-dimensional reconstruction methods lack proper model knowledge that reflects the scene. Model knowledge is required in order to reduce ambiguities which occur during the reconstruction process. It must comprise the scene and is therefore complex, and additionally difficult to acquire. In this paper we present an approach for the learning of complex model knowledge. A (large) sample set of three-dimensionally acquired buildings represented as graphs is generalized by the use of background knowledge. The background knowledge entails domain-specific knowledge and is utilized for the search guidance during the generalization process of EXRES. The generalization result is a distribution of relevant patterns which reduces ambiguities occurring in 3D object reconstruction (here: buildings). Three different applications for the 3D reconstruction of buildings from aerial images are executed whereas binary relations of so-called building atoms, namely tertiary nodes and faces, and building models are learned. These applications are evaluated based on (a) the estimated empirical generalization error and (b) the use of information coding theory and statistics by comparing the learned knowledge with non-available a priori knowledge.

In this paper, the BDA was referred to as the 'Photosynthetic Learning Algorithm (PLA)'. The PLA utilizes the rules governing the conversion of carbon molecules from one substance to another in the Benson-Calvin cycle and Photorespiration reactions. In this paper, the principles of the PLA are presented in detail. Neural network training was selected as a typical optimization or parameter estimation problem to demonstrate the performance of the PLA. The neural network model for the logical functions was successfully trained TSP was chosen to demonstrate the capability of photosynthetic Algorithm because it is a representative problem for a wide variety of combinatorial optimization problems where the solution space is all permutations of n objects. We see again that the photosynthetic algorithm has been able to find a good solution. Copyright (C) 1998 IFAC.

The learning algorithms represent three types of classifier: decision trees, neural networks and rule-based classifiers. The study performs data analysis and examines the effect of irrelevant attributes to explain the performance characteristics of the learning algorithms. The survey concludes with some general recommendations about the selection of public domain machine learning algorithms relative to the properties of the data examined.

Neural network (NN) and memory based reasoning (MBR) have common advantages over other learning strategies. NN and MBR can be directly applied to the classification and regression problem without additional transform mechanisms. They also have strength in learning the dynamic behavior of the system over the period in time. Unfortunately, they have shortcomings. The knowledge representation of NN is unreadable to human being acid this 'black box' property restricts the application of NN to areas which need proper explanations as well as precise predictions. On the other hand, MBR suffers from the feature weighting problem. When MBR measures the distance between cases, some features should be treated more importantly than others. Although previous researchers provide several feature weighting mechanisms to overcome the difficulty, those methods were mainly applicable only to the classification problem. In our hybrid system of NN and MBR, the feature weighs set calculated from the trained neural network plays the core role in connecting both of learning strategies. Moreover, the explanation on prediction can be given by presenting the most similar cases from the case base. In this paper, we present the basic idea of the hybrid system and preliminary experimental results. Experimental results show that the hybrid system predicts the yield with relatively high accuracy and has a distinct potential in feature selection.

An integration technique should be able to estimate and select the most appropriate component classifiers from the ensemble. We present two variations of an advanced dynamic integration technique with two distance metrics. The technique is one variation of the stacked generalization method with an assumption that each of the component classifiers is the best one inside a certain sub area of the whole domain area. Our technique includes two phases: the learning phase and the application phase. During the learning phase a performance matrix of each component classifier is derived using the instances of the training set. Each matrix thus includes in a way information concerning the "competence area" of the corresponding component classifier. These matrixes are used during the application phase to predict the performance of each component classifier in each new instance. The technique is evaluated on three data sets taken from the UCI machine learning repository, with which well-known classification methods have not worked very well. The comparison results show that our dynamic integration technique outperforms weighted voting and cross-validation majority techniques in some data sets.

These tools employ techniques that originate from research in various areas such as machine learning, statistical data analysis, and visualization. Each of these techniques makes assumptions concerning the composition of the data collection to be analyzed. If the particular data collection does not meet these assumptions well, the technique usually performs poorly. For example, decision tree tools, such as C4.5, rely on rectangular approximations, which do not perform too well if the boundaries between different classes have other shapes such as a 45 degree line or elliptical shapes. However, if we could find a transformation f that transforms the original attribute space into a space in which class boundaries are more rectangular better approximations could be obtained. In this paper, we address the problem of finding such transformations f. We describe the features of tool, called WOLS, whose goal is the discovery of good ingredients for such transformation functions f, which we call building blocks. The tool employs genetic programming and symbolic regression for this purpose. We also present and discuss the results of case studies in using the building block analysis tool in the areas of decision tree learning and regression analysis.

Each server is coupled with an object-oriented database and a computational engine such as a network of high-performance workstations. The database provides persistent storage and supports querying of the "mined" information. The computational engine provides parallel execution of expensive image processing, object recognition,and query-by-content operations. Key benefits of the Diamond Eye architecture are: (1) the design promotes trial evaluation of advanced data mining and machine learning techniques by potential new users (all that is required is to point a web browser to the appropriate URL), (2) software infrastructure that is common across a range of science mining applications is factored out and reused, and (3) the system facilitates closer collaborations between algorithm developers and domain experts.

The capabilities of the information technology environment which we are investigating are those of artificial intelligence, machine learning and information retrieval. We are investigating combining these capabilities in a library context. We describe an experimental automatic document classification system, outlining its design, a series of tests and the results obtained so far. The results of these tests suggest that the design approach of the system is viable. This is suggestive for further work in both machine learning and automated document classification.

We start by clarifying the notion of discovery by automated agent. Then we present a number of principles and discuss the ways in which different principles can be used together. Further augmented, a set of principles shah become a theory of discovery which can explain discovery systems and guide their construction.

Bayesian learning algorithms represent each concept with a single probabilistic summary. In this paper we present an iterative approach to naive Bayes. The iterative Bayes begins with the distribution tables built by the naive Bayes. Those tables are iteratively updated in order to improve the probability class distribution associated with each training example. Experimental evaluation of Iterative Bayes on 25 benchmark datasets shows consistent gains in accuracy. An interesting side effect of our algorithm is that it shows to be robust to attribute dependencies.

The interpretation of the internal representation of a successful Neural Network can be useful to understand the nature of the problem and its solution, to use the Neural "model" as a tool that gives insights about the problem solved and not just as a solving mechanism treated as a blade box. The internal representation used by the family of kernel-based Neural Networks (including Radial Basis Functions, Support Vector machines, Coulomb potential methods, and some probabilistic Neural Networks) can be seen as a set of positive instances of classification and, thereafter, used to derive Fuzzy rules suitable for explanation or inference processes. The probabilistic nature of the kernel-based Neural Networks is captured by the membership functions associated to the components of the rules extracted, in this work we propose a method to extract fuzzy rules from trained Neural Networks of the family mentioned; comparing the quality of the knowledge extracted by different methods using known machine learning benchmarks.

The induction idea is a clustering principle based on Kohonen's self-organizing algorithms. The function to optimize in the aggregation of examples to become rules is a classificatory quality measure called impurity level, which was previously employed in our system called FAN. The rule conditions obtained in this way are densely populated areas in the attribute space. The main goal of our system, in addition to its accuracy, is the high quality of explanations that it can provide attached to the classification decisions.

One of the main disadvantages of these systems is the high number of patterns retained. In this paper, a new method for extracting just a small set of paradigms from a set of training examples is presented. Additionally, we provide the set of attributes describing the representative examples that are relevant for classification purposes. Our algorithm computes the Kohonen self-organizing maps attached to the training set to then compute the coverage of each map node. Finally, a heuristic procedure selects both the paradigms and the dimensions (or attributes) to be considered when measuring similarity in future classification tasks.

The introduction of Context Free Grammars (CFG), which allow to declaratively express search spaces involving complex structures, has recently lead to new advances in Genetic Programming. In this paper, we propose to refine this framework, with a formalism which is still declarative but more expressive than CFGs: biases are expressed by means of constraints and a solver enables both to check that a hypothesis belongs to the search space, and to find interesting instantiations of it. This formalism is based on usual CFGs, but allows to express context dependent constraints. Thus, it extends previous expressiveness, solving for example complex typing problems. This approach has been applied to a Data Mining task.

When finding solutions, all of the properties of the input information are not always required. Therefore, the authors assume that a certain mechanism which can select specific properties to be focused on will contribute to this purpose. For the realization and discussion of this mechanism, the authors have focused on the Classifier System (CS) which has more advantages than other ML systems. From the authors' point of view, operation processes in the CS are thought to involve this mechanism. However, the CS also involves such "duality" that both the optimization processes of rules for solution finding and the abstraction processes of input information are in a single process, which may lead to problems. In this paper, the authors propose a computational model in which these two processes are explicitly separated. The key concept of the proposed model is the Viewpoint-Forming Process for the purpose of using rules for selecting properties to be focused on. This is separate from the standard rules for finding solutions. A computer system is developed to evaluate the utility of this model.

Aircraft maneuvering supplies a rich and complex task for machine learning. A rudimentary flight test maneuvering agent (FTMA) possesses the potential to be moved from aircraft to aircraft in a robust but general manner. This study presents an FTMA, whose adaptive qualities are tested in two, NASA developed, hi-fidelity flight simulations-the X-31A Enhanced Fighter Maneuverability Demonstrator and the F-106 Delta Dart. These two aircraft possess dramatically different dynamics and control laws. The agent approach contributes generality of interface and adaptation to this complex problem.

Fuzzy GP depends on a grammar defining valid expressions of fuzzy classifiers, and guarantees that all individuals in the population are valid instances of it all along the evolution process. This is accomplished by restricting crossover and mutation so that they only take place at points of the derivation tree representing the same non-terminal, thus generating valid subtrees [13]. In Fuzzy GP, terminal symbols are fuzzy constants and variables that are chosen beforehand. In this work we propose a method for evolving both fuzzy membership functions of the variables and the Rule Base. Our method extends the GA-P hybrid method [6] by introducing a new grammar with two functional parts, one for the Fuzzy Rule Base (GP Part), and the other for the constants that define the shapes of the fuzzy sets involved in the Fuzzy Rule Base (GA Part). We have applied this method to some classical benchmarks taken from the collection of test data at the UCI Repository of Machine Learning Databases [9].

Their appeal lies in their strong connection to the underlying statistical learning theory, in particular the theory of Structural Risk Minimization. SVMs have been shown to be particularly successful in fields such as image identification and face recognition; in many problems SVM classifiers have been shown to perform much better than other nonlinear classifiers such as artificial neural networks and L-nearest neighbors. This paper explores the issues involved in applying SVMs to phonetic classification as a first step to speech recognition. We present results on several standard vowel and phonetic classification tasks and show better performance than Gaussian mixture classifiers. We also present an analysis of the difficulties we foresee in applying SVMs to continuous speech recognition problems.

In this work, we compare on-line algorithms from machine learning to existing algorithms for combining language models. On-line algorithms developed for this problem have parameters that are updated dynamically to adapt to a data set during evaluation. On-line analysis provides guarantees that these algorithms will perform nearly as well as the best model chosen in hindsight from a large class of models, e.g., the set of all static mixtures. We describe several on-line algorithms and present results comparing these techniques with existing language modeling combination methods on the task of domain adaptation. We demonstrate that, in some situations, on-line techniques can significantly outperform static mixtures (by over 10% in terms of perplexity) and are especially effective when the nature of the test data is unknown or changes over time.

A recently proposed and very promising boosting algorithm is AdaBoost [7]. In this paper we investigate if AdaBoost can be used to improve a hybrid HMM/neural network continuous speech recognizer. Boosting significantly improves the word error rate From 6.3% to 5.3% on a test set of the OGI Numbers95 corpus, a medium size continuous numbers recognition task. These results compare favorably with other combining techniques using several different feature representations or additional information from longer time spans. Ensemble methods or committees of learning machines can often improve the performance of a system in comparison to a single learning machine. A recently proposed and very promising boosting algorithm is AdaBoost [7]. It constructs a composite classifier by sequentially training classifiers while more and more emphasis on certain patterns. Several authors have reported important improvements with respect to one classifier on several machine learning benchmark problems of the UCI repository, e.g. [2, 6]. These experiments displayed rather intriguing generalization properties, such as continued decrease in generalization error after training error reaches zero. However, most of these data bases are very small (only several hundreds of training examples) and contain no significant amount of noise. There is also recent evidence that AdaBoost may very well overfit if we combine several hundred thousands classifiers [8] and [5] reports severe performance degradations of AdaBoost when adding 20% noise on the class-labels. In summary, we can say that the reasons for the impressive success of AdaBoost are still not completely understood. To the best of our knowledge, an application of AdaBoost to a real world problem has not yet been reported in the literature either. In this paper we investigate if AdaBoost can be applied to boost the performance of a continuous speech recognition system. In this domain we have to deal with large amounts of data (often more than 1 million training examples) and inherently noisy phoneme labels. The paper is organized as follows. In the next two sections we summarize the AdaBoost algorithm and our baseline speech recognizer. In the third section we shown how AdaBoost can be applied to this task and we report results on the Numbers95 corpus and compare them with other classifier combination techniques. The paper finishes with a conclusion and perspectives for future work.	CNRS, LIMSI, F-91403 Orsay, France	Schwenk, H (reprint author), CNRS, LIMSI, Bat 508,BP 133, F-91403 Orsay, France.

The proposed approach has been applied to images' text and color attributes. In order to ensure that meaningful features are extracted, a pseudo object model based on color coherence vector has been adopted to model color content. The RF approach employs techniques developed in the fields of information retrieval and machine learning to extract pertinent features from each of the attributes. It then uses the user's relevance judgments to estimate the importance of different attributes in an integrated content-based image retrieval. The system developed has been tested on a large image collection containing over 12,000 images. The results demonstrate that the proposed RF approaches and pseudo-object based color model are effective.

The recent evolution of hybrid architectures for machine learning systems has resulted in several approaches that combine rule-induction methods with case-based reasoning techniques to engender performance improvements over more-traditional one-representation architectures. We briefly survey several major rule-induction and case-based reasoning ML systems. We then examine some interesting hybrid combinations of these systems, and explain their strengths and weaknesses as learning systems. We present a balanced approach to constructing a hybrid architecture, along with arguments in favor of this balance and mechanisms for achieving a proper balance. Finally, we present some initial empirical results from testing our ideas and draw some conclusions based on those results.

We discuss anomalies in the ordering of hypotheses in a subdomain when performance is normalized and averaged, and show conditions under which anomalies can be eliminated. To generalize performance across subdomains, we present a measure called probability of win that measures the probability whether one hypothesis is better than another. Finally, we discuss some limitations in using probabilities of win and illustrate their application in finding new parameter values for TimberWolf, a package for VLSI cell placement and routing.

Years of experience in building and fielding CBR systems have shown that the "case approach" is not free from problems. It has been realized that the knowledge engineering effort required for designing many real-world casebases can be prohibitively high. Based on the wide-spread use of databases and powerful machine learning methods, some CBR researchers have been investigating the possibility of designing casebases automatically. This paper proposes a flexible model for the automatic discovery of abstract cases from databases based on the Lattice Machine. It also proposes an efficient and effective algorithm for retrieving such cases. Besides the known benefits associated with abstract cases, the main advantages of this approach are that the discovery process is fully automated (no knowledge engineering costs).

Attention was drawn to a comparative exercise which called for predictions on the outcome of 30 rodent carcinogenicity bioassays. This - the Predictive Toxicology Evaluation (or PTE) Challenge - was seen to provide AI programs with an opportunity to participate in an enterprise of scientific merit, and a yardstick for comparison against strong competition. Here we provide an assessment of the machine learning (ML) submissions made. Models submitted are assessed on: (1) their accuracy, in comparison to models developed with expert collaboration; and (2) their explanatory value for toxicology. The principal findings were: (a) using structural information available from a standard modelling package, layman-devised features, and outcomes of established biological tests, results from ML-derived models were at least as good as those with expert-derived techniques. This was surprising; (b) the combined use of structural and biological features by ML-derived models was unusual, and suggested new avenues for toxicology modelling. This was also unexpected: and (c) significant effort was required to interpret the output of even the most "symbolic" of ML-derived models. Much of this could have been alleviated with measures for converting the results into a more "toxicology-friendly" form. As it stands, their absence is sufficient to prevent a whole-hearted acceptance of these promising methods by toxicologists. This suggests that ML techniques have been able to respond - not fully, but nevertheless substantially - to the PTE Challenge.

As the expert operator remains a rare resource and in order to capitalize his/her knowledge and know-how, the development of tools integrating this new dimension has become an important challenge. This paper deals with a tool for knowledge acquisition under cognitive constraints, assuming that cognitive principles could be sometimes useful to improve machine learning tools results. Additionally, we have to cope with the difficulty linked to the fact that the acquired strategies have to be adapted on-line. After describing the underlying cognitive principles, we will introduce the decision representation space and its related notations. We will then show the difficulties linked to the search of an optimal representation of the expert strategies set and how the heuristics used by the algorithm studied avoid these NP-complete problems. Finally, the current results and our work perspectives are stated.	ENST Bretagne, LIASC, F-29285 Brest, France	Le Saux, E (reprint author), ENST Bretagne, LIASC, BP 832, F-29285 Brest, France.

In multi-agent settings, when other agents are present in the environment, these demands are even more severe. We investigate ways in which the agent's knowledge and the results of deliberative decision-making can be compiled to reduce the complexity of decision-making procedures and to save time in urgent situations. We use machine learning algorithms to compile decision-theoretic deliberations into condition-action rules on how to coordinate in a multi-agent environment. Using different learning algorithms, we endow a resource-bounded agent with a tapestry of decision making tools, ranging from purely reactive to fully deliberative ones. The agent can then select a method depending on the time constraints of the particular situation. We also propose combining the decision-making tools, so that, for example, more reactive methods serve as a pre-processing stage to the more accurate but slower deliberative decision-making ones. We validate our framework with experimental results in simulated coordinated defense. The experiments show that compiling the results of decision-making saves deliberation time while offering good performance in our multi-agent domain.

Unfortunately, they are also difficult and time-consuming to maintain. This paper proposes the use of machine learning techniques to greatly automate the creation and maintenance of domain-specific search engines. We describe new research in reinforcement learning, text classification and information extraction that enables efficient spidering, populates topic hierarchies, and identifies informative text segments. Using these techniques, we have built a demonstration system: a search engine for computer science research papers available at www.cora.justresearch.com.

In general, the disambiguation rules differ for different words. For this reason, the automatic construction of disambiguation rules is highly desirable. One way to achieve this aim is by applying machine learning techniques to training data containing the various senses of the ambiguous words. In the work presented here, the decision tree learning algorithm C4.5 is applied on a corpus of financial news articles. Instead of concentrating on a small set of ambiguous words, as done in most of the related previous work, all content words of the examined corpus are disambiguated. Furthermore, the effectiveness of word sense disambiguation for different parts of speech (nouns and verbs) is examined empirically.

First, the damage detection process is described in terms of a problem in statistical pattern recognition. Next, a specific example of a statistical-pattern-recognition-based damage detection process using a linear discriminant operator, "Fisher's Discriminant: is applied to the problem of identifying structural damage in a physical system. Accelerometer lime histories are recorded from sensors attached to the system as that system is excited using a measured input. Linear Prediction Coding (LPC) coefficients are utilized to convert the accelerometer time-series data into multi-dimensional samples representing the resonances of the system during a brief segment of the time series. Fisher's discriminant is then used to find the linear projection of the LPC data distributions that best separates data from undamaged and damaged systems. The method is applied to data from concrete bridge columns as the columns are progressively damaged. For this case, the method captures a clear distinction between undamaged and damaged vibration profiles. Further, the method assigns a probability of damage that can be used to rank systems in order of priority for inspection.

The presence of lexical semantic tags in the treebank has proved useful for learning semantic constraints which limit the amount of nondeterminism in the parsers. The level of generality of the semantic tags used is of direct importance to that task. We combine the ILP system LAPIS with the lexical resource WordNet to learn parsers with semantic constraints. The generality of these constraints is automatically selected by LAPIS from a number of options provided by the corpus annotator. The performance of the parsers learned is evaluated on an original corpus also described in the article.

In predictive knowledge discovery, the most frequently used measure is classification accuracy. With new tasks being addressed in knowledge discovery, new measures appear. In descriptive knowledge discovery, where induced rules are not primarily intended for classification, new measures used are novelty in clausal and subgroup discovery, and support and confidence in association rule learning. Additional measures are needed as many descriptive knowledge discovery tasks involve the induction of a large set of redundant rules and the problem is the ranking and filtering of the induced rule set. In this paper we develop a unifying view on some of the existing measures for predictive and descriptive induction. We provide a common terminology and notation by means of contingency tables. We demonstrate how to trade off these measures, by using what we call weighted relative accuracy. The paper furthermore demonstrates that many rule evaluation measures developed for predictive knowledge discovery can be adapted to descriptive knowledge discovery tasks.

Toxicity models that used findings from ILP programs have performed creditably in the PTE-2 experiment proposed under this challenge. We report here on an assessment of such models along scales of: (1) quantitative performance, in comparison to models developed with expert collaboration; and (2) potential explanatory value for toxicology. Results appear to suggest the following: (a) across of range of class distributions and error costs, some explicit models constructed with ILP-assistance appear closer to optimal than most expert-assisted ones. Given the paucity of test-data, this is to be interpreted cautiously; (b) a combined use of propositional and ILP techniques appears to yield models that contain unusual combinations of structural and biological features; and (c) significant effort was required to interpret the output, strongly indicating the need to invest greater effort in transforming the output into a "toxicologist-friendly" form. Based on the lessons learnt from these results, we propose a new predictive toxicology evaluation experiment - PTE-3 - which will address some important shortcomings of the previous study.

This problem has interesting applications in linear programming as well as in fields such as machine learning and statistical discriminant analysis. MAX FS is NP-hard and also difficult to approximate, fn this paper we examine structural and algorithmic properties of MAX FS and of irreducible infeasible subsystems (IISs), which are intrinsically related, since one must delete at least one constraint from each IIS to attain feasibility. In particular, we establish: (i) that finding a smallest cardinality IIS is NP-hard as well as very difficult to approximate; (ii) a new simplex decomposition characterization of IISs; (iii) that for a given clutter, realizability as the IIS family for an infeasible linear system subsumes the Steinitz problem for polytopes; (iv) some results on the feasible subsystem polytope whose vertices are incidence vectors of feasible subsystems of a given infeasible system.

Error sources in the system are studied and problems are described. A number of methods for eliminating problems due to inaccuracy in 2D-space have been previously reported [3][4][5][6][7]. These methods have been extended to address the problem in 3 dimensions. Utilising a real time monitoring system, the end-effector position is sensed. The collected data is converted into appropriate error maps. Using a novel machine learning method, the error maps are used to predict system errors and compensate for them. The machine learning engine generalises the data for the points between the sampled points. The experimental results are presented.

They cannot adapt to changing environmental conditions and to new objects. The application of machine learning to image interpretation is the next logical step. Our proposed approach aims at the development of dedicated machine learning techniques at all levels of image interpretation in a systematic fashion. In the paper we propose a system, which uses Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) to optimize image segmentation at the low level according to changing image acquisition conditions and image quality. The intermediate-level unit extracts the case representation used by the high level unit for further processing. At the high level, CBR is employed to dynamically adapt image interpretation.

This research proposes a hybrid approach to pattern matching for speech synthesis by machine. The problem statement may be reduced as follows: How do we assign a phoneme to a character given its contextual information,i.e. the characters preceding and following the character? In our present study, we use a contextual window of five characters wide allowing up to two characters on either side of each character in question for phoneme assignment. The assignment method is based on a machine learning approach by training the system with a large set of examples. The hybrid approach is to integrate an information gain learning algorithm with a transformation-based error driven learning algorithm. The examples for training and testing in the present work are taken from NETtalk Corpus, containing a list of 20,008 English words along with a phonetic transcription for each word. This hybrid approach has been shown to achieve a final accuracy of 96.86%.

The technique can be divided into three major steps: The first step is pre-processing in which the original image is transformed into a binary image utilizing a 300 dpi scanner and then forming the connected component. At the moment we extract seven types of global features: number of subwords, number of peaks of each subwords, number of loops of each peak, number and position of complementary characters,. Second, global features of the input Arabic word are then extracted such as number subwords, number of peaks within the subword, number of loops of each peak, number the height and width of each peak and position of the complementary character, etc.. Finally, Machine learning C4.5 is used for character classification to generate a decision tree. The system was tested with a set of 500 different classes of Arabic words teach class has fifteen different fonts) using Cross validation algorithm and the average recognition rate obtained was 96.52%. This is a very promising result and clearly shows that machine learning techniques are well suited to these types of application.

Based on the forecasting performance of Cubist in our artificial returns, some evidences seems to support this consistent interpretation. However, there are a few cases that Cubist can beat the random walk even though the series is independent. As a result, rue do not consider the evidence is strong enough to convince machine learning to give up when the efficient market hypothesis is sustained.

We demonstrate how the degree of reuse can be increased to a larger extent through a high level reuse of complete subsystems by the application of machine learning techniques and fuzzy logic in an object-oriented system-level synthesis environment. The fuzzy learning techniques were implemented in the ICOS methodology. It is shown by experiments that efficiency of synthesis improved by a factor of two to three after fuzzy learning was applied.

One of these progresses is the realization of dynamic models that permit us to model the complex behaviour of the software development processes. The main advantage of these models is the possibility to experiment before the execution of the project. In this way we can see the effect that the application, or non application, of different management policies will have on the project. In this paper we present a part of the results obtained by combining, on one hand, the use of a tool that learns producing rules, and additionally a dynamic model of SDP. This permits us to obtain management rules applicable to a SDP for estimating good results with the variables that the project manager desires.

Rough sets theory provides a new mathematical tool to deal with uncertainty and vagueness. Based on rough sets theory, this paper proposes a novel approach far the classification and rule induction of inconsistent information systems. It is achieved by integrating rough sets theory with a statistics-based inductive learning algorithm. The framework of a prototype rough-set-based classification system (RClass) is presented. Two examples are used to verify the prototype system. The results of the validation are discussed.

However, their significant disadvantage in real applications is that inferences are not real values but disjoint intervals of real values. In order to overcome this difficulty, we propose a new approach in which rough set theory and neuro-fuzzy fusion are combined to obtain the optimal rule base from input/output data. These results are applied to the rule construction for inferring the temperature at specified points in a refrigerator.

In this paper, firstly, three kinds of knowledge in diagnosis systems are introduced, namely experience knowledge, causal knowledge and the first law knowledge. Then, we analyze the role of a few existing learning and, on the basis of the above discussion. divide the learning in diagnosis expert systems into three parts, i.e., learning simply learning mutually and learning independently. At last, the frame of fault diagnosis and machine learning is given and the viewpoint that diagnosis and learning are an entity is explained.

The method uses the trained model (e.g., the neural net or the decision tree) as, a distance metric to determine which cases in the training set are most similar to the case that needs to be explained. This approach is well suited to medical domains, where it is important to understand predictions made by complex machine learning models, and where training and clinical practice makes users adept at case interpretation.

Amer Med Informat Assoc				We compare the performance of four computerized methods in identifying chest x-ray reports that support acute bacterial pneumonia. Two of the computerized techniques are constructed from expert knowledge, and two learn rules, and structure from data. The two machine learning systems perform as well as the expert constructed systems. All of the computerized techniques perform better than a baseline keyword search and a layperson, and perform as well as a physician. We conclude that machine learning can be used to identify chest x-ray reports that support pneumonia.

Amer Med Informat Assoc				This paper evaluates the variable selection performed by several machine-learning techniques on a myocardial infarction data set. The focus of this work is to determine which of 43 input variables are considered relevant for prediction of myocardial infarction. The algorithms investigated were logistic regression (with stepwise, forward, and backward selection), backpropagation for multilayer perceptrons (input relevance determination) I Bayesian neural networks (automatic relevance determination), and rough sets. An independent method (self-organizing maps) was then used to evaluate and visualize the different subsets of predictor variables. Results show good agreement on some predictors, but also variability among different methods; only one variable was selected by all models.

Effective solutions to this problem are indispensable especially when dealing with MRI of dynamic phenomena since then, rapid sampling in k-space is required. The goal in such a case is to reduce the measurement time by omitting as many scanning trajectories as possible. This approach, however, entails underdetermined equations and leads to poor image reconstruction. It is proposed here that significant improvements could be achieved concerning image reconstruction if a procedure, based on machine learning, for estimating the missing samples of complex k-space were introduced. To this end, the viability of involving Supervised and Unsupervised Neural Network algorithms for such a problem is considered and it is found that their image reconstruction results are very favorably compared to the ones obtained by the trivial zero-filled k-space approach or traditional more sophisticated interpolation approaches.

The notion of metric is central to Nearest Neighbor's working and different feature weighting metrics have been proposed in order to increase its performance. In this work we present an original Probability Based Metric, i.e. a metric for classification tasks that relies on estimates of the posterior probabilities, called Minimum Risk Metric (MRM). MRM is optimal but it optimizes directly the finite misclassification risk whereas the Short and Fukunaga Metric minimize the difference between finite risk and asymptotic risk. An experimental comparison of MRM with Short and Fukunaga Metric, Value Difference Metric, and Euclidean-Hamming metrics on benchmark datasets shows that MRM outperforms the other metrics and performs comparably to the Bayes Classifier based on the same probability estimates. The results suggests that MRM can be useful in applications were the retrieval of a nearest neighbor is required (e.g. Case Based Reasoning).

The approach combines corpus-based grammar induction with a very simple pattern-matching algorithm and an optional constituent verification step. The grammar induction algorithm acquires a set of rules for each level of linguistic analysis using a new technique for error-driven pruning of treebank grammars. The constituent verification step employs standard inductive learning techniques as an additional recision-enhancing device. We evaluate the approach on four partial parsing data sets and find that performance is very good (over 93% precision and recall) for applications that require or prefer fairly simple constituent bracketing. As the complexity of the partial parsing task increases, however, our approach lags the performance of competing approaches.

The system lets users guide the search toward particular schedules by giving high-level, operational advice about the solutions desired. Because traces of user interactions provide information regarding the user's preferences among schedules, INCA can draw on machine learning techniques to construct user models that reflect these preferences. We characterize the modeling task as that of learning a weight vector for a linear evaluation function that will lead to the same pairwise preferences between schedules as the user. INCA adapts to individual users by adjusting the weights on its evaluation function using a perceptron-type learning algorithm. To evaluate the system's adaptive capabilities, we designed an experiment involving four types of synthetic users that differed in their evaluation functions and in the level of advice they provide. We present experimental results showing that INCA achieves better performance with more specific advice and with learning, even on users with evaluation functions that have nonlinearities or unobservable factors.

It is developed for the Naive Bayesian classifier applied on text data, since it combines well with the addressed learning problems. We focus on domains with many features that also have a highly unbalanced class distribution and asymmetric misclassification costs given only implicitly in the problem. By asymmetric misclassification costs we mean that one of the class values is the target class value for which we want to get predictions and we prefer false positive over false negative. Our example problem is automatic document categorization using machine learning, where we want to identify documents relevant for the selected category. Usually, only about 1%-10% of examples belong to the selected category. Our experimental comparison of eleven feature scoring measures show that considering domain and algorithm characteristics significantly improves the results of classification.

Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) is a new research area in Machine Learning, marked by the exploitation of background knowledge, and the use of first order logic to represent hypotheses. ILP systems are attractive for complex and real-world applications which also help to uncover the strengths and shortcomings of these systems. This paper first points out some shortcomings of some ILP systems. One is the discriminatory nature of rules created by them, when used in the area of object model learning. A model represented by such a discriminatory rule may cause an object to be falsely recognised. Further verification with a model containing all the necessary information about an object (a descriptive model) may solve this problem. In addition, rules generated by ILP systems are not exactly identical to a generalised graph which represents a model of a class of objects. A new ILP system, TSFOIL, that can learn both discriminatory and descriptive rules in two stages is introduced. The generated rules have also more similarity to a graph representation of object models. Experiments on a real world application are then reported which were conducted to show the shortcomings of discriminatory rules, and the advantage of using both kinds of rules.

This task arises in the construction of search engines and Web knowledge bases. This paper argues that the creation of efficient web spiders is best framed and solved by reinforcement learning, a branch of machine learning that concerns itself with optimal sequential decision making. One strength of reinforcement learning is that it provides a formalism for measuring the utility of actions that give benefit only in the future. We present an algorithm for learning a value function that maps hyperlinks to future discounted reward using a naive Bayes text classifier. Experiments on two real-world spidering tasks show a threefold improvement in spidering efficiency over traditional breadth-first search, and up to a two-fold improvement over reinforcement learning with immediate reward only.

In the 1960s algorithmic information theory supplied universal measures of confidence but these are, unfortunately, non-computable. In this paper we combine the ideas of algorithmic information theory with the theory of Support Vector machines to obtain practicable approximations to universal measures of confidence. We show that in some standard problems of pattern recognition our approximations work well.

Most work has focused on classification in static domains, where an instantaneous snapshot of attributes is meaningful. In many domains, attributes are not static; in fact, it is the way they vary temporally that can make classification possible. Examples of such domains include speech recognition, gesture recognition and electrocardiograph classification. While it is possible to use ad hoc, domain-specific techniques for "flattening" the time series to a learner-friendly representation, this fails to take into account both the special problems and special heuristics applicable to temporal data and often results in unreadable concept descriptions. Though traditional time series techniques can sometimes produce accurate classifiers, few can provide comprehensible descriptions. We propose a general architecture for classification and description of multivariate time series. It employs event primitives to analyse the training data and extract events. These events are clustered, creating prototypical events which are used as the basis for creating more accurate and comprehensible classifiers. A minimal implementation of this architecture, called TClass, is applied to two domains, one real and one artificial and compared against a naive approach. TClass shows great promise, particularly in comprehensibility, but also in accuracy.

Unfortunately, information on the Web is hard to represent with the usual knowledge base formalisms: problems include terminological. differences across sites, and the frequent combination of structured information with unstructured textual descriptions. The primary focus of my research in the last few years has been WHIRL, an "information representation language" that is designed to address these problems. WHIRL allows information to be represented using a combination of formally structured facts and informal textual descriptions. Incorporating ideas from both AI and statistical information retrieval, WHIRL generalizes both logical deduction and ranked retrieval of documents. Below I will describe informally my motivations in developing WHIRL; introduce the WHIRL representation language; and then disuss some issues of interest to the machine learning community.

The tool, partly still in development phases, performs automatic subject description of documents, searching with natural language queries and ranking of search hits according to their relevance. The search engine allows the searcher to use relevance feedback in order to perform incremental improvement of search results. The machine learning system TILDE for learning user profiles was also applied. Documents marked by the user as relevant or non-relevant are used to find characteristics that distinguish relevant documents from non-relevant ones.

Appropriate navigation implies the robot will avoid collision or contact with hazards, will not be falsely rerouted around traversible terrain due to false hazard detections, and will exploit the terrain to maximize its concealment. Appropriate autonomous navigation requires the ability to detect and localize critical features in the environment. Examples of critical environmental features include rocks, trees, ditches, holes, bushes and water. Environmental features have a wide range of characteristics and multiple sensing phenomenologies are required to be able to detect them all. Once the data is acquired from these multiple phenomenologies, a mechanism is required to combine and analyze all of these disparate sources of information into one composite interpretation. In this paper we discuss the Demo III multi-sensor system for autonomous mobility, and the "operator-trained" fusion system called O-NAV (Object NAVigation) that is used to build a labeled three dimensional model of the immediate environment surrounding the robot vehicle so it can appropriately interact with its surroundings.

The model prediction error serves as the fitness measure. It depends strongly on the parameter settings of the processing modules. Qualitatively better processing parameter settings are found by iterative training process where these settings are modified base on the quality of the previous learning process, controlled by downhill algorithms (Evolutionary Strategy, Downhill, Simplex). This enables us to find a suitable model describing a process with less effort. The traditional optimizing process of determining signal processing parameters with heuristics may be standardized and preserved through this mechanism.

J	Finn, GD				Finn, GD			Learning fuzzy rules from data	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						fuzzy algorithms; fuzzy systems; if then rules; machine learning		We present an algorithm, FUZZEX, for learning fuzzy rules from a corpus of data mapping input antecedents to output consequents. The input and output spaces are first divided into a grid of cells and primitive if ... then rules formulated from each occupied input cell in the role of an antecedent. The distribution of output cells into which data in the input cell maps, plays the role of the consequent interpreted as a fuzzy set. Those input cells associated with sufficiently similar fuzzy output sets are then combined to form a composite rule. A concise set of rules in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) is formed by combining adjacent input cells belonging to the same rule, thereby simplifying the logical expression of the antecedents. Optionally, more succinctness of expression may be obtained by recruiting into a rule, adjacent input cells with (little or) no data, but which happen to simplify rule expression. Preliminary testing on testbed datasets is presented. FUZZEX can be applied effectively to problems of large dimensionality.

However, in this rough setting, where it is inherently not possible to describe the entire data with 100% accuracy, it is possible to definitively describe part of the data with 100% accuracy. The gRS-ILP model is extended in this paper to motifs in strings. An illustrative experiment is presented using the ILP system Progol on transmembrane domains in amino acid sequences.
