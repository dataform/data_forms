J	MONTBRIAND, MJ				MONTBRIAND, MJ			DECISION TREE MODEL DESCRIBING ALTERNATE HEALTH-CARE CHOICES MADE BY ONCOLOGY PATIENTS	CANCER NURSING			English	Article						DECISION MAKING; ALTERNATE HEALTH CARE; ONCOLOGY; HEALTH CARE CHOICES	CANCER; PRACTITIONERS; THERAPIES; MEDICINE; ILLNESS	What common sense decision strategies do patients with cancer use when they are making health care choices that include alternate therapies? Existing research indicates that oncology patients are making alternate choices while associated with biomedicine. Often patients' decision strategies are exploited by the alternate system to promote and market alternate products. Although some of these practices are benign, others are dangerous or may interfere or delay successful treatment in biomedicine. Therefore, it seems important for biomedical professionals to understand patients' common sense decision patterns. A decision tree model, outlining patients' decision strategies, has recently been developed through intensive interviews with 300 patients who were diagnosed with cancer of the respiratory and digestive systems. The two-phase methodology included, first, a context sensitive approach to develop the model, followed by a predictive approach testing the model developed in the first phase on a separate yet similar random sample of patients. The discussion in this article focuses on the research, the patterns of the decision tree model, and the implications and adaptability of this model to nursing practice.

J	CHANG, CH; LEOU, JJ				CHANG, CH; LEOU, JJ			DETECTION AND CORRECTION OF TRANSMISSION ERRORS IN DPCM IMAGES	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY			English	Note								In this paper, a new approach to detection and correction of transmission errors in DPCM images is proposed. Here each transmission error (streak noise) is detected via a sequence of the WMW rank-sum tests performing on a sliding window using four particularly designed grouping schemes. Instead of four possible patterns used in Kundu and Wu, in the proposed approach 18 possible detection patterns represented as a decision tree are identified. And the transmission error detection procedure is equivalent to tracing the decision tree. The estimated gray level shift of a detected streak noise is used to locate the streak origin. Then instead of using previous line replacement, each streak noise can be almost deleted by compensating the corrupted pixels with the estimated gray level shift. Experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed approach.

J	BRODLEY, CE; UTGOFF, PE				BRODLEY, CE; UTGOFF, PE			MULTIVARIATE DECISION TREES	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						DECISION TREES; MULTIVARIATE TESTS; LINEAR DISCRIMINANT FUNCTIONS; INDUCTIVE LEARNING		Unlike a univariate decision tree, a multivariate decision tree is not restricted to splits of the instance space that are orthogonal to the features' axes. This article addresses several issues for constructing multivariate decision trees: representing a multivariate test, including symbolic and numeric features, learning the coefficients of a multivariate test, selecting the features to include in a test, and pruning of multivariate decision trees. We present several new methods for forming multivariate decision trees and compare them with several well-known methods. We compare the different methods across a variety of learning tasks, in order to assess each method's ability to find concise, accurate decision trees. The results demonstrate that some multivariate methods are in general more effective than others (in the context of our experimental assumptions). In addition; the experiments confirm that allowing multivariate tests generally improves the accuracy of the resulting decision tree over a univariate tree.

Since the maintenance of a TLC in place for a prolonged period may lead to infectious complications, it appeared warranted that standards of management be developed. A decision-tree model was constructed for evaluating the optimal time for changing a TLC that would minimize infection. Cost estimates and health effects at three-, five-, and ten-day change intervals were considered for catheter insertion and complications resulting from such insertion. The results suggested that prophylactic catheter changes should occur no later than every five days, provided that there are no signs of infection. However, sensitivity analysis of several variables suggested that individual institutions should establish policy timing changes based upon careful interpretation of their own data. A model was developed to assist in determining the optimal time to change a TLC based upon such data.

Methods: A decision tree was constructed to determine the outcome of three prevention strategies: (1) Screen all pregnant women for group B streptococcus (GES) at 28 weeks' gestation and give intrapartum chemoprophylaxis to all GBS carriers; (2) Screen all pregnant women, but give chemoprophylaxis selectively to those carriers with obstetric risk factors (i,e,, premature labour, prolonged rupture of membranes and maternal sepsis); and (3) Do not screen but give intrapartum chemoprophylaxis for all women with obstetric risk factors, Australian data were used if available, and the cost benefit and cost effectiveness of each strategy compared with no screening at all were estimated. Results: All three strategies had a net cost benefit compared with no intervention at all, Strategy 1 could prevent 46%, Strategy 2 38% and Strategy 3 60%-80% of all early-onset GBS sepsis. Conclusion: A substantial proportion of early-onset GBS sepsis is preventable. Strategy 1, which is practical in some large teaching hospitals, prevents more sepsis at a lower cost per case prevented than Strategy 2, Strategy 3 theoretically could prevent more cases at a substantially lower cost than Strategies 1 or 2, but has not been evaluated clinically.

In the systems developed to date, the structure of the hash table is fixed and must be created by the system developer--an onerous task especially when the number of attributes is large, as it must in systems that use both geometric and nongeometric attributes. Another deficiency of previous systems is that uncertainty is treated as a fixed value and not modeled. In this paper, we will present a system, named MULTI-HASH, which uses the tools of decision trees and uncertainty modeling for the automatic construction of hash tables. The decision-tree framework in MULTI-HASH is based on a hybrid method that uses both qualitative attributes, such as the shape of a surface, and quantitative attributes such as color, dihedral angles, etc. The human trainer shows objects to the vision system and, in an interactive mode, tells the system the model identities of the various segmented regions, etc. Subsequently, the decision-tree-based framework learns the structure of the hash table.

J	GYLDMARK, M				GYLDMARK, M			A REVIEW OF COST STUDIES OF INTENSIVE-CARE UNITS - PROBLEMS WITH THE COST CONCEPT	CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE			English	Article						INTENSIVE CARE UNIT; CRITICAL CARE; HEALTH RESOURCES; RESOURCE ALLOCATION; MEDICAL CARE COSTS; HEALTH-CARE COSTS; COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS	DIAGNOSIS-RELATED GROUPS; MECHANICAL VENTILATION; ICU-PATIENTS; SURVIVAL; CHARGES; BENEFITS	Objective: To study methods for costing hospital services, specifically in relation to multi-unit studies of activity, case mix, severity of illness, outcome, and resource use in adult intensive care units (ICUs). Data Sources: Twenty published cost studies of adult ICUs. The studies are all published in English and are both European and American. Study Selection: Cost studies of adult ICUs published in international journals (English language). Data Extraction: Literature survey, where the articles were obtained through MEDLINE and other database searches. Data Synthesis: Cost of intensive care therapy was compared across the 20 studies. However, as stressed in the article, to compare costs of intensive care therapy across units is not possible for a number of reasons. One of the reasons for this limitation is that the studies employed different approaches to costing and thereby introduced a methodologic bias. In addition, the costing methodology applied in the majority of the studies was wrongly specified in relation to the purpose and viewpoint of the studies. Conclusions: The methodologies for costing ICU therapy are flawed and fail to provide correct answers. In most studies, the study question is not adequately specified and the cost concept used in the studies is not tailored to the purposes of the study. Standardizing the cost model would lead to better, faster, and more reliable costing. This standardized cost model should not be rigid, but adaptable to different decision situations. A decision tree or taxonomy is proposed as a way toward better costing of ICU activity.		GYLDMARK, M (reprint author), DANISH HOSP INST,LANDEMAERKET 10,DK-1119 COPENHAGEN K,DENMARK.

Two complementary computer-assisted methods were used. The first method made use of the digital image analysis of Feulgen-stained nuclei, making it possible to compute 15 morphonuclear and 8 nuclear DNA content-related (ploidy level) parameters. The second method enabled the most discriminatory parameters to be determined. This second method is the Decision Tree technique, which forms part of the Supervised Learning Algorithms. These two techniques were applied to a series of 250 supratentorial astrocytic tumors of the adult. This series included 39 low-grade (astrocytomas, AST) and 211 high-grade (47 anaplastic astrocytomas, ANA, and 164 glioblastomas, GBM) astrocytic tumors. The results show that some AST, ANA and GBM did not fit within simple logical rules. These ''complex'' cases were labeled NC-AST, NC-ANA and NC-GBM because they were ''non-classical'' (NC) with respect to their cytological features. An analysis of survival data revealed that the patients with NC-GBM had the same survival period as patients with GBM. In sharp contrast, patients with ANA survived significantly longer than patients with NC-ANA. In fact, the patients with ANA had the same survival period as patients who died from AST, while the patients with NC-ANA had a survival period similar to those with GBM. All these data show that the computer-assisted techniques used in this study can actually provide the pathologist with significant information on the characterization of astrocytic tumor aggressiveness.

However, OCs also influence the occurrence of unintended pregnancies through an additional, poorly recognized, route: cessation of OC use by women who do not wish to become pregnant but stop using OCs because of side effects or other reasons. Many such women fail to immediately substitute a new contraceptive and/or adopt a less reliable contraceptive. This is a particularly important consideration for the approximately 3.7 million women who begin taking OCs in the United States each year since this group commonly experiences side effects and has a high discontinuation rate. Using a decision tree to follow a cohort OC users over one year, we estimate that over 1 million unintended pregnancies are related to OC use, misuse or discontinuation. The greatest proportion of these, 61%, occur in women who discontinue OCs; of these, 66.6% occur in women who fail to immediately substitute other contraceptives and 33.3% because of the adoption of less reliable contraceptive methods. Of continuing OC users, the majority, exhibiting good compliance, contribute 24% of pregnancies because of their large numbers. Continuing OC users who are poor compliers, though many fewer, ave responsible for 15% due to their high pregnancy rate. Unintended pregnancies in women who discontinue OCs account for approximately 20% of the 3.5 million annual unintended pregnancies in the United States, incurring mts nf nearly, $2.6 billion. As many as 687,000 unintended pregnancies could be avoided through improved method use and a reduction in the number of women who discontinue OCs but still do not wish to become pregnant.

The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the MRA as a noninvasive diagnostic test are exceptional. Given an adequate two-dimensional time-of-flight (2D-TOF) study, it provides a robust test for the evaluation of carotid stenosis. The authors conclude from this meta-analysis that MRA is at least as accurate as DU in a selected group of patients. The question of superiority for all patients with suspected carotid artery disease is not, however, answered by this meta-analysis. Another question not answered is the question of DU/MRA-XRA. concordance/discordance. If DU and MRA were concordant across all, rather than a selected group of patients, would the clinical decision tree be in favor of elimination of XRA? The cost for a DU scan is approximately one third of the cost of an MRA and, from an economic point of view, one could not argue the use of MRA over DU. However, as MRA technology and accuracy improve and when the cost of MRA approaches that of DU, MRA may replace DU as a screening method. Clearly, a consecutive series of all patients suspected of having carotid artery disease needs to be evaluated by use of the best available diagnostic technologies. A comprehensive protocol would include an evaluation of the sources of difficulties in conducting these tests.

These tools are impacting the performance of outcome studies by discovering patterns which can then be verified with standard statistical tools. This paper demonstrates INC2.5, a general classification system, as a tool for assisting physicians in the decision making process. INC2.5 gathers information from patient records and builds a decision tree which is used to assist physicians in predicting the outcome of new patients. The decision tree will also reveal any patterns which the system found in the data. Successful results of such a system can be used to enhance outcome studies as well as to spread clinical information to areas with fewer resources. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.

J	BLUROCK, ES				BLUROCK, ES			AUTOMATIC LEARNING OF CHEMICAL CONCEPTS - RESEARCH OCTANE NUMBER AND MOLECULAR SUBSTRUCTURES	COMPUTERS & CHEMISTRY			English	Article								A set of 230 hydrocarbons is analyzed with respect to the research octane number (RON) using an extended version of the ID3 machine learning method of Quinlan. The basic ID3 method produces a decision tree. The questions within the decision tree ask whether given substructures are present or absent within a molecule (for example, is the hexane carbon skeleton present as a substructure?). The decision to be made is whether the RON value is within a given range (for example, is the RON greater than or equal to 90). In addition to the normal usage of decision trees to predict the RON value, qualitative information is extracted: for example, which substructures are significant in which RON ranges. The best results were found for those molecules having RON values between 90 and 105. This was due to the high density of samples in this region. The ID3 method is used to prune down an overabundance of parameters to a reasonable size. From the original set of 230 substructures, it was found that only 31 were needed for the RON description. The presence or absence of the substructures n-hexane, methylbenzene and benzene were particularly significant in determining the RON value. Considering that ID3 is not a traditional method of analysis, especially within chemistry, an effort is made to explain its principles using the problem at hand as an example. In addition, its use as the first step in analysis to gain intuitive information is explained.		BLUROCK, ES (reprint author), JOHANNES KEPLER UNIV,SYMBOL COMPUTAT RES INST,A-4020 LINZ,AUSTRIA.

In this paper, we present a new efficient technique for accurately estimating the bit error rates (BER's) of stack or Zigangirov-Jelinek (ZJ) sequential decoders for specific time-invariant convolutional codes. In contrast to a brute-force simulation approach, this method achieves computational efficiency by using a mean-translation importance sampling biasing method along with a set of easily checked rules which immediately eliminate the need of running the computationally intensive ZJ algorithm in a large number of simulation trials.

We apply this model using the nearest-neighbor learning algorithm, and develop upper and lower bounds on sample complexity for several different concept classes. For some concept classes, the sample complexity turns out to be exponential even using this best-case model, which implies that the concept class is inherently difficult for the NN algorithm. We identify several geometric properties that make learning certain concepts relatively easy. Finally we discuss the relation of our work to helpful teacher models, its application to decision tree learning algorithms, and some of its implications for current experimental work.

In this paper, one kind of machine learning methodology-ID3 is used for the detection of tool failure. Based on the example objects which are known only through their values of a set of attributes, a decision tree which is the representation of acquired knowledge of ID3 can be constructed. The main objective of using ID3 is td learn more than one piece of information to detect the tool failure correctly, and also to acquire the implicit knowledge of tool failure phenomenon. Here, six attributes of two kinds of signals (AE signal and cutting force signal) in the single point turning operation are selected for constructing the decision tree. Experiments of using ID3 to detect the tool failure is executed, and the high correct rate in detection for the tool failure is received.

METHODOLOGY	JOURNAL DE RADIOLOGIE			French	Article						HERNIOGRAPHY; COST EFFECTIVENESS; DECISION THEORY		Aim: To assess the validity and the interest to health of systematic herniography in cases of unilateral inguinal hernia in children under two years of age. Method: Decision theory was used to assess the effect of herniography on individual health by estimating gonadic benefit and establishing a benefit-risk ratio, and on collective health by the use of cost-effectiveness analysis. Results: a decision tree and algorithms were developed. Discussion: Decision analysis is used in complex medical decision making, clarifying choices and subdividing a problem into several more manageable sub-problems. The threshold approach pinpoints factors requiring more information.

This paper presents a normative framework for assessing rail transit security following a system-wide metric approach. The security metric can also be used to assess the marginal improvement in security as a result of improving or adopting alternative policing and monitoring strategies. The model consists of five tasks: surveying rail transit security systems, developing a rail transit security metric, assigning efficiency ratings to rail security functions, developing a composite index for the efficiency of the overall security system, and applying a probability matrix to temper the results. Efficiency ratings can be translated into probability of occurrence figures that can be used in a decision tree context to improve rail transit security.

In order to clarify issues surrounding this controversy, we created a decision tree modeling URS or SWL with literature-based probabilities and used as endpoints both cost and patient preferences. Ureteroscopy was more successful than single-session or multiple-session SWL, 92.1% v 74.3% or 84.5%, and had a lower retreatment/complication rate. Although initial SWL was only slightly more expensive than URS, $4,420 v $4,337, the difference increased when the additional costs of complications and retreatment were calculated, $6,745 v $5,555. Using values for an ''average'' patient, SWL was preferred to URS in terms of patient satisfaction. The most important factors distinguishing between URS and SWL were the success of treatment, the cost of initial therapy, and patient attitudes toward unplanned ancillary procedures and retreatment. Although no alteration of success rates and cost figures within reasonable ranges made URS less cost-effective than SWL, individual differences in patients' aversion for complications allowed URS to be preferred to SWL in some situations. Therefore, SWL is less cost-effective than URS and is not necessarily preferred by patients. The physician should be aware of the principal determinants of the choice between URS and SWL treatment of distal ureteral calculi.

The linearized multistage model is then used as the default approach to estimate the potential human cancer risk at environmental levels of the chemical. There is an increasing appreciation in the scientific and regulatory communities that chemical carcinogens differ dramatically in potency, exhibit a high degree of tissue and species specificity, and act through different modes of action. This paper advocates a decision tree strategy for classifying carcinogens that are acting primarily through genotoxic, cytotoxic, or mitogenic pathways. A primary concern is whether the chemical has direct genotoxic potential resulting from DNA reactivity or clastogenicity of the compound or its metabolite(s). Knowledge of the exposure-response curve for cytotoxicity is important because initiation and promotion events may occur secondary to a variety of associated activities such as regenerative cell proliferation. Mitogens induce direct stimulation of growth and may provide a selective growth advantage to spontaneously initiated precancerous cells. Of particular concern is the situation where pathological changes induced during the course of the treatment at high doses near the MTD are absent at lower, environmentally relevant, doses. If the tumor response is coincident with the preceding toxic response, it may not be justified to use the high-dose data in extrapolating to expected responses at low environmental exposures where no induced tissue abnormalities occur. Suggestions are presented for appropriate risk assessment approaches for different modes of action. Examples discussed are formaldehyde, a weakly genotoxic rodent nasal carcinogen; chloroform, a nongenotoxic-cytotoxic rodent liver and kidney carcinogen; and phenobarbital, a nongenotoxic-mitogenic rodent liver carcinogen.

This methodology associates three complementary techniques, namely digital cell image analysis, the discretisation of numerical data and a Decision TI ee technique (DT). The first technique relies on the use of the digital cell image analysis of Feulgen-stained nuclei, a technique which makes possible a quantitative and thus objective description of nuclei with the help of 24 numerical parameters (15 molphonuclear and 9 DNA content- (ploidy level and proliferation activity) related). The second technique transforms each numerical parameter into an ordinal one with a small number of values (2 to 4) so that only the relevant physical significance of the parameters is retained The Decision Tree technique generates classification rules on the basis of the discretised parameters quoted above. This methodology was applied to 53 human soft tissue tumors which included 26 lipomatous tumors (13 malignant liposarcomas and 13 benign lipomas) and 27 smooth muscle tumors (11 malignant leiomyosarcomas and 16 benign leiomyomas). The results show that a distinction between benign (lipoma) and malignant (liposarcoma) lipomatous tumors can easily be made by means of simple logical rules depending on only foul discretised cytological parameters (two ploidy- and two morphonuclear-related). In contrast, no stable or predictive characterisation can be obtained with respect to the difference between leiomyosarcomas and the leiomyomas. Hence, while lipomas and liposarcomas appeared to be two completely distinct biological entities, leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas seem to involve a continuous biological process.

J	MUMTAZ, MM; CIBULAS, W; DEROSA, CT				MUMTAZ, MM; CIBULAS, W; DEROSA, CT			AN INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK TO IDENTIFY SIGNIFICANT HUMAN EXPOSURES (SHELE)	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article							BLOOD LEAD	Typically, health risk assessment methodologies have been designed to assess risks associated with exposure to individual chemicals through one specific medium, such as air, water, or food. This is partly because classical experimental methodology is used to study pure chemicals, and partly because a majority of early promulgated environmental laws (e.g., Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act) regulated chemicals in a given matrix via a specific route. Often, however, exposures in the ambient environment are through multiple routes, multiple media and to multiple chemicals. Presented here is a multimedia framework that health risk assessors can use to identify significant human exposure levels (SHELs) on a site-specific basis. This framework is presented in the context of a decision tree that links health guidance values such as minimal risk levels (MRLs) with site-specific data, using a range of decision-support models. It includes a provision to estimate a level of concern by comparing the estimated total dose (exposures) with guidance values established by the Agency, by other federal organizations, and by basket-survey results. If a SHEL has been identified, a range of follow-up public health actions may be indicated (i.e., surveillance, health education, or other preventive interventions). This framework serves to (1) integrate the overall health assessment process, (2) evaluate the need for public health interventions, (3) incorporate innovative decision-support methods/models, and (4) demonstrate utility of such methods in public health practice and the pursuit of the Agency's mission.

Design: Medical decision analysis using a decision-tree model. Methods: Costs and benefits associated with two alternative strategies are compared. In the first strategy, empirical therapy alone is provided. The second strategy also includes tests to diagnose the cause of dyspepsia. Results: It is more beneficial to test than to employ empirical treatment alone if the a-priori probability P of an organic disease is larger than the ratio of the costs T of testing to the costs C of a missed diagnosis: P>T/C. In most clinical situations, the costs of a missed diagnosis outweigh the costs of testing by a factor of 5-10, for which the cost ratio is 10-20%. Conclusion: Diagnostic tests should be performed in patients with dyspepsia, whenever the probability of finding organic disease exceeds the ratio of the cost of testing to the cost of missing this diagnosis.

Classified images were produced and tested within three days of SIR-C data acquisition, Both C-band (5.7 cm) and L-band (24 cm) wavelengths were necessary to distinguish the cover types. HH polarization was most useful for distinguishing hooded from nonflooded vegetation (C-HH for macrophyte versus pasture, and L-HH for hooded versus nonflooded forest), and cross-polarized L-band data provided the best separation between woody and nonwoody vegetation, Between the April and October missions, the Amazon River level fell about 3.6 m and the portion of the study area covered by flooded forest decreased from 23% to 12%, This study demonstrates the ability of multifrequency SAR to quantify in near realtime the extent of inundation on forested floodplains, and its potential application for timely monitoring of flood events.

This method relies upon the combined use of a specific decisional algorithm (the decision tree) and 23 parameters which include 15 morphonuclear parameters describing the geometric, densitometric, and textural features of a cell nucleus, and 8 parameters describing the various levels of nuclear DNA content. These 23 parameters were objectively quantified by means of the digital cell image analysis of Feulgen-stained nuclei. This methodology was used to investigate whether it could be applied as a diagnostic tool. The biological model chosen included 12 cell lines adapted to grow in vitro and stemming from 4 astrocytomas (weakly malignant astrocytic tumors) and 6 glioblastomas (highly malignant ones). The 2 additional cell lines were from two medulloblastomas (MED) (2 highly malignant primitive neuro-ectodermal tumors). The results demonstrate unambiguously that it is actually possible to distinguish between low-grade and high-grade tumors on the basis of these parameters, which describe their morphonuclear features and the amount of their nuclear content. However, a clear-cut distinction between these different types of tumors can only be attained when a specific technique is used. In the present case this was the decision tree technique. We were not able to distinguish between these various histopathological groups when we used conventional statistical methods including the one-way-variance analysis of data or the carrying out of the X(2) test.

The function estimate is a piecewise polynomial, with the pieces determined by the terminal nodes of a binary decision tree. The decision tree is constructed by recursively partitioning the data according to the signs of the residuals from a model fitted by maximum likelihood to each node. Algorithms for tree-structured Poisson and logistic regression and examples to illustrate them are given. Large-sample properties of the estimates are derived under appropriate regularity conditions.

The different methods are: the F-test, principal component analysis (PCA), a decision tree method: CART, weight evaluation, and optimal cell damage (OCD). The neural networks use the variables selected with the different methods. We compare the percentages of events properly classified by each neural network. The learning set and the test set are the same for all the neural networks.		PRORIOL, J (reprint author), PHYS CORPUSCULAIRE LAB,CLERMONT FERRAND,FRANCE.

J	NAKASUKA, S; KOISHI, T				NAKASUKA, S; KOISHI, T			AUTOMATED EXTRACTION OF ATTRIBUTE HIERARCHIES FOR AN IMPROVED DECISION-TREE CLASSIFIER	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						DECISION TREE CLASSIFIERS; CONCEPTUAL DISTANCE; GENERALIZATION; KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION; KNOWLEDGE-BASES; FAULT DIAGNOSIS	RECOGNITION; DESIGN	A method to automatically extract inherent hierarchies of attribute values from data is proposed to improve the performance of a decision-tree classifier. When attributes used for a decision tree take continuous values, simple decision rules such as ''IF a certain attribute is less than a certain value'' yield good results in many cases. The rationale of this type of rule is the natural tendency that two nearby attribute values have a ''similar meaning'' in the sense that they suggest the same class with high probability. When only discrete-type, unordered attributes are available for tree generation, however, such efficient decision rules are hard to obtain because ''distance relationships'' between the attribute values are seldom known beforehand. In order to solve this problem, the proposed method estimates from the training data set a conceptual distance between each pair of attribute values, and by iteratively grouping two attribute values with minimum distance, generates hierarchies of attribute values, which are then utilized for making the decision tree. This method is applied to the task of fault diagnosis of a certain printed circuit board, and it is indicated that the generated attribute hierarchies can reduce the size of a decision tree sufficiently, which results in a significant improvement of its classification accuracy.

J	SETHI, IK				SETHI, IK			NEURAL IMPLEMENTATION OF TREE CLASSIFIERS	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS			English	Note							DECISION TREES; DESIGN; INFORMATION; RECOGNITION; NETS	Tree Classifiers represent a popular non-parametric classification methodology that has been successfully used in many pattern recognition and learning tasks. However, ''is feature-value greater than or equal to thrsh'' type of tests used in tree classifiers are often found sensitive to noise and minor variations in the data. This has led to the use of soft thresholding in decision trees. Following the decision tree to feedforward neural network mapping of the entropy net [21], three neural implementation schemes for tree classifiers, that allow soft thresholding, are presented in this paper. Results of several experiments using well-known data sets are described to compare the performance of the proposed implementations with respect to decision trees with hard thresholding.

Five types of decision tree (E-trees, N-trees, X-trees, D-trees, and C-trees) are shown to be in exact correspondence with the object-oriented modeling principles generalization with disjoint subclasses, generalization with overlapping subclasses, classification, generalization with restriction, and aggregation, respectively. In addition, C&C modeling and subsequent database implementation are shown to be enhanced through application of such object-oriented modeling principles as association and role names.

Forecasts have been issued for southern Ontario for many years by the province of Ontario, but this is a new undertaking in other parts of the country, where air quality has become a concern in recent years, There is a need for guidance to prepare the forecasts, particularly for prediction of surface O-3 concentration levels near or exceeding the Canadian 1-h maximum acceptable concentration of 82 ppb. Such occurrences are episodic and relatively rare in southern Canada. Probability of occurrence is in the range 0.00-0.08 at the sites in the regions studied here, thus, reliable prediction is difficult without guidance, Mesoscale numerical meteorological-photochemical models are not currently available for routine use in operations, but the capability exists for development and use of sophisticated multivariate statistical techniques for prediction of daily maximum O-3 concentration. Most statistical ozone forecast procedures to date in Canada have been based on multiple linear regression with a limited number of predictors mainly drawn from surface meteorology and subjective classification of the synoptic meteorological flow pattern, Since the relationship between surface O-3 and meteorology is nonlinear, tree-based statistical models with several predictors are appropriate for developing objective forecast guidance. Surface and upper-air meteorological predictor; and other predictors were matched with several years of observed daily maximum O-3 concentrations for the months of May-September at air-monitoring sites in the three regions. A recent nonparametric data-driven tree-based analysis method known as CART (classification and regression trees) was used to analyze the data at each site. The decision trees built by CART were found to fit the data reasonably well, and the rules for node splitting were found to be physically realistic, Some of the important aspects of the analyses are noted. One interesting result was that moisture content of the air plays a limiting role on the maximum surface O-3 concentration that can be achieved when other factors point to occurrence of high values. The decision trees can be used to predict maximum surface O-3 concentrations if the predictor variables are forecast, thus providing an inexpensive site-specific model for forecasts and climate impact analysis. An estimation of performance with independent data was conducted for the Vancouver-lower Fraser River valley and Montreal regions for each of the five years 1988-92. Verification of the ensemble of forecasts in the two regions shows the technique would have reasonably good skill in forecasting surface O-3 concentrations near or exceeding acceptable 1-h limits. A computer version of the technique has been provided for use in the regional forecast offices.

Design-A decision tree was used to combine data from local sources and the medical literature to predict the likely frequency of several outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were used to test the robustness of the conclusions drawn. Setting-Oxfordshire Health Authority. Main outcome measures-live births with and without Down's syndrome; miscarriages with Down's syndrome; cases of Down's detected antenatally; amniocenteses (and associated miscarriages); direct NHS screening costs; number of women offered screening. Results-Screening policies for Down's syndrome that include serum testing can produce better population outcomes than programmes that do not. Each option for screening for Down's syndrome that we considered had significant drawbacks. In Oxfordshire, offering serum testing to women of all ages would prevent the birth of approximately one more baby with Down's syndrome per year than would a policy of screening for women aged 30 years or more. The cost of preventing this one extra Down's birth would be one or two normal babies lost after amniocentesis, 4500 blood tests for young women (with the associated anxiety and counselling), approximately 200 false positive serum test results and amniocenteses (with the associated anxiety and distress), and pound 90 000 for the extra tests, counselling, and amniocenteses. Opinions are divided as to which policy is the better option for the population. Conclusions-Decision analysis is a useful tool for determining the likely consequences of different policy options across a broad range of outcomes. This focuses debate and decision making on outcomes of care, which in turn makes it clear that the choice of screening programme for Down's syndrome depends on the relative importance ascribed to the different outcomes. If individuals' values vary widely it may be impossible to find one screening policy that meets the needs of all pregnant women.

J	KASSOFF, J; MEYER, DR				KASSOFF, J; MEYER, DR			EARLY OFFICE-BASED VS LATE HOSPITAL-BASED NASOLACRIMAL DUCT PROBING - A CLINICAL DECISION-ANALYSIS	ARCHIVES OF OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Article							OBSTRUCTION; IRRIGATION	Background: Controversy exists regarding the treatment of infants with symptomatic nasolacrimal duct obstruction. One philosophy advocates ''early'' nasolacrimal duct probing, generally in the office. An alternate strategy advocates medical management until the infant is approximately 12 months old to allow for spontaneous resolution, with those with persistent nasolacrimal duct obstruction usually treated by ''late'' probing in the hospital with the use of general anesthesia. Methods: We used clinical decision analysis to compare these two opposing treatment strategies. A decision tree was constructed with the usual designations for probability nodes and decision points, comparing early probing at 6 months of age in the office and late probing at 12 months of age in the hospital. The initial decision point thus addressed treatment of children who still had symptomatic nasolacrimal duct obstruction at 6 months of age. One repeated probing under same-strategy conditions was performed for patients in whom initial office probing failed. Values for probability nodes were derived from the ophthalmic literature, including a 70% rate of spontaneous resolution of nasolacrimal duct obstruction between the ages of 6 and 12 months. Results: Both the early office probing strategy and the late hospital probing strategy yielded success rates greater than 99%. Based on prevailing fees, the late hospital strategy cost $2 310 000 more than the early office strategy per 10 000 patients, even though fewer procedures were performed. Conclusion: Early office probing and late hospital probing have similar high success rates, albeit at a higher cost for the late hospital. probing strategy.

Method: For this analysis, a computerized decision tree of clinical practice was developed to model the 12-month treatment of moderate to severe depression in Canada. To complete the model, data were obtained from physician panels, the Ontario Ministry of Health, and clinical comparative trials of paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and imipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant. Results: The overall cost of treatment when paroxetine 30 mg per day was used first-line was found to be lower than when generic imipramine was used as the initial therapy ($1697 versus $1793). The higher drug cost of paroxetine ($1.69 per day) versus imipramine ($0.05 per day) was offset by a higher rate of treatment failures with the tricyclic necessitating an alternate therapy, additional physician visits and/or hospitalization. Sensitivity analysis of key variables determined that drug price and relapse rates after discontinuation were relatively insensitive predictors of the overall cost of care. More important was the continuation rate while on different therapies. Conclusion: Paroxetine demonstrated a cost-benefit relative to imipramine when the continuation rate was greater than or equal to 47%. Clinical trials of paroxetine have reported continuation rates of 41% to 65%, suggesting that paroxetine is a cost-effective alternative to imipramine in the 1-year management of patients with moderate to severe depression.

Optimal treatment strategies for individual patients are identified, by combining early surgery (on day 2), delayed surgery (on day 10), late elective surgery after 3 months, antifibrinolytics and nimodipine. The risks of rebleeding, infarction and mortality from the initial haemorrhage were estimated by proportional hazards regression in a reanalysis of a randomized clinical trial of antifibrinolytics against placebo. These combined with data from the literature are used in a decision tree to compute the chances of good recovery, moderate and severe disability and death after 3 months, and the (discounted quality-adjusted) life expectancy for each treatment strategy. Treatment with nimodipine is recommeded for all patients. For patients in good clinical condition at admission, antifibrinolytics and delayed surgery form the optimal treatment strategy. However, the benefits of early or delayed surgery are small compared to elective late surgery in this group, and therefore the surgical complication rate should be low. Patients with a heavy load of subarachnoid blood on CT scan should be treated with (delayed) surgery, but not with antifibrinolytics, because of the increased risk of infarction.

This paper describes: 1) the development and use of a brain tissue probability model for the segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in magnetic resonance (MR) brain images, and 2) an empirical comparison of the performance of statistical and decision tree classifiers, applied to MS lesion segmentation, Based on MR image data obtained from healthy volunteers, the model provides prior probabilities of brain tissue distribution per unit voxel in a standardized 3-D ''brain space.'' In comparison to purely data-driven segmentation, the use of the model to guide the segmentation of MS lesions reduced the volume of false positive lesions by 50-80%.

A further reliable segmentation is achieved by a modified Markov random field (MRF) model-based method, In classification, the MRF segmented regions are classified into suspicious and normal by a fuzzy binary decision tree based on a series of radiographic, density-related features, A set of normal (50) and abnormal (45) screen/film mammograms were tested, The latter contained 48 biopsy proven, malignant masses of various types and subtlety, The detection accuracy of the algorithm was evaluated by means of a free response receiver operating characteristic curve which shows the relationship between the detection of true positive masses and the number of false positive alarms per image, The results indicated that a 90% sensitivity can be achieved in the detection of different types of masses at the expense of two falsely detected signals per image, The algorithm was notably successful in the detection of minimal cancers manifested by masses less than or equal to 10 mm in size, For the 16 such cases in our dataset, a 94% sensitivity was observed with 1.5 false alarms per image, An extensive study of the effects of the algorithm's parameters on its sensitivity and specificity was also performed in order to optimize the method for a clinical, observer performance study.

A new and simpler proof is given of Salowe's theorem, i.e., a sequential algorithm is given that computes the k closest pairs in the set S in O(n log n + k) time, using O(n + k) space. The algorithm fits in the algebraic decision tree model and is, therefore, optimal. Salowe's algorithm seems difficult to parallelize. A parallel version of our algorithm is given for the CRCW-PRAM model. This version runs in O((log n)(2) log log n) expected parallel time and has an O(n log n log log n + k) time-processor product. Finally, actual running times are given of an implementation of our sequential algorithm.

In contrast, we observe that the problem of computing the Voronoi diagram of a finite sequence of points in the plane which gives the sorted order of the points with respect to a single direction requires Omega(n log n) operations in the algebraic decision tree model. As a corollary from the first result, we show that the bounded Voronoi diagrams of simple n-vertex polygons which can be efficiently cut into the so called monotone histograms can be computed in o(n log n) time.

J	SEILER, RL				SEILER, RL			PREDICTION OF AREAS WHERE IRRIGATION DRAINAGE MAY INDUCE SELENIUM CONTAMINATION OF WATER	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article								The U.S. Department of the Interior has investigated 25 areas in the western USA to determine whether irrigation drainage has caused harmful effects on wildlife or has reduced subsequent beneficial uses of the water. A database of chemical analyses of water, sediment, and biota from the 25 areas was created and supplemented with geologic, climatologic, and hydrologic data. The data were evaluated to identify common features among study areas and principal factors that result in Se contamination of water in lakes, ponds, and streams downgradient of irrigated areas. From the analysis of data, a decision tree that uses readily available geologic, climatologic, and hydrologic data was derived for use by resource managers as a screening tool to predict the likelihood that irrigation drainage will result in Se contamination in areas of the western USA. Irrigation in areas that are not associated with marine sedimentary rocks of late Cretaceous age is unlikely to cause Se contamination. Irrigation in very arid areas that are associated with these Cretaceous sediments Is almost certain to cause Se contamination if the irrigation water drains to terminal lakes and ponds. The likelihood that an area will be contaminated with Se because of irrigation drainage can change, particularly with changes in precipitation. During normal or wet periods, Se contamination may not occur in an area, even though it has seleniferous soils, but reduced water deliveries during a drought in such an area may result in Se contamination.

J	ROSE, RC				ROSE, RC			KEYWORD DETECTION IN CONVERSATIONAL SPEECH UTTERANCES USING HIDDEN MARKOV MODEL-BASED CONTINUOUS SPEECH RECOGNITION	COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE			English	Article								This paper describes a set of modeling techniques for detecting a small vocabulary of keywords in running conversational speech. The techniques are applied in the context of a hidden Markov model (HMM) based continuous speech recognition (CSR) approach to keyword spotting. The word spotting task is derived from the Switchboard conversational speech corpus, and involves unconstrained conversational speech utterances spoken over the public switched telephone network. The utterances in this task contain many of the artifacts that are characteristic of unconstrained speech as it appears in many telecommunications based automatic speech recognition (ASR) applications. Results are presented for an experimental study that was performed on this task. Performance was measured by computing the percentage correct keyword detection over a range of false alarm rates evaluated over 2-2 h of speech for a 20 keyword vocabulary. The results of the study demonstrate the importance of several techniques. These techniques include the use of decision tree based allophone clustering for defining acoustic subword units, different representations for non-vocabulary words appearing in the input utterance, and the definition of simple language models for keyword detection. Decision tree based allophone clustering resulted in a significant increase in keyword detection performance over that obtained using tri-phone based subword units while at the same time reducing the size of the inventory of subword acoustic models by 40%. More complex representations of non-vocabulary speech were also found to significantly improve keyword detection performance; however, these representations also resulted in a significant increase in computational complexity.

Identifying carcinogens and limiting their exposure is one approach to the problem of reducing risk. Currently, epidemiology and rodent bioassays are the means by which putative human carcinogens are identified. Both methods have intrinsic limitations: they are slow and expensive processes with many uncertainties. The development of methods to modify specific genes in the mammalian genome has provided promising new tools for identifying carcinogens and characterizing risk. Transgenic mice may provide advantages in shortening the time required for bioassays and improving the accuracy of carcinogen identification; transgenic mice might now be included in the testing armamentarium without abandoning the two-year bioassay, the current standard. We show that mutagenic carcinogens can be identified with increased sensitivity and specificity using hemizygous p53 mice in which one allele of the p53 gene has been inactivated. Furthermore, the TG.AC transgenic model, carrying a v-Haras construct, has developed papillomas and malignant tumors in response to a number of mutagenic and nonmutagenic carcinogens and tumor promoters, but not to noncarcinogens. We present a decision-tree approach that permits, at modest extra cost, the testing of more chemicals with improved ability to extrapolate from rodents to humans.

The conventional method, using a decision tree, applies only to discrete attribute values, To apply it to fault diagnosis of power distribution lines, in practice it must be revised in order to treat attributes whose values range over certain widths, This is because the sensor value or attribute value varies owing to the resistance of the fault point or is influenced by noise, The proposed method is useful when the attribute value has such a property, and it takes into consideration the cost of acquiring the information and the probability of the occurrence of a fault.

J	SCHUBERT, J				SCHUBERT, J			ON P IN A DECISION-THEORETIC APPARATUS OF DEMPSTER-SHAFER THEORY	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article						BELIEF FUNCTIONS; DECISION ANALYSIS; DECISION MAKING; DECISION TREE; DEMPSTER-SHAFER THEORY; EVIDENTIAL REASONING; REASONING UNDER UNCERTAINTY		Thomas M. Strat has developed a decision-theoretic apparatus for Dempster-Shafer theory (Decision analysis using belief functions, Intern. J. Approx. Reason. 4(5/6), 391-417, 1990). In this apparatus, expected utility intervals are constructed for different choices. The choice with the highest expected utility is preferable to others. However to find the preferred choice when the expected utility interval of one choice is included in that of another, it is necessary to interpolate a discerning point in the intervals. This is done by the parameter rho, defined as the probability that the ambiguity about the utility of every nonsingleton focal element will turn out as favorable as possible. If there are several different decision makers, we might sometimes be more interested in having the highest expected utility among the decision makers rather than only trying to maximize our own expected utility regardless of choices made by other decision makers. The preference of each choice is then determined by the probability of yielding the highest expected utility. This probability is equal to the maximal interval length of rho under which an alternative is preferred We must here take into account not only the choices already made by other decision makers but also the rational choices we can assume to be made by later decision makers. In Strats apparatus, an assumption, unwarranted by the evidence at hand, has to be made about the value of rho. We demonstrate that no such assumption is necessary It is sufficient to assume a uniform probability distribution for rho to be able to discern the most preferable choice. We discuss when this approach is justifiable.		SCHUBERT, J (reprint author), NATL DEF RES ESTAB,DEPT COMMAND CONTROL WARFARE TECHNOL,DIV INFORMAT SYST TECHNOL,S-17290 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN.

These include animal toxicology, toxicokinetics, allometric scaling, pharmacokinetics, body surface area correlations, and integration of preclinical pharmacologic and toxicologic data. Appropriate preclinical evaluation and analysis may reduce the frequency and severity of unexpected toxic events arising during single-dose, phase I testing. However, significant intrinsic uncertainties in this process presently exist and will continue to exist well into the foreseeable future. With our present state of knowledge, we cannot provide a realistic and reasonable algorithm for ascertaining first-time-in-human doses: any decision tree would be too unwieldy. There are several rules of thumb that do have a place in the evaluation and decision-making process, however.

J	CALLAHAN, SM; VOLAND, G				CALLAHAN, SM; VOLAND, G			EXTRACTING KNOWLEDGE FROM EXAMPLES - INDUCTION OF HEURISTIC RULES FOR WHEELCHAIR PRESCRIPTION	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & ROBOTIC SYSTEMS			English	Article						WHEELCHAIR PRESCRIPTION; ID3; MACHINE LEARNING; EXPERT SYSTEM; REHABILITATION; EQUIPMENT SELECTION; INDUCTION		The feasibility of using an induction algorithm to discover heuristic rules for wheelchair equipment selection is investigated. Syntactical rules for two description languages (one to describe the disabled client and another to describe wheelchair equipment configurations) are presented. These languages allow the rulebase developer to describe training instances (examples) to the computer in an intelligible way. An induction learning algorithm is used to classify these training instances, thereby producing a decision tree. Heuristic rules can then be extracted from the tree and placed in a rulebase for an expert system called LEADER. LEADER is being developed to aid a wheelchair prescriber in the equipment selection process. There are two important objectives of this research: (1) to reduce the time and facilitate the development of an intelligent expert system rulebase by extracting knowledge embedded within existing examples and (2) to provide the expert system with the ability to learn new rules autonomously. The ability to learn makes the rulebase dynamic; the initial rulebase would be augmented with new rules as additional examples are provided to the system while it is in clinical use.

J	DEAR, SF; BEASLEY, RD; BARR, KP				DEAR, SF; BEASLEY, RD; BARR, KP			USE OF A DECISION TREE TO SELECT THE MUD SYSTEM FOR THE OSO FIELD, NIGERIA	JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								Far too often, the basis for selection of a mud system is the ''latest, greatest'' technology or personal preference rather than sound cost-effective analysis. The use of risk-vs.-cost decision analysis improves mud selection and makes it a proper business decision. Several mud systems usually are available to drill a well and, with good decision analysis, the cost-effectiveness of each alternative becomes apparent. The Nigerian Natl. Petroleum Corp. and Mobil Producing Nigeria (MPN) recently began development of the Oso field, a condensate development funded by the World Bank. The budget authorized $187 million for development drilling of 19 wells and completion of 21 wells. Early drilling was very troublesome owing to wellbore instability, lost circulation, and stuck pipe. In addition, the mud cost was excessive because of high dilution rates and expensive mud products (especially barite, which was approximate to 50% of the final mud cost). This paper describes how the drilling team used structured decision analysis to evaluate and select the best mud system for the project. First, Monte Carlo simulations forecast the range of possible results with each alternative. The simulations provided most-likely values for the variables in the decision tree, including reasonable ranges for sensitivity analyses. This paper presents and discusses the simulations, the decision tree, and the sensitivity analyses. The analysis compares several factors in six mud systems, including cost-per-barrel; dilution; trip time; rate of penetration (ROP); stuck pipe, lost-circulation, wellbore-stability, torque-and-drag, filter-cake, and carbonate problems; and environmental concerns. The analysis used variables based on actual data whenever possible. The results indicated that, in spite of necessary rig modifications and increased risk of lost circulation, a mineral-oil-based mud was the best choice. Before introduction of the mineral-oil-based mud, a steady improvement had occurred in drilling performance, which improved dramatically after this mud was introduced. During the project, 21 wells were completed and 22 development wells were drilled (three more than originally planned). Total cost was $176 million, $28 million under the original budget and $11 million under the final budget. This paper presents field results that show the improvement in well, mud, and coring costs; average ROP; and trouble time. Through sound application of decision analysis, selection of the mud system becomes a sound business decision.

J	BRYG, DJ				BRYG, DJ			CONTINUOUS TREES AND NEVADA SIMULATION - A QUADRATURE APPROACH TO MODELING CONTINUOUS RANDOM-VARIABLES IN DECISION-ANALYSIS	MEDICAL DECISION MAKING			English	Article						CONTINUOUS TREES; NEVADA SIMULATION; DECISION ANALYSIS; MODELING	LIFE	This paper introduces an improved technique for modeling risk and decision problems that have continuous random variables and probabilistic dependence. Variables are modeled with mixtures of four-parameter random variables, called ''continuous trees.'' Functions of random Variables are calculated using gaussian quadrature in a manner called ''NEVADA simulation'' (NumErical integration of Variance And probabilistic Dependence Analyzer). This technique is compared with traditional decision-tree modeling in terms of analytic technique, solution-time complexity, and accuracy. NEVADA simulation takes advantage of the probabilistic independence in a decision problem while allowing for probabilistic dependence to achieve polynomial computational-time complexity for many decision problems. it improves on the accuracy of traditional decision trees by employing larger approximations than traditional decision analysis. It improves on traditional decision analysis by modeling continuous variables with continuous, rather than discrete, distributions, A Bayesian analysis using a mixed discrete-continuous probability distribution for cigarette smoking rate is presented.

Methods for the analysis of the structure and physicochemical properties of molecules referred to include topological analysis, molecular orbital calculations, input of chemical structures, molecular modelling, cluster analysis and pattern recognition. Emphasis is placed on the importance of identifying substructural fragments of sufficient size and physicochemical specificity to act as toxicophores. Procedures for processing structural information include decision-tree and probabilistic systems, as well as algebraic and related statistical analyses for obtaining quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). The principal differences between knowledge-based and automated rule-induction expert systems, and their utilisation for predicting the activity of chemicals, are discussed by reference to the use of several methods, including DEREK, HAZARDEXPERT, COMPACT, CASE and TOPKAT. It is concluded that these AI expert approaches have an important role to play in predictive toxicity screening as alternatives to animal experiments.

For the improvement of the diagnostic values of these markers, a ''recursive partitioning and amalgamation'' algorithm was employed to construct a decision protocol. A total of 636 subjects including 161 healthy subjects, 163 patients with GAG, 196 with gastric ulcer and 116 with duodenal ulcer were enrolled Serum levels of gastrin, pepsinogen I, pepsinogen II, and the ratio of pepsinogen I / pepsinogen II were determined for each of the subjects. The proposed ''decision tree'' classifies subjects into five subgroups with different risks of GAC and peptic ulcer, based on the information of age, serum pepsinogen and gastrin levels. Using this novel analysis system, an expected probability of GAC or ulcers could be obtained Patients with an age > 62 years and a serum level of pepsinogen I less than or equal to 33 ng/ml were strongly indicated for further confirmatory tests of GAC. This tree-structured analysis is also helpful in clarifying the interactions between various serologic markers and demographic factors.

Design: Decision analysis model comparing two different strategies for detecting brain metastases: brain er routinely (CT-first) or brain CT only when patients develop neurologic signs and/or symptoms (CT-deferred). Patients: Hypothetical cohort of patients with lung cancer with an unremarkable screening clinical evaluation for metastases. Measurements: Net costs are calculated as the difference in costs between the two limbs of the decision tree. Net benefits are expressed as the difference in calculated years of life expectancy between the two strategies, Net costs are divided by net benefits, yielding the marginal cost per quality adjusted year of added life expectancy (C/QALY) for the CT-first strategy, Results: In the baseline analysis, the C/QALY for the CT-first strategy is about $70,000, Improving the clinical evaluation as a screen for detecting brain metastases markedly increases the C/QALY, Increasing the cost of brain CT magnifies this effect, More effective treatment for asymptomatic brain metastases and better accuracy of CT for identifying resectable and unresectable brain metastases lower C/QALY. Conclusions: Although a threshold cost-effectiveness has not been defined for identifying ''cost-effective'' diagnostic procedures, the marginal C/QALY of the CT-first strategy is substantially higher than many accepted medical interventions, At current costs, the routine use of brain CT is not warranted in patients with lung cancer who have normal findings on a standardized clinical evaluation for metastases.

J	BENNETT, C; SAGAN, BE				BENNETT, C; SAGAN, BE			A GENERALIZATION OF SEMIMODULAR SUPERSOLVABLE LATTICES	JOURNAL OF COMBINATORIAL THEORY SERIES A			English	Article							FREE ARRANGEMENTS	Stanley (Algebra Universalis 2, 1972, 197-217) introduced the notion of a supersolvable lattice, L, in part to combinatorially explain the factorization of its characteristic polynomial over the integers when L is also semimodular. He did this by showing that the roots of the polynomial count certain sets of atoms of the lattice. In the present work we define an object called an atom decision tree. The class of semimodular lattices with atom decision trees strictly contains the class of supersolvable lattices, but their characteristic polynomials still factor for combinatorial reasons. We then apply this notion to prove the factorization of polynomials associated with various hyperplane arrangements having non-supersolvable lattices. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.

Design: In a prospective clinical study, we compared the diagnostic performances of clinical symptoms, presenting EGG, creatine kinase, creatine kinase MB activity and mass concentration, myoglobin, and cardiac troponin T test results of hospital admission blood samples. By classification and regression trees, a decision tree for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction was developed. Setting: Emergency room of a Department of Internal Medicine (University Hospital). Patients: One hundred fourteen nontraumatic chest pain patients (median delay from onset of chest pain to hospital admission, 3 h; range, 0.33 to 22): 26 Q-wave and 19 non-Q-wave myocardial infarctions, 49 patients with unstable angina pectoris, and 20 patients with chest pain caused by other diseases. Measurements and results: Of each parameter taken by itself, the ECG was tendentiously most informative (areas under receiver operating characteristic plots: 0.87+/-0.04 [ECG], 0.80+/-0.08 [myoglobin], 0.80+/-0.04 [creatine kinase MB mass], 0.77+/-0.04 [creatine kinase activity], 0.69+/-0.06 [clinical symptoms], 0.67+/-0.06 [creatine kinase MB activity], 0.67+/-0.05 [troponin T]). In patients presenting 3 h or less after the onset of chest pain, ECG signs of acute transmural myocardial ischemia were the best discriminator between patients with and without myocardial infarction. In patients presenting more than 3 h, however, creatine kinase MB mass concentrations (discriminator value, 6.7 mu g/L) were superior to the EGG, clinical symptoms, and all other biochemical markers tested. This algorithm for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction was superior to each parameter by itself and was characterized by 0.91 sensitivity, a 0.90 specificity, a 0.90 positive and negative predictive value, and a 0.90 efficiency. Conclusions: We found an algorithm that could accurately separate the myocardial infarction patients from the others on admission to the emergency department. Therefore, this classifier could be a valuable diagnostic aid for rapid confirmation of a suspected myocardial infarction.

Methods are derived from simple counts, logistic regression analysis, Quality Receiver Operating Characteristic (QROC) analyses or a combination. Nine approaches were compared: Best Single Item, Count of Entire Symptom list, Count of Refined Symptom list, Logistic Regression All In Score, Logistic Regression Backward Score, Logistic Regression Backward Count, Logistic Regression Forward Score, Logistic Regression Forward Count and QROC Decision Tree. The validation criterion and symptom lists were based on a computer diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and the measure of agreement between classification and criterion was the weighted kappa. We present the argument that sensitivity and specificity are uncalibrated measures of test performance. Valuable indices of test quality resulted from calibrating sensitivity and specificity by the proportion of test positives. When plotted, the new indices create a QROC plane which facilitates symptom evaluation and combination. Of all the scoring approaches, the Logistic Regression All In was optimally efficient. For ease of use and practicality, a simple count of predictive items may be the optimal choice. Implications for the evaluation of DSM-III-R symptom lists are discussed. We recommend that, instead of reporting scores at a set cut-off point, the full range of scores should be illustrated in a QROC plane. This permits others to evaluate and select cut-off points that are optimal for the research or clinical situation.

J	BenAsher, Y; Newman, I				BenAsher, Y; Newman, I			Decision trees with Boolean threshold queries	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER AND SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							COMPLEXITY	We investigate decision trees in which one is allowed to query threshold functions of subsets of variables. We are mainly interested in the case where only queries of AND and OR are allowed. This model is a generalization of the classical descision tree model. Its complexity (depth) is related to the parallel time that is required to compute Boolean functions in certain CRCW PRAM machines with only one cell of constant size. It is also related to the computation using Ethernet channel. We prove a tight lower bound of theta(k log(n/k)) for the required depth of a decision tree for the threshold-k function. As a corollary of the method we also prove a tight lower bound for the ''direct sum'' problem of computing simultaneously k copies of threshold-2 in this model. Next, the size complexity is considered. A relation to depth-three circuits is established and a lower bound is proven. Finally the relation between randomized, nondeterminism, and determinism is also investigated, we show separation results between these models. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.

Patients presenting with overt regional metastases necessarily undergo therapeutic intervention directed to both the primary site and the neck. However, controversy persists regarding the best management for patients without clinical evidence of nodal disease. Would these patients best be managed with elective treatment of the neck, with no neck treatment unless overt nodal metastases are detected, or would some diagnostic test be beneficial in determining which patients are at highest risk of having occult nodal disease and, therefore, most likely to benefit from elective treatment! We performed a decision analysis to address this question. Baseline probability assumptions were made based on the evidence available in the literature for the parameters of interest. A decision tree was constructed and analyzed. In the final analysis, two options, elective functional neck dissection for all patients and a supraomohyoid neck dissection, were equally beneficial and were significantly better than the remaining options tested. Either of these surgical treatment strategies shifted the survival distribution curve significantly to the right.

This shortcoming can be alleviated if some approximation of the target concept in terms of a logical description is available. The paper reports a successful attempt to initialize neural networks using decision-tree generators. The TBNN (tree-based neural net) system compares very Favourably with other learners in terms of classification accuracy for unseen data, and it is also computationally less demanding than the back propagation algorithm applied to a randomly initialized multilayer perceptron. The behavior of the system is first studied for specially designed artificial data. Then, its performance is demonstrated by a real-world application.

The model integrated environmental databases and knowledge on distribution of vegetation. Soil and terrain decision-tree variables were derived by processing state-wide soil geographic databases and digital terrain data. Variables used as model inputs were soil parent material, soil drainage, soil acidity, slope position, slope gradient, and slope azimuth. Landscape-scale maps of potential vegetation were derived through sequential map overlay operations using a geographic information system (GIS). A verification sample of 276 field plots was analyzed to determine: (1) agreement between GIS-derived estimates of decision-tree variables and direct field measurements, (2) agreement between vegetation distributions predicted using GIS-derived estimates and using field observations, (3) effect of misclassification costs on prediction agreement, (4) influence of particular environmental variables on model predictions, and (5) misclassification rates of the decision-tree model. Results indicate that the prediction model was most sensitive to drainage and slope gradient, and that the imprecision of the input data led to a high frequency of incorrect predictions of vegetation. However, in many cases of misclassification the predicted vegetation was similar to that of the field plots so that the cost of errors was less than expected from the misclassification rate alone. Moreover, since common vegetation types were more accurately predicted than rare types, the model appears to be reasonably good at predicting vegetation for a randomly selected plot in the landscape. The error assessment methodology developed for this study provides a useful approach for determining the accuracy and sensitivity of landscape-scale environmental models, and indicates the need to develop appropriate field sampling procedures for verifying the predictions of such models.

J	Moore, AW; Atkeson, CG				Moore, AW; Atkeson, CG			The parti-game algorithm for variable resolution reinforcement learning in multidimensional state-spaces	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						reinforcement learning; curse of dimensionality; learning control; robotics; kd-trees		Parti-game is a new algorithm for learning feasible trajectories to goal regions in high dimensional continuous state-spaces. In high dimensions it is essential that neither planning nor exploration occurs uniformly over a state-space. Parti-game maintains a decision-tree partitioning of state-space and applies techniques from game-theory and computational geometry to efficiently and adaptively concentrate high resolution only on critical areas. The current version of the algorithm is designed to find feasible paths or trajectories to goal regions in high dimensional spaces. Future versions will be designed to find a solution that optimizes a real-valued criterion. Many simulated problems have been tested, ranging from two-dimensional to nine-dimensional state-spaces, including mazes, path planning, non-linear dynamics, and planar snake robots in restricted spaces. In all cases, a good solution is found in less than ten trials and a few minutes.

J	Zhang, JP; Michalski, RS				Zhang, JP; Michalski, RS			An integration of rule induction and exemplar-based learning for graded concepts	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						learning from examples; graded concepts; exemplar-based learning; concept learning	CATEGORIES	This paper presents a method for learning graded concepts. Our method uses a hybrid concept representation that integrates numeric weights and thresholds with rules and combines rules with exemplars. Concepts are learned by constructing general descriptions to represent common cases. These general descriptions are in the form of decision rules with weights on conditions, interpreted by a similarity measure and numeric thresholds. The exceptional cases are represented as exemplars. This method was implemented in the Flexible Concept Learning System (FCLS) and tested on a variety of problems. The testing problems included practical concepts, concepts with graded structures, and concepts that can be defined in the classic view. For comparison, a decision tree learning system, an instance-based learning system, and the basic rule learning variant of FCLS were tested on the same problems. The results have shown a statistically meaningful advantage of the proposed method over others both in terms of classification accuracy and description simplicity on several problems.

While as compact as an influence diagram, the sequential diagram captures the asymmetric and sequential aspects of decision problems as effectively as decision trees. We show that a unified framework, consisting of a sequential diagram, an influence diagram, and a common formulation table for the problem's data, suffices for compact and consistent representation, economical formulation, and efficient solution of (asymmetric) decision problems. In addition to asymmetry, the framework exploits other sources of computational efficiency, such as conditional independence and value function decomposition, making it also useful in evaluating dynamic-programming problems. The formulation table and recursive algorithm can be readily implemented in computers for solving large-scale problems. Examples are provided to illustrate the methodology in both asymmetric and symmetric cases.

J	Kim, H; Koehler, GJ				Kim, H; Koehler, GJ			Theory and practice of decision tree induction	OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						expert systems; decision tree induction	RULE INDUCTION; EXPERT; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM	Induction methods have recently been found to be useful in a wide variety of business related problems, including in the construction of expert systems. Decision tree induction is an important type of inductive learning method. Empirical results have shown that pruning a decision tree sometimes improves its accuracy. In this paper we summarize theoretical results of pruning and illustrate these results with an example. We give a sample size sufficient for decision tree induction with pruning based on recently developed learning theory. For situations where it is difficult to obtain a large enough sample, we provide several methods for a posterior evaluation of the accuracy of a pruned decision tree. Finally we summarize conditions under which pruning is necessary for better prediction accuracy.

For the top quark signal t (t) over bar --> e/mu + 4 jets, we show how to reject all but 25% of the background in a data sample while retaining 83% of the signal, without introducing bias into the subsequent mass measurement. The technique used is the binary decision tree. Combining this highly efficient procedure for signal identification with a novel algorithm for top quark reconstruction, we propose a powerful new way to measure the top quark mass.

In the fuzzy ID3, it is nearly impossible to obtain the most suitable fuzzy rules since the fuzzy ID3 has a couple of problems, i.e., a problem of a lack of representation and an adjusting problem. In our fuzzy ID3, AND/OR operators are formulated using t-norm and t-conorm connectives with parameters and each parameter is adjusted using golden section method. By using golden section method, we get the optimal solution at a high speed. The proposed fuzzy ID3 gives more accurate fuzzy rules by adjusting parameters. If t-conorm connective is selected as AND/OR operator, the decision tree has more flexible representation.

First, several design scenarios (alternatives) are created based on the preliminary selection of appropriate technologies. Then, reliability analysis for each element of the system is performed. The analysis is based on a defined performance function that incorporates all available data for design and control variables. The uncertainty associated with data quality is also included. Using a decision tree, each alternative is presented through the series of decision-making parameters. System reliability, cost and safety index, (when information on probability distribution is not available) are used as determining factors for the selection of most favorable alternative.

Decision-tree analysis was used to determine the costs and benefits, from an employer's perspective, of several smoking-cessation options. The probability that a smoker would stop smoking was based on two published meta-analyses of smoking-cessation interventions and a national study of nicotine patch users who received a smoking-cessation consultation from a pharmacist. The costs were determined be telephone interviews and market research information. A sensitivity analysis of treatment costs was conducted to determine the optimal treatment from the standpoint of costs versus benefits. The smoking-cessation intervention from which an employer would receive the greatest net benefit is the nicotine patch with smoking-cessation consultation from a pharmacist and patient participation in a formal smoking-cessation program. Pharmacists included in this analysis could charge a smoking-cessation consultation fee of up to $109 per patient. Pharmacoeconomic analysis suggested that smoking-cessation therapy consisting of treatment with nicotine patches, consultations with pharmacists, and participation in a comprehensive behavioral program would be the most cost-beneficial to employers.

J	Morton, DP				Morton, DP			An enhanced decomposition algorithm for multistage stochastic hydroelectric scheduling	ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	IFIP Workshop on Stochastic Programming, Algorithms and Models	JAN, 1994	LILLEHAMMER, NORWAY	IFIP		stochastic programming; hydroelectric scheduling; large-scale systems		Handling uncertainty in natural inflow is an important part of a hydroelectric scheduling model. In a stochastic programming formulation, natural inflow may be modeled as a random vector with known distribution, but the size of the resulting mathematical program can be formidable. Decomposition-based algorithms take advantage of special structure and provide an attractive approach to such problems. We develop an enhanced Benders decomposition algorithm for solving multistage stochastic linear programs.

The decision tree generated by the induction algorithm is generally used to create a set of rules for a traditional rule-based system; however, it may be used to determine the weight (i.e., importance) of features for classification. This approach combines the flexibility of CBR systems with the machine-learning ability to automatically derive decision criteria. We experimentally assess the tolerance of rule induction to noise and missing values and fmd it surprisingly resilient to poor-quality training data. This bodes well for use of rule induction to allow the process of CBR system development to be mole independent of expert judgement.

The aim of this research is to demonstrate that Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques such as inductive learning can provide an alternative approach to existing speech processing techniques such as Dynamic Time Warping (DP), Hidden Markov Modelling (HMM) and Neural Networks (NN). The construction of the decision tree is based on C4.5 inductive system developed by Quinian [1]. The decision tree is generated automatically from the training speech database. The classification is performed using an inference engine to execute the decision tree and classify the firing of the rules. The proposed system [2] has two main advantages. Firstly, it attempts to solve the problem of inter- and intra speaker speech variability, by the use of a large speech database. Secondly, it has the ability to generate decision trees using any combination of features (parametric or acoustic-phonetic). This allows the integration of features from existing signal processing techniques, that are currently used in HMM stochastic modelling, and acoustic-phonetic features, which have been the cornerstone of traditional knowledge based techniques.

The resulting knowledge, in form of symbolic decision trees and easily understood inference mechanisms, has been praised for its compressibility. Unfortunately, the most comprehensible trees have been designed for perfect data described with symbolic features. Over the years, additional methodologies have been proposed to deal with continuous or multi-valued data, and with missing or noisy features. We have recently proposed a new approach, utilizing fuzzy representation. Fuzzy representation bridges the gap between symbolic and non-symbolic data, as it allows both comprehensible descriptions and smooth quantitative processing. In this paper, we summarize the ideas.

In particular, it offers classifiers that combine accuracy and smoothness with deep insight into their decision process. However, their automatic induction from raw numerical databases is an intricate task, so that most existing procedures rely heavily on the user's expertise. In this paper we propose two methods that aim at completely relieving the user from any part of the induction process, without sacrificing the above advantages. The first scheme is based on an extension of the very concept of fuzzy partitioning, whereas the second one involves a new family of discrimination quality measures more suitable for smooth partitioning than traditional ones. Their behavior on an actual case of transient stability assessment is evaluated and compared with conventional decision trees.

The specifics of this system are first described along with its very structure which makes transmission capacity strongly dependent on transient stability limits. Decision trees are then properly adjusted to this intricate real world problem, in particular by using composite attributes, decomposition of the problem into subproblems, and techniques able to reduce the number of dangerous (overoptimistic) diagnostics. Further, the resulting trees are compared with LIMSEL, i.e. the transient stability software presently used at Hydro-Quebec; they are found able to provide indeed an interesting alternative thanks to their intrinsic assets. Finally, limitations of decision trees are discussed and the interest to combine them with other, complementary automatic learning approaches is suggested. This latter issue is explored in a companion paper.

Itraconazole (I-week pulse) therapy may have higher efficacy and an improved adverse-effects profile compared to the continuous therapy regimen. Objective: We performed a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of the most commonly used treatments in Germany for toenail onychomycosis from a health care payer perspective. Methods: A 5-step approach was used. Firstly, the purpose of the study, the comparator drugs, their dosage regimens and the time frame of the analysis were defined. Next, the medical practice and resource consumption patterns associated with the treatment of onychomycosis were identified. In step III a meta-analysis was used to determine the relative efficacy of the comparator drugs. In step IV, a decision tree of the treatment algorithms was constructed for each comparator. The expected cost analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis were also performed, Finally, a sensitivity analysis was carried out. Results: For the four main comparator drugs used to treat toenail onychomycosis in Germany, the clinical response rates (clinical cure plus marked improvement) at the end of the follow-up period (month 12 after starting therapy) were, for itraconazole (1-week pulse dosing): 89.8 +/- 3% (mean +/- SE), terbinafine: 79.4 +/- 10%, itraconazole (continuous dosing): 77.5 +/- 9%, and ciclopirox nail varnish: 55 +/- 5%, Itraconazole (1-week pulse dosing) was most cost-effective at DM 1,107 per successful treatment, followed by oral terbinafine at DM 1,224, ciclopirox nail varnish and itraconazole (continuous dosing). Sensitivity analyses indicated that itraconazole (1-week pulse dosing) and terbinafine had similar cost-effectiveness ratios. Conclusion: Itraconazole is an effective, broad-spectrum triazole used as continuous or pulse therapy in the treatment of onychomycosis. Itraconazole (1-week pulse) and terbinafine are the most cost-effective therapies for toenail onychomycosis.

To reduce effects of other factors such as tree learning methods, new attribute search strategies, evaluation functions, and stopping criteria, a single tree learning algorithm is developed. With different option settings, it can construct four different types of new attribute, but all other factors are fixed. The study reveals that conjunctive and disjunctive representations have very similar performance in terms of prediction accuracy and theory complexity on a variety of concepts. Moreover, the study demonstrates that the stronger representation power of M-of-N than conjunction and disjunction and the stronger representation power of X-of-N than these three types of new attribute can be reflected in the performance of decision tree learning.

J	Harding, WT; Redmond, RT				Harding, WT; Redmond, RT			Compilers and knowledge dictionaries for expert systems: Inference engines of the future	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article								For the most part, the current technology of expert system inference engines only provides basic coverage of its rule base, i.e. they do not go beyond the simple matching of symptoms to rules. Today's inference engines do not provide any dynamic reorganization or substitution when certain symptoms are either unavailable as session input or not included in the knowledge base. An expert system prototype Compiler/Knowledge Dictionary Expert System (CKDES) is developed to demonstrate how load, compile, sort, and grouping techniques can both simplify and improve the organization/reorganization of knowledge bases. The CKDES prototype can take ''ill-defined' (unorganized) text knowledge, load (scan) it in, and reorganize it into a workable and efficient knowledge bare. A ''knowledge dictionary'' is generated during the knowledge base load/compile process. A ''knowledge dictionary'' (KD) is here defined as a repository (file) containing the definitions of all symptoms and diagnoses used by the knowledge base. Inference engines of the future can use this KD to dynamically substitute for unavailable symptoms and reorganize decision tree constructs. The CKDES prototype is tested in a nursing diagnostic application. Results of this experiment are presented.

J	Terano, T; Ishino, Y				Terano, T; Ishino, Y			Knowledge acquisition from questionnaire data using simulated breeding and inductive learning methods	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd World Congress on Expert Systems	FEB 05-09, 1996	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA				DECISION-TREE INDUCTION	Marketing decision making tasks require the acquisition of efficient decision rules from noisy questionnaire data. Unlike popular learning;from-example methods, in such tasks, we must interpret the characteristics of the data without clear features of the data nor pre-determined evaluation criteria. The problem is how domain experts get simple, easy-re-understand, and accurate knowledge from noisy data. This paper describes a novel method to acquire efficient decision rules from questionnaire data using both simulated breeding and inductive learning techniques. The basic ideas of the method are that simulated breeding is used to get the effective features from the questionnaire data and that inductive learning is used to acquire simple decision rules from the data. The simulated breeding is one of the Genetic Algorithm based techniques to subjectively or interactively evaluate the qualities of offspring generated by genetic operations. The proposed method has been qualitatively and quantitatively validated by a case study on consumer product questionnnaire data: the acquired rules are simpler than the results from the direct application of inductive learning; a domain expert admits that they are easy to understand; and they are at the same level on the accuracy compared with the other methods. Furthermore, we address three variations of the basic interactive version of the method: (i) with semiautomated GA phases, (ii) with the relatively evaluation phase via AHP, and (iii) with an automated multiagent learning method.

Although, part features form the basis for the formation of the part-machine matrix, they are not directly considered in the process of forming part families and machine cells. The goal of this paper is to understand the characteristics of machine cells in terms of part features. The relationship between part features and machine cells is captured as a decision tree. The decision tree also becomes a tool for post-clustering analysis including evaluation of different clustering methods and for to classify parts that may appear to belong to more than one group. The simplicity of the decision tree, the number of parts classified by each leaf of the tree, and the effect of pruning on the tree are used as metrics to evaluate the clustering methods.

However, CERA is a time consuming procedure when there is no presumption about the actual HTL. Considering the average N1 peak latency curve as a function of the stimulus level above threshold, it is possible to propose a protocol and a decision tree for optimizing stimulus level strategy when the aim is to define the electrophysiological threshold.

As opposed to the usual backing-off to diphones and monophones, the current method aims at finding a triphone model that has proven to exhibit some similarity with the unseen triphone. It is based on a probabilistic mapping of unseen contexts to dusters of triphone-states observed in the training data. This algorithm has been applied to dictation tasks for three languages with vocabulary sizes ranging from 20k to 64k. The results compare favorably with those obtained using standard back-off rules. This technique also offers an alternative to top-down decision-tree procedures which are frequently used especially for their generalization capabilities.

This ensures that these cues have a certain amount of discriminating power but we do not know either the optimal thresholds nor which combination of cues are the most efficient. Therefore, we propose to use the decision tree theory [4] to choose the most discriminating cues and to improve: their discrimination power. Considering the stop occurrences of a training corpus, the best cues are those which allow the decision tree leading to the best partition to be constructed. Mie have considered all the cues derived from the ones provided by the phonetician on formant transitions and burst characteristics. The improvement of the cues has been achieved on a corpus of 941 stops.

Trees are usually created by successive node splitting decisions, based on how well a single Gaussian or Poisson density fits the data associated with a node. We introduce a new node splitting criterion, derived from the maximum likelihood fitting of the complex node distributions with Gaussian tied-mixture densities. We also carry the use of decision trees for tying HMM models a step further. In addition to questions about phonetic class of neighbouring phonemes, we allow questions about the HMM model state to be asked. The resulting decision tree maximizes the likelihood by adjusting the amount of parameter tying simultaneously across stare and context. Accuracy improvement and model size reduction were evaluated on a gender-dependent 5K closed-vocabulary WSJ task, using the SI-84 and SI-284 training sets, for tied-mixture and continuous HMM models. The new decision trees are shown to reduce both error rate and model size, while being computationally cheap enough to allow consideration of two preceding and two following phones for the context.

Context dependent phone models were derived by a decision tree clustering algorithm. In particular, lexical stress was introduced as a clustering variable in addition to the phonetic context. The parameter sharing model was extended by tying HMM states across different target phones. For instance, one or more states of a tense vowel and the corresponding lax vowel were tied if they proved to be acoustically similar. The results indicate that the use of lexical stress information in acoustic modelling might be fruitful when large amounts of training data are available.

A new decision-tree algorithm is developed and applied to the recognizer design which results in hierarchical partitioning of the articulatory state space. The articulatory states associated with common acoustic correlates, a phenomenon caused by the many-to-one articulation-to-acoustics mapping well known in speech production, are automatically clustered by the decision-tree algorithm. This enables effective prediction of the unseen articulatory states in the training, thereby increasing the recognizer's robustness. Some preliminary experimental results are provided.

Speech from an unseen accent group is phonetically transcribed such that pronunciation variations may be derived. These context-dependent variations are clustered in a decision tree which is used as a model of the pronunciation variation associated with this new accent group. The tree is then used to build a new pronunciation dictionary for use during the recognition process. Experiments are presented for the recognition of Lancashire & Yorkshire accented speech using a recognizer trained on London & South East England speakers. The results show that the addition of accent-specific pronunciations can reduce the error rate by almost 20% for cross accent recognition. It is also shown that worthwhile gains in performance can be obtained using only a small amount of accent-specific data.

These sensors can detect snowcover during daylight, cloud-free conditions. The operational procedure developed by NOAA/NESDIS requires an analyst to manually view the images in order to subjectively distinguish between clouds and snowcover, Because this procedure is manually intensive, it is only performed weekly, Since microwave sensors see through nonprecipitating clouds, snowcover can be determined objectively without the intervention of an analyst, Furthermore, microwave sensors can provide daily analysis of snowcover in real-time, which is essential for operational forecast models and regional hydrologic monitoring. Snowcover measurements are obtained from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), flown aboard the DMSP satellites, a decision tree, containing various filters, is used td separate the scattering signature of snowcover from other scattering signatures. Problem areas are discussed and when possible, a filter is developed to eliminate biases, The finalized decision tree is an objective algorithm to monitor the global distribution of snowcover, Comparisons are made between the SSM/I snowcover product and the NOAA/NESDIS subjectively analyzed weekly product.

J	Geman, D; Jedynak, B				Geman, D; Jedynak, B			An active testing model for tracking roads in satellite images	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						decision tree; model-based tracking; active testing; roads; SPOT images	EFFICIENT DECISION TREES; RECOGNITION; CLASSIFICATION; CONSTRUCTION; ENTROPY	We present a new approach for tracking roads from satellite images, and thereby illustrate a general computational strategy (''active testing'') for tracking 1D structures and other recognition tasks in computer vision. Our approach is related to recent work in active vision on ''where to look next'' and motivated by the ''divide-and-conquer'' strategy of parlor games such as ''twenty Questions''. We choose ''tests'' (matched filters for short road segments) one at a time in order to remove as much uncertainty as possible about the ''true hypothesis'' (road position) given the results of the previous tests. The tests are chosen on-line based on a statistical model for the joint distribution of tests and hypotheses. The problem of minimizing uncertainty (measured by entropy) is formulated in simple and explicit analytical terms. To execute this entropy testing rule we then alternate between data collection and optimization: At each iteration new image data are examined and a new entropy minimization problem is solved (exactly), resulting in a new image location to inspect, and so forth. We report experiments using panchromatic SPOT satellite imagery with a ground resolution of ten meters: Given a starting point and starting direction, we are able to rapidly track highways in southern France over distances on the order of one hundred kilometers without manual intervention.

The latter has the lower limit for posterior probability of classification. The triplet-decision tree includes a division-wait mechanism that postpone the decision about uncertain samples which are in marginal area and not able to be classified to any categories definitely. The third node is generated for such samples. Improvement of the triplet tree method is made by introducing linearly-combined variables related to principal components. Flexible and effective segmentation is accomplished by this refinement. Result of experiments by simulation data and real remotely-sensed data are compared by the two methods in the viewpoint of cutting of feature space and classification accuracy. When the normality or representability of sample is hold, classifier with extended quadratic discrimination function has the best performance. The advantage of triplet tree appears when categories are diversified in nature or training samples have poor representabilities.

Hand gesture are quickly recognized by the decision tree made from the image features automatically by our proposed method. There are another pattern recognition methods using image features like nearest-neighbor method. But it is better for computation time to use the decision tree because the decision tree uses only few selected important features.

Features collected from a single or multiple viewpoints care classified using a decision tree. Since only the initial part of the echo is examined, the approach has potential for faster classification than alternative techniques requiring processing of the entire waveform. To emulate a workcell scenario, the approach has been verified mounting a Polaroid sensor at the wrist of a Prima 560 manipulator and implementing a simple modification of the proprietary circuitry (Polaroid Ranging Unit 6500). When tested with a set of 8 small plastic objects with regular shapes, the recognition technique has achieved classification success rates from 72% to 98% depending upon the number and selection of echoes exploited for recognition. The paper illustrates classification performance using single or multiple viewpoints tinder both axis parallel and oblique decision trees.

J	Fisher, D				Fisher, D			Iterative optimization and simplification of hierarchical clusterings	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article							DECISION	Clustering is often used for discovering structure in data. Clustering systems differ in the objective function used to evaluate clustering quality and the control strategy used to search the space of clusterings. Ideally, the search strategy should consistently construct clusterings of high quality, but be computationally inexpensive as well. In general, we cannot have it both ways, but we can partition the search so that a system inexpensively constructs a 'tentative' clustering for initial examination, followed by iterative optimization, which continues to search in background for improved clusterings. Given this motivation, we evaluate an inexpensive strategy for creating initial clusterings, coupled with several control strategies for iterative optimization, each of which repeatedly modifies an initial clustering in search of a better one. One of these methods appears novel as an iterative optimization strategy in clustering contexts. Once a clustering has been constructed it is judged by analysts - often according to task-specific criteria. Several authors have abstracted these criteria and posited a generic performance task akin to pattern completion, where the error rate over completed patterns is used to 'externally' judge clustering utility. Given this performance task, we adapt resampling-based pruning strategies used by supervised learning systems to the task of simplifying hierarchical clusterings, thus promising to ease post-clustering analysis. Finally, we propose a number of objective functions, based on attribute-selection measures for decision-tree induction, that might perform well on the error rate and simplicity dimensions.

J	Webb, GI				Webb, GI			Further experimental evidence against the utility of Occam's razor	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article								This paper presents new experimental evidence against the utility of Occam's razor. A systematic procedure is presented for post-processing decision trees produced by C4.5. This procedure was derived by rejecting Occam's razor and instead attending to the assumption that similar objects are likely to belong to the same class. It increases a decision tree's complexity without altering the performance of that tree on the training data from which it is inferred. The resulting more complex decision trees are demonstrated to have, on average, for a variety of common learning tasks, higher predictive accuracy than the less complex original decision trees. This result raises considerable doubt about the utility of Occam's razor as it is commonly applied in modern machine learning.

While there are many approaches to pruning, the alternative of averaging over decision trees has not received as much attention. The basic idea of tree averaging is to produce a weighted sum of decisions. We consider the set of trees used for the averaging process, and how weights should be assigned to each tree in this set. We define the concept of a fanned set for a tree, and examine how the Minimum Message Length paradigm of learning may be used to average over decision trees. We perform an empirical evaluation of two averaging approaches, and a Minimum Message Length approach.

J	Russmann, W				Russmann, W			Computer-assisted planning of squint surgery	KLINISCHE MONATSBLATTER FUR AUGENHEILKUNDE			German	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th Meeting of the Bielschowsky-Society-for-Research-of-Squint	MAR 18-19, 1995	HAMBURG, GERMANY	Bielschowsky Soc Res Squint		eye muscle surgery; computer aided diagnosis; computer programs; nystagmus; strabismus		Background Two different program systems can be used when planning squint surgery. In the first system's algorithms (Robinson-Miller-Simonsz) are modelled the mechanical and innervational laws that govern eye movements (ophthalmotrope program). With ocular deviations and surgical procedures as input the program estimates postoperative deviations. The second program (Russmann-Konen) mimics any surgeon's planning of squint surgery using a defined decision tree and an appropriate number of mm-degree-relations (planning program). If ocular deviations, axial length, monocular excursions, and head posture are input the program proposes a surgical procedure. I combined both programs to enable the ophthalmotrope program to evaluate the propositions of the planning program. Material and Methods I translated Simonsz' version 1/1989 of Robinson's program from FORTRAN to the programming language of my planning program (Turbo BASIC for IBM-PC) and connected both, the former becoming a module of the latter. Thus data entered into the planning program as well as the surgical procedure proposed may be immediately processed by the ophthalmotrope program to compute the presumed postoperative result. Several program loops allow a wide variation of data and procedures in successive program runs. Turbo BASIC being somewhat slower than FORTRAN quick computers (INTEL 80486, Pentium) are necessary lest processing lasts more than 1 minute. Results A concomitant esotropia of 20 degrees and a head posture with elevation of the chin of 20 degrees are used to illustrate program properties. In the first case the planning program proposes a reasonable recess-resect-procedure 6 mm each, which is estimated to give a very slight overcorrection by the ophthalmotrope module. In the second case the planning module proposes a gaze shift procedure (Kestenbaum) on the vertical recti, which - in good agreement with my own experience - is estimated to produce an A-phenomenon of 19 degrees with an incyclotropia up to 30 degrees by the ophthalmotrope module. If an anterior margin recession of the superior oblique and an anterior margin tuck of the inferior oblique are added to the gaze shift procedure in both eyes neither any phenomenon nor any significant deviation are predicted by the ophthalmotrope module. Conclusions The combination of a planning module with an ophthalmotrope module in one program considerably enhances the usefulness of both.

J	Velupillai, K				Velupillai, K			The computable alternative in the formalization of economics: A counterfactual essay	KYKLOS			English	Article								The mathematization of economics has, almost without exception, proceeded along pathways delineated by the Formalists and the Bourbakians. The methodological underpinnings have been provided by deductivism. Recent developments in logic, the foundations of mathematics and the philosophy of science suggest new possibilities for the formalization of economics along recursion theoretic and inductive lines. In this essay I explore, counterfactually, alternative paths for the mathematization of economics on the basis of these new visions. By choosing particular nodes in an imaginary decision tree depicting the development of mathematical economics, I ask whether a recursion theoretic formalism of economics could have led to alternative, more interesting and interdisciplinary, histories. My conclusion is unambiguously positive in at least one important sense: often, at such crucial nodes, economic concepts have been forced to conform to a narrow mathematical and methodological formalism simply because the appropriate alternatives have been absent; or, when present, unknown to the practitioners. A broader awareness of theoretical technologies and a deeper understanding of the development of mathematical economics is not only necessary; it is also eminently feasible when viewed in this particular counterfactual mode. Examples from core areas in economic theory - consumer and production theory, games and existence proofs - are harnessed to extract the above messages.

The computer networking power point determination by the congestion controlled fairness criteria specifies the interaction or completion of the exercises within the War Games. The Congestion Monitored Link Load Alteration Factor(CMLLAF) is the congestion controlled fairness measure establishing the Sub Game Perfect Theory equilibrium points that are analogous to the computer network Power points. The CMLLAF Protocol operating point criteria for removing constraints at the conclusion of exercises allows the Lagrangian optimization to continue unconstrained minimization of delay for the platform terminal protocols. The CMLLAF measure forms the basis for three intranetwork computational intelligence factors; i.e. Intranetwork Population, Intranetwork Delay and Intranetwork Size CMLLAF Protocols, realized computationally by a geometric structure interface with the MMCR Protocol geometric structure. This treatment of the internal structure of the MMCR Protocol, emphasizes the interaction of the CMLLAF measure with the latency and capacity measurements, wavelet theoretical decision tree performance evaluation, fractal data compression, Category theory admissibility and construction specifications with the Strategic Game Theory, and Maxmin and Minimax Game Theory.

Our approach offers one solution to this problem. For each pair of numeric attributes with strong correlation, we compute a two-dimensional association rule with respect to these attributes and the objective attribute of the decision tree. In particular, we consider a family R of grid-regions in the plane associated with the pair of attributes. For R is an element of R, the data can be split into two classes: data inside R and data outside R. We compute the region R(opt) is an element of R that minimizes the entropy of the splitting, and add the splitting associated with R(opt) (for each pair of strongly correlated attributes) to the set of candidate tests in Quinlan's entropy-based heuristic. We give efficient algorithms for cases in which R is (1) x-monotone connected regions, (2) based-monotone regions, (3) rectangles, and (4) rectilinear convex regions. The algorithm for the first case has been implemented as a subsystem of SONAR(System for Optimized Numeric Association Rules) developed by the authors. Tests show that our approach can create small-sized decision trees.

Although classification is a well-studied problem, most of the current classification algorithms require that all or a portion of the the entire dataset remain permanently in memory. This limits their suitability for mining over large databases. We present a new decision-tree-based classification algorithm, called SPRINT that removes all of the memory restrictions, and is fast and scalable. The algorithm has also been designed to be easily parallelized, allowing many processors to work together to build a. single consistent model. This parallelization, also presented here, exhibits excellent scalability as well. The combination of these characteristics makes the proposed algorithm an ideal tool for data mining.

The number of possible such multiple-split tests grows exponentially in the size of the hierarchy associated with the attribute. It is, therefore, impractical to enumerate and evaluate all these tests in order to choose the best one. We introduce an efficient algorithm for solving this problem that guarantees maximizing the gain-ratio over all possible tests. For a training set of m examples and an attribute hierarchy of height d, our algorithm runs in time proportional to dm, which makes it efficient enough for practical use.

We propose an extension of the feature-vector representation that allows the value of a feature to be a set of strings; for instance, to represent a small white and black dog with the nominal features size and species and the set-valued feature color, one might use a feature vector with size=small, species=canis-familiaris and color={white, black}. Since we make no assumptions about the number of possible set elements, this extension of the traditional feature-vector representation is closely connected to Blum's "infinite attribute" representation. We argue that many decision tree and rule learning algorithms can be easily extended to set-valued features. We also show by example that many real-world learning problems can be efficiently and naturally represented with set-valued features; in particular, text categroization problems and problems that arise in propositionalizing first-order representations lend themselves to set-valued features.

Algorithms for constructing decision trees, such as C4.5, ID3, and CART create a single "best" decision tree during the training phase, and this tree is then used to classify test instances. The tests at the nodes of the constructed tree are good on average, but there may be better tests for classifying a specific instance, We propose a lazy decision tree algorithm-LAZYDT-that conceptually constructs the "best" decision tree for each test instance. In practice, only a path needs to be constructed, and a caching scheme makes the algorithm fast. The algorithm is robust with respect to missing values without resorting to the complicated methods usually seen in induction of decision trees. Experiments on real and artificial problems are presented.	Stanford Univ, Dept Stat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA	Friedman, JH (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Dept Stat, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.

Unfortunately, most real-world problems have to deal with such imperfect data. This paper presents a new model for fuzzy classification by integrating fuzzy classifiers with decision trees. In this approach, a fuzzy classification tree is constructed from the training data set. Instead of defining a specific class for a given instance, the proposed fuzzy classification scheme computes its degree of possibility for each class. The performance of the system is evaluated by empirically compared with a standard decision tree classifier C4.5 on several benchmark data sets the UCI machine learning repository.

The aim of this research is to demonstrate that inductive learning can provide an alternative approach to existing automatic speech recognition techniques such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), Hidden Markov Modelling (HMM) and Neural Networks (NN). The construction of the decision tree is based on C4.5 inductive system developed by Quinlan [1, 2]. The decision tree is generated automatically from the training speech database. The database contains labelled examples in the form of a feature vector and its corresponding label, for each frame. The feature vector may consist of any number of different feature sets and the label may be at the word, phonetic class or phoneme level. The recognition is performed at the frame level, using an inference engine to execute the decision tree and classify the firing of the rules. The proposed system [3, 4] has two main advantages. Firstly, it uses the data-driven approach to isolated word classification, thus attempting to solve the problem of inter and intra speaker speech variability, by the use of a large speech database. Secondly, it has the ability to generate decision trees using any combination of features (parametric or acoustic-phonetic). This allows the integration of features from existing signal processing techniques, that are currently used in HMM stochastic modelling, and acoustic-phonetic features, which have been the cornerstone of traditional knowledge based techniques. Isolated digit recognition results for Texas Instruments (TI) digit database, for speaker dependent and independent recognition, are presented.

J	Dierstein, A; Hayer, R; Rauber, T				Dierstein, A; Hayer, R; Rauber, T			The ADDAP system on the iPSC/860: Automatic data distribution and parallelization	JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING			English	Article							MACHINES	This paper describes the ADDAP system-a parallelizing compiler for distributed memory MIMD machines that automatically computes a data distribution for the arrays of the source program by a branch-and-bound algorithm and parallelizes the inner loops of the program by inserting the necessary communication statements to access nonlocal array sections. The branch-and-bound algorithm incrementally constructs paths in a decision tree where each node on a path corresponds to the distribution of an array of the source program. For each path, a communication analysis tool computes the corresponding communication costs. Based on these costs, the data distribution algorithm tries to find the best data distribution by searching for the cheapest path from a leaf to the root of the decision tree. By rejecting expensive paths as early as possible, the algorithm actually builds only a few paths, corresponding to a small fraction of the decision tree. Therefore, the runtime of the data distribution phase remains quite small also for larger input programs. The structure of the algorithm makes it easy to allow redistributions during program execution. The communication analysis tool computes the communication costs of a data distribution by determining the number and size of the messages that each processor has to receive during program execution. The tool also takes sequentializations into account that are caused by data dependences. A prototype implementation of the system generates code for an Intel iPSC/860. Tests show that the communication costs are determined quite accurately and that the array distributions computed cause only a small communication overhead compared to other data distributions. This results in good speedup values for most of the parallelized programs. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.

The decision-tree analysis allowed determination of the most important measured variables (discriminators) associated with the occurrence of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Those variables may be used to improve reliability and validity of the tree. Statistical validation of endpoint data (leaves) is described, and decision trees are presented that increase the understanding of individual wells and hypothesize causes for sulfate-reducing bacteria.

Using data obtained from a review of the literature, probabilities were assigned to each significant outcome. When numbers were not available, estimates were used and tested with a sensitivity analysis. Routine pre-exposure prophylaxis would prevent 0.054 cases per million adult travellers per month at a cost of 5 billion (thousand million) Canadian dollars. In the worst-case scenario, which concerns children, the cost per case prevented per year of stay would be $275 000 dollars. Our decision analysis leads us to believe that routine pre-exposure prophylaxis given to travellers hending for rabies-endemic regions of the world is not indicated. We conclude that pre-exposure rabies prophylaxis is a medical decision that must be individualized for every traveller and should be particularly considered for children at high risk of being exposed to rabies, who are leaving for a long stay (more than one year) and who will not have rapid access to medical services and rabies immunobiologics.

J	Miller, D; Rose, K				Miller, D; Rose, K			Hierarchical, unsupervised learning with growing via phase transitions	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							VECTOR QUANTIZATION; ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION; DESIGN	We address unsupervised learning subject to structural constraints, with particular emphasis placed on clustering with an imposed decision tree structure. Most known methods are greedy, optimizing one node of the tree at a time to minimize a local cost. By constrast, we develop a joint optimization method, derived based on information-theoretic principles and closely related to known methods in statistical physics. The approach is inspired by the deterministic annealing algorithm for unstructured data clustering, which was based on maximum entropy inference. The new approach is founded on the principle of minimum cross-entropy, using informative priors to approximate the unstructured clustering solution while imposing the structural constraint. The resulting method incorporates supervised learning principles applied in an unsupervised problem setting. In our approach, the tree ''grows'' by a sequence of bifurcations that occur while optimizing an effective free energy cost at decreasing temperature scales. Thus, estimates of the tree size and structure are naturally obtained at each temperature in the process. Examples demonstrate considerable improvement over known methods.

Decision tree indiction, based on ID3, is a well-known approach of learning from examples. In this article we introduce a new data representation formalism that extends the original ID3 algorithm. We propose a new algorithm, ID+, which adopts this representation scheme. ID+ provides the capability of modeling dependencies between attributes or attribute values and of handling multiple values per attribute. We demonstrate our work via a series of medical knowledge acquisition experiments that are based on a ''real-world'' application of acute abdominal pain in children. In the context of these experiments we compare ID+ with C4.5, Newld and a Naive Bayesian classifier Results demonstrate that the rules acquired via ID+ improve decision tree clinical comprehensibility and complement explanations supported by the Naive Bayesian classifier, while in terms of classification, accuracy decrease is marginal.

The authors propose to understand a neural network via rules extracted from it. Their algorithm, NeuroRule, extracts rules from a standard feed-forward neural network, with network training and pruning via the simple, widely used back-propagation method. The extracted rules, a one-to-one mapping of the pruned network, are compact and comprehensible and do not involve weight values. The authors' experiments show that neural-network-based rules are as accurate and compact as decision-tree-based rules, which are widely regarded as explicit and understandable. Thus, using rules extracted by NeuroRule, neural networks become understandable and could lose their black-box reputation.

J	Sielken, RL; ValdezFlores, C				Sielken, RL; ValdezFlores, C			Comprehensive realism's weight-of-evidence based distributional dose-response characterization	HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT			English	Article						benchmark dose; uncertainty factors; reference dose; alternatives to default assumptions; tree; plausibility distribution; quantitative sensitivity analyses	MONKEYS	Challenges to low-dose Linearity and other default assumptions in cancer risk assessment and the limitations associated with NOAELs, LOAELs, and constant uncertainty factor values in the evaluation of noncancer health effects have stimulated the continued evolution of risk assessment methodologies. The increasing need for more realistic estimates of the dose-response relationship, better uncertainty characterization, and greater utilization of cost-benefit analyses have also contributed to this evolution. ''Comprehensive Realism'' is an emerging quantitative weight-of-evidence based risk assessment methodology for both cancer and noncancer health effects which utilizes probability distributions and decision analysis techniques to reflect more of the relevant human exposure data, more of the available and pertinent human and animal dose-response data, and the current state of knowledge about the relative plausibility of alternative dose-response analyses. A tree (like a decision tree and a probability tree) is used to decompose the dose-response assessment into component factors, to provide a structure for explicitly considering multiple alternatives for each factor, and to explicitly incorporate the current state of knowledge about the relative plausibility of these alternatives. Groundbreaking work has demonstrated the feasibility of weight-of-evidence based distributional characterizations, and provided initial examples. Computer software implementations are also available.		Sielken, RL (reprint author), SIELKEN INC,3833 TEXAS AVE,SUITE 230,BRYAN,TX 77802, USA.

It carries out symbolic simplification, and works from the bottom of a binary variable decision tree to the top, with variable choice determined using a genetic algorithm. Since the algorithm is multilevel in nature, it delivers more compact circuits than two-level ESOP minimisation algorithms, such as EXMIN2. It also finds more economical representations than the fixed polarity Reed-Muller method.

J	Dillon, R; Haimes, YY				Dillon, R; Haimes, YY			Risk of extreme events via multiobjective decision trees: Application to telecommunications	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS			English	Article								Simultaneous transmission of high-resolution video, digital audio, and data over fiber-optic cables is only one of the many new services that the rapidly changing telecommunications industry will soon be providing to users, Currently, federal regulations are restraining telephone companies from entering the video entertainment business, but with the capabilities that technology can provide, their entrance into the market in the long run is inevitable. Telephone companies are facing the decision of whether or not to invest in fiberoptic cables in local telephone loops, They also need a way of determining optimal timing for the installation of fiberoptic technology in the network, This study will focus on the risks involved in developing optimal investment plan for expansion of a telecommunications network. This problem is modeled using a multiobjective decision tree where the objective of monetary return from a particular alternative is traded off against the customer satisfaction which that alternative achieves. At each chance node in the decision tree, a continuous probability distribution represents the possible outcomes, To examine the risk of extreme events, the probability distribution is required, rather than only the expected value, To retain all distribution information, a simulation is used to generate a set of Pareto optimal alternatives for various scenarios considered in the model.

J	Janikow, CZ				Janikow, CZ			A genetic algorithm method for optimizing fuzzy decision trees	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article								Fuzzy decision trees exploit the popularity of decision tree algorithms for practical knowledge acquisition and the representative power of the fuzzy technology. They are extensions of IDS trees, with the tree-building routine modified to utilize fuzzy instead of strict domains, and with new inferences combining fuzzy defuzzification with the inductive methodology. As ID3 trees, they require that real-valued and multivalued domains be partitioned prior to tree construction. In this paper, we introduce a methodology aimed at relaxing this requirement. This is done by optimizing the domain partitions. This optimization is based on genetic algorithms, designed to process constraints associated with this task. A simple illustration is also given.

J	Douglass, CW; Fox, CH				Douglass, CW; Fox, CH			Cost effectiveness of periodontal services	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PERIODONTOLOGY			English	Article						periodontitis disease; diagnostic test; cost effectiveness; decision analysis	DISEASES; FLUID	This gaper presents the combined use of decision trees and cost-effectiveness analysis to determine on which patients new diagnostic tests can be useful, and whether they can change the dentist's decision to provide different services and thus improve patient outcomes in 5 different categories of patients. A decision tree is constructed in which the primary decision branches are ''test'' and ''no test''. The treatment and outcome branches in the test branch are affected by the results of the test which is then either negative or positive. In contrast, the treatment and outcome branches in the no-test branch represent pathways for patient therapy when the new (or additional) test is not used. Results show that even with excellent test efficacy parameters (sensitivity 0.87 and specificity 0.84) it is not cost effective to use a diagnostic test in the general population or for adults under age 45 years. However for adults > 45 years, patients referred to a periodontist, and patients with a history of periodontal disease, the test would change treatment decisions and improve patient care outcomes.

According to the WHO classification, three levels of malignancy are identified as grades I (low), II (intermediate), and III (high), This classification system operates satisfactorily for two of the three grades in forecasting clinical progression, most grade I tumours being associated with good prognoses and most grade III with bad, In contrast, the grade II group is very heterogeneous in terms of their clinical behaviour, The present study used two computer-assisted methods to investigate whether it is possible to sub-classify grade II tumours: computer-assisted microscope analysis (image cytometry) of Feulgen-stained nuclei and the Decision Tree Technique, This latter technique belongs to the Supervised Learning Algorithm and enables an objective assessment to be made of the diagnostic value associated with a given parameter. The combined use of these two methods in a series of 292 superficial transitional cell carcinomas shows that it is possible to identify one subgroup of grade II tumours which behave clinically like grade I tumours and a second subgroup which behaves clinically like grade III tumours, Of the nine ploidy-related parameters computed by means of image cytometry [the DNA index (DI), DNA histogram type (DHT), and the percentages of diploid, hyperdiploid, triploid, hypertriploid, tetraploid, hypertetraploid, and polyploid cell nuclei], it was the percentage of hyperdiploid and hypertetraploid cell nuclei which enabled identification, rather than conventional parameters such as the DI or the DHT.

This tree is used to correlate textural features, computed from ultrasonographic prostate images, with the histopathology of the imaged tissue. The algorithm consists of two parts; growing and pruning. In the growing phase an optimal tree is grown, based on the concept of mutual information. After growing, the tree is pruned by an alternating interaction of two data sets. Moreover, the structure and performance of the constructed tree are compared to the results using a slightly modified corresponding growing and pruning algorithm. The modified algorithm provides better retrospective and prospective classification results than the original algorithm. The use of the tree for automated cancer detection in ultrasonographic prostate images results in retrospective and prospective accuracy of 77 . 9% and 72 . 3%, respectively. Using this tissue characterisation, a supporting tool is provided for the interpretation of transrectal ultrasonographic images.

A decision analysis by Levey et al. in 1983 demonstrated that patients with ADPKD would not significantly benefit from routine arteriographic screening for cerebral aneurysms. We reexamined this conclusion in light of new clinical data and the introduction of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a screening method. We compared an MRI screening strategy with a nonscreening strategy. The screening strategy specified MRI screening and then neurosurgical management of detected aneurysms. The nonscreening strategy specified cerebrovascular care only in the event of subarachnoid hemorrhage. The decision tree incorporated estimates derived from the clinical literature for the prevalence of asymptomatic aneurysms in patients with ADPKD (15%), the annual incidence of aneurysmal rupture (1.6%), the morbidity and mortality rates associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage (70 and 56%, respectively), the risk of transfemoral arteriography (0.2%), the sensitivity and specificity of MRI, the morbidity and mortality rates associated with surgical treatment of an unruptured aneurysm (4.1 and 1.0%, respectively), and the life expectancy of patients with ADPKD. The model predicted that the screening strategy would provide 1.0 additional year of life without neurological disability to a 20-year-old patient with ADPKD. A sensitivity analysis showed that the model was most sensitive to estimates of the prevalence of aneurysms in ADPKD, the annual incidence of rupture, and the morbidity and mortality rates associated with rupture. A financial analysis showed that a screening strategy is likely to cost less than a nonscreening strategy. The model predicts that an MRI screening strategy would increase the life expectancy of young patients with ADPKD and reduce the financial impact on society of ADPKD.

Furthermore, Little is known about the development and course of homesickness feelings. Therefore, the present multiple case study was designed in order to obtain a better insight into the onset and course of homesickness and patterns of mood changes, as well as saliva cortisol levels during a short stay away from home. Methods: Several times before, during and after their holiday, 10 adult homesick-prone females completed the Profile of Mood States (POMS), the Homesickness Decision Tree (HDT) and a Subjective Homesickness Rating. In addition, saliva samples were obtained. Data were analyzed individually. Furthermore, days with and without homesickness were compared across individuals using t tests. Results: Using the HDT, the following typology, based upon four different reaction patterns, emerged: (1) no homesickness, (2) anticipation homesickness, (3) holiday homesickness, and (4) a combination of anticipation and holiday homesickness. POMS scores demonstrated significantly worsened mood when experiencing homesickness. Cortisol levels, however, failed to differ between days with and without homesickness. Conclusions: Homesickness is characterized by negative mood which is not necessarily reflected in significantly changed salivary cortisol levels. Feelings of homesickness are not only experienced during absence from home, but may occur also in anticipation to a leave. Future studies need to focus upon the prevalence, causes and consequences of the different types of homesickness.

The panel focused on information obtained from clinical histories, to ensure the utility of the guidelines in practice, Relevant high quality research evidence was limited. Setting-Ontario, Canada. Main measures-Appropriateness ratings on a 7-point scale, and urgency rankings on a 4-point scale keyed to specific waiting times. Results-Despite incomplete evidence panellists agreed on ratings in 92.5% of appropriateness and 73.8% of urgency scenarios versus 15% and 18% agreement expected by chance, respectively. Statistically validated algorithms in decision tree form, which should permit rapid estimation of urgency or appropriateness in practice, were compiled by recursive partitioning. Rating patterns and algorithms were also used to make brief written guidelines an how clinical factors affect appropriateness and urgency of surgery. A summary score was provided for each case scenario; scenarios could then be matched to chart audit results, with scoring for quality management. Conclusions-These algorithms and criteria can be used by managers or practitioners to assess appropriateness of referral for hip or knee replacement and relative rankings of patients in the queue for surgery.

J	Gardner, IA; Carpenter, TE; Leontides, L; Parsons, TD				Gardner, IA; Carpenter, TE; Leontides, L; Parsons, TD			Financial evaluation of vaccination and testing alternatives for control of parvovirus-induced reproductive failure in swine	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article							PORCINE PARVOVIRUS; INFECTION; GILTS; PERFORMANCE; VACCINES; ANTIBODY; PIGS	Objective-To identify the preferable testing and vaccination strategy for control of porcine parvovirus (PPV) during a 6-month period. Design-Decision-tree analysis and computer simulations. Sample Population-Computer modeling of 300-sow farrow-to-finish herd. Procedure-Serologic testing of 30 females to estimate herd PPV prevalence versus not testing any females was the initial decision alternative. On the basis of serologic test results, herds were classified into 1 of 3 PPV-risk categories: low (greater than or equal to 80% seropositive females), moderate (40 to < 80% seropositive females), or high (< 40% seropositive females). Vaccinating all females, only gilts, or not vaccinating was the second decision alternative. Results-For initial model assumptions (test sensitivity and specificity = 0.95; test cost = $5/female; vaccination cost = $0.30/dose; vaccination efficacy = 0.95,and foregone gross margin = $10.85/pig), vaccination of all females (with or without serologic testing) was preferable, but the financially preferable option was to omit serologic testing. Most profitable vaccination option varied with foregone gross margin, vaccination cost, and efficacy. For herds in which all sows were known to be immune, vaccinating only gilts was financially preferable, and serologic testing was not warranted. Variation in expected monetary losses was less in vaccination options than with nonvaccination. Clinical Implications-for most herds in the United States, serologic screening for PPV prior to selection of a vaccination program is unlikely to be cost-effective, because vaccination is inexpensive ($0.30/dose) and effective (95%). At current profit margins ($10.85/pig), vaccination of all females has the least-risk and is the preferred option.

J	Patel, SA; Kamrani, AK				Patel, SA; Kamrani, AK			Intelligent decision support system for diagnosis and maintenance of automated systems	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							EXPERT SYSTEM; DESIGN	ROBODOC, the diagnosis and maintenance consultant, is an off-line decision support utility that will help maintenance staff diagnose and correct robotic failures. It uses a group technology approach to classify symptoms and a decision tree approach in developing the system. It has the capability to produce both detailed as well as shallow reports of problems and their fixes. Its modularity makes it easier to add or revise the knowledge base or to transfer the diagnostic knowledge from one automated system to another, without necessitating complete development from scratch. The results of this work can contribute to the development of a design for a service expert system, which will be able to give design recommendations based on past experiences, which will produce more durable and easier to maintain equipment designs.

J	Sahami, M				Sahami, M			Generating neural networks through the induction of threshold logic unit trees	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						neural networks; decision trees; threshold logic units; backpropagation		This paper investigates the generation of neural networks through the induction of binary trees of threshold logic units (TLUs). Initially, it describes the framework for a tree construction algorithm devised by the author, and shows how it helps to bridge the gap between pure connectionist (neural network) and symbolic (decision tree) paradigms. It also shows how the trees of threshold units that are induced can be transformed into an isomorphic neural-network topology. Several methods for learning the linear discriminant functions at each node of the tree structure are examined, and are shown to produce accuracy results that are comparable to classical information-theoretic methods for constructing decision trees (which use single feature tests at each node), but produce trees that are smaller and thus easier to understand. Moreover, the results also show that it is possible to simultaneously learn both the topology and weight settings of a neural network simply using the training data set that is initially given.

J	Atwill, ER; Mohammed, HO				Atwill, ER; Mohammed, HO			Benefit-cost analysis of vaccination of horses as a strategy to control equine monocytic ehrlichiosis	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						equine species; cost-benefit analysis; Ehrlichia risticii; vaccination	COLITIS; FEVER	Objective-To determine whether horses in New York should be vaccinated against equine monocytic ehrlichiosis (EME). Design-Decision-tree analyses of data from a cross-sectional study and a case-control study. Sample Population-Horses in New York. Procedure-Annual expected monetary loss per horse attributable to EME was calculated for vaccinated and nonvaccinated horses in New York, Because risk of being seropositive was dependent on county in which the horse was located, farm elevation, and use of each horse, decision-tree analyses were stratified by these factors. Results-Annual expected monetary loss per horse attributable to EME for horses vaccinated by veterinarians ranged from $21 to $21.83/horse/y; for horses vaccinated by owners ranged from $10 to $10.83/horse/y; and for nonvaccinated horses ranged from $0 to $4.03/horse/y. Assuming 78% of vaccinated horses were protected and mean losses associated with EME included costs for horses that died, annual incidence density at which expected monetary loss for vaccinated horses was equal to that for nonvaccinated horses was 12 cases/1,000 horses/y and 25 cases/1,000 horses/y for horses vaccinated by owners or by veterinarians, respectively. Clinical Implications-Annual vaccination minimizes monetary losses attributable to EME only when the annual incidence density exceeds 12 to 25 cases/1,000 horses/y. In New York, expected monetary losses are minimized when horses are not vaccinated because of the low annual incidence density in most regions.

The first methodology relates to the digital image analysis of Feulgen-stained nuclei and the second to a supervised learning algorithm named Decision Tree. The digital image analysis of Feulgen-stained nuclei generated 11 variables for nuclear DNA content and 15 for quantitatively describing chromatin pattern. These 26 variables were submitted to a Decision Tree technique which produces multi-attribute logical classification rules by selecting informative variables and determining discriminatory values for each of them. A series of 41 patients for which the majority of the T2 bladder tumours (68%) were associated with a 'good' prognosis (remission) while the majority of the T3-T4 ones (77%) were associated with a 'bad' one (clinical progression or death) were submitted to the proposed approach. The results show that the decision tree was able to characterise the tumours associated with a 'bad' prognosis in the T2 sub-group (32%) and the tumours associated with a 'good' prognosis in the T3-T4 one (23%), by using only few image-generated variables (added to the clinical stage).

To illustrate our purpose, this methodology was applied to the difficult problem of leiomyomatous tumour diagnosis, The aim was to illustrate what kind of diagnostic information can be extracted from a sample data set including 23 smooth muscle tumors (14 benign leiomyomas and 9 malignant leiomyosarcomas) described by a large set of computer-assisted, microscope-generated features, Three groups of features were used relating to: (1) ploidy level determination (10 features), (2) quantitative chromatin pattern description (15 features), and (3) immunohistochemically related antigen specificities (6 features), All these features were quantified by digital cell image analysis, The results suggest that an objective distinction between leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas can be established by means of simple logical rules depending on only a few features among which the immunohistochemically revealed antigen expression of desmin plays a preponderant part, One of the combinations of features proposed by the methodology is interesting for pathologists, because it includes two features describing the appearance of a nucleus in terms of chromatin distribution homogeneity and density, two features widely used by pathologists in tumor-grading systems.

J	Dantchev, N				Dantchev, N			Therapeutic decision frees in psychiatry	ENCEPHALE-REVUE DE PSYCHIATRIE CLINIQUE BIOLOGIQUE ET THERAPEUTIQUE			French	Article						decision analysis; decision tree; depression; psychiatry; therapeutics	MEDICINE; DEPRESSION	The main objective of decision analysis is to offer a theoretical representation of choices made in an environment of uncertainty. This technique is currently under development in a great variety of fields, particularly in medicine, where aid in decision making is the topic of much research. Psychiatry, in turn, is very much concerned by these new developments which could be of particular interest to therapeutics - an area where the large nomber of studies and date are in great contrast with the lack of consensus concerning the various solutions proposed to patients. Decision analysis utilizes different techniques among which are decision trees. The technique of decision trees goes far beyond a simple graphic representation of reasoning in the form of a chart. Its basic principles is to measure the uncertainty associated with decision making in the hopes of better understanding the rationale of decisions while optimizing the gain versus cost ratio. The goal is to calculate, within a series of decisions, the weight of their importance expressed in terms of usefulness or unpleasantness. In psychiatric therapeutics, only three studies have been published which incorporate the technique of decision frees. Two of these deal with treating depression (Schulberg et al., 1989; Koenig et al., 1993) while the third deals with schizophrenia (Hatcher, 1995). The limits of these techniques are, on one hand, due to their feasibility in that their complexity renders them inapplicable when a great number of variables have to be taken into account or when the amount of necessary data is still insufficient. Moreover, the use of these techniques remains relatively restricted as their expansion depends upon their acceptance by clinical physicians. Also, their use raises questions as to what extent it is possible to rationalize decisions in psychiatry. From a larger perspective, one must consider that these techniques may eventually furnish certain elements which could be integrated to help further the field of decisionmaking representations for clinical use. These decision-making techniques are still in the experimental stages and remains difficult to apply to clinical practice. However they appear to be of a great interest, not only in communicating knowledge both in teaching and training, but in research as well. They allow us to view the results of epidemiological studies and clinical research from a more global perspective; to make evident the grey areas of our science and to determine new priorities in research.

Data was gathered through a literature survey and clinical interviews conducted in nine different UK hospitals. This was used to construct a decision tree, modelling the drug choices available to a clinician at various stages of a patient's treatment, and assigning probabilities to the different corresponding outcomes. UK cost data were fed into this model to determine the expected cost per patient of the different prophylaxis strategies. Two different patient groups were considered: chemotherapy-only patients, and bone-marrow-transplant (BMT) patients who have higher risks of fungal infection. Probabilities derived from the literature suggest that a cost-minimization strategy to manage both chemotherapy patients and BMT patients is to administer oral fluconazole, both as prophylaxis and as first line treatment, against superficial fungal infection. Probabilities gathered from clinical interviews yield similar results, suggesting that the cost-minimization strategy with chemotherapy-only patients is to administer oral polyenes as prophylaxis, and oral fluconazole in case of superficial fungal infection, while for BMT patients it is a combination of fluconazole and oral polyenes as prophylaxis, with oral fluconazole for the treatment of superficial fungal infections. Using the probabilities from the literature, the lowest cost strategies produce an expected cost of pound 567.20 for chemotherapy-only patients, and an expected cost of pound 804.87 for BMT patients for a course of treatment lasting from seven to 28 days. The clinical interview probabilities produce expected costs of pound 826.48 and pound 1529.43, respectively. Sensitivity analysis was then conducted, and it was found that in the majority of cases, using the literature probabilities, the cost-minimizing strategy remained prophylaxis with oral fluconazole. The sensitivity analysis for chemotherapy-only patients using the interview probabilities tended to favour oral polyenes as the cost-minimization strategy, whereas for BMT patients the sensitivity analysis favoured a combination of fluconazole and oral polyenes in the majority of cases. The key economic advantage of prophylaxis with fluconazole or a combination of fluconazole with oral polyenes in the prophylaxis of fungal infection in immunocompromised patients, results from the reduction of the expected cost of subsequent fungal infection among those who are most at risk.

Assessments made with single species testing are commonly used in environmental risk assessment. Community-level analyses can be used to test the predictions of the single-species' tests and determine the potential for indirect effects. Mesocosms, such as the P & G Experimental Stream Facility, are used to develop an experimental ecosystem in which this community-level analysis can be performed. Microbial communities, as base of the photoautotrophic carbon input and heterotrophic carbon cycling within streams, are key to the ecotoxicological assessment and understanding of these effects. These communities are evaluated for changes in biomass, activity, and community structure over an 8-week exposure to an added test chemical. These studies are not evaluated based on a 'most sensitive species' or key endpoint approach. Rather, an ecosystem-level evaluation is made using a decision tree that sequentially evaluates: (1) statistical differences compared to a control stream; (2) ecological consistency of complementary endpoints; (3) dose response of effect; and (4) temporal pattern of effect (transient or progressive). The goal of this analysis is to reduce the results of these complex studies down to a single No-Observed-Effect-Concentration (NOEC) for the ecosystem tested. Results from experiments with two anionic surfactants illustrate how analytical evaluation of microbial communities is used in the derivation of ecosystem-level NOECs when both direct and indirect effects are observed.

J	Huber, O; Kuhberger, A				Huber, O; Kuhberger, A			Decision processes and decision trees in gambles and more natural decision tasks	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							RISK	Most of the experimental results on the risky decision behavior of individuals have been in reference to simple gambles. An investigation was conducted to determine whether those results can be generalized to more natural situations; 32 participants were required to make choices in one gambling task and three natural-decision tasks. Half were trained and guided to draw a decision tree during the decision process. Behavior in the gambling tasks differed systematically from that in the natural-decision tasks, in the cognitive representation of the decision situation constructed by the decision maker and in the role of subjective probabilities in such a representation. The results call into question the general claim that the drawing of a decision tree aids decision making. Among other effects, participants who drew a decision tree introduced less background knowledge and more often biased the presented information than did those who did not draw a decision tree.

J	Schwartz, DB				Schwartz, DB			Enhanced enteral and parenteral nutrition practice and outcomes in an intensive care unit with a hospital-wide performance improvement process	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN DIETETIC ASSOCIATION			English	Article								To improve patient outcomes at a 455-bed community health care facility, a performance improvement process was implemented for the delivery of enteral and parenteral nutrition in a 28-bed intensive care unit (ICU). In 1992, the study group consisted of all patients who mere started on either enteral or parenteral nutrition while in the ICU during a a-month period. These patients were followed up until discharge from the hospital or death to determine practice patterns and outcomes. Three actions were identified as opportunities to change practice and improve outcomes: increase use of the enteral route of alimentation compared with the parenteral route; start alimentation sooner, especially via the enteral route; and meet protein and energy needs of patients. Educational programs mere developed targeting physician and nursing staff. Through an interdisciplinary approach, a nutrition support decision tree and patient outcome statement mere developed. In 1994, evaluation of a group meeting the same criteria as the original group indicated that the goals for nutrition support practice improvement were met in all three areas identified. Providing a systematic approach to an interdisciplinary performance improvement process, as part of an organization-wide plan, enhanced nutrition support practice in a community hospital and resulted in quality improvement and cost savings.

Design-A decision analytic model composed of a decision tree to represent the epidemiology of dyspepsia and a Markov process to model the outcomes of treatment. Patients-Patients under the age of 45 years presenting to their general practitioner with (peptic type) dyspepsia. Interventions-Conventional empirical treatment with healing and maintenance doses of cimetidine v eradication treatment solely in patients with confirmed peptic ulcer; and conventional empirical treatment for all dyspeptic patients compared with the use of a serology test to identify patients with H pylori, who then receive endoscopy to investigate the presence of peptic ulcer disease and, when disease is found, are given eradication treatment with a breath test to confirm successful eradication. Main outcome measures-Expected cumulative costs over a period of 10 years. The proportion of time patients spend without a recurrent ulcer. Results-After receiving eradication treatment, patients with confirmed ulcer spend an average of 99% of their time free fi om recurrent ulcer disease compared with 95% after treatment with cimetidine. Eradication treatment costs less than that with cimetidine. When the initial cost of identifying appropriate patients to receive eradication treatment is added to the analysis, however, these cost savings take almost eight years to accrue. Conclusions-Enthusiasm for introducing testing for and eradication of H pylori for dyspeptic patients in general practice should be tempered by an awareness that cost savings may take many years to realise.

Methods: Decision and cost-utility analysis. Data Sources: A MEDLINE search of all literature dealing with the diagnosis and management of blunt aortic injury was used to establish assumptions and assign baseline probability estimates. Utility assignments were made from published data and our own assignments. We obtained institution-specific cost data. Study Selection: Only randomized, prospective trials that used aortography as the gold standard test were used to assign baseline accuracy of transesophageal echocardiography and dynamic chest computed tomography. Other baseline estimates were taken from class II and class III published data. Data Synthesis: A decision tree compared 4 diagnostic approaches for blunt chest trauma after an initial normal chest radiograph: observation with follow-up chest radiography, aortography, transesophageal echocardiography, and dynamic chest computed tomography. Utility (a quality-of-life measure) was assigned to ultimate health states to incorporate patient preference. Chest radiography and aortography had similar utility. Aortography gained 1 quality-adjusted life year for minimal cost. Transesophageal echocardiography and dynamic chest computed tomography lose quality-adjusted life-years at increased cost. No variable changed the relative cost-utility of the screening methods in 2-way sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Aortography gains additional quality life at minimal cost when used as a screening method for all patients with blunt chest trauma regardless of the results of the initial chest radiograph. With a normal initial chest radiograph, transesophageal echocardiography and dynamic chest computed tomography are associated with increased cost and loss of quality-adjusted life.

J	Almuallim, H				Almuallim, H			An efficient algorithm for optimal pruning of decision trees	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								Pruning decision trees is a useful technique for improving the generalization performance in decision tree induction, acid for trading accuracy for simplicity in other applications. In this paper, a new algorithm called OPT-2 for optimal pruning of decision trees is introduced. The algorithm is based on dynamic programming. In its most basic form, the time and space complexities of OPT-2 are both Theta(nC), where n is the number of test nodes in the initial decision tree, and C is the number of leaves in the target (pruned) decision tree. This is an improvement over the recently published OPT algorithm of Bohanec and Bratko (which is the only known algorithm for optimal decision tree pruning) especially in the case of heavy pruning and when the tests of the given decision tree have many outcomes. If so desired, the space required by OPT-2 can further be reduced by a factor of r at the cost of increasing the execution time by a factor that is bounded above by (r + 1)/2 (this is a considerable overestimate, however). From a practical point of view, OPT-2 enjoys considerable flexibility in various aspects, and is easy to implement.

J	Peng, WN; Muller, JC				Peng, WN; Muller, JC			A dynamic decision tree structure supporting urban road network automated generalization	CARTOGRAPHIC JOURNAL			English	Article								Generalization is a complex task which requires a good understanding of the geometrical and semantic aspects of map features as well as the potential use of the map. Reasoning about spatial relationship, comparing alternative solutions, and contextual thinking are all important activities required for generalization decision-making. Such activities are not easy to simulate in a computer without sufficient information and the support of good data structures and adequate reasoning mechanisms. This paper introduces a dynamic decision tree structure in an attempt to partly circumvent the problem of urban road network generalization through the use of object classification and aggregation hierarchies, topological data structure, decision rules, and AI technology. Apart from the construction process, it also discusses the reasoning process for decision-making, and provides two test results with some discussion on the benefits and short-comings of the proposed approach.

J	Braaten, O				Braaten, O			Artificial intelligence in pediatrics: Important clinical signs in newborn syndromes	COMPUTERS AND BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article							ID3 ALGORITHM; DECISION-TREE; DIAGNOSIS	New methods are warranted in the field of syndromology. This study is an exploration into whether an artificial intelligence method (ID3) could provide a new angle for approaching syndromes. Diagnosing syndromes in the newborn is difficult. The accepted approach is to look for individual clinical signs that add up to a syndrome diagnosis. Of all possible clinical signs, one would want to extract the signs with the strongest predictive power. I used the ID3 algorithm to extract predictive clinical signs from a catalogue of syndromes (Birth Defects Encyclopedia Online; BDEO). Using information from BDEO, files of randomly generated ''patients'' were created. The signs consistently high in the identification tree were long philtrum, short palpebral fissures, low-set ears, and hepatosplenomegaly. The program used featured a crude ''expert system'' based on the ID3 algorithm. When using one-half of the data set as a training set and the other half as a testbed, a correct classification rate of 92.1-98.1% was attained. When the ID3 expert system was tested against cases from a clinical database (Pictures of Standard Syndromes and Undiagnosed Malformations), the correct classification rate was less than 20%. This may not necessarily reflect faults with the ID3 approach, but possibly biases in the clinical database. In syndromology no ''criterion standards'' exist that can confirm a diagnosis. The statistical method of cluster analysis does not require prior knowledge of diagnoses and will make a tree of syndromes based upon clinical signs. A cluster analysis was performed as a validity check to provide a tree for comparison with the ID3 tree. There was a reasonable degree of agreement between the two. Applying artificial intelligence methods to this held highlights problems with basic assumptions and philosophical aspects of syndrome diagnosis. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.

This article demonstrates that utilizing both quantitative and qualitative methods can improve our understanding of complex behaviors. Ethnographic interviews were used to create a decision tree model of the choice of breastfeeding or formula feeding for Navajo women. This preliminary model was tested with reference to the initial feeding decisions of 250 post-partum women. Errors in the model and statistical analysis of correlates of feeding behavior were used to improve the decision model, which was subsequently tested on a new sample of 52 mothers. The final model accurately predicted the initial infant feeding behavior of 96% of women in the new sample. This combination of techniques proved useful in developing a breastfeeding promotion program which targeted specific groups for education and addressed local concerns and perceptions.

J	Skidmore, AK; Gauld, A; Walker, P				Skidmore, AK; Gauld, A; Walker, P			Classification of kangaroo habitat distribution using three GIS models	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article							LANDSAT	In this paper, we compare three techniques for mapping wildlife habitat, termed BIOCLIM, CART and a new classification method based on nonparametric techniques. These techniques model dependent map layers of species distributions, where the areas to be mapped are large and the plot data is sparse. The techniques recognise pattern in the (independent) plot data, available to natural resource managers. In this case, the independent data set comprised 12 climate surfaces, that attempt to represent the range of temperature and precipitation important in determining the habitat of kangaroos across Australia. With this particular data set, the CART (decision tree) model was most accurate, but more time consuming to initialise. The relative performance of these models depends on the quality of the data set, and skill of the GIS analyst. Where possible, GIS analysts should implement all available methods, and compare output.

The apparent usefulness of SMPS may depend on referral bias, the stress mode employed and the criterion for disease. We compared markers of ischaemia on quantitative planar SMPS with Tl-201 in 503 referred patients; stress was tailored to the individual patient to include exercise (n = 154), dipyridamole (n = 118) or a combination of the two (n = 231). Four angiographic criteria of increasing severity (A-D) were targeted. The fraction of the population receiving diagnostic benefit was calculated for reversible defects (RD) or lung uptake (LU) in comparison to concurrent ST depression; abnormal baseline tracings and fixed Tl-201 defects were regarded as indeterminate. Decision tree induction, a computer-learning algorithm and logistic regression were also used to assess the contribution of 13 scintigraphic and other input variables. In comparison to ST depression, RD showed incremental value in 167 (33%) patients with criterion A, decreasing to 5% with criterion D; LU showed its greatest benefit (21%) with criterion D. Both scintigraphic markers were more useful with dipyridamole-based tests than with exercise alone. Decision trees induced at each criterion for disease showed the predominant contribution of scintigraphic results in comparison to clinical and ECG data. In conclusion, in a referred population with a frequent requirement for pharmacological stress, the clinical utility of scintigraphy can be determined by comparison of markers of ischaemia; the results will depend, however, on the angiographic criterion for disease.

Over 50% of patients experience toxic effects of the major anti-PCP medications cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) and pentamidine. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration approved a new oral drug therapy, atovaquone, as an alternative to pentamidine for the treatment of people with mild-to-moderate PCP who are intolerant of cotrimoxazole. We developed a decision tree model to estimate the costs and cost effectiveness of atovaquone therapy compared with intravenous pentamidine therapy for cotrimoxazole-intolerant patients with mild-to-moderate PCP. Clinical outcomes were based on data from a phase III trial comparing the 2 medications. Our economic outcomes were based on treatment algorithms derived from discharge data, published reports and the clinical judgement of the co-authors. We estimate the total expected cost of treating a patient for an episode of PCP with atovaquone to be $US3990 compared with $US6545 for pentamidine under our baseline scenario (1995 dollars). Our decision model also provides insight into the large cost-savings benefits of treating mild-to-moderate PCP on an outpatient basis.

J	Ishii, M; Akiba, Y; Kaneda, S; Almuallim, H				Ishii, M; Akiba, Y; Kaneda, S; Almuallim, H			Simplification of majority-voting classifiers using binary decision diagrams	SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS IN JAPAN			English	Article						machine learning; knowledge acquisition; ID3		Various versions of the majority-voting classification method have been proposed in recent years as a strategy for improving classification performance. This method generates multiple decision trees from training examples and performs majority voting of classification results from these decision trees in order to classify test examples. In this method, however, since the target concept is represented in multiple decision trees, its readability is poor. This property makes it ineffective in knowledge-base construction. To enable the majority-voting classification method to be applied to knowledge-base construction, this paper proposes a simplification method that converts the entire majority-voting classifier into compact disjunctive normal form (DNF) formulas. A significant feature of this method is the use of binary decision diagrams (BDDs) as internal expressions in the conversion process to achieve high-speed simplification. A problem that must be addressed here is the BDD input variable ordering scheme. This paper proposes an ordering scheme based on the order of variables in the decision trees. The simplification method has been applied to several real-world data sets of the Irvine Database and to data from medical diagnosis domain. It was found that the description size of the majority-voting classifier after simplification was on the average from 1.2 to 2.7 times that of a single decision tree and was less than one-third the size of a majority-voting classifier before simplification. Therefore, the method is effective in reducing the description size and should be applicable to the knowledge acquisition process. Using the input variable ordering scheme proposed here, high-speed simplification of several seconds to several tens of seconds is achieved on a Sun SPARC-server 10 workstation.

Our research shows that performance of conventional classification methods using only simple heart rate timing based features can be improved with the inclusion of morphology analysis on samples of the right ventricular apex lead. While morphology classification is typically patient dependent, and computationally expensive, we show that the performance of a patient independent classifier which uses a multi-layer perceptron for morphology recognition and heart beat timing decision tree is superior to that of a timing only classifier, while remaining economical (silicon area and power dissipation) from an implementation perspective. We also show that performance can be significantly improved in the patient dependent case.

J	Ross, K; Ostendorf, M				Ross, K; Ostendorf, M			Prediction of abstract prosodic labels for speech synthesis	COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE			English	Article							PITCH ACCENT; INTONATION; ENGLISH; TEXT	Higher quality speech synthesis is required to make text-to-speech technologies useful in more applications, and prosody is one component of synthesis technology with the greatest need for improvement. This paper describes computational models for the prediction of abstract prosodic labels for synthesis-accent location, symbolic tones and relative prominence level-from text that is tagged with part-of-speech labels and marked for prosodic constituent structure. Specifically, the model uses multiple levels of a prosodic hierarchy and at each level combines decision tree probability functions with Markov sequence assumptions. An advantage of decision trees is the ability to incorporate linguistic knowledge in an automatic training framework, which is needed for building systems that reflect particular speaking styles. Studies of accent and tone variability across speakers are reported and used to motivate new evaluation metrics. Prediction experiments show an improvement in accuracy of prominence location prediction over simple decision trees, with accuracy similar to the level of variability observed across speakers.

J	Lee, KC; Oh, SB				Lee, KC; Oh, SB			An intelligent approach to time series identification by a neural network-driven decision tree classifier	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						time series identification; ARMA model; extended sample autocorrelation function; pattern matching; decision tree classifier; neural pruning search algorithm	PATTERN-RECOGNITION; MODEL; SEARCH; DESIGN	The objective of this paper is to suggest a new intelligent approach to classifying a time series into one of autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) models, which is named time series identification (TSI), by using a neural network-driven decision tree classifier, The main recipe of our approach is to apply two pattern recognition concepts for solving the TSI problem. The first pattern recognition concept is an extended sample autocorrelation function which is derived from a given times series data and is used as an important feature for solving the TSI problem. The second pattern recognition concept is a neural network-driven decision tree classifier which is a main vehicle for reducing the complexities involved in TSI problems and, finally, providing the most promising ARMA model for a given time series. The neural network-driven decision tree classifier consists of a set of nodes at which neural network-driven decision making is made whether the connecting subtrees should be pruned or not. To enhance the performance of our proposed classifier, we suggest a neural pruning search algorithm which is used to find the promising paths. The proposed search algorithm essentially results in a neural network-driven search through the space of possible terminal nodes of the classifier. Experimental results with a set of real time series data show that the proposed approach can efficiently identify the time series patterns with high precision compared to other approaches.

J	Khotanzad, A; Liou, JJH				Khotanzad, A; Liou, JJH			Recognition and pose estimation of unoccluded three-dimensional objects from a two-dimensional perspective view by banks of neural networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article							INVARIANT IMAGE RECOGNITION; CLASSIFIERS; MOMENTS; CLASSIFICATION; ROTATION	This paper describes a neural network (NN) based system for recognition and pose estimation of an unoccluded three-dimensional (3-D) object from any single two-dimensional (2-D) perspective view, The approach is invariant to translation, orientation, and scale. First, the binary silhouette of the object is obtained and normalized for translation and scale. Then, the object is represented by a set of rotation invariant features derived from the complex orthogonal pseudo-Zernike moments of the image. The recognition scheme combines the decisions of a bank of multilayer perceptron NN classifiers operating in parallel on the same data. These classifiers have different topologies and internal parameters, but are trained on the same set of exemplar perspective views of the objects. Next, two pose parameters, elevation and aspect angles, are obtained by a novel two-stage NN system consisting of a quadrant classifier followed by NN angle estimators. Performance is tested on clean and noisy data bases of military ground vehicles. Comparative studies with three other classifiers (a single NN, the weighted nearest-neighbor classifier, and a binary decision tree) are carried out.

J	Taha, HA; Wolf, HM				Taha, HA; Wolf, HM			Evaluation of generator maintenance schedules at Entergy Electric System	INTERFACES			English	Article							RELIABILITY; RISK	Manual evaluation of the impact of detrimental events on outage schedules in electric power plants is both subjective and time-consuming. We developed a decision-tree-based methodology that converts the manual evaluation process into a computerized package. It uses a special statistic instead of the (less-useful) expected value analysis that typifies textbook presentations. It also provides a systematic procedure for determining the branches and probabilities of the decision tree based on historical data. The Entergy Electric System has used the new tool for over three years to enable the outage planner to isolate high-risk time periods and to develop timely maintenance schedules in response to short-notice changes.

J	Ruhs, SA; ElKhoury, GY; Chrischilles, EA				Ruhs, SA; ElKhoury, GY; Chrischilles, EA			A cost minimization approach to the diagnosis of skeletal neoplasms	SKELETAL RADIOLOGY			English	Article						bone tumors; biopsy; needle biopsy; metastases	MUSCULOSKELETAL LESIONS; ASPIRATION BIOPSY; NEEDLE-BIOPSY; BONE	Objective. Percutaneous needle aspiration (PNA) has been widely used to diagnose bone malignancies. Successful aspirates hinge on the ability of the operator to obtain an adequate or diagnostic sample, and a skilled cytologist to make a diagnosis on needle aspirates. False-negative aspirates could pose a serious problem. This study is designed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PNA in the diagnosis of skeletal neoplasms using a cost minimization approach. Design. All PNA performed over a 44-month period were reviewed retrospectively. Ninety-four skeletal biopsies were performed to diagnose a clinically or roentgenographically suspicious lesion: 69 for a suspected metastatic malignancy, and 25 for a suspected primary malignancy, The PNA results were collected and reviewed, sensitivities and specificities were determined (compared with open biopsy results or clinical follow-up as the gold standards), and the probabilities were applied to a decision tree. Charges were obtained from the patient's billing and converted into costs by a cost-charge ratio. Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the costs of each branch of the decision tree, and ultimately the final cost of the two strategies: (1) PNA for all suspected neoplasms followed by open biopsy for negative and non-diagnostic PNA results, or (2) open biopsy for all suspected neoplasms. Results. In diagnosing a suspected metastatic skeletal neoplasm, PNA had a sensitivity of 88%, a specificity of 100%, and a non-diagnostic re suit in 3% of cases. Cost analysis determined a savings of $ US 2486 per patient when ''PNA strategy'' was used instead of ''open biopsy strategy''. In diagnosing a suspected primary neoplasm, PNA hat a sensitivity 75%, a specificity of 100%, and a non-diagnostic result in 16% of cases. Cost analysis determined a savings of $ US 954 per patient when ''PNA strategy'' was used instead of ''open biopsy strategy''. By using ''PNA strategy'' instead of ''open biopsy strategy'' at this institution we would have saved $ US 195384 over the 44-month period. Conclusions. Metastatic skeletal neoplasms could be reliably diagnosed by PNA, and followed by open biopsy if the PNA result is negative or non-diagnostic, at a significant cost saving over open biopsy. Diagnosing primary skeletal neoplasms using ''PNA strategy'' offers a slight cost saving compared with ''open biopsy strategy'', but too few primary skeletal neoplasms were evaluated to recommend the best diagnostic approach.

Fuzzy reasoning rules in the form of a decision tree, which can be viewed as a fuzzy partition, are obtained by fuzzy ID3. The aims of this paper are: (1) Not only the learning from examples but also the interview with domain specialists are needed for knowledge acquisition in expert systems. In order to avoid dangerous simplification of the tree by discarding partial knowledge of the experts, a measure of uncertainty with maximizing entropy is applied to fuzzy ID3. (2) Basically the tree based learning is nonincremental or single step. An algebraic method to facilitate incremental learning like the neural nets is adapted and the fuzzy decision tree which consists of B-spline membership function is regarded as three layered neural network. (3) Prototypes of expert system for estimation of wheel wear characteristics and surface roughness in abrasive cut-off are developed.

In this paper we combine methods from abstract real algebraic geometry and complexity theory in order to show lower bounds on the arithmetical cost of semi-algebraic decision trees. In contrast to the topological combinatorial methods the approach is local and based on the relations computed along paths distinguished by certain well defined points in the real spectrum of the polynomial ring R[X(1),...,X(n)]. We describe the theme of semi-algebraic decision trees entirely from the point of view of the concept of the real spectrum which extracts the local ''quintessence'' of the behavior of decision trees. Together with the degree argument - introduced into complexity theory by Strassen [46] - we obtain bounds that apply to concrete natural problems, and their range of application complements the one of topologically based lower bounds. Various new applications to test problems around interpolation (solvability of overdetermined interpolation tasks) and Chinese remaindering are included. Having a lower bound on decision complexity of a semi-algebraic subset E subset of R(n) a further question naturally arises: Is the set of inputs from R(n) producing a long path in a decision tree ''significant,'' or is it only an unspecified exceptional set of possibly very low dimension? Unlike the topological combinatorial methods the real spectrum approach provides such information. For instance, if E is an irreducible algebraic set then the subset of points in E producing a short path has dimension strictly less than the dimension of E. We discuss complexity questions throughout from the variable and relative standpoint.		Lickteig, T (reprint author), UNIV BONN,INST INFORMAT,D-53117 BONN,GERMANY.

A tree-based machine learning algorithm (PREDICTOR) was applied to this database, in order to attempt to find rules which would classify patients into 2 groups, i.e., those suffering from gastric or oesophageal cancer, and the remainder. The results were encouraging. The cross-validated classification performance figures showed that, by classifying 61.3% of the patients as high risk, a sensitivity of 94.9% and a specificity of 39.8% could be achieved. It is planned to construct an expert system based on the rules produced by the machine learning algorithm, in order to provide preliminary screening for cancer in dyspeptic patients.

J	Verdenius, F				Verdenius, F			Managing product inherent variance during treatment	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						recipe design; learning by induction; decision tree; neural network; constraint satisfaction; quality control		The natural variance of agricultural product parameters complicates recipe planning for product treatment, i.e. the process of transforming a product batch from its initial state to a prespecified final state. For a specific product P, recipes are currently composed by human experts on the basis of heuristic matches between product state and recipe features. This approach makes use of standard recipes, that do not sufficiently reflect inherent differences between batches. Improvement of the recipe design process requires three problems to be solved: (1) assessment of the initial product state, (2) fixation of the recipe requirements and (3) design of a treatment recipe. To objectively assess the initial product state, additional measurement of a specific parameter is required. This parameter varies substantially between batches, requiring large measurement samples. Without objective assessment, however, automated determination of the recipe requirements and recipe design is not possible. This paper describes a procedure to get an objective initial state assessment, and presents a Product Treatment Support System that takes an initial state assessment, and performs the process of recipe design. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are applied at three points in the process. Induction of decision trees is used to determine rules that an understandable to experts and that select products most suitable for state assessment. Neural networks are applied to transform the assessment of the initial state into the overall requirements of the recipe. Finally, the actual recipe is derived by means of constraint satisfaction.

J	Reynolds, KM; Holsten, EH				Reynolds, KM; Holsten, EH			Classification of spruce beetle hazard in Lutz and Sitka spruce stands on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						spruce beetle; Dendroctonus rufipennis; Alaska; hazard	RISK	Stand data from Lutz and Sitka spruce forest types occurring on the Kenai Peninsula were analyzed by tree-based classification and abductive inference to develop decision models for classifying spruce beetle hazard. Model development and validation data sets contained 286 and 88 stand observations, respectively. The final decision-tree structure yielded 13 possible hazard outcomes based on total stand basal area, percentage of total basal area composed of spruce, percentage of spruce basal area composed of trees with diameter > 25 cm, stand elevation, and stand aspect, Four paths in the decision tree led to low-hazard outcomes (spruce basal area loss less than or equal to 10%); two paths each led to low-medium, medium, and medium-high hazard outcomes (spruce basal area loss of less than or equal to 40%, 11-40%, and > 10%, respectively); and three led to high-hazard outcomes (spruce basal area loss > 40%). Results of model verification were considered very acceptable; in the worst case, predictions of high hazard were correct for 67% of the observations. Model validation results also were considered acceptable, but predictions of medium and high hazard showed a marked drop from verification results. For comparison, the same analysis was performed using abductive inference to test a modeling method better suited to automatic processing of numerous stands for landscape-level analysis, There was a high degree of correspondence between predictions of the two analytical methods.

To predict which patients with early inflammatory polyarthritis presenting to primary care will be functionally disabled one year after presentation, in order to inform treatment and referral decisions. Methods. The study population consisted of 381 patients notified to the Norfolk Arthritis Register, a primary care based inception cohort of patients with inflammatory polyarthritis. Patients were regarded as functionally disabled if they had a Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score of one or more. Clinical, laboratory, and demographic variables easily measured at baseline were analyzed for their ability to predict future disability. Recursive partitioning was used to create a simple decision tree to predict those patients who would be disabled at one year. A logistic regression model was generated on a sample of 277 patients and tested on an independent sample of 104 patients, This was compared with other models, one of which consisted of the 1987 ARA criteria. Results, 112 (29%) patients had a HAQ score of at least 1 at one year. The strongest predictors of future disability were a high baseline HAQ, large joint involvement, female sex, and longer disease duration. The decision tree predicted disability accurately in 67% of patients. Conclusion. It is possible to predict functional outcome at one year among patients with early inflammatory polyarthritis presenting to primary care using simple clinical variables measured at baseline. Satisfying the 1987 ARA criteria could not be used to predict future disability.

This article describes a unification of two widely-used empirical approaches: rule induction and instance-based learning. In the new algorithm, instances are treated as maximally specific rules, and classification is performed using a best-match strategy. Rules are learned by gradually generalizing instances until no improvement in apparent accuracy is obtained. Theoretical analysis shows this approach to be efficient. It is implemented in the RISE 3.1 system. In an extensive empirical study, RISE consistently achieves higher accuracies than state-of-the-art representatives of both its parent approaches (PEBLS and CN2), as well as a decision tree learner (C4.5). Lesion studies show that each of RISE's components is essential to this performance. Most significantly, in 14 of the 30 domains studied, RISE is more accurate than the best of PEELS and CN2, showing that a significant synergy can be obtained by combining multiple empirical methods.

Methods: The outcome of serological testing for H. pylori in dyspepsia is analyzed using a decision tree, Successful eradication is associated with the potential benefits of healing dyspepsia and preventing peptic ulcer or gastric cancer, In a sensitivity analysis, all of the transition rates and benefits are varied over a wide range to test the robustness of the calculated decision outcomes, Results: The cost-benefit relationship of serological screening for H. pylori in dyspeptic patients is influenced primarily by the response rate of nonulcer dyspepsia to H. pylori eradication and secondly by the monetary benefit of ulcer prevention and the prevalence rate of peptic ulcer in H. pylori-positive patients, A response to H. pylori eradication in 5-10% of all patients with nonulcer dyspepsia would make screening and treatment for H. pylori a beneficial option, irrespective of any other potential benefits, If ulcer prevention were associated with long term benefit of $4000 or more and if the ulcer prevalence rate exceeded 10% of all dyspeptic patients, serological screening for H. pylori would also pay off, Conclusions: As long as no unequivocal evidence exists that nonulcer dyspepsia responds to eradication of H. pylori, treating all dyspeptic patients who test positive for H. pylori cannot be recommended, At the present time, antibiotic therapy should be reserved to patients with proven ulcer or to patients with nonulcer dyspepsia for whom other measures have failed.

There are a number of subgroups of AMI patients, however, for whom the indication for coronary angiography is not well established. Methods and Results We developed a decision-analytic model for AMI in representative patient subgroups based on relevant clinical characteristics. The model estimates quality-adjusted life expectancy and direct lifetime costs for two strategies: coronary angiography and treatment guided by its results versus initial medical therapy without angiography. Decision tree chance node probabilities were estimated with the use of pooled data from randomized clinical trials and other relevant literature, costs were estimated with the use of the Medicare Part A database, and quality of life adjustments were derived from a survey of 1051 patients who had had a recent AMI. In our analysis, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for coronary angiography and treatment guided by its result, compared with initial medical therapy without angiography, ranged between $17 000 and >$1 million per quality-adjusted year of life gained. Patient subgroups with severe postinfarction angina or a strongly positive exercise tolerance test (ETT) typically had cost-effectiveness ratios of <$50 000 per quality-adjusted year of life gained. In addition, most patient subgroups with a prior AMI had cost-effectiveness ratios of <$50 000 per qualify-adjusted year of life gained, even with a negative ETT result. Conclusions In many patient subgroups after AMI, the cost-effectiveness of routine coronary angiography and treatment guided by its results compares favorably with other treatment strategies for coronary heart disease.

Using Learning to Facilitate the Evolution of Features for Recognizing Visual Concepts	EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION			English	Article						Evolutionary computation; Baldwin effect; decision trees; feature selection; Genetic Algorithms; hybrid systems; induction; pattern recognition		This paper describes a hybrid methodology that integrates genetic algorithms (GAS) and decision tree learning in order to evolve useful subsets of discriminatory features for recognizing complex visual concepts. A GA is used to search the space of all possible subsets of a large set of candidate discrimination features. Candidate feature subsets are evaluated by using C4.5, a decision tree learning algorithm, to produce a decision tree based on the given features using a limited amount of training data. The classification performance of the resulting decision tree on unseen testing data is used as the fitness of the underlying feature subset. Experimental results are presented to show how increasing the amount of learning significantly improves feature set evolution for difficult visual recognition problems involving satellite and facial image data. In addition, we also report on the extent to which other more subtle aspects of the Baldwin effect are exhibited by the system.

Each substance in the database was classified into one of three structural classes using a decision tree approach. The resulting cumulative distributions of NOELs for each of the structural classes differed significantly from one another, supporting the contention that chemical structure defines toxicity. The database was used to derive a threshold of acceptable human exposure for each of the structural classes that could be applied in the absence of specific toxicity data on a substance within one of the three structural classes. The human exposure thresholds provide guidance on the degree of testing and evaluation required for substances that lack toxicity data.

A classification of 81 environmental units was derived by subdividing the region according to combinations of mean annual rainfall, mean annual temperature, soil fertility and slope, All environmental units contain forest, although some also contain other vegetation formations, The units were used to separate the region's forests into 81 classes. This approach produced a consistent classification of environments for the entire region that could be applied across all land tenures and uses. Derivation of the classification from physical data also enabled the extent of clearing of each environmental unit to be accurately assessed, The coverage of the environmental units by all formal protection measures was measured, Strict reserves (secure areas with management dedicated to nature conservation) are highly biased in their regional distribution, being concentrated in the steep and/or infertile parts of the region, Other protection measures include a variety of tenures, classifications and zonings with different constraints on land use applied by Local, State and Commonwealth Governments. When all protection measures are combined, there is still a strong bias towards the steep, and to some extent the infertile, parts of the region, The reasons for these biases are explained in terms of the history of reservation and the types of land over which other measures have generally been applied, The result of the biases in protection measures is that environmental units most suitable for clearing have been given least protection. The potential for achieving levels of reservation of environmental units required under current Commonwealth Government policy was assessed in relation to tenure and degree of fragmentation of the remaining vegetation. While public land can contribute the required areas of new reserves for many environmental units, adequate reservation of other environments will have to rely heavily on private land and remnants of vegetation, Priorities for reservation were expressed in terms of two factors: (1) the percentage of the remaining vegetation in each environmental unit that will need to be reserved to achieve the policy target; and (2) the vulnerability of each environmental unit to clearing. Environmental units with high percentages required (few options in space) and high vulnerability (few options in time) have the highest priority for reservation or other effective protection, The vegetation that remains in these environmental units is mainly on private land. Reservation priorities will change to some extent if conservation goals are changed. Current priorities also need to be complemented by an analysis of the security and effectiveness of protection measures other than strict reservation.

We break the problem down into a series of sub-problems and concentrate on the radical recognition problem. The sub-problems are linked in a hierarchy of three layers: radical, radical sub-unit, and salient stroke. This problem reduction technique enables us to solve complex recognition problems effectively. We describe how to analyze and choose radical sub-units and salient strokes in order to recognize a set of radicals. We also construct two knowledge bases in the form of decision trees to guide the hypothesis and test procedures used to solve the recognition sub-problems. The problem reduction is done in a top-down fashion, while the problem solving process proceeds in a bottom-up fashion. The advantages of our method are described. The representation and organization of the two knowledge bases are explicitly described. The method is tested on two sets of handprinted characters using an TBM PC (486-33). The recognition rate is over 95.7% and the computer time needed to recognize a radical averages about 0.07 s. The experimental results indicate that our method effectively copes with a wide range of ordinary variations encountered in handwritten Chinese characters.

J	deSouza, RB; Ab, K; Lee, SG; Lye, SW				deSouza, RB; Ab, K; Lee, SG; Lye, SW			An integrated decision-support environment for DFX audit	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS MANUFACTURING			English	Article								Environmental issues related to the life cycle of a product have forced companies, especially electronics companies, to adopt new strategies to stay competitive. Whereas until not so long ago environmental issues in manufacturing were considered, at best, as a cost overhead, today that perception has been radically altered. However, to address product life cycle issues, specific techniques and methods have to be understood and applied, for example, design for disassembly and artificial intelligence techniques. An integrated decision-support environment is proposed, incorporating some of these, to compute the cost/benefits of servicing, discarding or recycling an electronic pager. The pager was analyzed as, with an ever-increasing user-base, the social and political pressures for product ''take-back'' at the end of its useful life is expected to mount. The methodology entails first constructing a decision-tree of the disassembly sequence of the product, embodying the relevant material and disassembly costs. The decision to service, discard or recycle is reached based on a cost/benefit analysis of the alternative courses of action. if the alternatives are not clear-cut, or heuristic in nature, fuzzy logic is employed. The software tools, all visual, comprise Axon(R) Idea Processor, Decision Analysis by TreeAge (DATA(TM)), and FuzzyTECH(R).		deSouza, RB (reprint author), NANYANG TECHNOL UNIV,SCH MECH & PROD ENGN,NANYANG AVE,SINGAPORE 639798,SINGAPORE.

However, the potential effect of PET on the management of these patients and its cost-effectiveness has not been rigorously studied. Thus, we have used decision tree sensitivity analysis to assess the cost-effectiveness of a PET based strategy for staging of NSCLC. Methods: Two decision strategies for selection of potential surgical candidates were compared; thoracic CT alone or thoracic CT and thoracic PET. The first decision tree was conservatively constructed by requiring mediastinoscopy (biopsy) to confirm imaging results so that no patient with surgically curable disease would miss the opportunity for surgery in either strategy. A second less conservative tree in which only nonconcordant results are biopsied was also tested. The various paths of each strategy are dependent on numerous parameters which were determined from a review of the medical literature. Life expectancy was calculated using the declining exponential approximation of life expectancy and reduced based on procedural mortality. Costs were based on mean costs at our institution. For all possible outcomes of each strategy, the expected cost and projected life expectancy were determined. The effect of changing one or more parameters on the expected cost and life expectancy were studied using a sensitivity analysis. Results: The CT + PET strategy in the conservative decision tree showed a saving of $1154 per patient without a loss of life expectancy (increase of 2.96 days) as compared to the alternate strategy of CT alone. Both these effects were the result of improved staging of lung carcinoma prior to the decision for surgery. The CT + PET strategy in the less conservative decision tree showed a savings of $2267 per patient but misses 1.7% of potentially operable patients. Conclusion: These results show through rigorous decision tree analysis, the potential cost-effectiveness of using FDG PET in the management of NSCLC. These results form a basis for detailed study of the results obtained from multicenter trials on the accuracy of PET in NSCLC management. Furthermore, the techniques utilized for decision tree analysis have broad range of applicability to the entire field of nuclear medicine.

J	Liu, WZ				Liu, WZ			An integrated approach for different attribute types in nearest neighbour classification	KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING REVIEW			English	Article							DECISION TREE INDUCTION	The basic nearest neighbour algorithm works by storing the training instances and classifying a new case by predicting that it has the same class as its nearest stored instance. To measure the distance between instances, some distance metric needs to be used. In situations when all attributes have numeric values, the conventional nearest neighbour method treats examples as points in feature spaces and uses Euclidean distance as the distance metric. In tasks with only nominal attributes, the simple ''over-lap'' metric is usually used. To handle classification tasks that have mixed types of attributes, the two different metrics are simply combined. Work by researchers in the machine learning field has shown that this approach performs poorly. This paper attempts to study a more recently developed distance metric and show that this metric is capable of measuring the importance of different attributes. With the use of discretisation for numeric-valued attributes, this method provides an integrated way in dealing with problem domains with mixtures of attribute types. Through detailed analyses, this paper tries to provide further insights into the understanding of nearest neighbour classification techniques and promote further use of this type of classification algorithm.

Of these 47 quantitative variables, 27 were computed on Feulgen-stained specimens (25 on cytologic and 2 on histologic samples) and, of the remaining 20, 8 related to vimentin and S-100 protein immunostaining patterns and the other 12 to the glycohistochemical staining patterns of peanut agglutinin, succinylated wheat germ agglutinin, and concavalin A agglutinin. The 35 lipomatous tumors included 6 atypical lipomas and 8 well differentiated, 5 dedifferentiated, 6 myxoid, and 10 pleomorphic liposarcomas. The actual diagnostic value contributed by each of the 47 variables with respect to the 5 lipomatous tumor groups was determined by means of the decision tree technique, an artificial intelligence-related algorithm that forms part of the supervised learning algorithms. Of the 47 quantitative variables, the decision tree technique retained 8: ie, 2 tissue architecture-, 2 DNA ploidy level-, 2 morphonuclear-, 1 lectin histochemical-, and 1 vimentin immunostain-related variables. The decision tree technique made use of these 8 variables to set up logical rules that make it possible to identify atypical lipomas from well differentiated liposarcomas, on the one hand, and dedifferentiated liposarcomas from those that are well differentiated and pleomorphic, on the other. Thus, the combination of an artificial intelligence algorithm analyzing quantitative variables generated by means of the computer-assisted microscope analysis of cytologic and histologic samples from lipomatous tumors can be considered an expert system contributing significant diagnostic information to conventional diagnosis.

Study of this task has inspired a wide range of human and computational work. The task requires that children predict the outcome of placing a discrete number of weights at various distances on either side of a fulcrum. Our model, which features the symbolic learning algorithm C4.5 as a transition mechanism, exhibits regularities found in the human data including orderly stage progression, U-shaped development, and the torque difference effect. Unlike previous successful models of the task, the current. model uses a single free parameter, is not restricted in the size of the balance scale that it can accommodate, and does not require the assumption of a highly structured output representation or a training environment biased towards weight or distance information. The model makes a number of predictions differing from those of previous computational efforts.

The authors studied the consistency of performance of individual physicians to evaluate the identification of outlier practitioners as a strategy for improving patient care. METHODS. The authors used a data base containing information on 430 practitioners caring for 6,090 patients in 16 group practices. The authors analyzed inter- and intraphysician differences in performance on the basis of review criteria for 8 patient care guidelines. These criteria allowed for a variety of acceptable clinical strategies, incorporated decision tree logic, and included input from participating practitioners. The authors took steps to maximize validity and controlled for potentially confounding characteristics of patients and practitioners. The authors identified outliers, evaluated the significance of differences between outliers and nonoutliers, and studied variations in performance across cases and guidelines in conformance with guidelines. RESULTS. The authors identified a few statistically significant outliers. Correlations for performance across cases seen by a given physician were low. The highest positive correlation for performance between any pair of guidelines was 0.32. CONCLUSIONS. The performance of a given practitioner is highly variable from patient to patient and from guideline to guideline. Thus, strategies focusing solely on substandard outliers will miss opportunities to improve performance.

J	Hazen, GB; Pellissier, JM				Hazen, GB; Pellissier, JM			Recursive utility for stochastic trees	OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article							HEALTH-STATUS; DECISION; MODELS; HIP	Stochastic trees are semi-Markov processes represented using tree diagrams. Such trees have been found useful for prescriptive modeling of temporal medical treatment choice. We consider utility functions over stochastic trees which permit recursive evaluation In a graphically intuitive manner analogous to decision tree rollback. Such rollback is computationally intractable unless a low-dimensional preference summary exists. We present the most general classes of utility functions having specific tractable preference summaries. We examine three preference summaries - memoryless, Markovian, and semi-Markovian - which promise both computational feasibility and convenience in assessment. Their use is illustrated by application to a previous medical decision analysis of whether to perform carotid endarterectomy.

The system employs the identical sensor-avionic system as the Rocky Rover and can be implemented by a software upload only. Navigation is by dead reckoning with steering decisions accomplished by a unique combination of fuzzy logic and decision tree behavioral technology. The rule base for the fuzzy-inference machine was developed by an expert operator trained to steer the vehicle from a so-called approximate, or fuzzy, map of the terrain around the vehicle. This map has proven valuable, in itself, for very low bandwidth telepresence robotic vehicle steering applications. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Differences in treating preschool children are discussed. A mulitmodal treatment program for children with hyperkinetic and oppositional behavior problems is then described. It can be used for children aged 3 to 12 years old. The program has two parts, the parent-child program and the teacher-child program. The program contains intervention units that can be combined as necessary depending on the individual problem configuration. A case study is presented to illustrate the effects of this program in combination with stimulant medication.

For samples with at least 200 cases, extensive empirical evidence supports the following conclusions relative to complexity-fit selection: (a) 10-fold cross-validation is nearly unbiased; (b) ignoring model complexity-fit and picking the ''standard'' model is highly biased; (c) 10-fold cross-validation is consistent with optimal complexity-fit selection for large sample sizes and (d) the accuracy of complexity-fit selection by 10-fold cross-validation is largely dependent on sample size, irrespective of the population distribution.

The purpose of a preliminary screening of this type would be to reduce the number of OGTT's needed to identify cases of IGT and NIDDM in the population. We used NIDDM risk indicators and decision tree analysis methods (CART software) to identify subgroups of the population at increased risk. We examined a population of Hispanic (n=583) and non-Hispanic white (n=768) subjects without a prior history of diabetes. Subjects were classified as normal, IGT or NIDDM (WHO criteria) based on results from a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Sensitivity (SEN) and specificity (SPE) of the CART models were calculated using the OGTT as the 'gold standard.' Two approaches to screening were simulated. In the simultaneous approach all risk variables were entered into CART models at once. In the serial approach, risk variables were grouped according to degree of effort required for data collection, and were entered into CART models in stages. Fasting glucose, age and body mass index (BMI) were selected as risk;variables by CART when simulating the simultaneous approach (SEN=91%, SPE=55%). In the serial approach, CART used age and BMI to eliminate 35% of the population from further screening, and then used fasting glucose, glycohemoglobin, age and BMI to classify the remaining higher risk subjects (SEN=85% SPE=64%). These models suggest that screening for IGT and previously undiagnosed NIDDM can be based on measurement of relatively simple indicators, and yet maintain a level of both sensitivity and specificity acceptable for this type of preliminary screening.

This is particularly true for recombinant DNA technology, which has strongly stimulated the study of biocatalysis, and many examples of new applications of biocatalysts exist. Nevertheless, they have not yet been routinely applied in chemistry. In this study, the question is addressed as to when biocatalysts can be advantageously used in this field. If that is indeed the case, many decisions have to be made before they can be optimally utilized. In the present work, a decision tree is introduced which provides important questions to answer to come to such an optimal use. Examples are given to illustrate the decisionmaking.

Whether these results hold in general and to what extent pruning improves the accuracy of a concept have not been investigated theoretically. This paper provides a theoretical study of pruning. We focus on a particular type of pruning and determine a bound on the error due to pruning. This is combined with PAC (probably approximately correct) learning theory to determine a sample size sufficient to guarantee a probabilistic bound on the concept error. We also discuss additional pruning rules and give an analysis for the pruning error.

This work describes the decision strategy adopted in Angers concerning the neonatal handling of those abnormalities. Patients and methods. - One hundred children born between 1988 and 1990, with prenatally suspected fetal uropathy, were included in the study and followed for a period of 3 years. In every case, an ultrasound scan was performed at birth. In cases with persistent abnormality a voiding cystourethrography was done in the first week of life. An intravenous urograph and/or a nuclear renography were performed during the second month of life. Results. - Twenty-nine children were normal. Seventy-one were affected by 126 isolated or related uropathies; the most frequent ones were the ureteropelvic junction obstruction syndrome (48), ureterovesical junction obstruction (18) and multicystic kidneys (13). A vesicoureteral reflux was associated in 22% of cases. The diagnosis was perfectly correlated with the prenatal diagnosis in 50% of cases. Fourteen of the normal children had a later ultrasound scan control, between 2 and 9 months; later on, three of them showed a moderate ureteropelvic junction obstruction syndrome. Amongst the 48 ureteropelvic junction obstruction syndromes 22% have been operated on The others obstructive uropathies remained stable or spontaneously improved. Discussion. - These results require us to discuss as matter of priority the large number of spontaneously regressive prenatal hydronephrosis and the necessity to establish a consensus for the pre and postnatal pathological thresholds of the anteroposterior pelvic diameter, the interest in carrying out a voiding cystography after the birth when dilatation is confirmed the interest of nuclear renography for the diagnosis and follow-up of obstructive uropathies and the absence of urgency for surgery. Conclusion - We propose a decision tree specifying the action to take when facing [he diagnosis of a prenatal hydronephrosis.

Interactive rule induction utilizing mathematical algorithms has become a powerful tool in data analysis and in making rules and patterns explicit. Data from a Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) elemental analysis of human dental enamel were used to elucidate co-variations between certain elements. A co-variation analysis was performed employing a computerized induction analysis program, as well as a neural network program. Both analyses, confirming each other, revealed co-variations between certain elements in dental enamel in addition to exclusion of data of no importance for chosen outcomes. The results are presented in hierarchic diagrams, in which the importance for every specific element is given by its position and level in the diagram (decision tree). From the results it became evident that elements such as chlorine and sodium expressed a high co-variation level. Similarly fluorine and potassium co-varied, as well as magnesium and the trace element strontium. It was demonstrated that data from an elemental analysis could be processed by an induction analysis to reveal co-variations between certain elements in tooth enamel. The biological significance of these data is not fully understood, and further analyses in the field are needed.

J	Fay, RM; Feron, VJ				Fay, RM; Feron, VJ			Complex mixtures: Hazard identification and risk assessment	FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY			English	Article								Regarding risk evaluation of complex mixtures, the Working Group discussed the following topics: evaluation of the mixture as a whole, fractionation of the mixture, identification of the 'top ten' chemicals, and composite standards. It was concluded that no standard methodology for hazard identification and risk assessment of complex mixtures yet exists, but assessment of complex mixtures must proceed, using all available information, methods, technology, expertise and experience. The development of a decision tree for tackling complex mixtures was recommended, and the need to move forward with instituting standards for mixtures, especially in job-oriented situations, was emphasized.

J	Hwang, MY; Huang, XD; Alleva, FA				Hwang, MY; Huang, XD; Alleva, FA			Predicting unseen triphones with senones	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SPEECH AND AUDIO PROCESSING			English	Article							HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; DISTANCE	In large-vocabulary speech recognition, we often encounter triphones that are not covered in the training data. These unseen triphones are usually backed off to their corresponding diphones or context-independent phones, which contain less context yet have plenty of training examples. In this paper, we propose to use decision-tree-based senones to generate needed senonic baseforms for these unseen triphones. A decision tree is built for each Markov state of each base phone; the leaves of the trees constitute the senone pool. To find the senone associated with a Markov state of any triphone, the corresponding tree is traversed until a leaf node is reached. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was demonstrated in the ARPA 5000-word speaker-independent Wall Street Journal dictation task The word error rate was reduced by 11% when unseen triphones were modeled by the decision-tree-based senones instead of context-independent phones. When there were more than five unseen triphones in each test utterance, the error rate reduction was more than 20%.		Hwang, MY (reprint author), MICROSOFT CORP,REDMOND,WA 98052, USA.

The background for those in existence is described. Another decision-tree approach that follows the logic in the IAMFES manual Procedures to Implement the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point Approach is presented. It takes into consideration impending hazards, the effect of actions exercised at the operation in question, whether control actions should be taken at this or subsequent operations and whether the CCP will be monitored and corrections made. Further, guidelines are given for selecting an operation as a critical control point. A decision tree to aid in the evaluation of risks is presented, considering whether illness will result, the severity of the illness and the likely occurrence of this outcome, based upon epidemiologic or challenge study of related events. These decision trees provide additional tools to aid in the development of HACCP systems.

J	Farrow, GSD; Xydeas, CS; Oakley, JP; Khorabi, A; Prelcic, NG				Farrow, GSD; Xydeas, CS; Oakley, JP; Khorabi, A; Prelcic, NG			A comparison of system architectures for intelligent document understanding	SIGNAL PROCESSING-IMAGE COMMUNICATION			English	Article						document understanding; page layout analysis; document image processing; ODA		Intelligent document understanding (IDU) is the process of converting scanned document images into a high level representation which describes the document's layout and logical structure, in addition to providing its information content. In this paper we discuss IDU in general and address a specific problem within this domain concerning the extraction of the layout structure of pages from a technical journal. Three different architectural approaches to accomplishing this task are proposed. Firstly we describe a novel document understanding system (System A) which exploits a hybrid bottom-up/top-down control architecture. The system uses a variety of image processing algorithms in a bottom-up manner. Conversely, a system based on a pure top-down architecture (System B) is then proposed which produces a segmentation of the page via projection profile analysis and achieves classification of image regions via procedural deduction. Finally, an alternative top-down architecture (System C) is described in which an optimised segmentation scheme is applied to produce partitioned blocks. These are then classified in a goal driven manner using a decision tree. A comparison of the three systems is made by measuring system performance on images obtained from a specific class of input document. The performance of document understanding systems has been quantified in terms of an object identification rate and the percentage of column area successfully interpreted. Using these measures, System A has given superior results to the two top-down systems presented. System A also performs significantly better than a previously reported top-down system operating on a comparable problem (Viswanathan, 1990).

J	Yuan, YF; Zhuang, HJ				Yuan, YF; Zhuang, HJ			A genetic algorithm for generating fuzzy classification rules	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						fuzzy classification; machine learning; genetic algorithm	SYSTEMS; LOGIC	Fuzzy classification systems based on fuzzy logic are capable of dealing with cognitive uncertainties such as vagueness and ambiguity involved in classification problems. To build a fuzzy classification system, the key is to find an optimal set of fuzzy rules. Machine learning methods such as fuzzy neural networks and fuzzy decision tree induction have been applied to learn fuzzy rules but they may be trapped into local optimal. Based on the principle of natural evolution and global searching, a genetic algorithm is promising in obtaining better results but it is usually less efficient. In this paper, a Fuzzy Genetic Algorithm (FGA) is developed to generate fuzzy classification rules. Several techniques such as multivalue logic coding, composite fitness function, viability check, and rule extraction are used to improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of the algorithm. Two experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of FGA and to compare FGA with other machine learning algorithms.

J	Ash, D; HayesRoth, B				Ash, D; HayesRoth, B			Using action-based hierarchies for real-time diagnosis	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						reactive planning; decision trees; diagnosis; real-time planning; heuristics	PRINCIPLES; SYSTEM	An intelligent agent diagnoses perceived problems so that it can respond to them appropriately. Basically, the agent performs a series of tests whose results discriminate among competing hypotheses. Given a specific diagnosis, the agent performs the associated action. Using the traditional information-theoretic heuristic to order diagnostic tests in a decision tree, the agent can maximize the information obtained from each successive test and thereby minimize the average time (number of tests) required to complete a diagnosis and perform the appropriate action. However, in real-time domains, even the optimal sequence of tests cannot always be performed in the time available. Nonetheless, the agent must respond. For agents operating in real-time domains, we propose an alternative action-based approach in which: (a) each node in the diagnosis tree is augmented to include an ordered set of actions, each of which has positive utility for all of its children in the tree; and (b) the tree is structured to maximize the expected utility of the action available at each node. Upon perceiving a problem, the agent works its way through the tree, performing tests that discriminate among successively smaller subsets of potential faults. When a deadline occurs, the agent performs the best available action associated with the most specific node it has reached so far. Although the action-based approach does not minimize the time required to complete a specific diagnosis, it provides positive utility responses, with step-wise improvements in expected utility, throughout the diagnosis process. We present theoretical and empirical results contrasting the advantages and disadvantages of the information-theoretic and action-based approaches.

J	Marty, M				Marty, M			Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: From experimentation to expertise.	BULLETIN DU CANCER			French	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Congress on Cancer Chemotherapy	FEB, 1995	PARIS, FRANCE			chemotherapy-induced emesis; 5-HT3 receptor antagonists	INDUCED EMESIS; CISPLATIN; CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE; ANTAGONIST	Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, two of the most distressing side-effects of cancer chemotherapy, have been the subject of a number of fundamental and clinical investigations. These have led to the development of a novel class of antiemetic agents, the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. The pathophysiology of the emetic reflex and the clinical management of emesis are very complicated. Two experimental preclinical animal models are available (ferret and dog) and are particularly used to assess monochemotherapy as a single dose. Results are fairly good for acute nausea and vomiting. However, no optimal animal model is available fo the assessment of delayed and anticipated emesis. The clinical settings are so complex and variable that they preclude the development of an adequate model in all cases. It is also impossible to carry out clinical studies to assess each issue. Management of nausea and vomiting depends on the analysis by the physician of individual and drug-related parameters and on his own expertise. Scores can be assigned to each parameter and a decision tree can be elaborated to help the decision and improve the management of such patients. The first goal is to obtain an optimal control of emesis from the very first cycle of chemotherapy in order to ensure good control during subsequent cycles.

J	Erickson, J				Erickson, J			New lower bounds for Hopcroft's problem	DISCRETE & COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th Annual ACM Symposium on Computational Geometry	JUN, 1995	VANCOUVER, CANADA	ACM			ARRANGEMENTS; COMPLEXITY; LINES; CUTTINGS; SEGMENTS	We establish new lower bounds on the complexity of the following basic geometric problem, attributed to John Hopcroft: Given a set of n points and m hyperplanes in R(d), is any point contained in any hyperplane? We define a general class of partitioning algorithms, and show that in the worst case, for all m and n, any such algorithm requires time Omega (n log m + n(2/3) m(2/3) + m log n) in two dimensions, or Omega (n log m + n(5/6) m(1/2) + n(1/2) m(5/6) + m log n) in three or more dimensions. We obtain slightly higher bounds for the counting version of Hopcroft's problem in four or more dimensions. Our planar lower bound is within a factor of 2(O(log*(n+m))) of the best known upper bound, due to Matousek. Previously, the best known lower bound, in any dimension, was Omega (n log m + m log n). We develop our lower bounds in two stages. First we define a combinatorial representation of the relative order type of a set of points and hyperplanes, called a monochromatic cover, and derive lower bounds on its size in the worst case. We then show that the running time of any partitioning algorithm is bounded below by the size of some monochromatic cover. As a related result, using a straightforward adversary argument, we derive a quadratic lower bound on the complexity of Hopcroft's problem in a surprisingly powerful decision tree model of computation.

A prospective study of 155 patients	GUT			English	Article						diarrhoea; investigation; human immunodeficiency virus; acquired immunodeficiency syndrome; diagnosis; decision analysis	HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS; GASTROINTESTINAL MANIFESTATIONS; INTESTINAL MICROSPORIDIOSIS; CRYPTOSPORIDIAL DIARRHEA; PERSISTENT DIARRHEA; VIRUS-INFECTION; AIDS-PATIENTS; INDIVIDUALS	Background and Aims-The optimum diagnostic investigation for patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and diarrhoea is not known. Often no pathogen is detected and it is unclear whether this is because pathogens are absent in some patients or the investigations used fail to detect them. The hypothesis that AIDS related diarrhoea is usually due to an infection, which can be identified by a simple diagnostic strategy based on the results of intensive investigation of a cohort of such patients,was investigated. Methods-155 patients with AIDS and chronic diarrhoea underwent contemporaneous examination of stools, duodenal, jejunal, and rectal biopsy specimens and duodenal aspirate for bacterial, protozoal, and viral pathogens. A decision tree analysis was used to determine the best sequential diagnostic strategy for clinicians. Results-128 of 155 patients investigated (83%) had at least one potential pathogen. The presenting clinical features could not predict the presence or site of the pathogens. Stool analysis identified the most pathogens (93 of 199, 47%). Rectal biopsy was essential for the diagnosis of cytomegalovirus and adenovirus. Duodenal biopsy. was as helpful as jejunal biopsy and detected some treatable pathogens missed by other methods. Electron microscopy, impression smears, and duodenal aspirate yielded little extra information. If gut biopsy was reserved for patients without a stool pathogen, some treatable pathogens would have been missed. Conclusion-Most patients with AIDS and chronic diarrhoea have at least one gut pathogen, which can be identified by stool analysis and light microscopic examination of duodenal and rectal biopsies. Some pathogens will be missed unless all these investigations are done on all such patients.

J	Huang, YM; Lin, SH				Huang, YM; Lin, SH			An efficient inductive learning method for object-oriented database using attribute entropy	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						inductive learning; Version Space; ID3; entropy; object-oriented database		The data-driven characteristic of Version Space works efficiently in memory even if the training set is enormous. However, the concept hierarchy of each attribute used to generalize/specialize the hypothesis of S/G-set is processed sequentially and instance-by-instance, which degrades its performance. As for ID3, the decision tree is generated from the order of attributes according to their entropies to reduce the number of attributes in some of the tree paths. Unlike Version Space, ID3 generates an extremely complex decision tree when the training set is enormous. Therefore, we propose a method, AGE, taking advantages of Version Space and ID3 to learn rules from object-oriented databases (OODB) with the least number of learning features according to the entropy. By simulations, we found the performance of our learning algorithm is better than both Version Space and ID3. Furthermore, AGE's time complexity and space complexity are both linear to the number of training instances.		Huang, YM (reprint author), NATL CHENG KUNG UNIV,DEPT ENGN SCI,TAINAN 70100,TAIWAN.

J	Rao, NSV				Rao, NSV			On parallel algorithms for single-fault diagnosis in fault propagation graph systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS			English	Article						fault diagnosis; single fault; fault propagation graph; operative diagnosis; CREW PRAM; and hypercube	COMPLEXITY; DIAGNOSABILITY; NETWORK	Systems modeled as directed graphs where nodes represent components and edges represent fault propagation between components, are studied from a parallel computation viewpoint. Some of the components are equipped with alarms that ring in response to an abnormal condition. The single fault diagnosis problem is to compute the set of all potential failure sources, P-S, that correspond to a set of ringing alarms A(R). There is a lower bound of Omega(e + k(n - k + 1)) for any sequential algorithm for this problem (under a decision tree model), where n and e are the number of nodes and edges of the graph respectively, and k is the number of alrams. Using a CREW PRAM of p less than or equal to k(n - k + 1)/log k processors, the graph can be preprocessed in O(n(2.81)/p + log2n) time; then PS can be computed in O(k(n - k + 1)/p + log k) time. On a hypercube of p less than or equal to k(n-k+1)/log k processors, the preprocessng cna be done in O(n2/root p + n(2.61)/p(0.805) + nk(n - k + 1)/p) time; then P-S can be computed in O(k(n - k + 1) log n/p log k + log n) time.

A survey of 60 patients suspected of carcinomatous mandibular infiltration was undertaken, and the: most important clinical and imaging data were studied. Tumor localization and bone scintigraphy proved to offer the most important predictive power. A decision tree and a logistic regression model which determines a score function combining these characteristics were designed. This decision tree improves the sensitivity and specificity of the preoperative assessment and provides the surgeon with an algorithm for the accurate estimation of early mandibular invasion.

J	AllenbergNavony, N; Itai, A; Moran, S				AllenbergNavony, N; Itai, A; Moran, S			Average and randomized complexity of distributed problems	SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article						distributed computing; randomized algorithms; average complexity; message complexity; bit complexity; lower bounds; Yao's lemma	LEADER	Yao proved that in the decision-tree model, the average complexity of the best deterministic algorithm is a lower bound on the complexity of randomized algorithms that solve the same problem. Here it is shown that a similar result does not always hold in the common model of distributed computation, the model in which all the processors run the same program (which may depend on the processors' input). We therefore construct a new technique that together with Yao's method enables us to show that in many cases, a similar relationship does hold in the distributed model. This relationship enables us to carry over known lower bounds an the complexity of deterministic computations to the realm of randomized computations, thus obtaining new results. The new technique can also be used for obtaining results concerning algorithms with bounded error.

The underlying stochastic decision tree concept extends classical approaches mainly in that it adds a novel node type that allows for the continuous control of discrete branching probability distributions. The control functions are piecewise linear and are convex for the costs and concave for the benefits. The MILP-model has been embedded in a prototype Decision Support System (DSS). With respect to the proposed solution the DSS provides complete probability distributions for both costs and benefits.

The best way to design a successful DSS is through the participative design, thereafter conceptual simple decision making models with the possibility of automating learning should be considered in the design phase and then implemented by conceptual simple paradigms. In this paper we present a cardiological decision support system, called (ROSE)-S-2 (computeRised prOlapse Syndrome dEtermination, O-2 stands for Object Oriented implementation), based on decision tree approach and automatic learning, supporting the process of mitral valve prolapse determination. (ROSE)-S-2 is implemented using Object Oriented visual programming lnguage.

We will adopt oblique decision tree to represent the divided input space and select an appropriate subnetworks, each of which is trained over a different region of input space. The overall architecture of multiple neural networks system, called the federated architecture, consists of a facilitator, normal subnetworks, and "tile" networks. The role of a facilitator is to choose the subnetwork that is suitable for the given input data using information obtained from decision tree. However, if input data is close enough to the boundaries of regions, there is a large possibility of selecting the invalid subnetwork due to the incorrect prediction of decision tree. When such a situation is encountered, the facilitator selects a "tile" network that is trained closely to the boundaries of partitioned input space, instead of a normal subnetwork. In this way, it is possible to reduce the large error of neural networks at Zones close to borders of regions. The validation of our approach is examined and verified by applying the federated neural networks system to the configuration design of a midship structure.									0	0	0	IEEE COMPUTER SOC	LOS ALAMITOS	10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA		0-8186-8218-3				1997							161	167				7	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Medical Informatics	Computer Science; Medical Informatics	BK13D	WOS:000071282900031

This standard was developed to help users (i.e., engineers, chemists, managers, and other technical staff) determine (1) when sufficient safeguards were in place for an identified scenario and (2) which of these safeguards were critical to achieving (or maintaining) the tolerable risk level. Plant management was held accountable for upholding this standard, and they were also held accountable for maintaining (to an extremely high level of availability) the critical safety features that were identified. In applying this standard, the users found they needed more guidance on selecting the appropriate methodology for judging risk; some used methodologies that were deemed too rigorous for the questions being answered and others in the company used purely qualitative judgment tools. The users in the company agreed to a set of three methods for judging risk and developed a decision tree, followed by training, to help the users (1) choose the proper methodology and (2) apply the methodology chosen consistently. The new guidelines for risk acceptance and risk judgment were taught to technical staff(those who lead hazard reviews and design new processes) worldwide in early 1996. This paper presents the evolution of the risk tolerance and risk judgment approach used by the company.

In this work we used classification trees to analyze Touwen's protocol, in order to obtain a clinical procedure simple enough to be performed during the daily routine. 415 children underwent the protocol when they were 5 years old; they were then checked at the age of 7 to evaluate their learning levels. Collected data were analyzed using a variant of the ID3 algorithm, The best identified decision tree correctly classified 95% of total population using only 40 different items out of all the 316 items of the Touwen's protocol, This result could allow to define a sort of "typical" subject profile differentiating between normal and pathological subjects.

However, little attention is typically given to the validity of the features and types of rules generated by these systems and how well they perform across a variety of features and patterns. A comparison of the classification performance of two different types of decision tree techniques and their associated feature types is presented.

Ltree is able to define decision surfaces both orthogonal and oblique to the axes defined by the attributes of the input space. This is done combining a decision tree with a linear discriminant by means of constructive induction. At each decision node Ltree defines a new instance space by insertion of new attributes that are projections of the. examples that fall at this node over the hyper-planes given by a linear discriminant function. This new instance space is propagated down through the tree. Tests based on those new attributes are oblique with respect to the original input space. Ltree is a probabilistic tree in the sense that it outputs a class probability distribution for each query example. The class probability distribution is computed at learning time, taking into account the different class distributions on the path from the root to the actual node. We have carried out experiments on sixteen benchmark datasets and compared our system with other well known decision-tree systems (orthogonal and oblique) like C4.5, OC1 and LMDT. On these datasets we have observed that our system has advantages in what concerns accuracy and tree size at statistically significant confidence levels.

Many approaches to decision tree induction fail this challenge. Under a broad range of circumstances, these approaches exhibit a nearly linear relationship between training set size and tree size, even after accuracy has ceased to increase. These algorithms fail to adjust for the statistical effects of comparing multiple subtrees. Adjusting for these effects produces trees with little or no excess structure.

We begin by reviewing existing work on category formation in data mining which has been mainly concerned with enabling decision tree programs to handle numeric variables. It is argued that there are other important but neglected aspects of category formation, notably the formation of new categorizations of nominal variables. We report the limited success achieved in categorizing variables from survey data using either endogenous methods or exogenous methods that maximise the association with only one dependent variable. We then describe the categorization technique used in SNOUT: a procedure that selects a partition that both maximises the number of variables associated with the partitioned variable and maximises the strength of those associations. We report on the success achieved using this procedure in exploring real survey data.

Approaches proposed so far for mining classification rules for large databases are mainly decision tree based on symbolic learning methods. In this paper, we use artificial neural network to mine classification rules. We present a novel approach, called LBSB, composed of two phases to extract rules from artificial neural network and discover knowledge in databases. Some experiments have demonstrated that our method generates rules of better performance than the decision tree approach in noisy conditions.

Barrett and Zorn [1993] used a simple lifetime predictor and demonstrated this improvement on a variety of computer programs. In this paper, we use decision trees to do lifetime prediction on the same programs and show significantly better prediction. Our method also has the advantage that during training we can use a large number of features and let the decision tree automatically choose the relevant subset.

In this paper, based on the observation that finding: the best pruning can be efficiently solved by a dynamic programming in the "batch" setting where all the data to be predicted are given in advance, a new on-line prediction algorithm is constructed. Although it is shown that its performance is slightly weaker than Helmbold and Schapire's algorithm with respect to the loss bound, it is so simple and general that it could be applied to many on-line optimization problems solved by dynamic programming. We also explore algorithms that are competitive not only with the best pruning but also with the best prediction values. In this setting, a greatly simplified algorithm is given, and it is shown that the algorithm can easily be generalized to the case where, instead of using decision trees, data are classified in some arbitrarily fixed manner.

The network, built up during training, effectively partitions the feature space into subregions and each final subregion is assigned a class label according to the data routed to it. As the tree grows, the number of training data for each node decreases, which results in less weight update epochs and decreases the time consumption. The growing algorithm is based on depth-first search, which is guaranteed to find deep solutions, i.e. linearly nonseparable classes. We also introduce a measure for estimation of the best-fit neuron to split the feature space at each tree node. This eliminates the necessity for postprocessing perturbance of the hyperplanes and proves essential for solving linearly nonseparable difficult tasks. The network performance is compared to the multilayered perceptron (MLP) over the white/gray matter MRI segmentation problem.

The system is designed to help technically trained personnel incorporate social and economic criteria into project planning and implementation. To create AGFADOPT, information obtained from the literature was used to develop a set of general rules that simulate farmer decision making regarding the adoption of two tree-based technologies: fruit tree orchards and contour hedgerows. These rules were combined in the expert system using a yes/no decision tree framework. Preliminary verification of the system prototype using data from the Dominican Republic and evaluation of the system by potential users suggest that it is logically consistent, reasonably accurate (83% for tree orchard; 68% for contour hedgerows) and potentially useful.

Subjects were represented by their age, education and gender, plus their responses on the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), the Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE), and the Ishihara Color Plate (ICP) tasks. The ML algorithms applied to these data contained within the electronic patient records of a medical relational database, learned rule sets that were as good as or better than any rules derived from either the Literature or from domain specific knowledge provided by expert clinicians. All ML algorithms for all runs found that a single question from the FAQ, the forgetting rule, (''Do you require assistance remembering appointments, family occasions, holidays, or taking medications?'') was the only attribute included in all rule sets. CART's tree simplification procedure always found that just the forgetting rule gave the best pruned decision tree rule set with classification accuracy (93% sensitivity and 80% specificity) as high as or better than any other decision tree rule-set. Comparison with published classification accuracies for the FAQ and MMSE revealed that including some of the additional attributes in these tests actually worsen classification accuracy. Stepwise logistic regression using the FAQ attributes to classify dementia status confirmed that the forgetting rule gave a much larger odds ratio than any other attribute and was the only attribute included in all of the stepwise logistic regressions performed on 33 random samples of the data. Stepwise logistic regression using the MMSE attributes identified two attributes which occurred in all 33 runs and had by far the highest odds ratio. In summary, ML methods have discovered that the simplest and most sensitive screening test for the earliest clinical stages of dementia consists of a single question, the forgetting rule.

The conceptual ship design process begins with selecting previously designed reference ships of the same type with similar sizes and speeds. These reference ships are used for deriving an initial design of a new ship, and then the initial design is kept modified and repaired until the design reaches a level of satisfactory quality. The selection of good reference ships is essential for deriving a good initial design, and the quality of the initial design affects the efficiency and quality of the whole conceptual design process. The selection of reference ships has so far been done by design experts relying on their experience and engineering knowledge of ship design and structural mechanics. We developed an MBL method that can build an effective indexing scheme for retrieving good reference cases from a case base of previous ship designs. Empirical results show that the indexing scheme generated by MBL outperforms those by other learning methods such as the decision tree learning.

J	Bshouty, NH				Bshouty, NH			Simple learning algorithms using divide and conquer	COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY			English	Article						PAC-learning; exact learning; divide and conquer; queries	FORMULAS	This paper investigates what happens when a learning algorithm for a class C attempts to learn target formulas from a different class. In many cases, the learning algorithm will find a ''bad attribute'' or a property of the target formula which precludes its membership in the class C. To continue the learning process, we proceed by building a decision tree according to the possible values of this attribute (divide) and recursively run the learning algorithm for each value (conquer). This paper shows how to recursively run the learning algorithm for each value using the oracles of the target. We demonstrate that the application of this idea on some known learning algorithms can both simplify the algorithm and provide additional power to learn more classes. In particular, we give a simple exact learning algorithm, using membership and equivalence queries, for the class of DNF that is ''almost'' unate, that is, unate with the addition of O(log n) nonunate variables and a constant number of terms. We also find algorithms in different models for boolean functions that depend on k terms.

We design also randomized algebraic decision trees for recognizing the positive octant in R-n or computing MAX in R-n in depth log(O(1)) n. Both problems are known to have linear lower bounds for the depth of any deterministic analytic decision tree recognizing them. The main new (and unifying) proof idea of the paper is in the reduction technique of the signs of testing functions in a decision tree to the signs of their leading terms at the specially chosen points. This allows us to reduce the complexity of a decision, tree to the complexity of a certain Boolean circuit.

In our former research, each a peace of knowledge held by people is expressed by a single decision tree, and conceptual difference is detected by checking the difference. Sometimes it occurs that the attributes and the values with conceptual difference do not appear in decision trees and fails to detect conceptual difference. In this paper, we propose a method to solve this problem by using decision trees with diverse structures which are produced by our genetic algorithm.

Besides their unique mechanical characteristics, oil field centrifuges differ from other forms of solids separation equipment, e.g. screens and hydrocyclones, which operate continuously on the full mud circulating volumes. Centrifuges operate intermittently on a small fraction of the circulating volume (usually 5 - 15%). The normal use of centrifuges in drilling operations is to remove colloidal size solids from weighted drilling muds, salvaging barite and avoiding excessive viscosity problems which can result from high colloidal content. The primary reason for utilizing centrifuges to process drilling fluid is to reduce mud management costs, compared with dilution and disposal costs. Centrifuges can be used in a number of ways to process the drilling fluid. With an increasing costs of drilling fluid systems, e.g. polymers and synthetics, a need for fluid phase recovery systems has resulted in increased usage of centrifuges based solely on the costs of the recoverable fluid. The decanting centrifuge is the most common type of centrifuge in use in drilling operations today and is the focus of this paper. This paper will discuss the various applications of decanting centrifuges. A review of the various applications and comparison with conventional performance measures will highlight the criteria needed to create a decision tree for optimizing the use of centrifuges in drilling operations. A decision tree will be presented to clarify novel centrifuge applications. New solids separation technologies for the optimization of drilling operations must be evaluated before a decision about their usage can be made. The centrifuge and solids separation options available indicate the capability to address a wide range of drilling fluids and drilling operations.

The complete system involves preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. The images correspond to three cases: SMD present (SMD), SMD not present with a speck of glue (GLUE), and SMD not present (noSMD). For each case, two images are collected using top and side illuminations but these are first combined into one image before proceeding to do further processing. Preprocessing is done by applying the wavelet transform to the images to expose details. Using 500 images for each of the three cases, various features are considered from different wavelet subbands, using one or several transform levels, to find four good discriminating parameters. Classification is performed sequentially using a two-level binary decision-tree. Two features are combined into a two-component feature vector and are fed into the first level that compares the SMD vs noSMD cases. The second level uses another feature vector produced by combining two other features and then compares the SMD and GLUE cases. The features used give no cluster overlap on the training set and simple parallelepiped classifier is devised at each level of the tree producing no errors on this set. Results give 99.6% correct classification when applied to a separate testing set consisting of 500 images for each case. All the errors are made at level 2 classifying six SMD images erroneously as GLUE.

Often just the expected value of the decision-tree is used to decide on the project: a positive expected value usually being a rationale for proceeding, a negative expected value being a rationale for not going ahead. Here we show that uncertainty on the expected value, also easily determinable from decision-tree analysis, is a major factor in evaluating the risk of going ahead with an exploration project. Reliance solely on the expected value can lead to decisions not to participate in exploration projects which have a relatively high risk but also a relatively good chance of being profitable - and this is particularly the case when the expected value is negative but much smaller in magnitude than the standard error in the expected value.

The two major behaviours, namely reactivity and goal-seeking behaviour, are learned from positively reinforced robot motions from a starting point with no rules, The learning emphasis is on the automatic generation of knowledge without human intervention with the robot being trained successively to generate knowledge increments In the form of vector entities.

We also demonstrate the feasibility of behavioural decomposition into behaviour-biased decision trees.

J	Maloof, MA; Michalski, RS				Maloof, MA; Michalski, RS			Learning symbolic descriptions of shape for object recognition in X-ray images	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article								In this paper we describe a method for learning shape descriptions of objects in X-ray images. The descriptions are induced from shape examples using the AQ15c inductive learning system. The method has been experimentally compared to k-nearest neighbor a statistical pattern recognition technique, the C4.5 decision tree learning program, and a multilayer feed-forward neural network. Experimental results demonstrate strong advantages of the Ae methodology over the other methods. Specifically the method has higher predictive accuracy and faster learning and recognition rates. Ae's representation language, VL(1), was better suited for this problem, which can be seen by examining the empirical results and the learned rules. The method was applied to the problem of detecting blasting caps in X-ray images of luggage. An intelligent system performing this detection task can be used to assist airport security personnel with luggage screening.

While HACCP is simple as an abstract system, the combination of HACCP and the manufacturing system becomes complex enough that a properly programmed computer can be usefully employed in building and maintaining a HACCP system. In particular, the computer can help build and maintain the HACCP required flow of materials diagrams. The computer can then diagram an organizational structure for storing and retrieving planning information. "Clicking" on the diagram provides access to hazard information, critical control point information and critical control point planning information. Embedding HACCP planning requirements into a computer program means the user does not have to remember every detail of HACCP. The computer can prompt for the hazard entry requirement, the critical control point decision tree, and the HACCP planning categories. Especially in companies with multiple products, making and maintaining HACCP plans becomes feasible with proper computer support. The record keeping requirement of HACCP means that a computer can help with on going HACCP applications as well. Data can be stored and retrieved, analyzed and printed by accessing it through the flow of materials diagram. Once collected it can be manipulated in other ways, such as the formulation of reports or the export of the data to other programs. A properly programmed computer can keep HACCP plans and HACCP records up-to-date, well organized, easy to find, easy to print and easy to use.

Climatic and land cover layers were either obtained from existing data bases or interpolated (kriged) from point data. Multiple stepwise logistic regression was used, together with principal components analysis, to obtain a first screening of variables. A spatial stochastic simulation was then used to further test the variables of this first model in order to deal with spatial correlation of the residuals. The variables selected in these stages were used in the decision tree analysis and a set of rules predicting the class of abundance of nesting pairs was obtained. Both the logistic regression and decision tree model were cross-validated using a jack-knife technique. Two more trees were successively produced by including abundance in the neighbouring squares among the predictors. A procedure to spatially weight error was also devised and models performances were compared using both spatial and non spatial error measures. The best overall performance was achieved by incorporating the spatial median of abundance in cells up to 25 km away from each case, among the predictors. Decision trees performed much better than logistic regression in the model development stage but only marginally better in the crossvalidation exercise.

These results are obtained by establishing connections between the decomposition problem and some extremal questions in hypergraphs. Let d, n less-than-or-equal-to 1 be integers. A d-elementary cell is a set D in-set-of R-n defined by a finite set of constraints f(i)(x) = 0, g(j)(x) greater-than 0 where f(i), g(j) are polynomials of degrees not exceeding d. For any set S in-the-set-of R-n, let K-d(S) be the smallest number of disjoint d-elementary cells that S can be decomposed into. It is easy to see that any degree-d (ternary) algebraic decision tree for solving the membership question of S must have size no less than K-d(S). Thus, any lower bound to K-d(S) yields also a lower bound the size complexity for the corresponding membership problem. Let A(n) = {x(1), x(2), ... x(n)/ x(i) less-than-or-equal-to 0}. A well-known result of Rabin states that any algebraic decision tree for the membership question of A(n) must have height at least n. In this talk we discuss a recent result by Grigoriev, Karpinski and Yao [GKY], which gives an exponential lower bound to K-d(A(n)) for any fixed d, and hence to the size of any fixed degree (ternary) algebraic decision tree for solving this problem. The proof utilized a new connection between K-d(A(n)) and the maximum number of minimal cutsets for any rank-d hypergraph on n vertices. We also discuss an improved lower bound by Wigderson and Yao [WY]. Open questions are presented.

J	Oreski, S; Glavic, P				Oreski, S; Glavic, P			A knowledge-based system for selection of phase equilibria models	HUNGARIAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CORRESPONDING-STATES; EQUATION	In this article an expert system called PHYP (PHYsical Properties) is described which aids engineers in the selection of an appropriate vapour-liquid equilibrium (VLE) method when performing various process calculations. Test examples demonstrate the ability of the expert system to solve problems from the field of phase equilibria in the shortest way without redundant questions to the user giving the results expected. PHYP was compared with the same purpose expert system CONPHYDE when solving, the same classification problems. For final solution, PHYP needs less user's assertions because of its smaller and more efficient decision tree. The expert system PHYP was generated by an automatic expert system shell, Assistant Professional. This way of building expert systems is much more efficient than development of a classic expert system like CONPHYDE which needs decision rules formulated by hand to be built into its inference network.

Such trees are next used to create Linearly Independent (LI) Decision Diagrams (LIDDs). There are 840 nonsigular expansions for a pair of variables, so number of nodes in such (exact) diagrams is never larger than that of trees with single-variable Shannon, Positive Davio, and Negative Davio expansions. The LI Diagrams are a starting point in a synthesis of multilevel AND/OR/EXOR circuits and can potentially achieve better results than the well-known Pseudo-Kronecker Functional Decision Diagrams. They introduce also other gates than AND and EXOR to the synthesis process.

This paper presents a tree-based modeling method for identifying fault-prone software modules, which has been, applied to a subsystem of the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System, JSTARS, a large tactical military system. We developed a decision tree model using software product metrics from one iteration of a spiral life cycle to predict whether or not each module in the next iteration would be considered fault-prone. Model results could be used to identify those modules that would probably benefit from extra reviews and testing, and thus, reduce the risk of discovering faults later on. Identifying fault-prone modules early in the development can lead to better reliability. High reliability of each iteration translates into a highly reliable final product. A decision tree also facilitates interpretation of software product metrics to characterize the fault-prone class. The decision tree was constructed using the TREED-ISC algorithm which as a refinement of the CHAID algorithm. This algorithm partitions the ranges of independent variables based on chi-squared tests with the dependent variable. In contrast to algorithms used by previous tree-based studies of software metric data, there is no restriction to binary trees, and statistically significant relationships with the dependent variable are the basis for branching.

The weights are determined by user in the view of importance in actual classification. In the proposed method, a triplet tree classifier for land cover classification is used. The triplet tree classifier has two types of nodes. It generates two nodes for 'definite nodes' and one optional 'indefinite node' at every node segmentation. Tree design procedure uses the weights in the two meanings. Firstly, significant categories are assigned with high priority in the selection of splitting patterns. Categories with higher priority are separated from other categories at the upper nodes. Secondly, a node for heavily weighted categories are designated with little classification error at every decision of boundaries. Experiment about real remotely sensed images was executed to show the performance of the proposed method. The results of classification were compared with the standard Bayesian classifier or other multistep methods. The classification accuracy about heavy weighted categories by this method is higher than a conventional classifier without weights. The computing cost for this method is small because this approach is based on a decision tree method.

Grafting is an inductive process that adds nodes to inferred decision trees. This process is demonstrated to frequently improve predictive accuracy. Superficial analysis might suggest that decision tree grafting is the direct reverse of pruning. To the contrary, it is argued that the two processes are complementary. This is because, like standard tree growing techniques, pruning uses only local information, whereas grafting uses non-local information. The use of both pruning and grafting in conjunction is demonstrated to provide the best general predictive accuracy over a representative selection of learning tasks.

We extract regions corresponding to cartographic features for the classes built-up area, forest, water and open area. Water and built-up area are extracted from the intensity image. The use of a DEM as additional source of information allows to distinguish built-up land and forest from all other classes. The mathematical tools for feature extraction from intensity and DEM data are fractal dimension estimation and mathematical morphology. The classification is done employing a decision tree.

This study shows that induced decision trees are useful for the analysis of the importance of clinical parameters and of their combinations for the evaluation of the severity of brain injury and for outcome prediction. Due to a small number of patient data available for this study the induced decision trees cannot yet be considered as a reliable prognostic tool. Nevertheless, meaningful regularities have been discovered that help in the analysis of this difficult prognostic task.

Attributes included age, sex and education plus responses to the Functional Activities Questionnaire, the Mini-Mental Status and Blessed Orientation, Memory and Concentration tests. The machine learning algorithms included decision tree learners (C4.5, CART), rule inducers (C4.5 Rules, FOCL) and naive Bayes. Stepwise logistic regression was used to compare results. The sample was randomly split into training and testing sets, and the results were validated over 30 runs. Although the Functional Activities Questionnaire has been used since 1980, the machine learning algorithms were the first to identify that a single attribute, measuring forgetfulness, equaled or exceeded the accuracy of any other scoring method of this test. Post hoc inspection of the odds ratios obtained by stepwise logistic regression confirmed this finding. The application of machine learning has identified an extremely simple, yet accurate screen for very mild dementia.

They are of significant chemical and commercial interest because of their use as lead compounds in the search for new pharmaceutical effecters. The interpretation of diterpene C-13 NMR-spectra normally requires specialists with detailed spectroscopic knowledge and substantial experience in natural products chemistry, more specifically knowledge on peak patterns and chemical structures. Given a database of peak patterns for diterpenes with known structure, we apply machine learning approaches to discover correlations between peak patterns and chemical structure. Backpropagation neural networks, nearest neighbor classification and decision tree induction are applied, as well as approaches from the field of inductive logic programming. Performance close to the one of domain experts is achieved, which suffices for practical use.

J	Dasari, RV; Moon, YB				Dasari, RV; Moon, YB			Analysis of part families for group technology applications using decision trees	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						decision trees; group technology; part families		Concurrent formation of part families and machine cells can be achieved by using various algorithms based on the part-machine matrix. Although, part features form the basis for the formation of the part-machine matrix, part features are not directly consider-ed in the process of forming part families and machine cells. The goal of this paper is to understand the characteristics of machine cells in terms of part features. The relationship between part features and machine cells is captured as a decision tree. The decision tree also becomes a tool for post-clustering analysis including evaluation of different clustering methods and for the classification of ambiguous parts. The simplicity of the decision tree, the number of parts classified by each leaf of the tree, and the effect of pruning on the tree are used as metrics to evaluate the clustering methods.

There is a well-known O(n lg n)-time comparison tree algorithm for solving this problem. Also, a tight Omega 2(n lg n) lower bound in the comparison tree model is known. We prove a tight Omega 2(n lg n) lower bound in the more powerful algebraic decision tree model. The above lower bounds also apply to the apparently simpler problem of finding the length of a longest increasing subsequence.

J	Branting, LK; Broos, PS				Branting, LK; Broos, PS			Automated acquisition of user preferences	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES			English	Article								Decision support systems often require knowledge of users' preferences. However, preferences may vary among individual users or be difficult for users to articulate. This paper describes how user preferences can be acquired in the form of preference predicates by a learning apprentice system and proposes two new instance-based algorithms for preference predicate acquisition: IARC and Compositional Instance-Based Learning (CIBL). An empirical evaluation using simulated preference behavior indicated that the instance-based approaches are preferable to decision-tree induction and perceptrons as the learning component of a learning apprentice system, if representation of the relevant characteristics of problem-solving states. requires a large number of attributes, if attributes interact in a complex fashion, or if there are very few training instances. Conversely, decision-tree induction or perceptron learning is preferable if there are a small number of attributes and the attributes do not interact in a complex fashion unless there are very few training instances. When tested as the learning component of a learning apprentice system used by astronomers for scheduling astronomical observations, both CIBL and decision-tree induction rapidly achieved useful levels of accuracy in predicting the astronomers' preferences.

J	Devlin, B; Burke, M				Devlin, B; Burke, M			Internet: The ultimate reference tool?	INTERNET RESEARCH-ELECTRONIC NETWORKING APPLICATIONS AND POLICY			English	Article						academic libraries; bibliographies; Internet; referencing		Analyzes the Internet as a reference tool based on its ability to provide rapid access to authoritative information or sources of information. Reveals that the Internet provides no comprehensive mechanism for identifying quality information. Bibliographic structure is also disparate, making it impossible to adopt a coherent strategy for identifying quality information. A unified service interface would help alleviate this problem. An analysis of the use of the Internet by academic librarians reveals that existing bibliographic structure is not used to best advantage. Simple strategies which would limit these deficiencies, such as the use of electronic mail, are not used. Suitable training, from an introductory to advanced level, would alleviate this problem. Suggests the use of an amended version of Benson's decision tree as a pedagogical tool. This model would help to decide when to use the Internet and suggest search paths for different question types.

Bayes' method offers the possibility of obtaining the revised probabilities by means of additional information, and to correct the subjective probabilities. The method is applied to the decision-making problem about new investments, with decision tree in ''prior'' and ''posterior'' analysis.

A set of sequence derived features, such as regions of high hydrophobicity, were used for each classifier. The methods compared were a structured probabilistic model specifically designed for the localization problem, the k nearest neighbors classifier, the binary decision tree classifier, and the naive Bayes classifier. The result of tests using stratified cross validation shows the Ic nearest neighbors classifier to perform better than the other methods. In the case of yeast this difference was statistically significant using a cross-validated paired t test. The result is an accuracy of approximately 60% for 10 yeast classes and 86% for 8 E.coli classes. The best previously reported accuracies for these datasets were 55% and 81% respectively.

The theoretical scenarios looked at a a-year period wherein the immediate surgery patients incurred costs for 2 years after surgery, whereas the waiting list patients incurred costs for 1 year before and 1 year after surgery. Outcome probabilities were defined and applied to each treatment group, as derived from the literature and expert opinion. Expenditures were derived from the literature, based on conservative estimates of predicted pre- and postsurgical behavior for each scenario. This analysis indicates the potential for both substantial savings in resources and improved patient outcome for immediate surgery over waiting lists. These savings would begin at the inception of the immediate surgery protocol. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the conclusion is valid over a wide range of expenditures and probabilities.

Is it possible to define a set of preference relations, one for each node of a decision tree, such that these preferences satisfy the reduction of compound lotteries axiom and dynamic consistency, and yet do not converge to expected utility? It is argued that updated preferences necessarily have one affine indifference curve but that other indifference curves are unrestricted. A connection is drawn to modelling ''reference points.''

Several office-based management strategies are considered: empiric therapy, use of dipstick analysis, use of complete urinalysis, and several strategies using office or laboratory cultures, METHODS. We constructed a decision tree using model probabilities obtained from the literature. Where published probabilities were unavailable, we used extensive sensitivity analyses. Utilities were obtained from the Index of Well-Being. We obtained costs by surveying hospitals, physicians, and pharmacies. RESULTS. The most cost-effective strategy is to treat empirically ($71.52 per quality-adjusted life month, QALM). When the cost of antibiotics exceeds $74.50 or if the prior probability of having a UTI is under 0.30, then treatment guided by the results of a complete urinalysis is preferred. While it was the preferred strategy, other strategies (complete urinalysis, culture and treat, and dipstick testing only) were associated with greater utility, The marginal cost-effectiveness of these strategies compared with empiric therapy ranged from $2964 to $48,460 per additional QALM, CONCLUSIONS. The preferred strategy of empiric therapy is robust over a wide range of sensitivity analyses, While empiric therapy is associated with the best cost-utility ratio, doing a culture yields the greatest utility at greater incremental cost per QALM. Many primary care physicians already treat UTls empirically with antibiotics. This study confirms that empiric therapy, while frowned upon by some, is a cost-effective strategy. Other strategies may be considered, but at greater marginal cost. Ultimately these findings need to be confirmed in clinical trials.

J	Wetzel, AW				Wetzel, AW			Computational aspects of pathology image classification and retrieval	JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING			English	Article						image retrieval; image classification; signature file; decision tree; feature selection; genetic algorithm; image processing; instruction set		We are investigating the role of high performance computing for support of a comprehensive pathology image atlas. The primary computing component is a database access mechanism providing retrieval by content based image matching (CBIR) along with traditional term based queries. An organization based on information theoretic and Bayesian principles using decision trees and signature files is being developed. The essential role of HPC is the discovery, selection, and optimization of medically useful image feature sets via genetic algorithm and simulated annealing methods. This paper outlines the problem area along with aspects of the underlying theoretical basis and distinguishing computing characteristics. Efficiency of key portions of the computations can be greatly improved by using parallelism within the computer word length using bit counting instructions to implement voting and multimedia style instruction sets for low level image processing.

J	Brasel, KJ; Borgstrom, DC; Weigelt, JA				Brasel, KJ; Borgstrom, DC; Weigelt, JA			Cost-utility analysis of contaminated appendectomy wounds	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th Annual Meeting of the Surgical-Infection-Society	APR 19-22, 1995	LOUISVILLE, KY	Surg Infect Soc			DECISION-ANALYSIS; PERFORATED APPENDICITIS; ABDOMINAL INCISIONS; MANAGEMENT; INFECTION; REDUCTION; CLOSURE; COMPLICATIONS; PROPHYLAXIS	BACKGROUND: The influence of patient preference and treatment costs has not been considered in previous analyses of wound management decisions for contaminated right lower quadrant incisions. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a decision and cost-utility analysis, conducting a MEDLINE search of the postappendectomy wound infection literature to establish assumptions and assign baseline probability estimates. Institution-specific cost data were obtained, and utility assignments were made by the authors. Studies used to assign baseline probabilities fulfilled the following criteria: perforated appendix or gangrenous appendicitis, use of perioperative antibiotics active against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and data stratified by wound management, operative findings, and infection rate. RESULTS: We constructed a decision tree comparing three methods of wound management for contaminated right lower quadrant incisions: primary closure, delayed primary closure, and secondary closure. Utility (a quality of life measure) was assigned to ultimate health states to incorporate patient preference. We calculated the cost-utility for each method of wound management and found that primary closure was of optimum cost-utility compared with delayed primary closure and secondary closure. To gain one quality-adjusted life year treating a population of patients with contaminated incisions, primary closure saves $22,635 over delayed primary closure and another $22,340 over secondary closure. This decision, tested by two-way sensitivity analyses, was sensitive only to high primary closure infection rates. CONCLUSIONS: Challenging traditional surgical dogma, cost-utility analysis shows that primary closure is the favored method of management for contaminated right lower quadrant incisions. This analysis is specific to right lower quadrant incisions and the conclusion is valid for all estimated primary infection rates less than 0.27.

Interdisciplinary research provides a new generation of computation tools in knowledge discovery and data management is in great demand. In this study, an expert-guided decision tree construction strategy is proposed to offer an user-oriented knowledge discovery environment. The strategy allows experts, based on their expertise and/or preference, to override inductive decision tree construction process. Moreover, by reviewing decision paths, experts could focus on subsets of data that may be clues to new findings, or simply contaminated cases.

J	Blum, A				Blum, A			Empirical support for Winnow and Weighted-Majority algorithms: Results on a calendar scheduling domain	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						Winnow; Weighted-Majority; multiplicative algorithms		This paper describes experimental results on using Winnow and Weighted-Majority based algorithms on a real-world calendar scheduling domain. These two algorithms have been highly studied in the theoretical machine learning literature. We show here that these algorithms can be quite competitive practically, outperforming the decision-tree approach currently in use in the Calendar Apprentice system in terms of both accuracy and speed. One of the contributions of this paper is a new variant on the Winnow algorithm (used in the experiments) that is especially suited to conditions with suing-valued classifications, and we give a theoretical analysis of its performance. In addition we show how Winnow can be applied to achieve a good accuracy/coverage tradeoff and explore issues that arise such as concept drift. We also provide an analysis of a policy for discarding predictors in Weighted-Majority that allows it to speed up as it learns.

We show, both theoretically and empirically, how the fragmentation problem adversely affects predictive accuracy as variation del (a measure of concept difficulty) increases. Applying feature-construction techniques at every tree node, which we implement on a decision tree inducer DALI, is proved to only partially solve the fragmentation problem. Our study illustrates how a more robust solution must also assess the value of each partial hypothesis by recurring to all available training data, an approach we name global data analysis, which decision tree induction alone is unable to accomplish. The value of global data analysis is evaluated by comparing modified versions of C4.5rules with C4.5trees and DALI, on both artificial and real-world domains. Empirical results suggest the importance of combining both feature construction and global data analysis to solve the fragmentation problem.

J	Phelps, CE				Phelps, CE			Good technologies gone bad: How and why the cost-effectiveness of a medical intervention changes for different populations	MEDICAL DECISION MAKING			English	Article						cost-effectiveness; biases; errors; resource use; utilities	DECISION-MAKING; CLINICAL-TRIALS; CARE; PROBABILITY; HEALTH	Cost-effectiveness (CE) ratios vary considerably, not only across interventions, but within single interventions. Using a simple decision-tree model of the treat-vs no-treat decision to organize the analysis, four potential errors leading to these within-treatment differences in CE ratios are identified. These errors arise from estimates relating to 1) prior probabilities of disease; 2) treatment. efficacies; 3) costs of treatment; and 4) patient preferences. Systematic biases, where present, suggest overuse of medical interventions. For diagnostic tests, two additional potential sources of error are considered (using a simple decision tree incorporating both test and treat decisions). These involve 5) sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test and 6) inappropriate choice of ''cutoff' to determine abnormal patients, in part arising from errors in estimating prior probability of disease.

The aim of this study was to apply image analysis methods on ultrasound images for discriminating liver cirrhosis from fatty liver infiltration and for grading hepatic disease, which is important in the management of the patients. Ultrasound images of histologically confirmed 18 livers with cirrhosis, 37 livers with fatty infiltration, and 24 normal livers of healthy volunteers were selected and were digitized for further computer processing. Twenty two textural features were calculated from small matrix samples selected from the ultrasound image matrix of the liver parenchyma. These features were used in the design a three level hierarchical decision tree classification scheme, employing the multilayer perceptron neural network classifier at each hierarchical tree level. At die first tree level, classification accuracy for distinguishing normal from abnormal livers was 93.7%, at the second level the accuracy for discriminating cirrhosis from fatty infiltration was 90.9%, and at the third level the accuracy in distinguishing between low and high grading liver cirrhosis or fatty infiltration was 94.1% and 84.9% respectively. The proposed computer software system may be of value to the radiologists in assessing liver parenchyma disease.

Data on both the direct (purely medical) and indirect (socioeconomic) costs were used. The determination of the effectiveness of therapy was derived from a clinical trial: therapy with Saccharomyces boulardii was shown to reduce the length of illness by approximately one day. Due to differences in rising treatment costs, two patient groups were studied: one consisting of adults and one of children from four to 14 years of age. For both patient groups a decision tree was designed, with the purpose of evaluating the direct and indirect costs. On the basis of both direct and overall costs, therapy with Saccharomyces boulardii showed an appreciable cost saving over lack of therapy. In terms of direct costs for the patient groups studied, a cost saving potential of 465.29 million DM could be reached. In terms of overall costs, therapy with Saccharomyces boulardii shows a cost saving of 1.95 billion DM. Therefore, while often considered a superficial disease, medical treatment of acute unspecified diarrhea has a not insignificant medical and socioeconomic relevance.

Of that cost most is not the price of the terminal but the integration of the terminals into platforms. Future cost of terminals will decrease as COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf), (Government Off-the-Shelf) and NDI Developmental Item) equipment are ushered in, but the integration cost will remain constant unless terminal vendors are funded to supply the best possible information to the integrator to accomplish a smooth platform installation for the warfighter. As budgets continue to shrink, the burden of integration falls on the end-user. Both the frustration level of not having the proper information and the cost of doing business must be reduced This paper examines the complexity of the problem and the ability of an RF Accessory Manual to reduce paper work, increase utilization of available COTS/GOTS/NDI RF ancillary equipment, allow for the proper installation of RF accessories for a particular application and reduce frustration by consolidating all the required information. An internet website can provide an interactive decision tree along with the latest list of accessories.

The series of spectral line occurences is mapped by a vector quantiser to a series of discrete states. Following this the feature vectors are classified using separate Hidden-Markov-Models (HMM) for each modulation type. The classification results for the modulation types ASK, BPSK, QPSK, 2FSK: MSK and CW, obtained from computer simulations, prove the robustness of the classifier. Furthermore, it clearly outperforms a decision-tree based classifier.

Today's users of computer systems are expanded to ordinary people, Furthermore, too much network accessible information resources in the form of various media increases rapidly everyday. The primary goal of the intelligent Multimedia Repository(IMR) is to assist users in accessing multimedia information efficiently, Primary users of the IMR are assumed to be novice users even though the system can be used for users at different levels of expertise, Users are not well-trained people in using computer systems. Thus, the semantic gap between users and the system must be mainly reduced from the system site. The technology of intelligent user interface is adopted to minimize the semantic gap. For the intelligent user interface of the IMR, a Human Computer Interaction(HCI) model has been devised, and the IUI for the IMR has been designed and developed. Machine learning technologies have been employed to provide user adaptation/intelligent capability to the sq-stem. The IUI of the IMR consists User Interface Manager(UIM), and User Model(UM). The UIM performs the function of managing intelligent user interface. The UM stores the behavioral knowledge of the user. The UM stores the history of query and response interactions to absorb communication errors due to semantic gaps between the user and the IMR. The UM is implemented by decision tree based Case-Based Reasoning(CBR) and back propagation neural networks. Experimental results show the IUI can improve the performance of the IMR.

The proposed method results in a tree-structured hybrid architecture. Due to constructive learning, the binary tree hierarchical architecture is automatically generated by a controlled growing process for a specific supervised learning task. Unlike the classic decision tree, the linear discriminant functions are merely employed in the intermediate level of the tree for heuristically partitioning a large and complicated task into several smaller and simpler subtasks in the proposed method. These subtasks are dealt with by component neural networks at the leaves of the tree accordingly. For constructive learning, growing and credit-assignment algorithms are developed to serve for the hybrid architecture. The proposed architecture provides an efficient way to apply existing neural networks (e.g. multi-layered perceptron) for solving a large scale problem. We have already applied the proposed method to a universal approximation problem and several benchmark classification problems in order to evaluate its performance. Simulation results have shown that the proposed method yields better results and faster training in comparison with the multi-layered perceptron.

Reducing classification to the problem of finding numerical dependencies we gain an opportunity to utilize powerful regression methods implemented in the PolyAnalyst data mining system. Resulting regression functions can be considered as fuzzy membership indicators for a recognized class. In order to obtain classifying rules, the optimum threshold values which minimize the number of misclassified cases can be found for these functions. We show that this approach allows one to solve the over-fit problem satisfactorily and provides results that are at least not worse than results obtained by the most popular decision tree algorithms.

An evaluation function is used to approximate the goodness of different partition candidates. Most existing methods for multisplitting on numerical attributes are based on heuristics, because of the apparent efficiency advantages. We characterize a class of well-behaved cumulative evaluation functions for which efficient discovery of the optimal multisplit is possible by dynamic programming. A single pass through the data sumces to evaluate multisplits of all arities. This class contains many important attribute evaluation functions familiar from symbolic machine learning research. Our empirical experiments convey that there is no significant differences in efficiency between the method that produces optimal partitions and those that are based on heuristics. Moreover, we demonstrate that optimal multisplitting can be beneficial in decision tree learning in contrast to using the much applied binarization of numerical attributes or heuristical multisplitting.

EDA has much in common with existing data mining techniques: its main objective is to help an investigator reach an understanding of the important relationships in a data set rather than simply develop predictive models for selected variables. Brief descriptions of a number of novel techniques developed for use in SNOUT are presented. These include heuristic variable level inference and classification, automatic category formation, the use of similarity trees to identify groups of related variables, interactive decision tree construction, and model selection using a genetic algorithm.

When such trees are used in a Datamining and Knowledge Discovery context, ease of interpretation of the resulting trees is an important requirement to be met. Decision trees with tests based on a single variable, as produced by methods such as ID3, C4.5 etc., often require a large number of tests to achieve an acceptable accuracy. This makes interpretation of these trees, which is an important reason for their use, disputable. Recently, a number of methods for constructing decision trees with multivariate tests have been presented. Multivariate decision trees are often smaller and more accurate than univariate trees; however, the use of linear combinations of the variables may result in trees that are hard to interpret. In this paper we consider trees with test bases on combinations of at most two variables. We show that bivariate decision trees are an interesting alternative to both uni-and multivariate trees, especially qua ease of interpretation.

In these algorithms different measures for time complexity of decision trees and different measures for uncertainty of decision tables are used.

Approaches proposed so far for mining classification rules for large databases are mainly decision tree based on symbolic learning methods. In this paper, we use artificial neural network to mine classification rules. We present a novel approach, called LBSB, composed of two phases to extract rules from artificial neural network and discover knowledge in databases. Some experiments have demonstrated that our method generates rules of better performance than the decision tree approach in noisy conditions.

The algorithm incorporates a Filter Bank (FB) which decomposes the ECG into subbands with uniform frequency bandwidths. The FB-based algorithm enables independent time and frequency analysis to be performed on the EGG. Various features are computed from the subbands to distinguish between between paced and non-paced beats. These features are computed in a very computationally efficient manner. A machine learning method is used to design a decision tree to be used in the classification process. The classification algorithms were tested on records from the MIT/BIH database. The paced beat classification algorithm has a sensitivity of 87.64 % and a positive predictivity of 90.97 %. The FB-based structure is useful for performing multiple ECG processing tasks using one set of preprocessing filters.

The fitness evaluation is based on minimizing the size of the network while maximizing the classification accuracy, which is tested on separate dataset. The neural networks are feed-forward, and are trained by fast variant of error back-propagation algorithm (Quickprop). The method was tested with some benchmark data sets and compared to results obtained by Bayesian, decision-tree and some other methods found in literature. Genetic optimization was found to be very competitive. The effects of the various biases of the fitness function to the network structure are reported.

Although classification has been studied extensively, few of the known methods take serious consideration of efficient induction in large databases and the analysis of data at multiple abstraction levels. This paper addresses the efficiency and scalability issues by proposing a data classification method which integrates attribute-oriented induction, relevance analysis, and the induction of decision trees. Such an integration leads to efficient, high-quality, multiple-level classification of large amounts of data, the relaxation of the requirement of perfect training sets, and the elegant handling of continuous and noisy data.

The method used is potentially applicable in many other areas where the expert knowledge is mainly based on practical experience and thus, at first sight, difficult to implement within an expert system. By attempting to use At technology in such an environment the number of fields where AI technology may be applied is considerably increased. The decision tree structure of the SVARNE system is one of the first attempts to give any structure to the knowledge in this area. The SVARNE project shows that it is possible to build an expert system in a field where much of the knowledge present is tacit/based on practical experience. In the project a method for knowledge acquisition which works in this type of environment has been obtained.

However, concepts learned by neural networks are very difficult to understand. Rule extraction can offer a promising perspective to provide a trained connectionist architecture with explanation power and validate its output decisions. In this paper, we present a novel approach, called LBSB, composed of two phases to extract rules from a three-layer backpropagation neural network with distributed representation. This approach combines learning and searching techniques together. Some experiments have demonstrated that the fidelity of the rules extracted from a neural network with distributed representations in our method is higher than that in conventional search-based methods, such as KT algorithms, and our method generates rules of better performance than the decision tree approach in noisy conditions.

This makes it difficult to use the experience in future developments. This picture is worse when dealing with a family of products. The lack of documentation on the design decisions may preclude coherent evolution and development of products. This paper presents a framework for representing and supporting design decisions in the development of product families. The information is structured as a DDT (Design Decision Tree), where nodes represent design decisions and branches relate nodes to each other. The access to this information is based on HTML and WWW navigators. A simple case study is presented in order to illustrate the approach and to show its feasibility.

Given N intersection points of a Jordan curve with the x-axis in the order in which they occur along the curve. The task is to sort these points into the order in which they occur along the x-axis. Contrary to general sorting whose solution (in the algebraic decision-tree model of computation) requires theta(N log N) time in the worst case, the Jordan sorting problem can be solved in theta(N) time. The linear worst-case time algorithms for Jordan sorting were proposed by Hoffman et sri., and by Fung et al. Unfortunately, both these algorithms are rather complicated, which makes them difficult to use in practice. In this paper, we propose and analyse a simple algorithm far Jordan sorting. Although the worst-case time complexity of this algorithm is O(N log N), we show that the worst time is achieved only for special inputs. For most inputs, a better performance can be expected We also show that for a certain class of inputs which may be of practical interest, the algorithm runs even in O(N) expected time. me believe that Tor many practical applications, the algorithm may be more advantageous than rather complicated worst-case time optimal algorithms. Our main result is the analysis of this otherwise rather straightforward algorithm.

The first, single tree clustering, combines all allophone states of all phones into a single tree. This can be used to improve performance for very small systems. The single tree clustering structure can also be exploited for speaker and channel adaptation and is shown to provide a 30% reduction in the error rate for an LVCSR task under matched channel conditions and a greater reduction under mismatched channel conditions. The second, tagged clustering, is a mechanism for providing additional information to the clustering procedure. The tags are labels for any of a wide variety of factors, such as stress, placed on the triphones. These tags are then accessible to the clustering process. Small improvements in recognition performance were obtained under certain conditions. Both methods can be combined.

The most common approach is to use triphones. Recently, several speech recognition groups have started investigating the use of larger phonetic context windows when building acoustic models. In this paper we discuss some of the computational problems arising from wide context modeling (polyphonic modeling) and present methods to cope with these problems. A two stage decision tree based polyphonic clustering approach is described which implements a. more flexible parameter tying scheme. The new clustering approach gave us significant improvement across all tasks - WSJ, SWB, and Spontaneous Scheduling Task - and across all languages involved (German, Spanish, English). We report recognition results based on the JANUS speech recognition toolkit [2, 8] on two tasks comparing acoustic context phenomena in English read versus spontaneous speech. We used our WSJ 60K recognizer and the JANUS SWB 10K polyphonic recognizer.

However, this requires detailed knowledge about the vocabulary, and transcribed training data. If portability to new topics and languages is important, then a topic spelter based on phoneme recognition is preferable [5]. A phoneme recognizer is nm on training data consisting of audio files labeled by topic alone - no word transcripts are required. Phoneme sub-sequences which help to predict the topic are then extracted automatically. The work described here was carried out by two teams exploring three very different approaches to phoneme-based topic spotting: the ''DP-ngram'', the ''decision tree'', and the ''Euclidean'' approach. Results obtained by each team on the ARM (Airborne Reconnaissance Mission) and Switchboard datasets were compared by means of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. The best performance for each team was obtained via a similar type of discriminative training.

An ensemble consists a set of independently trained classifiers (such as neural networks or decision trees) whose predictions are combined when classifying instances. Previous research suggests that an ensemble as a whole is often more accurate than any of the single classifiers in the ensemble. In this paper we evaluate Bagging and Boosting as methods for creating an ensemble of neural networks. We also include results from Quinlan's [19] decision tree evaluation of these methods. Our results indicate that the ensemble methods can indeed produce very accurate classifiers for some datasets, but that these gains may depend on aspects of the dataset. In particular we find that Bagging is probably appropriate for most problems, but when properly applied, Boosting may produce even larger gains in accuracy.

Several maintenance and monitoring alternatives have been developed which can mitigate this problem. EPRI sponsored a project to develop software (Generator Stator Winding Leak Decision Advisor, or SLEAK), which calculates the casts of various maintenance alternatives based on the probability of the leaks occurring, their severity, the capital cost of completing the winding leak repairs, and the consequential costs from the probabilities of sudden future failures. The program uses decision tree analysis for decision making and risk assessment.

The entire feature space is quantized into non overlapping regions where each region is bounded by a number of hyperplanes. Each region is characterized by the occurence of only a small number of the total alphabet of allophones (sub-phonetic speech units). By identifying the region in which a test feature vector lies, only the gaussians that model the density of allophones that exist in that region need be evaluated. The quantization of the feature space is done in a heirarchical manner using a binary decision tree. Each node of the decision tree represents a region of the feature space, and is further characterized by a hyperplane (a vector (v) under bar(n) and a scaler threshold value h(n)), that subdivides the region corresponding to the current node into two non-overlapping regions corresponding to the two children of the current node. Given a test feature vector, the process of finding the region that it lies in involves traversing this binary decision tree, which is computationally inexpensive. We present results of experiments that show that the gaussian computation time can be reduced by as much as a factor of 20 with negligible degradation in accuracy. We also examine issues of robustness to different environments.

These prescriptions were documented by sending a questionnaire to the doctors who had started the treatment. The ''appropriate-use'' of the drug was defined according to the reference texts available: the ''Autorisation de Mise sur le Marche'' (New Drug Approval : NDA), the ''Fiche de Transparence'' (positive clinical and economical guidelines) and the ''References Medicales Opposables'' (negative medical guidelines). A decision tree was drawn up on the bases of these criteria. The ceftriaxone prescriptions were splited up into 6 classifications, linked principally to the nature of the infection, the existence of risk or severity factors and the circumstances of the prescription : the first class corresponding to the cases explicitly set out by the NDA; 2 classes grouping prescriptions Linked to infections implicitly within the NDA's domain; 1 class regrouping the prescriptions which were considered to be appropriate after having been individually examined by an expert infectiologist; 1 class corresponding to the prescriptions which were inappropriate according to our references 1 class grouping all the cases that were impossible to classify. By definition, the above first four classes group together the prescriptions which were considered to be appropriate according to our references. The treated population was old (average 71.5 years old). On average, the prescribed dosage was 1.02 g in 1.03 injection by day for 6.6 days. 77.6 % of infections concerned lower respiratory tract infections; 7.9 % upper respiratory tract infections; 7.7 % urinary tract infections; 6.8 % other infections. In 20.4 % of the cases, the patient had more than 2 infections. The analyses of the prescriptions compared with the appropriate-use showed that a total of 78.0 % of ceftriaxone prescriptions were appropriate.

The concept of information gain is used as a heuristic function for performing this compression. IGTree produces trees that, compared to other lazy learning approaches, reduce storage requirements and the time required to compute classifications. Furthermore, we obtained similar or better generalization accuracy with IGTree when trained on two complex linguistic tasks, viz. letter-phoneme transliteration and part-of-speech-tagging, when compared to alternative lazy learning and decision tree approaches (viz., IB1, information-gain-weighted IB1, and C4.5). A third experiment, with the task of word hyphenation, demonstrates that when the mutual differences in information gain of features is too small, IGTree as well as information-gain-weighted IB1 perform worse than IB1. These results indicate that IGTree is a useful algorithm for problems characterized by the availability of a large number of training instances described by symbolic features with sufficiently differing information gain values.

J	Clark, DE				Clark, DE			Computational methods for probabilistic decision trees	COMPUTERS AND BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article							MODELS; DISTRIBUTIONS; SENSITIVITY	Decision tree models may be more realistic if branching probabilities (and possibly utilities) are represented as distributions rather than point estimates. However, numerical analysis of such ''probabilistic'' trees is more difficult. This study employed the Mathematica computer algebra system to implement and verify previously described probabilistic methods. Both algebraic approximations and Monte Carlo simulation methods were used; in particular, simulations with beta, logistic-normal, and triangular distributions for branching probabilities were compared. Algebraic and simulation methods of sensitivity analysis were also implemented and compared. Computation required minimal programming and was reasonably fast using Mathematica on a standard personal computer. This study verified previously published results, including methods of sensitivity analysis. Changing the input distributional form had little effect. Computation is no longer a significant barrier to the use of probabilistic methods for analysis of decision trees. (C) 1997 Academic Press.

By making use of machine learning techniques the features of the surface froths of flotation cells can be used to construct representations of the behaviour of a plant. Two probabilistic decision tree methods and a backpropagation neural net were all equally capable of classifying the different froths at least as well as a human expert. Explicit decision trees were derived, relating froth characteristics to froth surface structures. Relatively sharply clustered Sammon maps of froth structures were obtained, allowing good visualisation of multidimensional flotation data.

In computer vision and image analysis, graphs are often used for the representation of structured objects. For example, if the problem is to recognize instances of known objects in an image, then often models, or prototypes, of the known objects are represented by means of graphs and stored in a database. The unknown objects in the input image are extracted by means of suitable preprocessing and segmentation algorithms, and represented by graphs that are analogous to the model graphs. Thus, the problem of object recognition is transformed into a graph matching problem. In this paper, it is assumed that there is an input graph that is given on-line, and a number of model, or prototype, graphs that are known a priori. We present a new approach to subgraph isomorphism detection which is based on a compact representation of the model graphs that is computed off-line. Subgraphs that appear multiple times within the same or within different model graphs are represented only once, thus reducing the computational effort to detect them in an input graph. In the extreme case where all model graphs are highly similar, the run time of the new algorithm becomes independent of the number of model graphs. We also describe an extension of this method to error-correcting graph matching. Furthermore, an approach to subgraph isomorphism detection based on decision trees is proposed. A decision tree is generated from the models in an off-line phase. This decision tree can be used for subgraph isomorphism detection. The time needed for decision tree traversal is only polynomial in terms of the number of nodes of the input graph. Moreover, the time complexity of the decision tree traversal is completely independent on the number of model graphs, regardless of their similarity. However, the size of the decision tree is exponential in the number of nodes of the models. To cut down the space complexity of the decision tree, some pruning strategies are discussed.

J	Silver, DL; Hurwitz, GA				Silver, DL; Hurwitz, GA			The predictive and explanatory power of inductive decision trees: A comparison with artificial neural network learning as applied to the noninvasive diagnosis of coronary artery disease	JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE MEDICINE			English	Article						coronary artery disease; artificial intelligence; machine learning; artificial neural networks; inductive decision trees	ACUTE PULMONARY-EMBOLISM; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS; PERFUSION IMAGES; CLINICAL-DATA; EXERCISE; TL-201; SCINTIGRAPHY; IDENTIFICATION; INTELLIGENCE	Background: This paper compares two machine learning systems, an inductive decision tree (IDT) and a back-propagation neural network (ANN), in the noninvasive assessment of coronary artery disease given a set of diagnostic input attributes, A collection of 490 patient cases were accumulated from the reference of diagnostic stress myocardial scintigraphy performed in a nuclear medicine department. All cases had correlating angiography, the results of which were used to derive the target diagnoses, Input attributes included 4 baseline clinical characteristics, 4 nonimaging stress components, and 3 scintigraphic findings. Methods: We chose 4 possible angiographic criteria for coronary artery disease and assessed the ability of each learning system to develop a diagnostic model, The 2 machine learning systems were compared on the basis of predictive performance and explanatory power. Results: Cross-validation experiments showed the 2 machine learning systems to have equivalent predictive power at the same level as the clinical scan reading, For the 70% stenosis criterion, the IDT had a sensitivity of 94 +/- 3% (mean +/- 95% confidence interval) and a specificity of 59 +/- 8%, and the ANN had a sensitivity of 97 +/- 2% and a specificity of 51 +/- 13%. However the IDT system exhibited excellent explanatory power; producing simple representations of the diagnostic models which agree with previous research. Conclusion: In comparison with the more widely used ANNs, the IDT learning system may bring advantages to certain problems in diagnostic classification.

J	Allen, UD; Kirby, MA; Goeree, R				Allen, UD; Kirby, MA; Goeree, R			Cost-effectiveness of recombinant human erythropoietin versus transfusions in the treatment of zidovudine-related anemia in HIV-infected children	PEDIATRIC AIDS AND HIV INFECTION-FETUS TO ADOLESCENT			English	Article								The objectives of this study were to compare the costs and benefits of recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) relative to repeated transfusions in the treatment of zidovudine (AZT)-related anemia among HIV-infected children. The study was based on a tertiary care Canadian Pediatric Hospital Model. A decision analytic structure was used for the evaluation of cost-effectiveness. The decision tree involved two options. In option A:r-HuEPO, subjects receive r-HuEPO three times weekly at home for 1 year, whereas in B:no r-HuEPO, transfusions are given on a monthly basis in a medical short-stay unit over a 1-year period. Probabilities of various outcomes and downstream events were obtained from a literature review. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the health-care system and utilized standard cost-effectiveness methodology. The results indicated that for every child receiving r-HuEPO, the total cost is Can $11,245 for 1 year compared with $3,130 per year for those in B:no r-HuEPO. The incremental cost effectiveness of A:r-HuEPO relative to B:no r-HuEPO is $1,373 per transfusion episode averted. The order of magnitude of the results was not significantly affected by changes in any of the assumptions used for the cost estimates or baseline probability values.

J	Linusson, S				Linusson, S			Partitions with restricted block sizes, Mobius functions, and the k-of-each problem	SIAM JOURNAL ON DISCRETE MATHEMATICS			English	Article						decision tree; Mobius function; partitions		Given a list of n real numbers, one wants to decide whether every number in the list occurs at least k times. It will be shown that Omega(n log n) is a sharp lower bound for the depth of an algebraic decision or computation tree solving this problem for a fixed k. For linear decision trees, the coefficient can be taken to be arbitrarily close to 1 (using the ternary logarithm). This is done by using the Bjorner-Lovasz-Yao method, which turns the problem into one of estimating the Mobius function for a certain partition lattice. The method will work also for the more general T-multiplicity problem when T is additive and cofinite. A formula for the exponential generating function for the Mobius function of a partition poset with restricted block sizes in general will also be given.

The present study was done to evaluate ifa panel of morphologic and morphometric parameters of the thyroid and ploidy status, either alone or in combination, would help differentiate hyperplastic nodular goiters from follicular adenomas and carcinomas. STUDY DESIGN: Fine needle aspiration smears of 75 cases classified as follicular neoplasms of the thyroid were studied for morphologic (cellularity, colloid and cellular patterns) and morphometric parameters (nuclear diameters and nucleoli). RESULTS: Of the large number of parameters utilized in this study, only two of the cellular patterns (honeycomb and single dispersed) and the average maximum nuclear diameter showed trends in differentiating these lesions. CONCLUSION: Based on these patterns and nuclear diameter (9 mu m), we developed a decision tree classification that separated the benign from malignant lesions (follicular carcinomas) with a sensitivity and specificity of 92.8% and 57.4%, respectively.

This article rakes a first step in this direction by investigating the use of machine learning techniques for discovering knowledge in international conflict and conflict management databases. We have applied similarity-based case retrieval to the KOSIMO database of international conflicts. Furthermore, we present results of analyzing the CONFMAN database of successful and unsuccessful conflict management attempts with an inductive decision tree learning algorithm. The latter approach seems to be particularly promising, as conflict management events apparently are more repetitive and thus better suited for machine-aided analysis.

Patients and methods: Eighty-seven consecutive patients with pleural effusion caused by congestive heart failure (33), infection (33), and malignancy (21) comprised a derivation set of patients. Pleural fluid LDH activity and isoenzyme pattern were established in all patients and analyzed by the classification and regression trees (CART) method. An additional group of 20 consecutive patients comprised a validation set that was used for cross-validation of CART-derived decision tree. Results: A decision tree, with a positive predictive value of 83%, was constructed and validated by data from a validation set of patients. Conclusions: Pleural fluid LDH isoenzyme pattern may be helpful for the differential diagnosis of the most common causes of pleural effusions: congestive heart failure, infections, and malignancy.

To assess the place of zuclopenthixol acetate in the treatment of acute episodes of schizophrenia, a cost-consequence analysis was performed comparing this new medication with short-acting, injectable haloperidol. The perspective of the Quebec health care system was adopted. The study population comprised patients diagnosed with schizophrenia who experienced an acute episode of psychosis and who were treated with intramuscular (IM) haloperidol. The study assessed patients for 9 days after the start of treatment. The literature was the principal source of comparative data about the clinical outcomes of the two treatments. The total cost associated with zuclopenthixol acetate IM or haloperidol IM was modeled using a decision tree built around the number of IM injections required to achieve stabilization. To establish costs, expert panels were consulted and patients' files were reviewed for a sample of schizophrenic patients who had been hospitalized in a large psychiatric or general hospital subsequent to a visit to the emergency department and had received a short-acting IM neuroleptic drug. Only direct medical costs were considered. Because zuclopenthixol acetate was not on the market at the time of the study, the file review did not allow for a direct estimate of its related costs but did provide an account of haloperidol use. The literature shows that zuclopenthixol acetate is similar to haloperidol with respect to the control of psychotic episodes; however, zuclopenthixol acetate is associated with increased sedation and a lower incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms. Using the base-case estimate for the number of injections required for stabilization, the incremental cost of zuclopenthixol acetate 50 mg over haloperidol was $25.00 (1995 Canadian dollars) per patient at the psychiatric hospital and $21.00 per patient at the general hospital. The results were sensitive to the estimate of the number of injections and the number of minutes of nursing care required by agitated patients. Zuclopenthixol acetate resulted in cost savings over haloperidol if it permits a reduction of 25% in minutes of nursing care or if 85% of patients require 2 injections or less (45% requiring 1 injection and 40% requiring 2). However, whichever drug is used, the cost of the injectable neuroleptic represents a small fraction of the cost of care for acutely psychotic patients.

The technique involves defining strategies for comparison, choosing a time horizon, constructing a decision tree and model, selecting outcomes and assigning probabilities, taking into account the value of time, calculating the net clinical and cost outcomes, and performing sensitivity analysis. This technique and its utility for different populations,urd changing health care settings are illustrated for the decision of screening for mild thyroid failure with a thyroid-stimulating hormone assay at the periodic health examination. The strengths and limitations of decision analysis and future applications in endocrinology and metabolism are explored.

The expert system applies AI-based methods (e.g. object-oriented modeling, blackboard technique, fuzzy reasoning, decision tree) in incorporating data on external systems in order to support the control center operator in network operation. At present the expert system is in everyday use in several distribution utilities. The main contribution of the paper is to propose the expert system entity including advanced AI-based inference models. In addition to the inference models the novelty value is founded on the practical use of the expert system.

Screening consisted of a biennial mammography performed on ail women 50-65 years old. A marginal analysis including women 45-49 years old was also performed. With the aid of a decision tree model, the numbers of BC cases diagnosed through screening, BC cases missed by screening and false-positive BC cases were calculated. Costs were calculated by feeding local data into Markovian models and the cost-effectiveness ratio calculation was performed in a computer spread sheet. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted. Results were presented in ECUs of 1993. The cost-effectiveness ratio per avoided death is 115,500 ECUs and per saved life year 7,300 ECUs. Including women 45-49 years old in the programme raises this ratio to 229,000 and 9,400 ECUs respectively. The sensitivity analysis showed the efficacy of mammography, compliance of the programme and screening costs to be the more sensitive variables.

J	Bushofa, BMF; Spann, M				Bushofa, BMF; Spann, M			Segmentation and recognition of Arabic characters by structural classification	IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING			English	Article						Arabic character recognition; OCR; segmentation; feature extraction	MACHINE RECOGNITION; TEXT	Arabic characters differ significantly from other characters, such as Latin and Chinese characters, in that they are written cursively in both printed and handwritten forms, and consist of 28 main characters. However, most of their shapes change according to their position in the word. These shapes, together with some other secondaries, raise the number of classes to 120. Furthermore, some of these characters have the same shape but are distinguished by the presence of one, two or three dots above or below them. In this paper, words are first segmented into characters and secondaries are removed using newly developed algorithms. This reduced the number of classes to 32. Information about these secondaries, such as their number, position and type, is recorded and used in the final recognition stage. Features of the skeletonized character are used for classification using a decision tree. A recognition rate of 97.23% over a set of 4260 samples is achieved.

J	Mookerjee, VS; Mannino, MV				Mookerjee, VS; Mannino, MV			Redesigning case retrieval to reduce information acquisition costs	INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						case based systems; case retrieval algorithms; information costs; cost reduction; joint versus separate optimization	KNOWLEDGE	Retrieval of a set of cases similar to a new case is a problem common to a number of machine learning approaches such as nearest neighbor algorithms, conceptual clustering, and case based reasoning. A limitation of most case retrieval algorithms is their lack of attention to information acquisition costs. When information acquisition costs are considered, cost reduction is hampered by the practice of separating concept formation and retrieval strategy formation. To demonstrate the above claim, we examine two approaches. The first approach separates concept formation and retrieval strategy formation. To form a retrieval strategy in this approach, we develop the CRlc (case retrieval loss criterion) algorithm that selects attributes in ascending order of expected loss. The second approach jointly optimizes concept formation and retrieval strategy formation using a cost based variant of the ID3 algorithm (ID3(c)). ID3(c) builds a decision tree wherein attributes are selected using entropy reduction per unit information acquisition cost. Experiments with four data sets are described in which algorithm, attribute cost coefficient of variation, and matching threshold are factors. The experimental results demonstrate that (i) jointly optimizing concept formation and retrieval strategy formation has substantial benefits, and (ii) using cost considerations can significantly reduce information acquisition costs, even if concept formation and retrieval strategy formation are separated.

J	Lagacherie, P; Holmes, S				Lagacherie, P; Holmes, S			Addressing geographical data errors in a classification tree for soil unit prediction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article							INFORMATION-SYSTEM; DECISION-TREE; MODEL; VEGETATION	To derive efficient predictions from a learning set provided by a geographical information system (GIS) needs to take into account errors that occur because of the poor quality of source maps and error propagation through GIS procedures. Using classification tree analysis, our objective was to build an approach which could take these errors into account, and so provide robust prediction rules for mapping natural systems. Our application addresses soil unit predictions from topographical and geological data. The learning set is taken from a sample area located in a French Mediterranean valley in which a large scale soil survey was conducted. We propose a rule for only conserving, among the splits of an initially large classification tree, the ones that provide a significant gain of purity (i.e. precision of soil predictions). This rule needs an estimate of the standard error on the purity index. This is achieved by evaluating the errors in the learning set, and then studying their propagation through the classification tree. The severity of the rule can be adjusted according to a risk threshold defined by the user. Our results indicate that the new rule has a strong influence on classification tree size. Furthermore, comparison with actual soil maps indicates that this rule provides more robust predictions than a classical pruning technique used in classification tree analysis. The soil predictions we obtain provide a medium scale soil map.	INRA,LAB BIOMETRIE,MONTPELLIER 1,FRANCE	Lagacherie, P (reprint author), LAB SCI SOL,PL VIALA,F-34060 MONTPELLIER 1,FRANCE.

Design: Cost-effective analysis. Materials and Methods: We constructed a decision tree with three approaches for PE prevention: no intervention, US, and VCF. Probabilities in each subtree were taken from published data, Sensitivity analyses evaluated all assumptions, probabilities, and outcomes for effects on baseline conclusions. Results: US is more cost-effective than VCF, with a cost/PE prevented of $46,300 compared with $93,700. The strategies become equally cost-effective only when VCF are placed in the radiology suite and length of stay is greater than or equal to 2 weeks. Conclusions: US is the most cost-effective approach for PE prevention in high-risk trauma patients, VCF should be reserved for patients with an anticipated length of stay greater than or equal to 2 weeks who can safely have a filter placed in the radiology suite.

A clinical trial, Deprenyl and Alpha-Tocopherol Antioxidative Therapy of Parkinsonism (DATATOP), used a novel study end point: increase in parkinsonian disability to the extent that investigators determined the need for treatment with levodopa. We analyzed DATATOP results to learn if this operationally-defined end point could be reproduced from elements of the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) and other conventional clinical scales. Our analysis involved UPDRS, Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living (S-E ADL), and Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) scores when DATATOP subjects reached the study end point. Various UPDRS components were examined, including subscores measuring severity of impaired ADL, bradykinesia, postural instability and gait difficulty, tremor, and rigidity. Data from subjects reaching the end point were com pared with assessments of those DATATOP subjects who did not, matched for the same duration of enrollment. All measures showed subjects who reached the end point had significantly greater mean impairment than did controls, although the two groups had substantial overlap. Multivariate analysis by using conditional logistic regression suggested that the end point was determined more by functional (S-E ADL and the UPDRS ADL scores) than by clinical examination criteria. The method of classification and regression trees suggested a simple decision tree splitting, respectively, on S-E ADL, UPDRS ADL, H-Y score, and UPDRS ADL again, with an estimated overall misclassification probability of 18%. We conclude that the DATATOP end point cannot be fully reproduced from the traditional clinical measures, although it can give results that are consistent with these scales in a well-designed clinical trial.

Dementia itself must also be differentiated as to cause, as in certain cases reversible conditions may he responsible. This article examines the clinical process of such differentiation, providing a decision tree for diagnosis and a summarizing algorithm for thinking through individual cases, with a focus on the most frequent cause of dementia, Alzheimer's disease. Also outlined are the stages of Alzheimer's disease, with the admonition that variations from the expected progression may represent a dementia diagnosis other than Alzheimer's disease or the co-occurrence of some other contributing factors.

J	Heger, AS; White, JE				Heger, AS; White, JE			Using influence diagrams for data worth analysis	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Article							DECISION-ANALYSIS	Decision-making under uncertainty describes most environmental remediation and waste management problems. Inherent limitations in knowledge concerning contaminants, environmental fate and transport, remedies, and risks force decision-makers to select a course of action based on uncertain and incomplete information. Because uncertainties can be reduced by collecting additional data, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques have received considerable attention. When costs associated with reducing uncertainty are considered in a decision problem, the objective changes; rather than determine what data to collect to reduce overall uncertainty, the goal is to determine what data to collect to best differentiate between possible courses of action or decision alternatives. Environmental restoration and waste management requires cost-effective methods for characterization and monitoring, and these methods must also satisfy regulatory requirements. Characterization and monitoring activities imply that, sooner or later, a decision must be made about collecting new field data. Limited fiscal resources for data collection should be committed only to those data that have the most impact on the decision at lowest possible cost. Applying influence diagrams in combination with data worth analysis produces a method which not only satisfies these requirements but also gives rise to an intuitive representation of complex structures not possible in the more traditional decision tree representation. This paper demonstrates the use of influence diagrams in data worth analysis by applying to a monitor-and-treat problem often encountered in environmental decision problems.

J	John, TJ				John, TJ			An ethical dilemma in rabies immunisation	VACCINE			English	Article						rabies vaccine; decision tree; safety	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; VACCINES	Rabies continues to be an important public health problem in India and many other developing countries. In India, annually some 700,000 persons are given post-exposure vaccine prophylaxis using Semple (sheep brain) vaccine. It is manufactured by government institutions and given free to the public. It is presumed to be cheap, although the actual cost of production may not be low. However, it is not a safe vaccine as it causes demyelinating central or peripheral nervous system side-effects in 1/3000-7000 persons vaccinated; this adverse reaction is occasionally fatal. Cell culture rabies vaccines are also available in India; unlike the Semple vaccine they are safe and can be used for pre-exposure vaccination, but they are more expensive. The dilemma is whether it is ethically acceptable to continue to use the Semple vaccine in humans while safer products are available. What is urgently needed is a decision tree which would enable economical use of cell culture vaccines together with the backing of professional bodies in medical practice, who will declare that cost is not the only factor in choosing a rabies vaccine - safety is also of paramount importance. We must also strive to reduce the cost of cell culture vaccines. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.		John, TJ (reprint author), CHRISTIAN MED COLL & HOSP,VELLORE 632004,TAMIL NADU,INDIA.

In this report we will describe the detailed structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies that led to the discovery of a potent series of butenolide ET(A) selective antagonists. Starting from a micromolar screening hit, PD012527, use of Topliss decision tree analysis led to the discovery of the nanomolar ET(A) selective antagonist PD155080. Further structural modifications around the butenolide ring led directly to the subnanomolar ET(A) selective antagonist PD156707, IC50's = 0.3 (ETA) and 780 nM (ET(B)). This series of compounds exhibited functional activity exemplified by PD156707. This derivative inhibited the ET(A) receptor mediated release of arachidonic acid from rabbit renal artery vascular smooth muscle cells with an IC50 = 1.1 nM and also inhibited the ET-1 induced contraction of rabbit femoral artery rings (ET(A) mediated) with a pA(2) = 7.6. PD156707 also displayed in vivo functional activity inhibiting the hemodynamic responses due to exogenous administration of ET-1 in rats in a dose dependent fashion. Evidence for the pH dependence of the open and closed tautomerization forms of PD156707 was demonstrated by an NMR study. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the closed butenolide form of PD156707 shows the benzylic group located on the same side of the butenolide ring as the gamma-hydroxyl and the remaining two phenyl groups on the butenolide ring essentially orthogonal to the butenolide ring.

J	Sadowski, DC; Rabeneck, L				Sadowski, DC; Rabeneck, L			Gastric ulcers at endoscopy: Brush, biopsy, or both?	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY			English	Article							HELICOBACTER-PYLORI INFECTION; TRIPLE THERAPY; DIAGNOSTIC-ACCURACY; CONTROLLED TRIAL; FOLLOW-UP; CYTOLOGY; MALIGNANCY; CANCER; ERADICATION; CARCINOMA	Objectives: All gastric ulcers discovered at endoscopy are potentially malignant. Concurrent use of both histological biopsy and cytological brushing has been advocated as a means of increasing the diagnostic yield for neoplasia at the time of initial endoscopy. The purpose of this analysis was to determine the impact of these diagnostic strategies on the cost-effectiveness of detecting malignancy in patients with a gastric ulcer. Methods: The diagnostic performance of biopsy and brushings in detecting gastric malignancy was estimated from a metaanalysis of published reports, Nondiscounted direct costs were determined from patient resource consumer profiles from the perspective of a Canadian hospital. A decision tree was used to compare diagnostic strategies (biopsy alone, brushing alone, or biopsy and brushing) in a hypothetical cohort of patients found to have a gastric ulcer at endoscopy. Effectiveness was expressed as diagnostic days saved. Results: No strategy achieved dominance. The brushing strategy was the most cost-effective, but its cost-effectiveness ratio was only slightly lower than that of biopsy. Cost differences between the biopsy and brushing strategies were small (less than $6 per case), performing both biopsy and brushing slightly improved the true-positive rate but resulted in a doubling of the false-positive rate, which in tuna led to unnecessary laparotomies. The impact of the high false-positive rate was also seen in the incremental cost of performing both brushings and biopsy ($168-$423 per case). Conclusions: For gastric ulcers discovered at endoscopy, the preferred strategy is to perform either cytological brushing or histological biopsy. The previously recommended strategy of performing both cytological brushing and histological biopsy should be reconsidered.

As far as these authors are aware, this is the first published work to describe the application of the ILP tool Golem to separation science. An outline of the theory of ILP is given, together with a description of Golem and previous applications of ILP. The advantages of ILP over classical machine induction techniques, such as the Top-Down-lnduction-of-Decision-Tree family, are explained. A case-study is then presented in which Golem is used to induce rules which predict, with a high accuracy (82%), whether each of a series of attempted separations succeed or fail. The separation data was obtained from published work on the attempted separation of a series of 3-substituted phthalide enantiomer pairs on (R)-N-(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)phenylglycine.

Computer-based empirical learning systems based on classical and nonparametric statistics, connectionist models, machine learning methods, and fuzzy logic are described. An original method for inducing fuzzy rules from input-output data is presented. Performance comparisons of the various approaches are summarized, along with the relative intelligibility of the outputs. In both respects, the decision-tree approach was found to perform very well on the problem investigated.

J	Helmbold, DP; Schapire, RE				Helmbold, DP; Schapire, RE			Predicting nearly as well as the best pruning of a decision tree	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th Annual Conference on Computational Learning Theory	JUL 05-08, 1995	SANTA CRUTZ, CA			decision trees; pruning; prediction; on-line learning	ALGORITHM	Many algorithms for inferring a decision tree from data involve a two-phase process: First, a very large decision tree is grown which typically ends up ''over-fitting'' the data. To reduce over-fitting, in the second phase, the tree is pruned using one of a number of available methods. The final tree is then output and used for classification on rest data. In this paper, we suggest an alternative approach to the pruning phase. Using a given unpruned decision tree, we present a new method of making predictions on test data, and we prove that our algorithm's performance will not be ''much worse'' (in a precise technical sense) than the predictions made by the best reasonably small pruning of the given decision tree. Thus, our procedure is guaranteed to be competitive (in terms of the quality of its predictions) with any pruning algorithm. We prove that our procedure is very efficient and highly robust. Our method can be viewed as a synthesis of two previously studied techniques. First, we apply Cesa-Bianchi et al.'s (1993) results on predicting using ''expert advice'' (where we view each pruning as an ''expert'') to obtain an algorithm that has provably low prediction loss, but that is computationally infeasible. Next, we generalize and apply a method developed by Buntine (1990, 1992) and Willems, Shtarkov and Tjalkens (1993, 1995) to derive a very efficient implementation of this procedure.

Cysteamine is a recently licensed orphan drug used to treat the inherited metabolic disease cystinosis. The drug delays the onset of renal failure in cystinotic patients and may provide many other significant health benefits. This study examined the cost-effectiveness of the administration of cysteamine to cystinotic patients prior to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Method. Decision-tree analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis. Cost data were estimated from current clinical charges and Medicare public-access reports. Life expectancy outcomes were derived from both published and unpublished clinical studies and from the U.S. Renal Data System. Results. Cysteamine therapy can extend the life of kidneys and delay renal transplantation, thereby increasing life expectancy for patients with cystinosis. Patients receiving cysteamine therapy prior to renal failure have lifetime-treatment drug costs of $234,000, in comparison with $238,000 for those who are not medicated. Costs of cysteamine therapy are offset by savings associated with delaying transplantation and costs of dialysis. Conclusions. Use of the orphan drug cysteamine both improves health outcomes and reduces health care costs for patients with cystinosis.

J	Patel, NV; Sethi, IK				Patel, NV; Sethi, IK			Video shot detection and characterization for video databases	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						video databases; shot detection; MPEG; chi-square; motion classification; single feature decision trees	DESIGN	The organization of Video information for video databases requires segmentation of a video into its constituent shots and their subsequent characterization in terms of content and camera work In this paper, we look at these two steps using compressed video data directly. For shot detection, we suggest a scheme consisting of comparing intensity, row, and column histograms of successive I frames of MPEG video using the chi-square test. For characterization of segmented shots, we address the problem of classifying shot motion into different categories using a set of features derived from motion vectors of P and B frames of MPEG video. The central component of the proposed shot motion characterization scheme is a decision tree classifier built through a process of supervised learning. Experimental results using a variety of videos are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of performing shot detection and characterization directly on compressed video.

The proofs rely on standard Ramsey-theoretic arguments that simplify the structure of the computation by restricting the input domain. The transformation of comparison model lower bounds, which are usually easier to obtain, to the parallel-random-access-machine, unifies some known lower bounds and gives new lower bounds for several problems.

Isolation has been recommended for all patients suspected to have tuberculosis even though the feasibility and the cost of this recommendation can be substantial. We have developed a classification tree using clinical and radiographic data from 277 isolation episodes in patients admitted between August 1992 and March 1994 who required isolation for suspicion of tuberculosis. The classification tree was developed with a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100% by binary recursive partitioning to predict those patients who are unlikely to require isolation. The predictor variables were upper zone disease on chest radiograph, a history of fever, weight loss, and CD4 count. The tree was validated in a separate cohort of 286 isolation episodes between April f994 and December 1995. In this validation cohort, no erroneous prediction was made of not isolating a patient with active pulmonary tuberculosis. The classification tree had a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 92.5 to 100%), a specificity of 48.1% (95% CI: 43.8 to 52.4%), and a negative predictive value of 100% (95% CI: 98.5 to 100%). We estimate that the use of the tree could have reduced the number of patients requiring isolation by more than 40% without increasing the risk of cross infection.

J	Furnkranz, J				Furnkranz, J			Pruning algorithms for rule learning	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						pruning; noise handling; inductive rule learning; inductive Logic Programming		Pre-pruning and Post-pruning are two standard techniques for handling noise in decision tree learning. Pre-pruning deals with noise during learning, while post-pruning addresses this problem after an overfitting theory has been learned. We first review several adaptations of pre- and post-pruning techniques for separate-and-conquer rule learning algorithms and discuss some fundamental problems. The primary goal of this paper is to show how to solve these problems with two new algorithms that combine and integrate pre- and post-pruning.

Methods. The forum was instructed to evaluate the economic costs of the commonly used forms of prophylaxis of thrombo-embolism in patients undergoing hip replacement surgery in South Africa, looking at shortterm events only. The methods used for the prophylaxis of thrombo-embolism in South Africa were determined by a postal survey. A decision tree was constructed to determine the events that will occur after a clinical decision to use no prophylaxis. The probabilities of these events were then determined. Protocols for and costs of prophylaxis and treatment were established. With the decision tree and these costs, the cost of the various modalities of prophylaxis was then determined. Results. The probability, determined by the forum, of developing a deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) when no prophylaxis is used was 0.5, with a mortality rate of 2.1%, The cost of this decision was R875, No prophylaxis given, but a venogram performed on day 7, reduced the mortality rate to 0.7%; however, this cost R3 017. The cost of low-molecular-weight heparin was R1 223 (probability 0.26, mortality rate 1.1%), while unfractionated heparin with a graduated compression stocking (GCS) cost R1 351 (probability 0.24, mortality rate. 1%). Aspirin with a GCS cost R777 (probability 0.35, mortality rate 1.5%). Conclusions. The use of some form of prophylaxis against DVT formation in patients undergoing elective hip replacement in South Africa is mandatory, as all the methods commonly used reduced the mortality. The use of no prophylaxis but with screening for DVT at day 7 - 10 is not justified as it is very expensive. Aspirin in combination with a stocking is the cheapest form of prophylaxis, but does not reduce the prevalence of DVT and does not reduce mortality sufficiently to be clinically effective. The heparins (possibly in combination with stockings) appear to be most cost-effective but cost between R350 and R500 more per patient than when no prophylaxis is used.

The material consisted of 123 primary teeth from 98 Danish children aged 9-108 months (mean age 33.5 +/- 19.7 months) at the time of injury. The specimens were analyzed by means of light and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Data from the clinical investigation and from predetermined ranked parameters from the histological analysis were processed in a computerized inductive analysis program. The results, describing patterns of co-variation, are presented as a decision tree. The most common diagnosis was intrusion luxation (54%). In 41% of all teeth, the degree of obliteration was less than 1/4 of the pulpal lumen. In most cases (79%), no denticles were visible. When present, 80% of the denticles had a bone-like appearance. Tissues occluding the pulpal lumen were either dentin-like (49%), bone-like (19%), or fibrotic (9%). It could be concluded that these varying responses could not be correlated with explicit clinical diagnoses. However, in certain combinations, histological parameters could be correlated to clinical findings.

Although the WHO has endorsed a policy df universal vaccination of all elderly people, the economic aspects of such a policy have not been determined. Using a decision tree framework, this paper examines the cost effectiveness of Various strategies of pneumococcal vaccination for the elderly in The Netherlands. For Various age categories, the economic attractiveness of the vaccination of ail individuals as well as the Vaccination of only those individuals with a specific disease has been calculated. We conclude that, allowing for some uncertainty regarding key variables such as the Vaccine efficacy and the hospital admission rate, the vaccination of all individuals above the age of 65 years is comparable in terms of cost-effectiveness to many existing health care interventions. The vaccination of individuals above the age of 55 years with chronic lung disease or chronic heart disease is similarly attractive from an economic point of view, as is the vaccination of individuals above the age of 65 years with diabetes mellitus.

In terms of accuracy, we show that the decision tree technique exceeds other more sophisticated techniques, such as multilayer neural networks. Furthermore, because of the ease with which decision tree results can be interpreted (logical classification rules), new methodologies can be readily developed to further assist in analyzing complex data that mix heterogeneous features. In this paper, we illustrate such capabilities in the context of different complex diagnostic and/or prognostic problems in tumor pathology relating to bladder, astrocytomas, and adipose tissues.

The therapies compared were androgenic hormone inhibition (finasteride) and alpha-blockade (doxazosin, prazosin and terazosin). This was a cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of the US military. The 36-month decision-tree model considered the aforementioned drugs as initial therapy for BPH following an unsuccessful period of watchful waiting. Therapy was continued toward a successful response. All patients who did not respond to therapy received secondary interventions, including transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The main outcome measures were clinical effectiveness and incurred costs. A Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis was performed on all cost-effectiveness ratios. The model and sensitivity analysis supported prazosin as the most cost-effective alpha-blocker over finasteride: the mean difference was $US381.65 (1994 values) per successfully treated patient, with a range of $US57.83 to $US675.53, in favour of prazosin. If prazosin was used as initial drug therapy after watchful waiting for a man over 50 years of age with classical symptoms of prostatism and no other severe or confounding comorbid conditions, a cost of $US578.15 per treatment could be expected, with clinical effectiveness of 70.3%. Patients who cannot tolerate prazosin should be considered for terazosin therapy before moving on from alpha-blockers. Subsequent treatment with finasteride would cost $US1426.53, with an additional clinical effectiveness of 9.9%. For the small number of patients who fail both therapies, the cost effectiveness of a first TURF as 'third-line' intervention [$US4321.36 for an additional effectiveness of 8.62% and a repeat TURF as 'fourth-line' ($US7650.53 for 0.59%) intervention] was calculated in a similar manner. Costs were cumulative, and effectiveness was derived from the total number of patients who started prazosin therapy. Pharmacological therapy was more cost effective than surgical intervention, and alpha-blockers were more cost effective than finasteride. Among the alpha-blockers, prazosin was by far the most cost effective followed by terazosin, then doxazosin.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From a database of 504 women selected to receive BCT, those developing probably benign microcalcifications within 3 years of BCT received close follow-up with mammography. Patients developing fewer than four probably benign microcalcifications more than 3 years after treatment were offered mammography or biopsy. If microcalcifications appeared malignant or patients developed four or more microcalcifications after 3 years, biopsy was performed. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (29 breasts [5.7%]) developed microcalcifications confined to the lumpectomy site. Fifteen patients (15 breasts) developed microcalcifications within 3 years of BCT and were followed up with mammography. Thirteen patients (14 breasts) developed microcalcifications confined to the lumpectomy site after more than 3 years. Among the latter group, microcalcifications appeared malignant in four breasts, and biopsy specimens revealed three recurrences. The remaining 10 breasts were followed up with mammography. No patient undergoing mammographic follow-up without biopsy has had clinical evidence of local failure throughout the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Follow-up mammography is an option when benign-appearing microcalcifications develop at the lumpectomy site depending on time of appearance and number; it is the primary recommendation when these microcalcifications develop within 3 years after treatment.

Rabin's principle asserts that the depth of any algebraic decision tree, recognizing a closed orthant in R-n, is no less than n. Using the techniques of Newton polyhedra, we give the shortest possible proof of this fact, extending it to arbitrary collections of open or closed orthants, and apply it to trees distinguishing real polynomials having at least iota real roots.

The efficiency of a segmentation-based coding scheme heavily relies on this step that defines how many and which regions have to be segmented. In this paper, we show that this problem carl be formulated as a rate/distortion problem. The proposed solution not only controls the segmentation, but also defines the coding strategy to be used in each region. Together with the general approach, several simplified versions of the segmentation control are proposed and discussed.

Considerable skill is required to analyse the consistency of different data in the report and to consider influences on the data. When performed throughout the day, such analysis is time-consuming and uncertain. We therefore decided to use a computer-assisted validation system, Valab-Biochem(R). Its decisions result from a decision tree based primarily on the intrinsic consistency of the data, validation ranges and patients' sex, age and hospital ward. Three hundred randomly chosen reports were simultaneously submitted to Valab-Biochem and to five biologists in order to analyse the computer's findings. The sensitivity of Valab-Biochem was 80% compared to biologists' consensus decision, which was taken as the gold standard. The specificity was 78%. This system provided autonomous assessment of the reports and could be used as an initial screen to assist biologists and focus attention on potentially inconsistent reports.

A decision tree analysis was performed on data from the charts of 108 patients who had undergone stress echocardiography without contrast enhancement as part of a cardiac function or wall-motion study. An analysis of a theoretical cohort of patients was conducted to determine shifts in cost associated with enhancement of stress echocardiography with perflenapent emulsion. Outcome was determined by the point at which the clinician was able to determine a treatment course for the patient based on the diagnostic information given. Stress echocardiography without contrast was identified as the most cost-effective path in terms of a conclusive test. Perflenapent emulsion shows a positive cost impact in patients who have had an inconclusive stress echocardiogram without the use of a contrast agent. These results are supported by a sensitivity analysis across a wide range of pricing for perflenapent emulsion, a wide range of cost for a stress echocardiogram, and up to 99% efficacy of contrast-enhanced stress echocardiography.

J	Samouelian, A				Samouelian, A			Frame-level phoneme classification using inductive inference	COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE			English	Article							RECOGNITION	This paper proposes a novel approach to frame-level classification by the use of inductive inference (decision trees). The proposed system (Samouelian, 1994a) uses the C4.5 induction system (Quinlan, 1993, 1996) to capture the knowledge about the structure and characteristics of the speech signal explicitly from the database. The decision tree is generated automatically from the training speech database. The database contains labelled examples in the form of a feature vector and its corresponding label for each frame. The feature vector may consist of any number of different feature sets and the label may be at the phoneme, sub-word or word level. This approach allows the integration of features from existing signal processing techniques that are currently used in stochastic modelling such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), and acoustic-phonetic features, which have been the cornerstone of traditional knowledge-based techniques. The aim of this research is to demonstrate that induction systems can provide a viable alternative automatic speech recognition technique by allowing the combination of features from any of the above feature representations to achieve optimum classification. Using C4.5, the results on five experiments are reported. The first four experiments use a small corpus of Australian English consonants (plosives, liquids and nasals) and four different feature sets, and they report on frame-level classification results for speaker-dependent and independent modes. The fifth experiment uses the TIMIT database and the mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) feature set and reports on frame-level classification results for speaker-independent experiments on the training data and test data.

J	Hartung, R				Hartung, R			Updated patient information for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia: A permanent challenge	EUROPEAN UROLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Patient Outcome Research: Success Criteria in BPH Management at Meeting of the European-Association-of-Urology	SEP 01-02, 1996	PARIS, FRANCE	European Assoc Urol		benign prostatic hyperplasia; decision tree; information; treatment		Ideally, a decision analysis should be performed in order to provide patient information and enhance decision-making procedures in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The steps associated with a decision analysis include creating a decision tree, identifying decision alternatives, quantifying the potential outcomes and weighing the potential outcomes according to the patients' requirements. However, doctors have their own individual experience and information on treatment from a wide variety of sources e.g. journals, conferences, the industry etc. Patients, in contrast, are informed by the popular media, friends and relatives etc. Updated patient information for the treatment of BPH therefore remains a permanent challenge. Each patient also has an individual acceptance of his symptoms, an individual tolerance to therapy according to his performance status, and an individual approach to medication or to surgery, whilst the doctor has novel experience with new drugs and instrumental procedures, his own individual availability of treatment options, and must always take the cost-effectiveness of a treatment into consideration.

J	Baldwin, JF; Lawry, J; Martin, TP				Baldwin, JF; Lawry, J; Martin, TP			A mass assignment based ID3 algorithm for decision tree induction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article								A mass assignment based ID3 algorithm for learning probabilistic fuzzy decision trees is introduced. Fuzzy partitions are used to discretize continuous feature universes and to reduce complexity when universes are discrete but with large cardinalities. Furthermore, the fuzzy partitioning of classification universes facilitates the use of these decision trees in function approximation problems. Generally the incorporation of fuzzy sets into this paradigm overcomes many of the problems associated with the application of decision trees to real-world problems. The probabilities required for the trees are calculated according to mass assignment theory applied to fuzzy labels. The latter concept is introduced to overcome computational complexity problems associated with higher dimensional mass assignment evaluations on databases. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Three different parameters (current, mass, and resistance) are collected simultaneously. Then these laboratory measurements are used by an algorithm software as a logged data file, resulting in to inducing a decision tree. Later, a systematic software is designed based on the rules derived from this decision tree, to recognize the type of unknown solution used in the experiment. This is a new approach to data acquisition in chemical industries involving conducting polymers.

J	Nease, RF; Owens, DK				Nease, RF; Owens, DK			Use of influence diagrams to structure medical decisions	MEDICAL DECISION MAKING			English	Article						decision analysis; influence diagrams; decision tree; decision techniques; cost-effectiveness analysis	CANCER; LIFE	Influence diagrams are compact representations of decision problems that are mathematically equivalent to decision trees. The authors present five important principles for structuring a decision as an influence diagram: 1) start at the value node and work back to the decision nodes; 2) draw the arcs in the direction that makes the probabilities easiest to assess; 3) use informational arcs to specify which events will have been observed at the time each decision is made; 4) ensure that missing arcs reflect intentional assertions about conditional independence and the timing of observations; and 5) ensure that there are no cycles in the influence diagram. They then build an influence diagram for the problem of staging non-small-cell lung cancer as an illustration. Influence diagrams offer several strengths for structuring medical decisions. They represent graphically and compactly the probabilistic relationships between parameters in the model. Influence diagrams also allow the model to be structured in a fashion that eases the necessary probability assessments, regardless of whether the assessments are based on available evidence or on expert judgment. Influence diagrams provide an important complement to decision trees, especially for representing probabilistic relationships among variables in a decision model.

J	Lopez, RE; Aubagnac, JP				Lopez, RE; Aubagnac, JP			The lightning activity of a hailstorm as a function of changes in its microphysical characteristics inferred from polarimetric radar observations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article							DOPPLER RADAR; THUNDERSTORMS; HAIL; ICE; ELECTRIFICATION; PRECIPITATION; STORMS; WATER	The progression of cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity in an Oklahoma hailstorm with well-developed supercell organization is related to changes in the microphysical characteristics of the storm as inferred from polarimetric radar observations. A decision tree based on the observed values of radar reflectivity Z(H), differential reflectivity Z(DR), and specific differential phase K-DP is used to identify regions in the storm containing graupel, hail, supercooled liquid water, and rain. Mixing ratios of graupel/hail and liquid water are obtained in terms of Z(H), Z(DR), and K-DP. One of the objectives of the study is to relate the development of graupel aloft, and the descent of graupel and hail, to fluctuations in CG lightning production. The results indicate that the development of graupel above the freezing level is related to the overall increase and decrease in the production of CG flashes (probably by providing the negative charge necessary for the flashes). However, it is the fluctuating descent of small hail below the height of the negatively charged graupel region that is correlated with the three or four pulses in the CG lightning activity (apparently by producing the electric bias needed for the discharge of the graupel layers aloft).

J	Beals, R				Beals, R			Equivalence of binary and ternary algebraic decision trees	ALGORITHMICA			English	Article						decision trees; complexity theory		Two models of algebraic decision trees have been studied. The binary model allows queries of the form ''is p(x(1),..., x(n)) less than or equal to 0?'', while in the ternary model the value of the query polynomial is compared with zero and one of three possible answers (<,=,>) is returned, each answer leading to a distinct subtree. It is straightforward to simulate a ternary tree with a binary tree at a cost of doubling the size and depth of the tree. However, no simulation in the other direction was previously known. Indeed, Grigoriev ei al. [4] have recently shown that if the degree of the query polynomials is bounded by a constant, then there exist binary decision trees for which such a simulation necessarily entails an exponential increase in size. We show that a binary algebraic decision tree T can be converted to a ternary algebraic decision tree T' at the expense of a quadratic increase in size and a linear increase in depth.

BRITISH JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE			English	Article						asthma diagnosis; peak flow; bronchial hyperresponsiveness	AIRWAY HYPERRESPONSIVENESS; SYMPTOMS; HISTAMINE; ASTHMA; BRONCHODILATOR	Background. Assessing bronchial hyper-responsiveness (BHR) is a main diagnostic criterion of asthma. Provocation testing is not readily available in general practice, but peak expiratory flow (PEF) is. Several guidelines promote the use of PEF variability as a diagnostic tool for BHR. This study tested the agreement between histamine challenge testing and PEF variability, and the consequences for diagnosing asthma Aim. To investigate the possibility of assessing BHR by PEF variability, using a histamine provocation test as a reference. Method. Subjects with signs or symptoms indicating asthma (persistent or recurrent respiratory symptoms or signs of reversible bronchial obstruction) (n = 323) were studied. They had been identified in a population screening for asthma. A histamine provocation test and PEF variability were assessed over a three-week period Asthma was defined as signs or symptoms together with a reversible airflow obstruction or BHR to the histamine challenge test. BHR was defined as a PC20 histamine of less than or equal to 8 mg/ml or a PEF variability of greater than or equal to 15%. Overall correlation between PC20 and PEF variability was calculated using Spearman's rho. Furthermore, a decision tree was constructed to clarify the role of BHR in diagnosing asthma. Results. Thirty-two patients had a reversibility in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of greater than or equal to 9% predicted, 131 patients showed a PC20 of less than or equal to 8 and 11 patients had a PEF variability of greater than or equal to 15%. Overall correlation was poor at only -0.27 (P < 0.0001). One hundred and fourteen of the 131 patients diagnosed as having asthma when the histamine challenge test was used were not diagnosed by PEF variability. Conclusion. PEF Variability cannot replace bronchial provocation testing in assessing BHR. This indicates that PEF variability and bronchial provocation do not measure the same aspects of BHR. If BHR testing is required in diagnosing asthma, a bronchial provocation test has to be used in general practice as well.

J	Craven, MW; Shavlik, JW				Craven, MW; Shavlik, JW			Understanding time series networks: A case study in rule extraction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article							NEURAL NETWORKS	A significant limitation of neural networks is that the representations they learn are usually incomprehensible to humans. We have developed an algorithm, called TREPAN, for extracting comprehensible, symbolic representations from trained neural networks. Given a trained network, TREPAN produces a decision tree that approximates the concept represented by the network. In this article, we discuss the application of TREPAN to a neural network trained on a noisy time series task: predicting the Dollar-Mark exchange rate. We present experiments that show that TREPAN is able to extract a decision tree from this network that equals the network in terms of predictive accuracy, yet provides a comprehensible concept representation. Moreover, our experiments indicate that decision trees induced directly from the training data using conventional algorithms do not match the accuracy nor the comprehensibility of the tree extracted by TREPAN.

J	Martin, JK				Martin, JK			An exact probability metric for decision tree splitting and stopping	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						pre-pruning; post-pruning; hypergeometric; Fisher's Exact Test	INDUCTION; BIAS	ID3's information gain heuristic is well-known to be biased towards multi-valued attributes. This bias is only partially compensated for by C4.5's gain ratio. Several alternatives have been proposed and are examined here (distance, orthogonality, a Beta function, and two chi-squared tests). All of these metrics are biased towards splits with smaller branches, where low-entropy splits are likely to occur by chance. Both classical and Bayesian statistics lead to the multiple hypergeometric distribution as the exact posterior probability of the null hypothesis that the class distribution is independent of the split. Both gain and the chi-squared tests arise in asymptotic approximations to the hypergeometric, with similar criteria for their admissibility. Previous failures of pre-pruning are traced in large part to coupling these biased approximations with one another or with arbitrary thresholds; problems which are overcome by the hypergeometric. The choice of split-selection metric typically has little effect on accuracy, but can profoundly affect complexity and the effectiveness and efficiency of pruning. Empirical results show that hypergeometric pre-pruning should be done in most cases, as trees pruned in this way are simpler and more efficient, and typically no less accurate than unpruned or post-pruned trees.

A decision-tree model over 6 months was constructed using an expert panel. The analytic perspective was that of the Ontario Ministry of Health as payor for all direct costs, which were derived from standard lists and included the cost of the drug as well as those for medical care, laboratory services, hospitalisation and managing adverse events. Success and dropout rates were determined from a meta-analysis of published randomised controlled trials. Medline, Embase, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts were searched from 1984 to 1996, as were references from retrieved articles and reviews. Inpatients and outpatients were analysed separately. SSRIs were used as backup therapy for patients receiving venlafaxine and TCAs, and SNRIs were used as backup therapy for patients receiving SSRIs. Pharmacoeconomic outcomes were expected cost per success, expected cost per symptom free day (SFD), and incremental cost per success and per SFD. The meta-analysis identified 56 treatment arms from 36 randomised controlled trials involving 2953 patients (2380 outpatients and 573 inpatients). SNRIs had the highest success rates. The respective costs (in 1996 $Can; $Canl = $US0.74) for outpatients and inpatients are given below. The expected costs per success were $6044 and $17 234 for venlafaxine, $6634 and $20 874 for SSRIs, and $9035 and $20 459 for TCAs in outpatients and inpatients, respectively. The respective expected costs per SFD were $45.92 and $127.31 for venlafaxine, $51.64 and $157.04 for SSRIs, and $70.71 and $152.43 for TCAs. Venlafaxine was dominant for all incremental pharmacoeconomic analyses. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were robust for outpatients but somewhat sensitive for inpatients.

The identification is carried out in two steps. The first step distinguishes groups of bacteria by following a decision tree with general identification tests. The second step in the identification is the distinction of species within a group on the basis of biochemical fermentation patterns. During grouping, probabilities for test failure are used. These probabilities can be used for assessing the quality of a given test answer. The probabilities are also used to select the most probable test answer in cases where the test result is inconclusive. The probabilities of test failure were determined by a group of experts and a group of potential users of the identification system. During species identification, similarity indices are calculated for all bacteria in a group. The described identification system has the ability to "learn" from different sessions in the species identification step, improving both identification speed and accuracy. Because of the versatile way in which the system is set up, it can very easily be expanded with identification keys to other organisms. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

The first data set contains three types of milk (from cow, goat and ewe) and the second data set contains two types of olive oils (adulterated and extra virgin). The performance of FuRES is compared with a selection of well-known classification algorithms: backpropagation artificial neural networks (ANNs), canonical variates analysis (CVA), classification and regression trees (CART), the K-nearest neighbour method (KNN) and discriminant partial least squares (DPLS). In terms of percent correct classification the DPLS and ANNs were best since all test set objects in both data sets were correctly classified, FuRES was second best with 100% correct classification for the milk data set and 91% correct classification for the olive oil data set, while the KNN method showed 100% and 61% for the two data sets. CVA had a 100% correct classification for the milk data set, but failed to form a model for the olive oil data set. The percent correct classifications for the CART method were 92% and 74%, respectively. When both model interpretation and predictive ability are taken into consideration, we consider that the ranking of these methods on the basis of these two data sets is in order of decreasing utility: DPLS, FuRES, ANNs, CART, CVA and KNN.

These arrhythmias are responsible for a large number of hospitalizations at a significant cost to the healthcare system, Electrical cardioversion (EC) is the most common nonpharmacologic intervention used to convert atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter to normal rhythm, Electrical cardioversion is highly successful in converting patients to normal rhythm; however, it is more traumatic and resource intensive than pharmacologic treatment, Recently, a new rapid-acting drug, ibutilide, was approved for the conversion of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Ibutilide is administered through intravenous infusion and does not require anesthetization of the patient, as is required for EC. A decision-tree model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of ibutilide therapy compared with EC therapy, Clinical outcomes were based on a phase III trial of ibutilide, and resource use was based on the literature and physician clinical judgment. A stepped conversion regimen of first-line ibutilide followed by EC for patients who fail to convert is less expensive and has a higher conversion rate than first-line EC, Sensitivity analysis shows that our results are robust to changes in cost and effectiveness estimates.

J	Kallmes, DF; Kallmes, MH				Kallmes, DF; Kallmes, MH			Cost-effectiveness of angiography performed during surgery for ruptured intracranial aneurysms	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article						aneurysm, cerebral; cerebral angiography; economics	DIGITAL SUBTRACTION ANGIOGRAPHY; DECISION-ANALYSIS; MALFORMATIONS; MANAGEMENT; MORBIDITY; HISTORY; STROKE	PURPOSE: To calculate the incremental cost-utility ratio for routine angiography performed during surgery for ruptured cerebral aneurysms. METHODS: Decision-tree and Markov analyses based on a cohort simulation were used to determine the incremental cost-utility ratio of routine intraoperative angiography versus no angiography. Input data from the literature were estimated for the following variables: frequency of unexpected aneurysmal rests and branch artery occlusions; annual rate of rehemorrhage of partially clipped aneurysms; prevalence of clinically relevant infarction resulting from branch artery occlusion; efficacy of clip repositioning; morbidity associated with intraoperative angiography; morbidity and mortality associated with aneurysmal rehemorrhage; sensitivity of intraoperative angiography for aneurysmal rests; and costs of intraoperative angiography, added duration of surgery, ischemic cerebral infarction, aneurysmal rehemorrhage, and rehabilitation. Sensitivity analyses were performed for all relevant input variables. A societal perspective was used, and cost-utility ratios less than $50 000/quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained were considered acceptable. RESULTS: Baseline input variables resulted in an acceptable cost-utility ratio for routine intraoperative angiography ($19 000/QALY). The input variables with greatest influence on the cost-utility ratio were frequency of branch artery occlusions, angiographic morbidity, and cost of angiography. However, the cost-utility ratio remained acceptable even over wide ranges of these input variables. Frequency of unexpected partially clipped aneurysms, efficacy of clip repositioning, and costs of stroke, rehemorrhage, and rehabilitation had relatively little impact on the analysis. CONCLUSION: Routine intraoperative angiography is cost-effective if performed in a manner consistent with low morbidity in a patient cohort harboring at least some unexpected branch artery occlusions that, if uncorrected, would result in clinically relevant cerebral infarctions.

Many expert systems in business, engineering, and medicine have benefited from sequential decision technology. In this survey, we unify the disparate literature on sequential decision models to improve comprehensibility and accessibility. We separate formulation of sequential decision models from solution techniques. For model formulation, we classify sequential decision models by objective (cost minimization versus value maximization) knowledge source (rules, data,belief network, etc.), and optimized form (decision tree, path, input order). A wide variety of sequential decision models are discussed in this taxonomy. For solution techniques, we demonstrate how search methods and heuristics are influenced by economic objective, knowledge source, and optimized form. We discuss open research problems to stimulate additional research and development.

J	Forouraghi, B				Forouraghi, B			Inductive learning of materials performance indices from a material properties database	MATERIALS EVALUATION			English	Article						data mining; databases; decision tree classifiers; machine learning; material properties; nondestructive testing; software		Assessment of materials performance in engineering design and manufacturing is a complex process that requires significant knowledge of scientific and engineering principles. In a typical design application, for instance, determination of how a material's performance indices such as fatigue resistance, corrosion resistance, and formability are affected by its physical properties is a laborious task. Expert system technology has been able to partially address this issue by transferring domain specific expertise and heuristics from human experts into knowledge based systems that can precisely communicate materials knowledge to their users. Traditional expert systems, however, are limited from the standpoint that acquisition of their needed operational knowledge from human experts, who may not even exist in some particular applications, is a time consuming process which is at best subjective and prone to error. In this paper, we present a new approach where ID3-type decision tree classifiers extract the material selection knowledge from a properties database and present it to designers in the form of generalizations. One of the important features of decision trees is their ability to deal with unknown and/or imprecise training information. We also show how receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves can be used for describing the performance of a parametric family of decision tree classifiers.

J	Ravi, B				Ravi, B			Intelligent design of gating channels for casting	MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								A systematic and integrated approach to automate the design of gating channels for casting is presented. The type of gating system and the layout of gating channels are selected by a set of rules stored in a knowledge base. A decision tree incorporating a conflict resolution mechanism has been developed to compute various parameters of the gating system and view the effect of changing a particular parameter on others. Simplified simulation of molten metal impingement, flow, and filling in the mould is carried out, followed by quantitative assessment of the entire gating system using a set of sixteen criteria. This approach enables rapid modification of the gating design and if necessary, the casting design, to achieve the required quality and yield. The results of the program developed in this investigation are presented for a three-dimensional model of a valve casting.

Data used in the study are from 132 patients diagnosed as having AI by automated electrocardiograph analysis. Their ECGs show an abnormal Q-wave (or QS complex) or small R progression in leads V-1 and V-2. However, 66 of them are diagnosed as old AI from the history, physical examination, echocardiogram and other laboratory data, whereas the other 66 are not. The network is trained with the data from half of the AI and non-infarction patients, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy rate is then tested with the remaining 66 patients (33 infarction, 33 non-infarction) who have not been exposed to the network. The neural network correctly identifies 90.2% of the patients with AI and 93.3% of the patients without infarction. The neural network is capable of diagnosing anterior wall myocardial infarction better than a computer electrocardiograph.

METHODS: Decision tree and Markov analyses that used cohort simulation were conducted to determine the incremental cost:benefit ratio of routine postsurgical angiography. Input data for unexpected partially clipped and unclipped cerebral aneurysms were estimated from the literature for the following variables: frequency; annual rate of subsequent hemorrhage; morbidity and mortality rates of subsequent hemorrhage; efficacy and morbidity and mortality rates of subsequent surgery; and costs of subsequent surgery, angiography, subsequent hemorrhage of aneurysm, and rehabilitation. RESULTS: Baseline input variables resulted in an acceptable cost:benefit ratio for routine postsurgical angiography. However, essentially all of the benefit was derived from intervening in cases of unexpected unclipped aneurysms rather than partially clipped aneurysms. Isolated instances of angiography and subsequent surgery for unexpected partially clipped aneurysms yielded unacceptable cost:benefit ratios. Surgical costs had minimal effect on the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: When routine postsurgical angiography was performed primarily to diagnose and to subsequently operate on unexpected partially clipped aneurysms, the cost:benefit ratio was unacceptable. However, even low frequencies of unexpected unclipped aneurysms resulted in favorable cost:benefit ratios.

J	Griggs, BJ; Parnell, GS; Lehmkuhl, LJ				Griggs, BJ; Parnell, GS; Lehmkuhl, LJ			An air mission planning algorithm using decision analysis and mixed integer programming	OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article								This paper describes the development of an air mission planning algorithm for the Joint Stochastic Warfare Analysis Research (JSTOCHWAR). The overall problem scope was to develop an algorithm to handle major factors bearing on the combat mission planning problem while providing hook-ups for the JSTOCHWAR architecture. Other aspects of the problem included finding the appropriate level of detail, developing a fast solving technique, and attempting to use existing data. The problem was handled by using some ideas from existing aircraft allocation algorithms and by adding some new techniques. The proposed air mission planning algorithm supplies the optimum degree of force for campaign objectives by using a mixed integer program (MIP) to allocate the optimum number and type of aircraft and munitions against each target. The MIP takes advantage of the force multiplying effects of mass and mutual support through its use of strike packages with air defense suppression and air-to-air escort aircraft. Additionally, a decision tree algorithm determines the best plan in light of the uncertainties of weather and weather forecasts. This air mission planning algorithm omits many of the details in the actual aircraft tasking process, but in its continuous variable version, provides fast, nearly optimal solutions that should approximate real-world tasking results.

J	Friedl, MA; Brodley, CE				Friedl, MA; Brodley, CE			Decision tree classification of land cover from remotely sensed data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							CONTERMINOUS UNITED-STATES; CANOPY REFLECTANCE; DATA SET; VEGETATION; CLIMATE; ALGORITHMS; SELECTION; INDUCTION; SCIENCE; MODELS	Decision tree classification algorithms have significant potential for land cover mapping problems and have not been tested in detail by the remote sensing community relative to more conventional pattern recognition techniques such as maximum likelihood classification. In this paper, we present several types of decision tree classification algorithms and evaluate them on three different remote sensing data sets. The decision tree classification algorithms tested include an univariate decision tree, a multivariate decision tree, and a hybrid decision tree capable of including several different types of classification algorithms within a single decision tree structure. Classification accuracies produced by each of these decision tree algorithms are compared with both maximum likelihood and linear discriminant function classifiers. Results from this analysis show that the decision tree algorithms consistently outperform the maximum likelihood and Zi-near discriminant function classifiers in regard to classification accuracy. In particular the hybrid tree consistently produced the highest classification accuracies for the data sets tested. More generally, the results from this work show that decision trees have several advantages far remote sensing applications by virtue of their relatively simple, explicit, and intuitive classification structure. Further, decision tree algorithms are strictly nonparametric and, therefore, make no assumptions regarding the distribution of input data, and are flexible and robust with respect to nonlinear and noisy relations among input features and class labels.

In many decision problems they are multidimensional, and their performance is expressed in a mixture of verbal statements and physical or monetary values. We propose to use the scores of cardinal methods for multicriteria decision analysis in order to represent the relative performance of the outcomes. Thereafter, we evaluate the chance forks in the tree via the corresponding aggregation procedure: in the Multiplicative AHP via weighted geometric means of the scores and in SMART via weighted arithmetic means. The procedure is based on the idea that the numerical values of verbal quantifiers like somewhat more, more,... do not depend on what we compare, whether it is relative importance or relative likelihood.

Most of the existing methods in literature are based on crisp concepts that are weak in handling marginal cases. In this paper, we present a fuzzy inductive learning method that integrates the fuzzy set theory into the regular inductive learning processes. The method converts a decision tree induced from regular method into a fuzzy decision tree in which hurdle values for splitting branches and classes associated with leaves are fuzzy. Results from empirical tests indicate that the new fuzzy approach outperforms the popular discriminant analysis and ID3 in predictive accuracy. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

A decision tree simulating the sequence of medical interventions and health states in chronic spasticity following stroke was developed based on a Delphi Panel survey including 13 German neurologists. The economic parameters were derived from direct medical costs incurred by the health service payer in Germany. The panel estimated that the average extent of improvement in spasticity with botulinum toxin A plus physiotherapy, as measured by the Ashworth scale, was three times greater than for baclofen plus physiotherapy and 10-fold greater than for physiotherapy alone. Total direct medical costs associated with the three strategies did not differ markedly. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for botulinum toxin A plus physiotherapy versus physiotherapy alone was around DM3000 per additional unit of improvement on the Ashworth scale.

Choosing between design-based and model-based sampling strategies for soil (with discussion)	GEODERMA			English	Editorial Material						sampling; geostatistics; soil science; spatial interpolation	SPATIAL INTERPOLATION; NUTRIENT CONSTITUENTS; VARIABILITY; VARIOGRAMS; INFORMATION; ALFISOL; SCHEMES; LOESS	Classical sampling theory has been repeatedly identified with classical statistics which assumes that data are identically and independently distributed. This explains the switch of many soil scientists from design-based sampling strategies, based on classical sampling theory, to the model-based approach, which is based on geostatistics. However, in design-based sampling, independence has a different meaning and is determined by the sampling design, whereas in the model-based approach it is determined by the postulated model for the process studied. Design-based strategies are therefore also valid in areas with autocorrelation. Design-based and model-based estimates of spatial means are compared in a simulation study on the basis of the design-based quality criteria. The simulated field consists of four homogeneous units that are realizations of models with different means, variances and variograms. Performance is compared for two sample sizes (140 and 1520) and two block sizes (8 x 6.4 km(2), 1.6 x 1.6 km(2)). The two strategies are Stratified Simple Random Sampling combined with the Horvitz-Thompson estimator (STSI, t(HT)), and Systematic Sampling combined with the block kriging predictor(SY, t(OK)). Point estimates of spatial means by (SY, t(OK)) were more accurate in all cases except the global mean (8 x 6.4 km(2) block) estimated from the small sample. In interval estimates on the other hand, p-coverages were in general better with the design-based strategy, except when the number of sample points in the block was small. Factors that determine the: effectiveness and efficiency of the two approaches are the type of request, the interest in objective estimates, the need for separate unique estimates of the estimation variance for all points or subregions, the interest in valid and accurate estimates of the estimation or prediction variance, the quality of the model, the autocorrelation between observation and prediction points, and the sample size. These factors will be assembled in a decision-tree that can be helpful in choosing between the two approaches. Models can also be used in the design-based approach. They describe the population itself, whereas in the model-based approach they describe the data generating processes. Errors in such models result in less accurate estimates, but the estimated accuracy is still valid. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Li, DC; Wu, CS; Torng, KY				Li, DC; Wu, CS; Torng, KY			Using an unsupervised neural network and decision tree as knowledge acquisition tools for FMS scheduling	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE			English	Article							ADAPTIVE RESONANCE; SYSTEM; PATTERNS; RULES	This paper applies neural network learning techniques and a decision tree method to obtain scheduling knowledge for flexible manufacturing systems. A search is made for the reverse relationship between the FMS system performance and its corresponding decision parameters. More specifically, the learning function is to acquire the scheduling knowledge which determines the decision-mix to control adequately the system in fulfilling a specified system performance. This paper first configures a typical flexible manufacturing system and defines a set of decision parameters along with a set of system performance evaluation criteria. The learning procedure initiates accumulating simulated data through the system. Next, the ART2 (adaptive resonance theory) neural model takes the system performance data as inputs and forms performance classes according to their similarities. Finally, the decision tree construction method is applied to extract the definition of each class. The definitions are converted into rule-type knowledge associated with certainty factors, and used as the scheduling knowledge.

J	Amit, Y; Geman, D				Amit, Y; Geman, D			Shape quantization and recognition with randomized trees	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							NEURAL NETWORKS; CHARACTER-RECOGNITION; NEOCOGNITRON; CLASSIFIERS; RESPONSES; POSITION	We explore a new approach to shape recognition based on a virtually infinite family of binary features (queries) of the image data, designed to accommodate prior information about shape invariance and regularity. Each query corresponds to a spatial arrangement of several local topographic codes (or tags), which are in themselves too primitive and common to be informative about shape. All the discriminating power derives from relative angles and distances among the tags. The important attributes of the queries are a natural partial ordering corresponding to increasing structure and complexity; semi-invariance, meaning that most shapes of a given class will answer the same way to two queries that are successive in the ordering; and stability, since the queries are not based an distinguished points and substructures. No classifier based on the full feature set can be evaluated, and it is impossible to determine a priori which arrangements are informative. Our approach is to select informative features and build tree classifiers at the same time by inductive learning. In effect, each tree provides an approximation to the full posterior where the features chosen depend on the branch that is traversed. Due to the number and nature of the queries, standard decision tree construction based on a fixed-length feature vector is not feasible. Instead we entertain only a small random sample of queries at each node, constrain their complexity to increase with tree depth, and grow multiple trees. The terminal nodes are labeled by estimates of the corresponding posterior distribution over shape classes. An image is classified by sending it down every tree and aggregating the resulting distributions. The method is applied to classifying handwritten digits and synthetic linear and nonlinear deformations of three hundred LAT(E)X symbols. State-of-the-art error rates are achieved on the National Institute of Standards and Technology database of digits. The principal goal of the experiments on LAT(E)X symbols is to analyze invariance, generalization error and related issues, and a comparison with artificial neural networks methods is presented in this context.

Quantitative kinetic studies have been hampered by the difficulties in enumerating and characterizing embryo populations. By employing neural networks, we have developed a pattern-recognition system for characterizing the morphological features of carrot somatic embryos. This pattern-recognition system employs a hierarchical decision tree to achieve optimal classification. It successfully classified carrot somatic embryos into normal and abnormal embryo classes. For normal embryo classes (globular, oblong, heart, and torpedo embryos), an accuracy of 90% or higher was achieved. The features identified by the neural network classifiers as most important for embryo classification are almost identical to those obtained by the branch-and-bound searching algorithm used previously. However, employing the neural networks shortens the system developing time greatly. Coupled with an image analysis system, this neural-network-based pattern-recognition system shows great potential in embryo sorting and automation of synthetic seed production.

Of methods for classification and regression that have been developed in the fields of pattern recognition, statistics, and machine learning, these are of particular interest for data mining since they utilize symbolic and interpretable representations. Symbolic solutions can provide a high degree of insight into the decision boundaries that exist in the data, and the logic underlying them. This aspect makes these predictive-mining techniques particularly attractive in commercial and industrial data-mining applications. We present here a synopsis of some major state-of-the-art tree and rule mining methodologies, as well as some recent advances.

Fuzzy logic is well suited to represent and to manipulate data and knowledge at different levels of the algorithm. Our algorithm is built in steps: Detection and segmentation of the individual microcalcifications, measurements on the segmented microcalcifications (shape, contrast, relative localization), use of these measurements as inputs of a learning system which concludes if the current case is malignant or not. We first describe some aspects of the fuzzy segmentation we have implemented. Then we explain how we build fuzzy measurements from the segmented objects and how these measurements are manipulated into the fuzzy decision tree we are using. Finally, we present the preliminary results we obtained with our test database. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Fourier descriptors and the projected area (pixel count) of the individual nuts were extracted from their two-dimensional images and used as recognition features. The Fisher criterion for feature selection was used in conjunction with the Gaussian classification method to select a subset of the Fourier descriptors from an initial set of 15 harmonics. The results of this feature selection indicated that seven harmonics were sufficient for this classification problem. The selected Fourier descriptors and the area of each nut were subsequently used as inputs to two classification schemes: a hybrid decision-tree classifier and a feedforward neural network trained by back-propagation. The average classification accuracy obtained for the decision-tree classifier was 87.1%. The neural-network classifier resulted in an average classification accuracy of 94.8%, indicating the superiority of the neural-network approach for machine vision grading of these nuts.

J	Gillberg, C				Gillberg, C			Practitioner review: Physical investigations in mental retardation	JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY AND ALLIED DISCIPLINES			English	Review						autism; mental handicap; physical disability; brain damage; assessment; diagnosis; etiology	AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS; BEHAVIOR CHECKLIST; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; CHILDREN; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ADOLESCENTS; DISABILITY	Mental retardation occurs in more than 1 % of the child population. A cause can be found in almost 80 % of individuals with severe mental retardation, but in fewer than 40 % of those with mild mental retardation. A work-up is indicated in all cases of mental retardation. A medical doctor with specific training in the field is needed to make "decision-tree diagnosis" and to suggest the most appropriate physical investigations in each case. This paper provides practical guidelines for diagnosis and work-up both in severe and mild mental retardation.

J	Sethi, IK; Yoo, JH				Sethi, IK; Yoo, JH			Structure-driven induction of decision tree classifiers through neural learning	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						decision trees; machine learning; multifeature splits; neural networks; neural trees; structured induction	DESIGN; ALGORITHM; NETWORKS; ENTROPY; CLASSIFICATION; INFORMATION	The decision tree classifiers represent a nonparametric classification methodology that is equally popular in pattern recognition and machine learning. Such classifiers are also popular in neural networks under the label of neural trees. This paper presents a new approach for designing these classifiers. Instead of following the common top-down approach to generate a decision tree, a structure-driven approach for induction of decision trees, SDIDT, is proposed. In this approach, a tree structure of fixed size with empty internal nodes, i.e. nodes without any splitting function, and labeled terminal nodes is first assumed. Using a collection of training vectors of known classification, a neural learning scheme combining backpropagation and soft competitive learning is then used to simultaneously determine the splits for each decision tree node. The advantage of the SDIDT approach is that it generates compact trees that have multifeature splits at each internal node which are determined on global rather than local basis; consequently it produces decision trees yielding better classification and interpretation of the underlying relationships in the data. Several well-known examples of data sets of different complexities and characteristics are used to demonstrate the strengths of the SDIDT method. (C) 1997 Pattern Recognition Society.

Cost-effectiveness, cost-utility and cost-benefit analyses were conducted from societal and health-departmental perspectives. A decision tree was used. Utilities were assigned to health states using the Quality of Well-Being Scale. Simple and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were also carried out. From a societal perspective, using sumatriptan instead of caffeine/ergotamine resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of -25 Canadian dollars ($Can) per attack aborted, an incremental cost-utility ratio of -$Can7507 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and a net economic benefit of $Can42 per patient per year (1995 values). From the perspective of the health department, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $Can98 per attack aborted, the incremental cost-utility ratio was $Can29 366 per QALY; the grade of recommendation based on past decisions regarding health technology for adoption into health insurance plans was 'moderate'. Sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust to relatively large changes in the input variables. The incremental health benefits obtained from using oral sumatriptan rather than oral caffeine/ergotamine were achieved at moderately acceptable incremental costs, if past decisions on the adoption of other health technologies are used as a guide.

J	Lea, AP; Lamb, HM				Lea, AP; Lamb, HM			Azithromycin - A pharmacoeconomic review of its use as a single-dose regimen in the treatment of uncomplicated urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infections in women	PHARMACOECONOMICS			English	Review							PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE; SEXUALLY-TRANSMITTED DISEASE; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; UNITED-STATES; DOXYCYCLINE; PREGNANCY; EFFICACY; MEN; PHARMACOKINETICS; ERYTHROMYCIN	In women, Chlamydia trachomatis infection often occurs in the urethra or cervix, with up to 70% of infections associated with few or no symptoms. Inadequate treatment may lead to infection of the upper genital tract and subsequent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in 10 to 40% of patients. PID causes an increased relative risk of ectopic pregnancy of 2.5 to 7.9 and PID may also lead to tubal infertility in about 17% of patients. 60% of infants born of mothers with C. trachomatis infection may become infected, leading to conjunctivitis in 23% and pneumonia in 21%. All of these sequelae of C. trachomatis infection may require in-or outpatient treatment. With >4 million infections estimated to occur each year in the US, C. trachomatis is one of the most common and costly of the sexually transmitted pathogens. Treatment options for uncomplicated C. trachomatis infections in nonpregnant women include single-dose azithromycin 1000mg or doxycycline 100mg twice daily for 7 days orally. In clinical trials, the bacteriological cure rate of single dose azithromycin 1000mg (95 to 100%) was similar to that of oral doxycycline 200 mg/day for 7 days (88 to 100%) in nonpregnant women. Azithromycin was at least as well tolerated as doxycycline and was associated with mainly mild gastrointestinal adverse effects including diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal pain. Pharmacoeconomic analyses have sought to determine if the 2.7- to 12-fold higher acquisition costs of azithromycin in comparison with doxycycline are offset by its simple single-dose regimen which is likely to aid patient compliance and so optimise drug efficacy. All analyses were retrospective cost-effectiveness decision-tree models and mainly considered direct costs. All models incorporated an estimate of noncompliance with doxycycline and its influence on efficacy. For the treatment of confirmed C. trachomatis infection, azithromycin saved around $US1200 per major outcome avoided (1993 values; third-party payer perspective in the US) or US$3502 per case of PID avoided (1993 values; US healthcare system perspective) compared with doxycycline. If infection was treated empirically, azithromycin was more costly than doxycycline by $US792 (1993 values), but the result was sensitive to changes of some parameters of the model. Azithromycin was more costly than doxycycline from the perspective of a public health clinic which paid for the treatment of initial infection and acute sequelae only. Thus, pharmacoeconomic data from the US support the use of azithromycin in the treatment of nonpregnant women with confirmed C. trachomatis urogenital infections from the perspective of the healthcare system or third-party payer; however, from the perspective of a public clinic, doxycycline is the less costly option. Decreases in doxycycline compliance or azithromycin acquisition cost are factors that favour azithromycin.

Socio-demographic, clinical and resource utilisation data for piracetam and placebo patients during the acute phase following stroke was obtained from the Piracetam Acute Stroke Study (PASS) clinical trial database. The economic analysis was based on the population defined as being treated within 6 h 59 min following stroke and presenting an initial Orgogozo score of less than 55. Resource utilisation data concerning the rehabilitation phase, outpatient follow-up and institutionalisation was obtained from decision tree analysis. There was a higher percentage of autonomous patients in the piracetam group (27.8%) compared to placebo (22.9%). The mean duration of hospitalisation (autonomous 21.8 days; non-autonomous 30.3 days) and the cost of an autonomous patient was lower than a non-autonomous patient. The total cost per stroke patient receiving piracetam was estimated at 103 KF during the 6-month period, compared to 106 KF per placebo patient. The major cost driver was hospitalisation during the acute phase, representing approximately 50% of the total cost per patient. In patients with moderate to severe stroke treated within 6.59 h, piracetam was cost-effective compared to placebo over the 6-month study period. (C) 1997 The Italian Pharmacological Society.

J	Rabinowicz, W				Rabinowicz, W			On Seidenfeld's criticism of sophisticated violations of the independence axiom	THEORY AND DECISION			English	Article						sequential choice; planning; independence axiom; dynamic inconsistency; sophisticated choice; backward induction; Seidenfeld; McClennen		An agent who violates independence can avoid dynamic inconsistency in sequential choice if he is sophisticated enough to make use of backward induction in planning. However, Seidenfeld has demonstrated that such a sophisticated agent with ''dependent'' preferences is bound to violate the principle of dynamic substitution, according to which admissibility of a plan is preserved under substitution of indifferent options at various choice nodes in the decision tree. Since Seidenfeld considers dynamic substitution to be a coherence condition on dynamic choice, he concludes that sophistication cannot save a violator of independence from incoherence. In response to McClennen's objection that relying on dynamic substitution when independence is at stake must be question-begging, Seidenfeld undertakes to prove that dynamic substitution follows from the principle of backward induction alone, provided we assume that the agent's admissible choices from different sets of feasible plans are all based on a fixed underlying preference ordering of plans. This paper shows that Seidenfeld's proof fails: depending on the interpretation, it is either invalid or based on an unacceptable assumption.

J	Trauth, R; Xanthopoulos, C				Trauth, R; Xanthopoulos, C			Non-point pollution of groundwater in urban areas	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						groundwater monitoring; groundwater pollution; non-point sources; urban areas		Within a pilot project, a monitoring network for the description of the non-point sources of groundwater pollution in urban areas was implemented and operated for 3 years. The main concept of the network lay in the collection of consistent series of time data for the description of groundwater quality and the description of the relationship between the non-point sources of anthropogenic pollutants in the urban areas and the measured concentration in groundwater. The impairment of the groundwater quality due to non-point sources of pollution could be demonstrated and described. Supporting information on hydrology, geology and land-use has been used in addition to the measured data. The results show the significant impact of the urban non-point sources on the groundwater quality. In particular, drastically decreasing concentrations of oxygen and increasing concentrations for boron, EDTA and NTA have been observed. The second step of the work focuses on the deduction of rules for the qualification of the influence of land-use on the groundwater quality by means of the decision-tree method.

J	Sen, S				Sen, S			Lower bounds for parallel algebraic decision trees, parallel complexity of convex hulls and related problems	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th Conference of the FST / TCS	1994	MADRAS, INDIA	FST, TCS			COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY; ALGORITHMS	We present lower bounds on the number of rounds required to solve a decision problem in the parallel algebraic decision tree model. More specifically, we show that any parallel algorithm in the fixed degree algebraic decision tree model that answers membership queries in W subset of or equal to R-n using p processors, requires Omega(log\W\/n log(p/n)) rounds where \W\ is the number of connected components of W. This implies non-trivial lower bounds for parallel algorithms that use a superlinear number of processors, namely, that the speed-up obtainable in such cases is not proportional to the number of processors. We further prove a similar result for the average case complexity. We give applications of this result to various fundamental problems in computational geometry like convex-hull construction and trapezoidal decomposition and also present algorithms with matching upper bounds. The algorithms extend Reif and Sen's work in parallel computational geometry to the sublogarithmic time range based on recent progress in padded-sorting. A corollary of our result strengthens the known lower-bound of parallel sorting from the parallel comparison tree model to the more powerful bounded-degree decision tree.

J	Grolmusz, V				Grolmusz, V			On the power of circuits with gates of low L-1 norms	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article							MONOTONE CIRCUITS; DEPTH	We examine the power of Boolean functions with low L-1 norms in several settings. In a large part of the recent literature, the degree of a polynomial which represents a Boolean function in some way was chosen to be the measure of the complexity of the Boolean function. However, some functions with low communicational complexity (AND, OR, PARITY, ID) have high degree, but small L-1 norms. So, in conjunction with communication complexity, instead of the degree, the L-1 norm can be an important measure of hardness. We conjecture that the randomized communication complexity of any Boolean function is bounded by the polylogarithm of its L-1 norm. We can prove only a weaker statement: we present a two-party, randomized, common-coin communication protocol for computing functions with O(L-1(2) delta) bits of communication, with error-probability of exp(-c delta) (even with large degree or exponential number of terms). Then we present several applications of this theorem for circuit lower bounds (both for bounded-and unbounded depth), and a decision-tree lower bound.

This classification is based both on morphologic criteria relating to morphonuclear features from isolated Feulgen-stained nuclei and on glycohistochemical characteristics from histologic slides submitted to three lectins (peanut, wheat germ, and gorse seed agglutinins) and one neoglycoconjugate glycohistochemical stain. While the morphonuclear features (including 30 variables) relate essentially to chromatin pattern, the glycohistochemical stains (including 16 variables) are linked to the presence of specific carbohydrate moieties in cell membranes and cytoplasm. Forty-nine nasal polyps, including single polyps, diffuse polyposis, cystic fibrosis-related polyposis, and aspirin idiosyncracy-related polyposis associated with asthma, were thus characterized. All the variables were obtained quantitatively by means of computer-assisted microscopy. Two complementary methods of data classification were used to determine the actual diagnostic value contributed by each quantitative variable, namely, discriminant analysis, which forms part of multifactorial statistical analysis, and the decision tree technique, which is an artificial intelligence-related algorithm. The data so obtained show that our morphologic classification of nasal polyps fits in with the classification of nasal polyps defined on the basis of clinical criteria.

J	Tessmer, AC				Tessmer, AC			What to learn from near misses: An inductive learning approach to credit risk assessment	DECISION SCIENCES			English	Article							SYSTEM-DEVELOPMENT; EXPERT SYSTEMS; DECISION; BANKRUPTCY; MODEL	This paper presents a new dimension of inductive learning for credit risk analysis based on the specific impact of Type I and Type II credit errors on the accuracy of the learning process. A Dynamic Updating Process is proposed to refine the credit granting decision over time and therefore improve the accuracy of the learning process. The new dimension is tested on credit files of small Belgian businesses. Results indicate an improvement of the learning process in terms of predictive accuracy, stability, and conceptual validity of the final decision tree.

The expert system applies AI-based methods (e.g. object-oriented modelling, blackboard technique, fuzzy reasoning, decision tree) in incorporating data on external systems in order to support the control center operator in network operation. At present the expert system is in everyday use in several distribution utilities. The main contribution of the paper is to propose the expert system entity including advanced AI-based inference models. In addition to the inference models the novelty value is founded on the practical use of the system.

Two well-known criteria are gain and gain ratio, both based on the entropy of partitions. We propose in this paper a new criterion based also on entropy, and use both theoretical analysis and computer simulation to demonstrate that it works better than gain or gain ratio in a wide variety of situations. We use the usual entropy calculation where the base of the logarithm is not two but the number of successors to the node. Our theoretical analysis leads some specific situations in which the new criterion works always better than gain or gain ratio, and the simulation result may implicitly cover all the other situations not covered by the analysis.

The goal is to produce a classification function that has higher accuracy than either the expert's hypotheses or the classification function inductively learned from the training examples alone. The key idea in our proposed approach is to let the expert's hypotheses influence the process of learning inductively from the training examples. Experimental results are presented demonstrating the power of our approach in a variety of domains.

New topical therapies are less expensive, have superior tolerability and better efficacy rates compared to the old topical antifungal agents. PURPOSE: Pharmacoeconomic analysis of topical lacquers and oral agents for the treatment of mild to moderate onychomycosis in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK. METHODS: Two topical lacquers, amorolfine (AMO) and ciclopirox (CIC), and the oral agents griseofulvin (GRI), itraconazole (ITR), and terbinafine (TER) were examined using a predictive (decision tree) model. Expert panels determined clinical practice patterns, reimbursement practices and standard costs for health care resource items in each country. Metaanalysis was used to determine clinical success rates. Data were analyzed over a 5-year horizon, with a 5% discounting rate. The sensitivity of the model was examined using rank order stability analysis (ROSA). The cost per regimen, total expected costs of therapy, and cost per symptom-free day (SFD) were calculated. RESULTS: CIC as first-line therapy had the lowest expected cost and lowest cost per SFD followed by AMO and then by TER and ITR in most countries. Variations were observed in the UK and Spain likely related to overestimation of the prices for the topical agents.

J	Lohani, VK; Loganathan, GV				Lohani, VK; Loganathan, GV			An early warning system for drought management using the Palmer drought index	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						drought management; Palmer drought severity index; early warning system; drought contingency plans; water availability task force; Markov chain	SEVERITY INDEX; HYDROLOGIC DROUGHT; SENSITIVITY; EUROPE	The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) is used in a non-homogeneous Markov chain model to characterize the stochastic behavior of drought. Based on this characterization an early warning system in the form of a decision tree enumerating all possible sequences of drought progression is proposed for drought management. Besides yielding probabilities of occurrence of different drought severity classes, the method associates a secondary measure in terms of likely cumulative precipitation deficit to provide timely guidance in deciding drought mitigation actions. The proposed method is particularly useful for water availability task forces in various states for issuing drought warnings in advance. The applicability of the technique is illustrated for the Tidewater climatic division of Virginia.

Although this paper focuses on inductive learning, it at least touches on a great many aspects of ML in general. In addition, incremental induction is also reviewed. Therefore, a general review of ML is presented, but specific detail which has been covered previously is omitted, although other relevant references are noted, and later material is commented upon.

J	Graf, T; Kamakoti V				Graf, T; Kamakoti, V			Sparse dominance queries for many points in optimal time and space	INFORMATION PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						dominating point; interval tree; priority search tree; layered witness graph		A point p is an element of R(2) dominates a point q is an element of R(2) if p.x greater than or equal to q.x. and p.y. greater than or equal to q.y. Given is a set S of n different points, a sequence Q of k query points chosen from S, and a function f:N --> N, f(x) less than or equal to x. In the Sparse Dominance Query Problem (SDQP) we have to compute for each q is an element of Q the set D(q) of points in S\{q} that dominate q if q is f-sparse and otherwise a close subset D'(q) of D(q) with \D'(q)\ = f(n). We prove that Omega(n log n + K(S, Q)) is a lower time bound for the SDQP in the algebraic decision tree model of computation, where K(S, Q) is the total number of points reported. We present an algorithm based on the layered witness graph (LWG) that solves the SDQP in optimal O(n log n + K(S, Q)) time using O(n) space for any function f and for any value of k. We also show that the LWG can be modified such that points p is an element of R(2) can be dynamically inserted into and deleted from S in O(\(D) over tilde(p)\log n) time, where (D) over tilde(p) denotes the set of points in S\{p} that are dominated by p.

The remedial technologies were selected based on cost, effectiveness, implementability, compatibility, and ability to allow for uncertainties in the subsurface conditions over the 200-acre area of interest. The flexibility-designed remediation system incorporated dual-phase extraction (DPE), in situ bioremediation (ISB), and conventional extraction (CE). The groundwater remediation system also incorporated use of existing remediation systems to reduce capital costs and utilized a decision tree for operation of the groundwater remediation system to capitalize on the most effective technology based on the variable saturated conditions of the low permeability stratum. The design incorporated 41 wells, associated reversible piping network, the existing groundwater treatment system, existing mobile vapor phase treatment systems, an amendment injection system for ISB, and a control system. Design was completed in 1996, with construction completed in March 1997. The system has operated for nine months as of January 1998. The early focus of the remediation system was use of DPE in areas where groundwater elevations were relatively low to capitalize on the relatively high efficiency of mass removal in the unsaturated zone.

For instance, threats such as high-speed, low-altitude and reduced radar cross section anti-ship cruise missiles are examples of means to exploit the intrinsic vulnerabilities of current shipboard surveillance radar systems. A possible approach to countering such threats might be the interactive integration of an infrared sensor with an horizon surveillance radar to extend acquisition and firm track ranges. This approach might be appropriate for these specific threats. But what about the potential conflicts with other goals that a warship commander has to achieve in order to fulfill his mission? This paper raises issues related to conflict management in the optimization of the various levels of the shipboard combat system decision tree organized as CCIS and warfare areas. Sensor integration, management and data fusion, i.e., the three distinct aspects of the coordinated use of sensor assets to support naval operations, are first define in the perspective of their relationship to command and control. Then, the tentative definition of a set of integration rules or guidelines required for any low level integration to be in line with the decisions made at higher levels is provided.

In particular, it implements the fuzzy decision tree approach. The method is based upon program generation technology of the type that is regularly used in compilers, i.e. software used to translate program source code to machine code. Only tools for the parsing phase - which is the first step of the compilation process - is used, including parser generator textual scanner generator and tree traverser. These tools generate and evaluate fuzzy decision trees. The result is a modular, robust, fast and theoretically well-grounded realisation of the recommended approach. According to Popoli [1] the fuzzy tree approach is superior to the alternative, the utility theory approach, in terms of simplicity, maintainability, extensibility, low processor loading and requirements of a priori data.

S	Buzek, JR			TAPPI	Buzek, JR			Minimizing the risk of brittle fracture in existing liquid storage tanks	INTERNATIONAL ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, BOOKS 1-3	TAPPI PROCEEDINGS		English	Proceedings Paper	TAPPI International Engineering Conference	SEP 13-17, 1998	MIAMI, FL	TAPPI, Acotepac, ABTCP, ATCP, Mexico, ATCP, Chile				Liquid storage tanks which do not conform to the 1980 API Standard 650, 7(th) Edition or later[1], may not meet material selection requirements designed to minimize the risk of brittle fracture. Shell corrosion, excessive foundation settlement, improper repairs, etc., will increase stresses in the tank walls and may increase the probability of brittle fracture. Unless it can be shown that a liquid storage tank can continue to operate safely in the winter months when the risk of brittle fracture is highest, the product level may have to be lowered to levels which make the plant operation uneconomical. If it cannot be demonstrated that the tank design and operating parameters fall within a safe operating envelope, then the API Standard 653[2] "decision tree" states that: "The owner/operator can also make a more rigorous analysis to determine the risk of failure due to brittle fracture by performing a fracture mechanics analysis based upon established principles and practices. The procedures and acceptance criteria for conducting an alternative analysis are not included in this standard." This article presents a brittle fracture assessment procedure and acceptance criteria for storage tanks, based on the principles of fracture mechanics. A simple equation is developed which gives a safe fill height based on the tank diameter, the corroded shell plate thickness, product density and the lowest expected one day mean ambient temperature. The equation has been tested against known brittle fracture failures of storage tanks and would have predicted all of them, except where the tank had very severe corrosion. To avoid this, tanks must be maintained properly and inspected regularly by knowledgeable individuals as required by API Standard 653 [2]. Otherwise, defects may develop which are sufficiently serious to cause a brittle fracture at liquid levels below those predicted in this article.

The mill was highly energy efficient prior to the beginning of the study. The application of pinch technology, simulation modeling and mill experience revealed practical projects that could save an additional 12% of the total energy used, while at the same time reducing cooling load. Process integration analysis revealed opportunity for an increase of 50,000 lb/h in evaporation without additional energy consumption. Cooperation between mill personnel, utility representatives and consultants ensured that the mill has a clear decision tree about the long term energy pathways so that energy saving projects can either be implemented independently or combined with other mill future plans.

Previous research has demonstrated that appropriate grafting techniques can improve predictive accuracy across a wide cross-selection of domains. However, previous decision tree grafting systems are demonstrated to have a serious deficiency for some data sets containing missing values. This problem arises due to the method for handling missing values employed by C4.5, in which the grafting systems have been embedded. This paper provides an explanation of and solution to the problem. Experimental evidence is presented of the efficacy of this solution.

The committee members vote to decide the final classification. Two such methods, Bagging and Boosting, have shown great success with decision tree learning. They create different classifiers by modifying the distribution of the training set. This paper studies a different approach: Stochastic Attribute Selection Committee learning of decision trees. It generates classifier committees by stochastically modifying the set of attributes but keeping the distribution of the training set unchanged. An empirical evaluation of a variant of this method, namely SASC, in a representative collection of natural domains shows that the SASC method can significantly reduce the error rate of decision tree learning. On average SASC is more accurate than Bagging and less accurate than Boosting, although a one-tailed sign-test fails to show that these differences are significant at a level of 0.05. In addition, it is found that, like Bagging, SASC is more stable than Boosting in terms of less frequently obtaining significantly higher error rates than C4.5 and, when error is raised, producing lower error rate increases.

The output of the ultrasonic scanning system installed on the train consists of echo images - so-called B-scans. The B-scans are classified according to the images of rail constructions, noise artefacts, and/or defects that they contain. Currently, at TNO Institute of Applied Physics a hybrid rule-based / case-based classification system is being built for the train. This paper describes the way the cases are represented and matched in the system, the way the case-base is organised, and the way the case retrieval is done. Interesting aspects of the system are: use of fuzzy membership functions for case matching, decision tree (C4.5) based top-level case-base organisation, and clustered bottom-level case-base organisation.

ADVANCES IN NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS 10	ADVANCES IN NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS		English	Proceedings Paper	11th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS)	DEC 01-06, 1997	DENVER, CO					Recent theoretical results for pattern classification with thresholded real-valued functions (such as support vector machines, sigmoid networks, and boosting) give bounds on misclassification probability that do not depend on the size of the classifier, and hence can be considerably smaller than the bounds that follow from the VC theory. In this paper, we show that these techniques can be more widely applied, by representing other boolean functions as two-layer neural networks (thresholded convex combinations of boolean functions). For example, we show that with high probability any decision tree of depth no more than d that is consistent with m training examples has misclassification probability no more than O ((1/m (N-eff VCdim(U) log(2) m log d))(1,2)), where U is the class of node decision functions, and N-eff less than or equal to N can be thought of as the effective number of leaves (it becomes small as the distribution on the leaves induced by the training data gets far from uniform). This bound is qualitatively different from the VC bound and can be considerably smaller. We use the same technique to give similar results for DNF formulae.

The approach is based on the principle of minimum cross entropy to derive a decision tree for data clustering and it employs a metalearning idea (learning to learn) to adapt to changes in data characteristics. Its efficiency is demonstrated by grouping non-stationary artifical data and by hierarchical segmentation of LANDSAT images.

At any moment in time, each vertex in such a graph is either idle or busy. The search problem we Consider is to find a path (from the given input to the given output) consisting entirely of idle vertices, or to find a cut (separating the given input from the given output) consisting entirely of busy vertices. We shall also anew the search to fair to find either a path or a cut with some probability bounded by a parameter called the failure probability This is to be accomplished by sequentially probing the idle-or-busy status of vertices, where the vertex chosen for each probe may depend on the outcome of previous probes. Thus a search algorithm may be modelled as a decision tree. For average-case analysis, we assume that each vertex is independently idle with some fixed probability, called the vacancy probability (and therefore busy with the complementary probability). For one commonly studied type channel graph, the parallel graph, we show that the expected number of probes is at most proportional to the length of a path, irrespective of the vacancy probability, and even if the allowed failure probability is zero. Another type of channel graph we study is the spider-web graph, which is superior to the parallel graph as regard linking probability (the probability that an idle path, rather than a busy cut, exists). For this graph we give an algorithm for which, as the vacancy probability is varied while the positive failure probability is held fixed, the expected number of probes reaches its maximum near the critical vacancy probability (where the linking probability make a rapid transition from a very small Value to a substantial value). This maximum expected number of probes is about the cube-root of the diversity (the number of paths between the input and output).

J	de Mantaras, RL; Cerquides, J; Garcia, P				de Mantaras, RL; Cerquides, J; Garcia, P			Comparing information theoretic attribute selection measures: a statistical approach	AI COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						decision trees; attribute selection; statistical tests; experimental methodology	DECISION-TREE INDUCTION	In [7], a new information-theoretic attribute selection method for decision tree induction was introduced. This method consists in computing for each node, a distance between the partition generated by the values of each candidate attribute in the nude and the correct partition of the subset of training examples in this node. The chosen attribute is that whose corresponding partition is the closest to the correct partition (i.e., the partition that perfectly classifies the training data). In that paper it was also formally proved that such distance is not biased towards attributes with a large number of values in the sense specified by Quinlan in [12] and some initial experimental evidence suggests that the predictive accuracy of the induced trees was not significantly different from that obtained with the most widely used information theoretic attribute selection measures, that is, Quinlan's Gain and Quinlan's Cain Ratio. However, it seemed that the distance induced smaller trees especially when the attributes had different number of values. In that paper it was not confirmed that the differences were statistically significant due to the small number of experiments performed. In this paper we report experimental results that allow to confirm that the distance induces trees whose size, without losing accuracy, is not significantly different from those obtained using Quinlan's Cain but smaller than those obtained with Quinlan's Gain Ratio. These experimental results are supported by a statistical analysis performed using two statistical hypothesis tests: the sign lest and the signed rank test.

Studies which attempt to assess the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of therapy may be further constrained by the fact that there is now good evidence that many patients with dyspepsia seek medical attention not so much because of the severity of symptoms, but because they fear that the symptoms signal the presence of some serious underlying disease, In this situation, effective well-founded reassurance that no serious disease is present is an important outcome of medical intervention and one which should be included in an economic appraisal of dyspepsia management, For obvious reasons, it is sensible to compare the cost effectiveness of various clinical management strategies applicable in dyspepsia, Decision-tree analyses are currently fashionable but suffer from the major defect that there is no theoretical basis from which patient satisfaction with treatment options can be assessed, It is suggested that for disorders such as functional dyspepsia, which are non-lethal and non-progressive, recommendations about acceptable clinical management strategies require that account be taken of patient satisfaction with the strategies being reviewed, Cost effectiveness calculations which take no account of this aspect of outcome are of limited relevance to clinical practice.

METHODS: Decision tree and Markov analyses that employ cohort simulation were applied to determine the incremental cost-utility ratio of GDC embolization versus no therapy for unruptured cerebral aneurysms. Clinical values required as input data were estimated from the literature for the following variables: relative frequencies of complete aneurysmal occlusion, partial aneurysmal occlusion, and attempted coiling (no coils detached); morbidity and mortality of GDC embolization; frequency, morbidity, and mortality of spontaneous aneurysmal rupture in untreated and GDC-embolized aneurysms; annual rate of recanalization of GDC-embolized aneurysms; quality of life when knowingly living with untreated or GDG-embolized aneurysms and of living with fixed neurologic deficit; costs of GDC embolization, spontaneous aneurysmal rupture, stroke, and rehabilitation; and discount rate. Cost-utility ratios below $50 000 per quality-adjusted life year saved were considered acceptable. Sensitivity analyses were performed for all relevant input variables. RESULTS: Baseline input values resulted in acceptable cost-utility ratios for GDC embolization of unruptured intracranial aneurysms. These ratios remained within acceptable limits across wide ranges of various input parameters. Cost-effectiveness was markedly affected by the natural course of unruptured, untreated aneurysms; rates of spontaneous rupture greater than 2% per year resulted in favorable cost-utility ratios that were relatively unaffected by variation in GDC efficacy, while rates of rupture less than 1% per year resulted in unfavorable ratios that were highly dependent on GDC efficacy. Many of the GDC efficacy indexes, such as rate of failed coiling, early recanalization, and progressive aneurysmal thrombosis, have mild effects on the cost-utility ratios. GDC complication rate as well as life expectancy had moderate effects on the analysis. The influence of late aneurysmal recanalization was mild unless high rates of rupture for partially coiled aneurysms were applied. Suboptimal clip placement resulting from the presence of GDC coils within a ruptured aneurysm had no demonstrable consequence on cost-utility ratios. CONCLUSIONS: The single most influential variable determining the cost-effectiveness of GDC embolization in our analysis was the natural course of untreated aneurysms. Other important variables included GDC-related morbidity and life expectancy at the time of GDC embolization.

Thirty morphonuclear and 8 nuclear DNA content-related variables were thus generated. The actual prognostic values of this set of cytometric variables was compared (by means of discriminant statistical analysis) to conventional diagnostic and/or prognostic markers including histopathological grades, tumour invasion levels and the presence or absence of metastases. We obtained complete clinical follow-ups for 49 of the 105 RCC patients under study, making it possible to define a subset of patients with a bad prognosis (i.e., who died in the 12 months following nephrectomy) and a subset of patients with a good prognosis (i.e., who survived at least 24 months following nephrectomy). An original method of data analysis related to artificial intelligence (decision tree induction) enabled a strong prognostic model to be set up. In the case of 10 new patients, this model identified all the dead patients as having a bad survival status, with a total of 8 correct predictions. Another prognostic model similarly generated enabled the correct predictions to be confirmed.

J	Clark, SA				Clark, SA			Dynamically consistent choice and the revelation of Strotz-Pollak equilibrium	ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article						dynamic consistency; Strotz-Pollak equilibrium; revealed preference; decision tree; myopic rationality; perfect rationality	EXPECTED UTILITY; TASTES	The purpose of this essay is to provide a revealed preference analysis of the concept of "dynamically consistent" choice in a decision tree without chance nodes. It is shown that myopic rationality with respect to a stationary weak order is characterized by Arrow's version of the Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference, and that perfect rationality is characterized by Chernoff's condition Alpha. Since the latter concept of dynamic rationality is based upon the selection of a Strotz-Pollak equilibrium as a game-theoretic solution, it is concluded that condition Alpha alone provides a proper choice-theoretic definition of "dynamic consistency".

The progress in this area contributes to the Progress of information systems since data entry is an accepted bottle neck in information system operations. Thai character recognition is also an active research topic. Various researchers work on the recognition of both printed and hand-written Thai characters which are unique and different from English alphabets. A popular classification technique for Thai characters is the use of structural characteristics such as concentrated code values (Q-codes). Nowadays, the creations of rules which are used to classify characters are done manually which may result in long, redundant and incomplete rules. This research work presents the development of an expert system for Thai character recognition. It accepts training sets and produces a concise and complete decision tree which is classification rules for Thai characters. The system was developed using the popular object- oriented programming language Smalltalk.

We describe the inherent relationship between codes in the context of a general data model, bur note that the model is somewhat tenuous and requires extensions through other data analytic/data mining techniques. One of those techniques is decision tree induction, which is described briefly as a possible supplement to the initial code-to-code patterns. The paper concludes with implications for future research, including the investigation of additional analytic techniques and the extension of the model into other domains where problem-solving has been codified.

This methodology may well help neuropathologists, who must determine the aggressiveness of astrocytic tumors on the basis of morphological criteria, The proposed methodology comprises two distinct steps, i.e. i) the production of descriptive quantitative variables (related to DNA ploidy level and morphonuclear aspects) by means of computer-assisted microscopy and ii) data analysis based on an artificial intelligence-related method, i.e. the decision tree approach, Three prognostic problems were considered on a series of 250 astrocytic tumors including 39 astrocytomas (AST), 47 anaplastic astrocytomas (ANA) and 164 glioblastomas (GEM) identified in accordance with the WHO classification, These three problems concern i) variations in the aggressiveness level of the high-grade tumors (ANA and GEM), ii) the detection of the aggressive as opposed to the less aggressive low-grade astrocytomas (AST), and iii) the detection of the aggressive as opposed to the less aggressive anaplastic astrocytomas (ANA), Our results show that the proposed computer-aided methodology improves conventional prognosis based on conventional morphologically-based classifications. In particular, this methodology enables some reference points to be established on the biological continuum according to the sequence AST-->ANA-->GBM.

The gray-level histogram data obtained from the gray scale image of the nuts were analyzed to select a set of suitable recognition features. Based on the analyses, the mean of the gray-level histogram over 50 to 60 gray-level range and the area of each nut (the integral of its gray-level histogram) were selected as the recognition features. The selected features were used as input to three classification schemes: a Gaussian, a decision tree, and a multi-layer neural network (MLNN). The three classifiers had similar recognition rates. However, the MLNN classifier resulted in slightly higher performance with more uniform classification accuracy than the other two classifiers.

A solution is presented here for the problem of touching character recognition for fixed font, using a Decision tree classifier paradigm. The method is based on the concept of probe trees, a feast recognition method that uses character probes to acquire knowledge about the input samples. Touching characters are recognized without segmentation, so errors common in segmentation-based methods are avoided. Speed is achieved by constructing a decision tree for a specific font off-line, before any samples are seen. A deformation model is used to generate probes that withstand certain image distortions. Experimental results are presented in support ol the method.

Cost-effectiveness	CLINICAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article						risperidone; haloperidol; health economics; schizophrenia; cost-effectiveness	CHRONIC-SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS; ECONOMIC-EVALUATION; REDUCTION; THERAPY	Australia and Canada are currently the only Western nations with government guidelines for analyzing the cost-effectiveness of drugs. We used guidelines issued by the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to construct a model for comparing the cost-effectiveness of risperidone and haloperidol over a 2-year period in patients with chronic schizophrenia. Use of clozapine was also included in the analysis as an alternative treatment given to patients who proved unresponsive to therapy with haloperidol or risperidone. Results are expressed in Australian dollars. Cost-effectiveness was determined by using decision-analytic modeling to compare clinical outcomes and costs, The analytic model contained a decision tree for each of the compared agents that tracked the distribution of patients between treatment outcome pathways (ie, scenarios), Distributions were based on probabilities derived from our meta-analysis results reported elsewhere and from other sources. Each scenario had an associated monetary cost that included all significant direct costs (ie, hospital costs; outpatient costs; and the cost of drugs, the services of health care professionals, and government-subsidize hostel accommodation). The cost for a given outcome was the sum of costs for all scenarios leading to that outcome. Cost-effectiveness was expressed as the total cost per favorable outcome. The definition of a favorable outcome was one in which the patient was in a response phase at the end of the 2-year period. The probability of a patient experiencing a favorable outcome at the end of 2 years was 78.9% for risperidone versus 58.9% for haloperidol. The total cost of treatment for 2 years was $15,549.00 for risperidone versus $18,332.00 for haloperidol. The expected cost per favorable outcome was $19,709.00 for risperidone and $31,104.00 for haloperidol. Risperidone was more cost-effective than haloperidol and therefore was "dominant" in pharmacoeconomic terms because it produced a higher proportion of favorable outcomes at lower cost. Sensitivity analysis showed that the difference in clinical response rate was a key determinant of cost-effectiveness.

This complements the n - 1 lower bound of [Rabin (1972)] on the depth of algebraic decision trees for this problem. The proof in fact gives an exponential lower bound on the size of the polyhedral decision problem MAX= for testing whether the j-th number is the maximum among a list of n real numbers. Previously, except for linear decision trees, no nontrivial lower bounds on the size of algebraic decision trees for any familiar problems are known. We also establish an interesting connection between our lower bound and the maximum number of minimal cutsets for any rank-d hypergraph on n vertices.

This study took the systems approach for the user-oriented design, development and evaluation of the CETP. 4 Methods of Presentation (MoP) of the CETP and their associated documentation were iteratively designed using ergonomics principles and guidelines. The MoP's were an Area Graph, a Table, a Psychrometric Chart and a Decision Tree. Following a pilot trial, 2 MoP's were selected for a formal user trial with a representative user population. The results of the Formal User Trial recommended that the Area Graph be the Method of Presentation for the CETP. The successful application of the CETP may help to reduce heat stress amongst wearers of PPC in industry.

Although many approaches of knowledge discovery for relational spatial databases exist, there is a growing interest in mining SOODB. Indeed, object-oriented databases are well-suited to represent complex spatial information. Moreover, a very large number of existing spatial databases are ready to be mined. We propose an algorithm to mine a SOODB. After a spatial object query and a mathematical and fuzzy preprocessing, we apply decision tree based techniques and fuzzy set theory to discover knowledge. An experiment on a region of France to discover classification rules related to houses and urban area is conducted with this algorithm to validate the interest of the approach.

In recent years, IR-based detection systems have gained increasing interest for the land-mine detection problem. We propose a novel processing technique for the IR sensor. The method consists of five algorithmic stages: (I) pre-processing, (2) preliminary detection, (3) feature extraction, (4) classification, and (5) combination of multiple classifiers. The pre-processing step uses a novel adaptive filtering technique that enhances the mines with respect to the background by an online algorithm. The pre-processed IR image is analyzed by parametric and non-parametric methods of testing differences of means for populations from two distributions. We identify candidate regions of interest at the preliminary detection stage, from which we extract features for classification. We use three different classifiers which are based upon a (1)probabilistic neural network, (2) decision tree, and (3) multi-layer feed-forward neural network. Results from multiple classifiers are combined using a new technique of dynamic classifier selection. We apply the complete algorithm on images acquired by IR cameras mounted on a vehicle, and the preliminary test results are very encouraging.

Ln this study, decision analysis was used to estimate the average additional net charge for US guidance. The risks for minor and major complications were extracted from the literature. The incidence of minor complications such as pain and bleeding not requiring hospitalization has been reported as 49% for blind liver biopsy and 39% for US-guided liver biopsy. Major complications requiring hospital admission occur in 4% of blind liver biopsies and 2% of US-guided liver biopsies. A decision tree was used to calculate the total charges of liver biopsy and its associated complications. The charge for treating an episode of minor complications was estimated at $605. The charge related to an episode of major complications was estimated at $1533. The total charge for an ultrasound-guided liver biopsy (except the added charge for the use of ultrasound) was $1770, or $102 less than the same charge for blind liver biopsy. The addition of ultrasound in performing liver biopsies for diffuse parenchymal liver disease is cost-saving if the additional charge of US is less than $102.

In this paper, we focus on a particular situation where we assume that the hypothesis we want to use for prediction is a very simple one so the hypotheses class is of feasible size. We study the problem of how to determine which of the hypotheses in the class is almost the best one. We present two on-line sampling algorithms for selecting a hypothesis, give theoretical bounds on the number of examples needed, and analyze them experimentally. We compare them with the simple batch sampling approach commonly used and show that in most of the situations our algorithms use a much smlaler number of examples.

Although many boosting algorithms have been proposed so far, all of them are essentially developed for binary classification problems, and in order to handle multiclass classification problems, they need the problems reduced somehow to binary ones. In order to avoid such reductions, we introduce a notion of the pseudo-entropy function G that gives an information-theoretic criterion, called the conditional G-entropy, for measuring the loss of hypotheses. The conditional G-entropy turns out to be useful for defining the weakness of hypotheses that approximate, in some way, to a multiclass function in general, so that we can consider the boosting problem without reduction. We show that the top-down decision tree learning algorithm using G as its splitting criterion is an efficient boosting algorithm based on the conditional G-entropy. Namely, the algorithm intends to minimize the conditional G-entropy, rather than the classification error. In the binary case, our algorithm is identical to the error-based boosting algorithm proposed by Kearns and Mansour, and our analysis gives a simpler proof of their results.

On an abstract layer these data can generally be modeled as continuous functions over time. In this article we present an approach to handle continuous-function attributes efficiently in decision tree induction, if the entropy minimalization heuristics is applied. It is shown how time series based upon continuous functions could be preprocessed if used in decision tree induction. A proof is given, that a piecewise linear approximation of the individual time series or the underlying continuous functions could improve the efficiency of the induction task.

Multivariate decision trees (MDT's) have been proposed to overcome some of the problems. Close examination of the conventional ways of building MDT's, however, reveals that the fragmentation problem still persists. A novel approach is suggested to minimize the fragmentation problem by separating hyperplane search from decision tree building. This is achieved by feature transformation. Let the initial feature vector be x, the new feature vector after feature transformation T is y, i.e., y = T(x). We can obtain an MDT by (1) building a UDT on y; and (2) replacing new features y at each node with the combinations of initial features x. We elaborate on the advantages of this approach, the details of T, and why it is expected to perform well. Experiments are conducted in order to confirm the analysis, and results are compared to those of C4.5, OC1, and CART.

However, although almost a third of a billion people worldwide, in several different languages, use Arabic characters for writing, little research progress, in both on-line and off-line has been achieved towards the automatic recognition of Arabic characters. This is a result of the lack of adequate support in terms of funding, and other utilities such as Arabic text database, dictionaries, etc.. and of course of the cursive nature of its writing rules. The main theme of this paper is the automatic recognition of Arabic printed text using machine learning C4.5. Symbolic machine learning algorithms are designed to accept, example descriptions in the form of feature vactors which include a lable that identifies the class to which an example belongs. The output of the algorithm is a set of rules that classifies unseen examples based on generalisations from the training set. This ability to generalise is the maine attraction of machine learning for handwriting recognition. Samples of a character can be preprocessed into a feature vector representation for presentation to a machine learning algorithm that creates rules for recognising characters of the same class. Symbolic machine learning has several advantages over other learning methods. It is fast in training and in recognition, generalises well, is noise tollerant and the symbolic representation is east to understand. The technique can be divided into three major steps: The first step is pre-processing in which the original image is transformed into a binary image utilizing a 300 dpi scanner and then forming the connected component. Second, global features of the input Arabic word are then extracted such as number subwords, number of peaks within the subword,, number and position of the complementary character, etc.. Finally, Machine learning C4.5 is used for character classification to generate a decision tree.

Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to develop systems that aid users in searching, filtering, and retrieving information from the Internet. Currently, only a few prototype systems catalog and index images in Web documents. To greatly improve the cataloging and indexing of images on the Web, we have developed a prototype rule-based system that detects the content images in Web documents. Content images are images that are associated with the main content of Web documents, as opposed to a multitude of other images that exist in Web documents for different purposes, such as decorative, advertisement and logo images. We present a system that uses decision tree learning for automated rule induction for the content image detection system. The system uses visual features, text-related features and the document context of images in concert for fast and effective content image detection in Web documents. We have evaluated the system by collecting more than 1200 images from 4 different Web sites and we have achieved an overall classification accuracy of 84%.

So far only symbolic, decision tree and statistical approaches were utilized to deal with a corpus as large as the VERBMOBIL corpus. We propose solutions to the questions of representing speech, network architecture and training in this context. We argue that, when using neural networks, a task like this can only be solved in a modular approach where training data is split and processed by different components of a larger network. Special care must be taken in constructing a feeding mechanism that avoids oscillatory behaviour due to the heterogeneous data. We were successful in constructing a modular neural network that yielded interesting time-sensitive properties as well as recognition rates superior to most other methods. A first attempt at devising a hybrid system got very close to the best results of this field which suggests further enhancement in future architectures.

One predominant weakness of this algorithm is the generation of sharp decision boundaries at every node within the tree. This paper utilises a new Fuzzy Inference Algorithm (FIA) which is used to transform a decision tree into a fuzzy rule set through the process of fuzzification. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to select a series of high performance membership functions which are then applied to branches within a decision tree. The GA will in addition optimise a pre-selected inference technique which will assign a degree of strength to the conjunction and disjunction of membership grades within the tree. FIA has been developed to provide a fuzzy inference framework for the inclusion of different fuzzy inference operators. Five known sets of operators have been applied to two data sets and have shown considerable improvements in classification accuracy over original ID3 (crisp) trees.

J	Lerche, I; MacKay, JA				Lerche, I; MacKay, JA			Uncertainties on hydrocarbon exploration assessments in both the absence and presence of optioning	ENERGY EXPLORATION & EXPLOITATION			English	Article								For hydrocarbon exploration opportunities a decision tree evaluation including variance in expected value leads to an extra uncertainty on the quality and worth of expected value as a decision device, due to both intrinsic uncertainties in success probability, assessed gains and assessed costs, and to the fact that the expected value is not one of the realizable outcomes. This paper shows how these uncertainty factors can be properly taken into account to provide a revised assessment of worth. In addition, a similar sense of logic prevails when options are considered for an opportunity. The uncertainty and success probability for an optioned opportunity are also assessed in terms of the volatility of the maximum option worth.

J	Lerche, I				Lerche, I			On economic resolution and uncertainty in hydrocarbon exploration assessment	ENERGY EXPLORATION & EXPLOITATION			English	Article								When assessments of parameters of a decision tree for a hydrocarbon exploration project can lie within estimated ranges, it is shown that the ensemble average expected value has two sorts of uncertainties: one sort due to the expected value of each realization of the decision tree being different than the average, the second sort due to intrinsic variance of each decision tree. The total standard en or of the average expected value combines both sorts. The use of additional statistical measures, such as standard error, volatility, and cumulative probability of making a profit, provide insight into the selection process leading to a more appropriate decision. In addition, the use of relative contributions and, relative importance for the uncertainty measures guides one to a better determination of those parameters that dominantly influence the total ensemble uncertainty. In this way one can concentrate resources on efforts to minimize the uncertainty ranges of such dominant parameters. A numerical illustration is provided to indicate how such calculations can be performed simply with a hand calculator.

We start from a decision-tree model, which owns strong context handling capabilities, but provides only static decision-making. We improve it by matching possible temporal chronicles, accounting for dynamic evolutions, to the context. A decision in this framework is activated upon complete recognition of such a chronicle, whereas our highly reactive application domain requires anticipated decisions, comparing possible evolutions to take the best decision in real-time. We choose to dynamically compute a timed game automaton synthesizing the predicted possible next steps, and propose an algorithm that computes the best decision from this simple controller model.

Some biases, such as the type of concepts that can be learnt, may be implicit in the machine learning technique. Other biases toward the predicted outcome may be implicit in the selection of the data, or explicitly available in the program. Decision tree heuristics, as with neural networks, are propositional learners, but with a slightly more restricted mapping. Decision tree heuristics can allow specific biases towards specific outcomes. The techniques for applying these biases are described and it is shown that more appropriate trees can be formed with these biases.

Like other state-of-the-art decision tree classifiers such as SPRINT, ScalParC is suited for handling large datasets. We show that existing parallel formulation of SPRINT is unscalable, whereas ScalParC is shown to be scalable in both runtime and memory requirements. We present the experimental results of classifying up to 6.4 million records on up to 128 processors of Gray T3D, in order to demonstrate the scalable behavior of ScalParC. A key component of ScalParC is the parallel hash table. The proposed parallel hashing paradigm can be used to parallelize other algorithms that require many concurrent updates to a large hash table.

The dilemma between overfitting and achieving maximum accuracy is seldom resolved. We propose a method to construct a decision tree based classifier that maintains highest accuracy on training data and improves on generalization accuracy as it grows in complexity. Trees are generated using the well-known C4.5 algorithm, and the classifier consists of multiple trees constructed in pseudo-randomly selected subspaces of the given feature space. We compare the method to single-tree classifiers and other forest construction methods by experiments on four public data sets, where the method's superiority is demonstrated.

The new technique uses relational models, bur avoids the complexity of full graph matching while incorporating probabilistic information that decreases the sensitivity to noise and errors in the data. The probabilistic relational indexing algorithm is compared to two popular decision tree classifiers and with the original discrete relational indexing algorithm.

A. study is done that enables us to prove that using a fuzzy decision tree instead of a classical decision tree, a slight change in the values of a description leads to a slight change in the value of the decision. Given a measure of satisfiability and a process of inference by means of a fuzzy decision tree, the continuity in the value of the decision relatively to the values of the description is shown. Thus, the stability of fuzzy decision trees when classifying evoluting observations results from this continuity.

This study provides an approach to this problem by systematically analyzing the spectral properties of major land cover change processes and the phenological profiles of different land cover types. The phenological profiles were derived from a global data set consisting of a full phenological year's data record of the 1 km monthly composites from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), while land cover change signals were simulated from the spectral signatures of corresponding land cover types in different seasons. A decision tree method was used to derive the decision rules that provide best separation between the change signals of land cover changes and vegetation phenology. These decision rules were referred to as land cover change trajectories. A complete set of change trajectories was developed for the globe in all seasons of a phenological year. Results from this study indicate that during most seasons of a phenological year, major land cover change processes including deforestation, denudation, revegetation, flooding, flood receding and vegetation burning, can be separated from one another and from vegetation phenology in the red-near infrared space. The derived trajectories, when validated, can serve as a theoretical basis for developing operational change detection algorithms.

A support vector machine is used for each decision in the tree. The "optimal" decision tree is characterized, and both a primal and dual space formulation for constructing the tree are proposed. The result is a method for generating logically simple decision trees with multivariate lineal; nonlinear or linear decisions. By varying the kernel function used, the decisions may consist of linear threshold units, polynomials, sigmoidal neural networks, or radial basis function networks. The preliminary results indicate that the method produces simple trees that generalize well with respect to other decision tree algorithms and single support vector machines.

It has been shown that Boosting and Bagging, as two representative methods of this type, can significantly decrease the error rate of decision. tree learning. Boosting is generally more accurate than. Bagging, but the former is more variable than the latter. In addition, Bagging is amenable to parallel or distributed processing, while Boosting is not. In. this paper, we study a new committee learning algorithm, namely MB (Multiple Boosting). It creates multiple subcommittees by combining Boosting and Bagging. Experimental results in, a representative collection of natural domains show that MB is, on, average, more accurate than either Bagging or Boosting alone. It is more stable Man Boosting, and is amenable to parallel or distributed processing. These characteristics make MB a good choice for parallel datamining.

In the modern sheet metal industry the selection of a suitable set of tools for the fabrication of a flat sheet metal part, using punching and/or nibbling operations, is a major economic issue for two reasons. Firstly, tooling is very expensive and should be minimised. Secondly, if tool capacity of the tool rack is exceeded, expensive set-ups are required to mount different tools in the rack and to program the system. The approach in this paper has been to develop a generic algorithm to select the best set of tools for producing a given sheet metal part, based upon searching a huge explosive decision tree which, in a practical sense is impossible to solve analytically. This paper will show how the well-known Monte Carlo simulation technique can be used in the decision tree search and hence in the process of selecting appropriate tooling. The method makes the selection of the best set of tools to produce any given sheet metal design, without any restriction on the geometry of the features involved.

Initially, a single large neural network is implemented with eleven image features as inputs and thirteen outputs - one for each class of veneer. In order to improve on the classification accuracy of this single network, a decision tree of smaller and more specialised modular neural networks is introduced to achieve a classification by successive refinement. This results in a substantial improvement in classification accuracy. A key process in the design of a modular neural network is the use of "normalised inter-class variation" in the selection of the most appropriate image features to be used for its particular specialised classification task.

This paper addresses two knowledge-based scheduling schemes (work cell attribute oriented dynamic schedulers "WCAODSs") to control the flow of parts efficiently in real-time for FMS in which the part-min I varies continually with the planning horizon. The present work employs a hybrid optimisation approach in the generalised AI framework. A genetic algorithm that provides an optimal combination of a set of priority dispatching rules, one for each work cell "WC" (WCwise pdr set), for each of the problem instances characterised by their WC attributes, is used for generating examples. The WC attributes reflect the information about the operating environment of each individual WC. Two inductive learning algorithms are employed to learn the examples, and scheduling rules are formulated as a knowledge base. The learning algorithms employed are: the Genetic CID3 (Continuous Interactive Dichotomister3 algorithm extended with generic program for weight optimisation) and the Classification Decision Tree algorithm. The knowledge base obtained through the above learning schemes generates robust and effective schedules intelligently with respect to the part-mix changes in real-time, for makespan criteria. The comparison made with a GA-based scheduling methodology shows that WCAODSs provide solutions closer to the optimum.

This pharmacoeconomic evaluation was conducted in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. Methods A four-phase approach was used. Phase 1: experts were assembled to identify the standard approach for management of fungal infections and a decision tree was constructed to model the process. Phase 2: meta-analysis was used to determine success, failure, and relapse rates. Phase 3: economic analyses performed included cost of regimen, total expected cost, and cost-effectiveness, Phase 4: sensitivity analyses (robustness analysis) were also executed to determine the validity of the assumptions, Results In the total expected cost analysis, TER demonstrated the lowest overall cost of treating patients, Terbinafine also provided the highest number of disease-free days during the analytic time horizon and, consequently, the lowest cost per disease-free day. Sensitivity analyses suggest that TER is the most cost-effective topical product for treating dermatophytosis in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. Conclusions All analytic scenarios suggest that TER therapy demonstrates lower expected costs and generates more DFDs when compared with the fungistatic topical therapies included in this pharmacoeconomic analysis, Terbinafine is expected to be the most cost-effective choice in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland for treatment of dermatophytosis minor.

In this paper, we propose a new approach for colour-based RF for image retrieval. The approach makes use of the Multi-Interval Discretization Algorithm to discretize the range of colour histogram values into discrete colour intervals. The probabilistic 0.5 formula is adapted to identify significant colour intervals which are then used to refine the initial query. In addition, knowledge is extracted from the relevance judgement information and represented as a Colour Interval Decision Tree. The decision tree is used to aid in classifying the images, retrieved using the modified query in subsequent retrieval, into the relevant and non-relevant sets. Extensive tests on a large image collection were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed RF approach.

J	Jiaa, CL; Dornfeld, DA				Jiaa, CL; Dornfeld, DA			A self-organizing approach to the prediction and detection of tool wear	ISA TRANSACTIONS			English	Article							ACOUSTIC-EMISSION	The decision tree method and the group method of data handling (GMDH), due to their self-organizing capability for sensor integration, diagnostic reasoning and decision making, were adopted for the recognition and prediction of the tool wear state in a turning operation using acoustic emission and cutting force signals. The decision tree approach was utilised to stimulate human intelligence and generalize heuristic rules from learning examples and was demonstrated to be able to make reliable inferences and decisions on tool wear classification. As a process modeling tool, the GMDH algorithm determines a representation of the real-time machining system interrelationship between tool flank wear and the quantitative measure of sensor variables involved. The derived model was used to predict the tool wear from the in-process sensor output features. A high accuracy of the prediction was obtained (within 5% accuracy of the measured values). The predictive performance of tool wear in machining using the GMDH approach has been proved to be superior to predictions using conventional analysis. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Furnkranz, J				Furnkranz, J			Integrative windowing	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article								In this paper we re-investigate windowing for rule learning algorithms. We show that, contrary to previous results for decision tree learning, windowing can in fact achieve significant run-time gains in noise-free domains and explain the different behavior of rule learning algorithms by the fact that they learn each rule independently. The main contribution of this paper is integrative windowing, a new type of algorithm that further exploits this property by integrating good rules into the final theory right after they have been discovered. Thus it avoids re-learning these rules in subsequent iterations of the windowing process. Experimental evidence in a variety of noise-free domains shows that integrative windowing can in fact achieve substantial run-time gains. Furthermore, we discuss the problem of noise in windowing and present an algorithm that is able to achieve run-time gains in a set of experiments in a simple domain with artificial noise.

The ONCODOC project proposes a framework for elaborating genetic decision support guidelines in a document-based paradigm with a knowledge-based approach. It has been first applied to assist clinicians in the treatment of breast cancer patients. Therapeutic expertise has been encoded as a decision tree. The decision process is driven by the clinician who interactively browses a hypertext version of the decision tree. During the navigation, he incrementally assigns values to decision parameters on the basis of his free interpretation of his patient's condition and thus builds a clinical context leading to patient-specific therapeutic recommendations. These guidelines are distributed on a hospital intranet and are evaluated at the point of care in an oncology department.

J	Wilcox, A; Hripcsak, G				Wilcox, A; Hripcsak, G			Knowledge discovery and data mining to assist natural language understanding	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION			English	Article								As natural language processing systems become more frequent in clinical use, methods for interpreting the output of these programs become increasingly important. These methods require the effort of a domain expert, who must build specific queries and rules for interpreting the processor output. Knowledge discovery and data mining tools can be used instead of a domain expert to automatically generate these queries and rules. C5.0, a decision tree generator, was used to create a rule base for a natural language understanding system. A general-purpose natural language processor using this rule base was tested on a set of 200 chest radiograph reports. When a small set of reports, classified by physicians, was used as the training set, the generated rule base performed as well as lay persons, hut worse than physicians. When a larger set of reports, using ICD9 coding to classify the set, was used for training the system, the rule base performed worse than the physicians and lay persons. It appears that a larger, more accurate training set is needed to increase performance of the method.

Unlike the traditional algorithms, the suggested procedure constructs a decision tree by using the neural network trained for a given set of training instances. The neural network is used for solving all possible problems that may arise in the process (feature selection, discovery of the threshold, generate new instances). The results show that the extracted trees represent good approximation of the respective neural network.

We represent testing strategies as a strategy tree. To support induction of strategy tree, we define three information measures: K-level information, K-level information gain, K-level gain ratio; and K-level cost index, for test selection during strategy building. These measures generalize Quinlan's information measures used in decision tree induction We present theoretical and experimental results to show that the K-level cost index can be used to induce strategy frees in a practical domain.

It is popular for its simplicity in constructing, efficient use in decision making and for simple representation which is easily understood by humans. The automatic learning of decision trees and their use usually show very good results in various "theoretical" environments. The training sets me usually large enough for learning algorithm to construct a hypothesis consistent with the underlying concept. But in real life if is often impossible to find the desired number of training objects for various reasons. The lack of possibilities to measure attribute values high cost and complexity of such measurements, unavailability of all attributes at the same time are the typical representatives. There are different ways to deal with some of these problems, but in a delicate field of medical decision making, we cannot allow ourselves to make any inaccurate decisions. We have measured the values of 24 attributes before and after the 82 operations of children in age between 2 and IO years. The aim was to find the dependencies between attribute values and a child's predisposition to acidemia - the decrease of blood's pH. Our main interest was in discovering predisposition to two forms of acidosis, the metabolic acidosis and the respiratory acidosis, which can both have serious effects on child's health. We decided to construct different decision trees from a set of training objects, which was complete (there were no missing attribute values), but on the other hand not large enough to avoid the effect of overfitting. A common approach to evaluation of a decision tree is the use of a test set. In our case we decided that instead of using a lest set, we ask medical experts to fake a closer look at the generated frees. They examined and evaluated the decision trees branch by branch. Their comments on the generated trees can be found in this paper. The comments show, that frees generated from available training set mainly have surprisingly good branches, but on the other hand some are very "stupid" and no medical explanation could be found Thereafter we can conclude, that the decision tree concept and automatic learning can be successfully used in peal world situations, constrained with the real world limitations, but they should be used only with the guidelines of appropriate medical experts.

Application of this technique to the South Crofty tin mine is discussed, together with analysis of case history information. An empirically-modified version of the design graph, based on data provided by South Crofty, has been used to re-define the stability zones using discriminant analysis methods. Site specific dilution curves have been constructed enabling further development of the probabilistic risk analysis approach to stope design. An overall strategy for risk analysis in open stopes has been developed. This includes the use of decision tree analysis to model the variation in geotechnical variables. An example probability tree is presented to demonstrate the methodology which may be used to quantify geotechnical risk and, ultimately, enable risk cost benefit analysis.

Many retrieval systems for multimedia information resources Slave been developed only focused on their efficiency and performance. Therefore, they cannot deal with user's preferences and interests well. In this paper, we present the framework design of a personalized image retrieval system (PIRS) which can reflect user's preferences and interests incrementally. The prototype of PIRS consists of two major parts: user's preference model (UPM) and retrieval module (RM). The UPM plays a role of refining user's query to meet with user's needs. The KM retrieves the proper images for refined query by computing the similarities between each image and refined query, and the retrieved images are ordered by these similarities. In this paper, we mainly discuss about UPM. The incremental machine learning technologies have been employed to provide the user adaptable and intelligent capability to the system. The UPM is implemented by decision tree based on incremental tree induction (ITI), and adaptive resonance theory (ART) network. User's feedbacks are returned to the UPM, and they modify internal structure of the UPM. User's iterative retrieval activities with PIRS cause the UPM to be revised for user's preferences and interests. Therefore, the PIRS can be adapted to user's preferences and interests. We have achieved encouraging results through experiments.

The system is designed to help technically trained personnel incorporate social and economic criteria into project planning and implementation. To create AGFADOPT, information obtained from the literature was used to develop a set of general rules that simulate farmer decision making regarding the adoption of two tree-based technologies: fruit tree orchards and contour hedgerows. These rules were combined in the expert system using a yes/no decision-tree framework. Preliminary verification of the system prototype using data from the Dominican Republic and evaluation of the system by potential users suggest that it is logically consistent, reasonably accurate (83% for tree orchard; 68% for contour hedgerows), and potentially useful.

This is a decision tree classifier which uses modified gini index as the partitioning criteria. Pre-sorting technique is used to overcome the problem of sorting at each node of the tree. This technique is integrated with a breadth first tree growth strategy which enables us to calculate the best partition for each of the leaf node in a single scan of database. We have implemented this algorithm using depth first tree growth strategy also. The algorithm uses Dynamic Pruning approach which reduces the number of scans of the database and does away with a separate tree pruning phase. The proof of correctness, analysis and performance study are also presented.

Both decision tree and rule set classifiers are used. The paper introduces a "repechage" variation of bagging, that uses, as the hold-out data for cost reduction, the "out of bag" items, which would be unused in standard bagging. The paper presents experimental evidence that, when used with the hold-out cost reduction methods, the repechage method can achieve better misclassification cost results than the straightforward use of standard bagging used with the same hold-out cost reduction method. Superior results for the repechage method on some problems with previously defined cost matrices are shown for a cost reduction decision tree method and two cost reduction rule set methods.

They repeatedly build different classifiers using a base learning algorithm by changing the distribution of the training set. SASC, as a different type of committee learning method, can also significantly reduce the error rate of decision trees. It generates classifier committees by stochastically modifying the set of attributes but keeping the distribution of the training set unchanged. It has been shown that Bagging and SASC are, on average, less accurate than Boosting, but the performance of the former is more stable than that of the latter in terms of less frequently obtaining significantly higher error rates than the base learning algorithm. In this paper, we propose a novel committee learning algorithm, called SASCBAG, that combines SASC and Bagging. It creates different classifiers by stochastically varying both the attribute set and the distribution of the training set. Experimental results in a representative collection of natural domains show that, for decision tree learning, the new algorithm is, on average, more accurate than Boosting, Bagging, and SASC. It is more stable than Boosting. In addition, like Bagging and SASC, SASCBAG is amenable to parallel and distributed processing while Boosting is not. This gives SASCBAG another advantage over Boosting for parallel machine learning and datamining.

Recently, it was shown that those associations that are missing in data may also be interesting. These missing associations are the holes or empty regions. The existing algorithm for discovering holes has a number of shortcomings. It requires each hole to contain no data point, which is too restrictive for many real-life applications. It also has a very high complexity, and produces a huge number of holes. Additionally, the algorithm only works in a continuous space, and does not allow any discrete/nominal attribute. These drawbacks limit its applications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to overcome these shortcomings. This approach transforms the holes-discovery problem into a supervised learning task, and then uses the decision tree induction technique for discovering holes in data.

A subtree is considered unreliable and therefore is pruned if the description length of the classification of the corresponding subsets of training instances together with the description lengths of each path in the subtree is greater than the description length of the classification of the whole subset of training instances in the current node. We compare the perfomance of our simple, parameterless, and well-founded MDL method with some other methods on 18 datasets. The classification accuracy using the MDL pruning is comparable to other approaches and the decision trees are nearly optimally pruned which makes our method an attractive tool for obtaining a first approximation of the target decision tree during the knowledge discovery process.

In particular, for the glaucoma, diagnosis ive target here, the ocular fundus image can be easily obtained and can be used to automatically identify whether an eye is glaucomatous or not. However, the image has a two-dimensional distribution, and it is difficult to feature the whole image through some real-valued parameters in general. This paper proposes a machine learning method using a set of expert's decision cases that identify local abnormalities of an image. This method finds regularities between an image set and the decision cases using Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). Unlike decision-tree learning and neural networks, ILP allows relational learning between concepts. Learned rules are abstract enough to absorb noisy data obtained directly from image analysis. We applied the method to detecting early glaucomatous eyes. Our ILP system, GKS produced 30 rules from 2000 positive and negative examples that were obtained by segmenting 39 glaucomatous eyes. A 10-fold cross validation assessment shows about 80% sensitivity and 65% accuracy of the rules, resulting in the high performance comparable with human-level classification.

Therefore, discretization of the continuous feature space has to be carried out. In this article we introduce the concept of cost sensitive discretization as a preprocessing step to induction of a classifier and as an elaboration of the error-based discretization method to obtain an optimal multi-interval splitting for each numeric attribute. A transparent description of the method and steps involved in cost sensitive discretization is given. We also evaluate its performance against two other well known methods, i.e, entropy-based discretization and pure error-based discretization on a real life financial dataset. From the algoritmic point of view, we show that an important deficiency from error-based discretization methods can be solved by introducing costs. From the application point of view, we discovered that using a discretization method is recommended. To conclude, we use ROC-curves to illustrate that under particular conditions cost-based discretization may be optimal.
