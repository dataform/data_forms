A computer-based system has been developed for the generation of medical expert opinions an the insulin-resistance syndrome, based on clinical data obtained from primary care physicians. Methods. An expert opinion for each patient was generated by using a decision tree for entering individual text modules and by adding optional free text. The expert opinions were returned by e-mail telefax or by ordinary mail. Results. 1389 primary care physician sent anonymous data sets and requested expert opinions for a total of 3768 patients. Through the set up of a rule-based system an automation of the generation of the expert opinions could be achieved and the generation time dropped from initially 40 minutes to less than 5 minutes at the end. Conclusions. By using predefined text modules and a rule based system a large number of medical expert opinions can be generated with relatively few additional resources.

The main characteristics of the method are expansion and coding of quantitative time-series data. Expansion and coding will result in creation of qualitative difference vector. Qualitative difference vector conveys the full information on the variation of the particular time-series and can be seen as a single point in n-dimensional discrete-space. From discrete-space, symbolic and numeric features are extracted and used for the decision tree construction that is later used in time-series classification. The proposed method was tested in the context of Control Chart Pattern data, which are time-series used in Statistical Process Control. Obtained results are compared with other methods.

Besides, nowadays it is widely accepted the existence of other kinds of uncertainty beyond the classical probabilistic approach. As a consequence, development and adaptation of automatic knowledge acquisition techniques under uncertainty is entirely advisable. Among them the decision tree paradigm is specially suitable to comprehension and readability concerns. This paper provides the definition of a general framework for the induction of decision trees in the presence of uncertainty. A novel approach based on the concept of observational entropy is also introduced.

Our objective was to evaluate the clinical and economic impacts of different diagnostic strategies involving [123 I]FPCIT SPECT. We developed a decision tree model to predict adequate treatment-month equivalents (ATME), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) during a 12-month time horizon in patients with suspected PD referred to a specialized movement disorder outpatient clinic. In our cost-effectiveness analysis, we adopted the perspective of the German health care system and used data from a German prospective health care utilization study (n = 142) and published diagnostic studies. Compared strategies were CE only (EXAM+), SPECT only (SPECT+), SPECT following negative CE (SINGLE+), and SPECT following positive CE (DOUBLE+). Costs of SPECT amounted to EURO789 per investigation. Based on our model, expected costs (and ATME) were EURO946 (52.85 ATME) for EXAM+, EURO1352 (53.40 ATME) for DOUBLE+, EURO1731 (32.82 ATME) for SINGLE+, and EURO2003 (32.96 ATME) for SPECT+; performance of SPECT was induced in 0%, 54%, 56%, and 100% of the patients, respectively. DOUBLE+ was more effective and less expensive than SINGLE+ or SPECT+; thus these two do not offer reasonable choices. The ICER of DOUBLE+ compared to EXAM+ was EURO733 per ATME gained. In sensitivity analyses, the ICER of DOUBLE+ versus EXAM+ ranged front EURO63 to EURO2411 per ATME gained. Whether the diagnostic work-up of patients referred to a specialized movement disorder clinic with a high prevalence of PD should include [I-123]FP-CIT SPECT depends on patient preferences and the decision maker's willingness to pay for adequate early treatment. SPECT should be used as a confirmatory test before treatment initiation and limited to patients with a positive test result in the clinical examination.

In this paper, we use ensemble, methods to identify noisy training examples. More precisely, we consider the problem of mislabeled training examples in classification tasks, and address, this problem by pre-processing the training set, i.e. by identifying and removing outliers from the training set. We study a, number of filter techniques that are based on well-known ensemble methods like cross-validated committees, bagging and boosting. We evaluate these techniques in an Inductive Logic Programming setting and use a first order decision tree algorithm to construct the ensembles.

The idea behind the forest is not only to represent multiple trees, but also to represent test alternatives at all levels of every tree. The resulting tree is in fact a 3-dimensional tree. A two-dimensional slice is equivalent to a single decision tree. The forest allows multiple choices of tests in some or all nodes of the decision tree. These alternative tests can be used to enhance the classification accuracy of the tree. However, the major advantage of having multiple test choices is to have alternative test decisions when features in test data are unreliable or just missing. In the paper, we overview the ideas behind Fuzzy Decision Forest, and we illustrate its enhanced capabilities with a number of experiments with missing features.

Due to this, numerous studies or research has been made to look into various methods of analysis, detection and mitigation. In general, these methods would involve either complex computation for accurate results but suffers from high computation time. Some methods may also be simple and fast but then has the disadvantage of inaccuracy. This paper presents an alternative method of analysing the voltage stability problem by incorporating machine learning techniques, i.e. Fuzzy Decision Tree method. The author proposed a general overview on how the algorithm is created. The Algorithm is then tested using an IEEE 300 bus test system to test the algorithm's capability. Results presented show that the proposed FDT has a lot of future potential as an online tool for voltage stability analysis.

Some methods are considered to be complex, slow but accurate and sonic methods are considered to simple, fast but inaccurate. With the emergence of Machine Learning techniques, a data mining method can also be used as an alternative diagnostic tool. This method is known as Fuzzy Decision Tree. This paper will outline improvements made to an existing fuzzy decision tree method by adding more contributing attributes for partitioning, creating a hybrid Fuzzy Decision Tree.

The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) offers potential advantages regarding efficient computation and ease of knowledge acquisition. However it is a "black box" type approach, which lacks interpretability. The Decision Tree (DT) approach is known for its interpretability but comparatively less accurate. The proposed hybrid approach combines ANN and DT approaches to exploit their potential while suppressing their drawbacks. It applies an ANN for security evaluation of power systems and DT methodology to drive preventive control measures. A divergence based feature selection algorithm has been investigated to select an optimal combination of neural training features. The method has been applied on an IEEE power system and the results obtained are promising.

IV&V is a unique aspect of the software lifecycle, and different methods are necessary to produce quick and accurate results. If quality code indicators could be produced on a per-project basis, then IV&V could proceed in a more straight-forward fashion, saving time and money. This article presents one case study on just such a project, showing that by using the proper metrics and machine learning algorithms, quality indicators can be found as early as 3 months into the IVV process.

Decision trees are very attractive for classification problems, because of their comprehensibility and white box modeling features. However, optimizing the classification accuracy and the tree size is a difficult problem, and to our knowledge very few studies have addressed the issue. This paper presents an automated and simplified genetic programming (GP) based decision tree modeling technique for calibrating software quality classification models. The proposed technique is based on multi-objective optimization using strongly typed GP. Two fitness functions are used to optimize the classification accuracy and tree size of the classification models calibrated for a real-world high-assurance software system. The performances of the classification models are compared with those obtained by standard GP. It is shown that the GP-based decision tree technique yielded better classification models. The technique presented, provides a practical and simplified solution for calibrating prediction models in the presence of multiple objectives, which is often the case during software development.

In many applications, it is important to have good probability estimates as well. This chapter introduces a new algorithm, Bagged Lazy Option Trees (B-LOTs), for constructing decision trees and compares it to an alternative, Bagged Probability Estimation Trees (B-PETs). The quality of the class probability estimates produced by the two methods is evaluated in two ways. First, we compare the ability of the two methods to make good classification decisions when the misclassification costs are asymmetric. Second, we compare the absolute accuracy of the estimates themselves. The experiments show that B-LOTs, produce better decisions and more accurate probability estimates than B-PETs.

But more recently it has been argued that classical rationality should also be rejected even as normative standards for human reasoning. For example, Gigerenzer and Goldstein (1996) and Gigerenzer and Todd (1999a) argue that reasoning involves "fast and frugal" algorithms which are not justified by rational norms, but which succeed in the environment. They provide three lines of argument for this view, based on: (A) the importance of the environment; (B) the existence of cognitive limitations; and (C) the fact that an algorithm with no apparent rational basis, Take-the-Best, succeeds in an judgment task (judging which of two cities is the larger; based on lists of features of each city). We reconsider (A)-(C), arguing that standard patterns of explanation in psychology and the social and biological sciences, use rational norms to explain why simple cognitive algorithms can succeed. We also present new computer simulations that compare Take-the-Best with other cognitive models (which use connectionist, exemplar-based, and decision-tree algorithms). Although Take-the-Best still performs well, it does not perform noticeably better than the other models. We conclude that these results provide no strong reason to prefer Take-the-Best over alternative cognitive models. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

Our approach consists of Web pages structure analysis and semantic clustering for intra-page semantic analysis, and machine learning based link semantic analysis for inter-page analysis. Based on the automatic repetitive patterns discovery in structure level and clustering in semantic level, we explore the intra-page semantic structure of Web pages and extend the processing unit from the whole page to a finer granularity, i.e., semantic information blocks within pages. After observing the various hyperlinks, we synthesize the Web inter-page semantic and define an information organizing oriented hyperlink semantic category. Considering the presentation of the hyperlink carrier and intra-page semantic structure, we propose corresponding feature selection and quantification methods, and then exploit the C4.5 decision-tree method to classify hyperlink semantic type and analyze the inter-page semantic structure. In our experiments, the results suggest that our approch is feasible for machine processing.

Tree automata have been used in pattern recognition tasks to represent some features of objects to be classified. Here we propose a method that combines both approaches to solve a classical problem in pattern recognition such as Optical Character Recognition. We propose a method which is organized in two stages: (1) we use a grammatical inference technique to represent some structural features of the characters and, (2) we obtain edit distances between characters in order to design a decision tree; The combination of both methods benefits from their individual characteristics and is formulated as a coherent unifying strategy.,	Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Sistemas Informat & Computac, E-46071 Valencia, Spain	Sempere, JM (reprint author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Sistemas Informat & Computac, E-46071 Valencia, Spain.

A simple alternative to bagging is to partition the data into disjoint subsets. Experiments with decision tree and neural network classifiers on various datasets show that, given the same size partitions and bags, disjoint partitions result in performance equivalent to, or better than, bootstrap aggregates (bags). Many applications (e.g., protein structure prediction) involve use of datasets that are too large to handle in the memory of the typical computer. Hence, bagging with samples the size of the data is impractical. Our results indicate that, in such applications, the simple approach of creating a committee of n classifiers from disjoint partitions each of size 1/n (which will be memory resident during learning) in a distributed way results in a classifier which has a bagging-like performance gain. The use of distributed disjoint partitions in learning is significantly less complex and faster than bagging. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The problem of selecting a good data source is difficult because some peers may not be encountered more than once, and many peers are on low-bandwidth connections. Despite these facts, information obtained about peers just prior to the download can help guide peer selection. A client can gain additional time savings by aborting bad download attempts until an acceptable peer is discovered. We denote as peer selection the entire process of switching among peers and finally settling on one. Our main contribution is to use the methodology of machine learning for the construction of good peer selection strategies from past experience. Decision tree learning is used for rating peers based on low-cost information, and Markov decision processes are used for deriving a policy for switching among peers. Preliminary results with the Gnutella network demonstrate the promise of this approach.

New bedside rapid flu tests (RFT) should increase the number of influenza-positive patients whom receive zanamivir appropriately. Objective: To estimate the economic effects of implementing RFT and zanamivir among unvaccinated healthy working adults who consult within 2 days of the onset of influenza-like symptoms. Methods: We constructed a decision tree to perform a cost-benefit analysis from a societal perspective. Clinical outcome, i.e. number of influenza days averted, and societal costs were compared for three strategies: (i) RFT and conditional zanamivir prescription; (ii) systematic zanamivir prescription; and (iii) no zanamivir. A two-way sensitivity analysis was performed including the proportion of influenza-positive patients. Results: During influenza epidemics, systematic zanamivir prescription provided the best health outcome (0.81 influenza days averted) and minimised societal costs (reduced by $US29.80 per person compared with no zanamivir; 1999 values). RFT with conditional zanamivir averted 0.65 influenza days and saved $US14.40 per person. When the proportion of influenza-positive patients was under 39%, the no zanamivir strategy yielded the greatest societal savings; otherwise, systematic zanamivir was the dominant strategy. Medical costs associated with no zanamivir were $US88.70 per patient consulting with influenza-like illness, and increased to $US125.50 with systematic zanamivir and to $US127.60 with RFT and conditional zanamivir. Conclusions: Due to poor sensitivity of current RFT, systematic zanamivir prescription without RFT for unvaccinated healthy working adults should be recommended during influenza epidemics.

J	Berggren, F; Johansson, L				Berggren, F; Johansson, L			Cost effectiveness of nasal budesonide versus surgical treatment for nasal polyps	PHARMACOECONOMICS			English	Article							ALLERGIC RHINITIS; FLUTICASONE PROPIONATE; EFFICACY; MANAGEMENT; POWDER; SPRAY	Objective: To conduct a cost-effectiveness study of nasal budesonide versus surgical treatment in the management of nasal polyps. Design and methods: A decision-tree model reflecting two different treatment strategies for nasal polyps in Sweden was developed. The first strategy was initial polypectomy, performed under three different sets of circumstances: inpatient functional endoscopic surgery, outpatient evulsion with sedation, or outpatient evulsion with local anaesthesia; all treatments were followed by intranasal treatment with budesonide (Rhinocort(R)) 128mug twice daily. The second strategy was initial intranasal treatment with budesonide 128mug twice daily. Perspective: Healthcare provider perspective. Outcome measures and results: After 1 month, treatment with nasal budesonide was classified as a success (82.5%) or a failure (17.5%) based on clinical study data. In cases of success, the treatment was continued, and in cases of failure, polypectomy was undertaken, followed by budesonide 128mug twice daily. Treatments were evaluated after 4 months using prices from the Central Hospital in Skovde, Sweden. The expected reduction in cost from using initial nasal budesonide treatment compared with the different alternatives of polypectomy were 9760 Swedish kronors (SEK) for inpatient functional endoscopic surgery, SEK2747 for outpatient evulsion with sedation, and SEK672 for outpatient evulsion with anaesthesia (1998 values). Nasal budesonide 128 mug twice daily treatment for nasal polyps revealed a potential reduction in costs of 53% compared with the primary surgery approach. Conclusion: Initial treatment of nasal polyps with nasal budesonide provides lower costs than treatment with initial polypectomy with maintained effectiveness.

J	Tavakoli, M				Tavakoli, M			Modelling therapeutic strategies in the treatment of osteoarthritis - An economic evaluation of meloxicam versus diclofenac and piroxicam	PHARMACOECONOMICS			English	Article							NONSTEROIDAL ANTIINFLAMMATORY DRUGS; GASTROINTESTINAL TOXICITY; COX-2 INHIBITORS; TRIAL; CYCLOOXYGENASE-2; TOLERABILITY; ROFECOXIB; NSAIDS; PAIN	Objective: To assess the economic efficiency of meloxicam, a cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 selective inhibitor. versus diclofenac and piroxicam in the UK for the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis and the impact on the NHS budget of substituting nonselective NSAIDs with meloxicam. Methods and perspective: A decision analytical model was used to compare the effects of 4 weeks' treatment of osteoarthritis with meloxicam (7.5 mg/day), diclofenac (100 mg/day) and piroxicam (20 mg/day). The decision tree was derived by combining best practice and clinical reality. Analysis was from the NHS perspective. The study considered only the direct costs. These included costs for drug acquisition and management of all adverse events. both serious gastrointestinal events requiring hospitalisation. and non-serious events that required maintenance, Resource use and treatment costs were obtained from local and published sources. A range of sensitivity analyses was carried out. Results: Based on two 4-week large-scale trials. the Meloxicam Large-scale International Study Safety Assessment (MELISSA) and Safety and Efficacy Large-scale Evaluation of COX-inhibiting Therapies (SELECT) trials. and a decision analytical model. the findings suggested that meloxicam had the lowest cost per patient (00 versus 05 for piroxicam and pound51 for diclofenac [costs presented as 1998 values except for drug costs which were in 2000 values]). The results of the Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis, using 4000 samples, suggested that meloxicam was the optimal strategy in the drug treatment of patients with osteoarthritis compared with nonselective NSAIDs both individually and as a group. The cost savings were due to lower levels of serious adverse events accompanied by fewer days in intensive care units and shorter overall duration of hospital stay observed with meloxicam compared with diclofenac and piroxicam in the 4-week trials, Conclusions: Based on the 4-week trial period, meloxicam was predicted to be the lowest cost drug therapy, and thus the optimal drug therapy, in the management of patients with osteoarthritis compared with nonselective NSAIDs such as diclofenac and piroxicam. Applying the cost savings per patient derived from the model, switching patients from piroxicam and diclofenac to meloxicam would indicate a cost saving of over pound25 million per annum. Models such as this can facilitate better clinical guidance and is a useful way Of assessing treatment outcomes.

J	Levy, E; Gabriel, S; Dinet, J				Levy, E; Gabriel, S; Dinet, J			The comparative medical costs of atherothrombotic disease in European countries	PHARMACOECONOMICS			English	Article							CORONARY HEART-DISEASE; MONICA PROJECT POPULATIONS; RISK-FACTORS; EVENT RATES; STROKE; CARE; MORTALITY; TRENDS; FRANCE; TRIAL	Background: The clinical manifestations of atherothrombotic disease include ischaemic heart disease (including myocardial infarction [MI]) and cerebrovascular disease (including ischaemic stroke [IS]). Although costs generated by the clinical manifestations of atherothrombotic disease represent an important economic burden for any healthcare system, very few economic comparative data are available. Objective: To: (i) assess management costs of the different practice patterns for acute and chronic phases for MI, IS and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in eight European countries; and (ii) to simulate the cost of managing a patient with an atherothrombotic disease for 2 years in Europe. Study perspective: Healthcare system. Methods: Firstly, the medical costs of managing MI and IS were analysed during the acute phase and subsequent 6-month periods over a total of 2 years. In each case, a decision tree was designed to indicate resource use. Assumptions concerning patient management and resource use were based on currently available local and international literature, official national statistics and local expert opinions (Delphi panel). Costs were assessed using diagnosis-related groups (Austria, Italy, Portugal and Sweden), or hospital databases and national tariffs (Belgium, France, Spain and Switzerland). Secondly, these costs were correlated to data from a large randomised clinical trial to estimate the overall cost per patient with atherothrombotic disease over a 2-year period. Results: For MI, there was a 2-fold difference in costs between the eight countries (E9512-18 293), with 47-76% of costs devoted to acute management, 14-48% to follow-up management during the first year, and 4-17% to follow-up during the second year. For IS, there was a 10-fold difference (E5607-56370), with 18-75% devoted to follow-up for the years 1995-1997. Conclusions: There are differences in the overall costs and cost breakdown in the clinical management patterns of MI and IS in Europe. These differences seem to arise as a result of local treatment pattern specificities as well as the availability of specific and well-adapted structures for patients' rehabilitation. Further studies are necessary to fully explain these differences. The assessment of the total medical costs of managing an atherothrombotic patient over a 2-year period (MI, IS, established PAD) has to take into account the risk of ischaemic events in different vascular areas (MI, IS or major leg ischaemia).

J	Hasegawa, T; Imai, H; Miki, S				Hasegawa, T; Imai, H; Miki, S			Cost evaluation of basiliximab treatment for renal transplant patients in Japan	PHARMACOECONOMICS			English	Article							ACUTE REJECTION EPISODES; ACUTE CELLULAR REJECTION; ALLOGRAFT RECIPIENTS; RANDOMIZED TRIAL; CYCLOSPORINE; DETERMINANTS; SURVIVAL; THERAPY	Background: International phase III studies (CHIB 201 and 352) showed that basiliximab, a high affinity chimeric monoclonal antibody interleukin-2 receptor antagonist, is highly effective in preventing acute rejection when used as immunoprophylaxis in patients receiving cyclosporin (Neoral(R)). We conducted a cost evaluation by applying international clinical results to standard Japanese medical practice. Objective: To evaluate the impact of basiliximab in renal transplant patients receiving conventional immunosuppressive therapy using cyclosporin and corticosteroids from the perspective of the healthcare payer in Japan. Study design: A decision tree model was developed, comprising seven pathways with key clinical events identified after the transplantation. The average first-year treatment costs after transplantation for patients treated with and without basiliximab were calculated using the model. A sensitivity analysis was done to measure the degree of influence of several criteria including the incidences of rejection, and rejection responding to steroid pulse therapy and antibody therapy. Methods: Estimates of key clinical events were derived from the international studies. Calculation of direct medical costs were made from the payers' perspective, based on the Social Insurance Medical Fee Table in Japan. The cost of basiliximab was assumed as zero. Main outcome measures and results: Basiliximab use produced an estimated saving of Y315 807 (2000 values) during the first year after transplantation. Reduced acute rejection treatment and dialysis most influenced the cost saving. The sensitivity analysis showed that the average cost for a patient was lower in the basiliximab group and that the model was effective within the plausible range of each criterion that would reflect renal transplantation in Japan. Conclusions: If the cost of basiliximab is less than Y315 807, the clinical and economic benefits of basiliximab in the first year after transplantation support the routine use of basiliximab in renal transplantation in Japan.

Materials and Methods: A literature-based, decision-tree model was developed to project the number of patients achieving glycosylated haemoglobin values of <7% on oral therapies and the associated costs over a 3-year timeframe. For each first-line strategy, patients could progress to combination therapy using two or more. agents prior to the introduction of insulin. The overall cost of treatment included costs (2001/2002 values; $US) of comprehensive medical care, laboratory tests, patient education, drug therapy, home glucose monitoring and adverse events. Results: At 3 years, the overall cost of treatment for the various first-line strategies was $US6106 for glipizide gastrointestinal therapeutic system, $US6727 for metformin immediate release, $US,6826 for metformin extended release, $US7141 for glibenclamide (glyburide)/metformin, $US7759 for rosiglitazone and $US9298 for repaglinide. Costs of comprehensive routine medical care ranged from approximately $US1538-2128 in year 1 and from approximately $US952-1543 in subsequent years, for controlled and uncontrolled patients, respectively. Adverse events represented <1%, and drug therapies represented approximately 50%, of the overall cost, respectively. Substantial cost differences between the strategies were seen within the first year. Regardless of first-line therapy, patients progressed quickly to combination therapies, with effectiveness among the agents being similar. Conclusions: Short-term costs required to provide comprehensive diabetes care and achieve glycemic goals can be substantial.

J	de Bruin, S; Hunter, GJ				de Bruin, S; Hunter, GJ			Making the trade-off between decision quality and information cost	PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							DESIGN; POLLUTION; TREES	A growing problem confronting users of remotely sensed. imagery is whether the use of additional or different imagery to improve decision quality is actually justified by its cost. This paper discusses how to compare these competing factors so that an acceptable trade-off may be made between them. The proposed method is based on probabilistic cost-benefit analysis. The concept of "value of information" is introduced in a practical case study using remote sensing to verify farmers' declarations for a crop subsidy program in the European Union. Application of the method requires that (1) the problem at hand can be represented by a decision tree, (2) the desirability of each decision outcome can be expressed numerically, (3) the imagery reveals information about the occurrence of events not under the decision maker's control, and (4), the probabilities of these events and the extent to which they are detectable in remotely sensed imagery can be assessed.

In this paper we present a modification of the learning algorithm for Bayesian networks with a local decision graph representation suggested in Chickering et al. (1997), which is often more efficient. It rests on the idea to exploit the decision graph structure not only to capture a larger set of regularities than decision trees can, but also to improve the learning process. In addition, we study the influence of the properties of the evaluation measure used on the learning time and identify three classes of evaluation measures.

Only recently there have been attempts to reduce costs and to implement more complex components by the application of preform technology. This article indicates the most appropriate application fields for LCM techniques for the manufacture of fibre reinforced polymers. Different LCM methods are described and summarised. The preforming techniques and particularly the sew-and-cut philosophy for developing a tailored reinforcement is explained. Investigations designed to elucidate the influence of sewing parameters and thread properties have led to an understanding of the requirements and preform characteristics needed to operate the quality controlled LCM process. Some concepts related to the control of the resin injection are described, and a realization of a decision-tree-concept is shown. Finally, a comparison of cost effects for different preforming methods shows a need to define a "critical preforming effort" to manufacture quality components as well as economically optimised parts.

One reason is that NNs are good both for batch learning and for incremental learning. Batch learning is important for obtaining an initial controller using existing data, while incremental learning is useful for refining the controller using newly observed data. One drawback in using NN controller is that the knowledge learned by an NN is difficult to understand and to re-use. The goal of this study is to interpret an evolved NN controller using a decision tree (DT). For this purpose it is necessary to generate a good training set from which the most consistent DT can be induced. This paper introduces several simple methods for generating the training set. The efficiency and effecacy of these methods are verified through expeirments.	Univ Aizu, Aizwakamatsu 9658580, Japan	Sakamoto, K (reprint author), Univ Aizu, Aizwakamatsu 9658580, Japan.

One is symbolic approach and another is sub-symbolic approach. Decision tree (DT) is a typical model for symbolic learning, and neural network (NN) is a popular model for sub-symbolic learning. Neural network tree (NNTree) is a DT with each non-terminal node being an expert NN. NNTree is a learning model that may combine the advantages of both DT and NN. Through experiments we found that the size of an NNTree is usually proportional to the number of training data. Thus, we can produce small trees by using partial training data. In most cases, however, this will decrease the performance of the tree. In this paper, we propose a two step algorithm to produce small NNTrees. The first step is to get a small NNTree using partial data, and the second step is to increase the performance through retraining. The effectiveness of this algorithm is verified through experiments with public databases.

The overall structure is a decision tree (DT), and each non-terminal node is an expert neural network (ENN). Generally speaking, NNTrees can achieve better performance than conventional DTs with fewer nodes, and the performance of the tree can be improved through incremental teaming. In addition, the NNTrees can be interpreted in polynomial time if the number of inputs for each ENN is limited. In this paper, we propose a multiple objective optimization based genetic algorithm (MOO-GA) for designing interpretable and comprehensible NNTrees. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is validated by experimental results.

In this contribution, novel digital signal processing techniques are employed to achieve this task. Classification decision tree algorithms have been used recently in pattern recognition problems. In this paper, we are proposing a self-designing system, using the classification tree algorithms, capable of recognizing a large number of signals. Preprocessing techniques are used to make the recognition process more effective. A combination of the original as well as the preprocessed signals is projected into different transform domains. A large number of criteria, that characterize the signals, can be developed in these domains. At each node of the classification tree, an appropriately selected less-complex and more noise-immune criterion is optimized and employed by the vector quantization (VQ) design techniques to divide the signals, presented at that node in that stage, into two approximately equal groups. ne use of VQ leads to high classification accuracy even with noisy data. At the terminal node of the tree, each signal is represented by a unique composite binary word index. Experimental results verify the excellent classification accuracy of this system even for noisy or corrupted data.

One such divide and conquer method is learning from soft partitions of data. By examining the decomposition of classifier error into bias and variance terms, we see that learning from smaller partitions of data introduces higher variance. In this paper, we investigate the use of a particular variance reduction technique, randomized C4.5, when learning from soft partitions of data. This approach maintains the distributed nature of the learning algorithm while boosting the overall classification accuracy. Experiments on six machine learning datasets demonstrate the improved accuracy gains by reducing classifier variance. In particular, learning from soft partitions of data can produce more accurate classifiers than using an ensemble of randomized decision trees constructed from the entire dataset, which in turn results in a more accurate classifier than building a single decision tree.

The fuzzy C-means method is applied to rind a number of central means for each continuous-valued feature and thus discretize such features. The ID3 algorithm is subsequently used to build a decision tree from the discretized data. Preliminary experiments using a real-world time-series data set from the Louisiana coast are reported that compare our method with the OC1 system for oblique decision tree learning. The experiment results seem to suggest that the proposed hybrid method achieves better or comparable classification accuracy.

Traditional sound recognizer utilizes decision-tree based method and causes a problem where the parameter is not generalized. The HMM based sound recognizer has been introduced to resolve this drawback. However, it adopts spectrum parameter and will result in high dimensional feature vectors. This paper successfully solves the shortcoming by taking the basis extraction. The recognition rate is about 82% while only spectrogram is adopted as the parameter. The improved recognition rate is about 95% while three mentioned MPEG-7 audio LLDs are regarded as the parameters in our environmental sound-recognizer. These three MPEG-7 audio LLDs are Audio Spectrum Centroid Descriptor, Audio Spectrum Spread Descriptor and Audio Spectrum Flatness Descriptor.

Previous registration methods include fixed-interval binning and the 0.1%-rule. We proposed a new peak registration algorithm via normal mixture models. It better approximates the underlying biophysical process where the noises are assumed to be Gaussian. The algorithm was tested on a 22-sample lung cancer data set (11 cases of normal, 11 cases of cancer). After the peak registration, we achieved an overall classification rate of 90.9%, with a false-negative rate of 0%. To avoid overfitting, we run a cross-validation. The non-optimistic success rate was 86.4% by leave-one-out method. It was achieved by a very simple decision-tree classifier with only one node. In addition to classifications, another goal of this study was to find relevant features as tumor marker proteins. We identified the peaks at m/z of 12 384 and 17 941, which correspond to two previous known markers for lung cancer diagnostics. In addition, we identified novel markers at 11 219; 10 305; 7 696; 15 674; 20 589; and 10 872. These findings allow us to further test their relevance in the experimental biology of lung cancer.

Four level-0 models were developed: an Artificial Neural Network, a Decision Tree, a Nearest Neighbor Classifier, and a Hybrid model that trained an Artificial Neural Network using those inputs selected as important by the Decision Tree. These models were developed from both a random sampling of the training dataset and a sampling designed to ensure an equal distribution of the localization variable. The predictions of these level-0 models were used to develop three level-1 generalizers: an Artificial Neural Network, a Decision Tree, and a Naive Bayesian Classifier. The accuracy rates of the various models and generalizers suggest a modestly improved performance when using stacked generalization. Among the level-0 models, the Nearest Neighbor and the Hybrid performed slightly better than the Artificial Neural Network and Decision Tree. The performance of the three level-1 generalizers was roughly equivalent. Overall, both level-0 models and level-1 generalizers achieved better accuracy when equal distribution sampling was not performed.

Using expression data from 108 known breast cancer-related genes for 75 patients with various diseases of the breast, we are able to induce decision trees with 89% accuracy in separating cancer from non-cancer patients in a cross-validation test. We also show that by inducing a separate decision tree for each cancer-related gene, and using the expression level of the individual gene as the decision variable, it is possible to obtain decision trees which aid the understanding of signaling pathways involved in breast cancer. In addition, we also show that the C4.5 algorithm is able to identify key breast cancer genes when decision trees are induced on expression data sets containing randomly selected genes. This result indicates that it is possible to make biological discoveries when applying decision tree algorithms to large sets of gene expression data in diseases where the genetic basis is not well characterised.

The observed behavioral aspects in decision-making, such as, hyperbolic time preference, loss aversion, dynamically-shifting reference point, asymmetric perception of uncertainty, limited memory, and over-optimism, are discussed. These behavioral features are incorporated in an optimization framework for the creation of more robust decision-aid systems for long-term financial planning. Some computational results are demonstrated for the tradeoff between immediate consumption and long-term savings. Decision tree models are used for the stochastic evolution of investment returns.

For example, training time is long, the topology is not specified, and so on. Since the decision tree and neural network are similar in classification and have equivalent property, a decision tree can be used to provide a systematic design method of neural network. In this paper, we propose a new mapping between decision tree and neural network that can accurately specify the number of units, layers, connection and initial setting of parameters of neural network. Further, we quote two theorems to show that the mapping is reasonable.

Mining frequent patterns in many kinds of databases has been studied in data mining research areas. With an enormous amount of data stored in databases and data warehouses, it is increasingly important to develop powerful tools for analysis of such data and mining interesting knowledge from it. Most of the previous studies adopted Apriori Algorithm or Apriori-like candidate set generation-and-test approach. Recently, a novel FP-tree structure mining method is based on FP-tree Algorithm without candidate generation. Data mining is a process of inferring knowledge from such huge data. Data Mining rules have been proposed and integrated in World Wide Web Applications platforms many research project using Data Mining algorithms such as Memory based reasoning, Association Rules, Neural Network Genetic Algorithm, Decision Tree, ID3, C4.5, C5:0 Mining Algorithm, to emulate web services prototype platform model to provide the necessity of integrating various data sources, such as server access logs, referrer logs, user registration or profile information. Since finding interesting association rules in databases may disclose some useful patterns for decision support, selective marketing, financial forecast, medical diagnosis, and many other applications, it has attracted a lot of attention in recent data mining research. We survey some of the emerging tools such as Frequent Patterns with FP-tree algorithm and identify several future research directions. Web mining can be broadly defined. as the discovery and analysis of useful information from the World Wide Web, and analysis of user access patterns from one or more web servers or on-line services.

At a high level, the key to achieving this is to specify requirements just in time and containing just enough detail. This paper applies the following XP practices and concepts to the RFP process: acceptance tests, business value, iterative & incremental delivery, on-site customer, pair development, planning game, spike, story, velocity, and yesterday's weather. In addition, the following concepts are combined with those from XP to achieve maximal benefit: user-goal use. case; context diagram, level of detail, and decision tree.

Random Forest is used here to measure the relative importance of each input variable in the data. The technique is fast and can greatly reduce the number of variables with little compromise, especially for highly redundant data like neural ensemble spike trains. It also naturally preserves the identiflability of the original information source unlike other techniques, for example the Principal Component Analysis that mixes up the content of the variables irrecoverably and projects it into different set of variables.

Using NNTrees, it is possible to learn new knowledge on-line by adjusting the NNs in the non-terminal nodes. It is also possible to understand the learned knowledge on-line because the NNs in the non-terminal nodes are usually very small, and can be interpreted easily. Currently, we have studied retraining of the NNTrees by adjusting the NNs in the non-terminal nodes. The structure of the trees is fixed during retraining. We found that this kind of retraining is good for size reduction in off-line learning, if the training set is highly redundant. However, updating the NNs alone is not enough for on-line learning. In this paper, we introduce two methods for on-line learning of NNTrees. The first one is SGU (simple growing up), and the second one is GUWL (growing up with learning). The effectiveness of these methods are compared with each other through experiments with several public databases.

Neural networks have been used previously to make diagnostic classifications of corneal disease using summary statistics as network inputs. This approach neglects global shape features (used by clinicians when they make their diagnosis) and produces results that are difficult to interpret clinically. In this study we propose the use of Zernike polynomials to model the global shape of the cornea and use the polynomial coefficients as features for a decision tree classifier. We use this model to classify a sample of normal patients and patients with corneal distortion caused by keratoconus. Extensive experimental results, including a detailed study on enhancing model performance via adaptive boosting and bootstrap aggregation leads us to conclude that the proposed method can be highly accurate and a useful tool for clinicians. Moreover, the resulting model is easy to interpret using visual cues.

In this paper, we revisit this problem, with a new goal, i.e. Can we develop an efficient parallel algorithm Jor decision tree construction that can be parallelized in the same way as algorithms Jor other major mining tasks ?. We report a new approach to decision tree construction, which we refer to as SPIES (Statistical Pruning of Intervals for Enhanced Scalability). This approach combines RainForest based AVC groups with sampling to achieve memory efficient processing of numerical attributes. Overall, this algorithm has the following properties: 1) no preprocessing or sorting of input data is required, 2) the size of the data-structure required in the main memory is very small, 3) the only disk-traffic required is one pass for splitting nodes for each level of the tree, and no writing-back of data, 4) very low communication volume when this algorithm is parallelized, and 5) the same level of accuracy as an algorithm that does not use sampling or pruning. We show that this algorithm can be efficiently parallelized using the same high-level interface and runtime support that was previously used to parallelize association mining and clustering algorithms. This, we believe, is an important step towards offering high-level interfaces for parallel data mining. Moreover, we have efficiently parallelized this algorithm on a cluster of SMPs, i.e. combining shared memory and distributed memory parallelism, and over disk-resident datasets.

The visual-based approach to decision tree construction has gained increasing popularity. We present Star-Class, a new interactive visual classification method. This method maps multi-dimensional data to the visual display using star coordinates, allowing the user to interact with the display to create a decision tree. Preliminary evaluation indicates that this new technique is as effective as state-of-the-art algorithmic classification methods, and more effective than the previous visual-based methods. Star-Class also offers additional advantages such as improving the user's understanding of the data.

Then two new features were added: a data massaging to emphasise the data and a fast and efficient Growing and Pruning algorithm for DT construction. In addition, the use of the new context dependent units to build word models was addressed. The benchmark Bahl approach gave recognition rates clearly outperforming those of context independent phone-like units. Finally the new methodology improves over the benchmark DT approach.			isplopek@vc.ehu.es; ccpgrrom@si.ehu.es; aitzol@si.ehu.es; ccphegom@si.ehu.es; iepzugee@vc.ehu.es; nerea@si.ehu.es	Zulueta, Ekaitz/B-8028-2009				BAHL RL, P IEEE ICASSP 94, P533; Breiman L., 1984, CLASSIFICATION REGRE; DEIPINA KL, 2000, P ICSLP BEIJ, V2, P531; DEIPINA KL, DECISION TREES INTER; FELDMAN JA, 1990, TR90009 ICSI; GELFAND SB, 1991, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V13, P163, DOI 10.1109/34.67645; KUHN R, P IEEE ICASSP 95, P552; Odell J., 1995, THESIS CAMBRIDGE U; YOUNG SJ, 1994, ARPA HUM LANG TECHN, P286	9	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743	3-540-20590-X	LECT NOTES COMPUT SC			2003	2905						259	265				7	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BY19C	WOS:000188097600031

This matching process accounts for the most resource intensive task of an IDS. Many systems perform the matching by comparing each input event to all rules sequentially. This is far from being optimal. Although sometimes ad-hoc optimizations axe utilized, no general solution to this problem has been proposed so far. This paper describes an approach where machine learning clustering techniques are applied to improve the matching process. Given a set of signatures (each dictating. a number of constraints the input data must fulfill to trigger it) an algorithm generates a decision tree that is used to find malicious events using as few redundant comparisons as possible. This general idea has been applied to a network-based IDS. In particular, a system has been implemented that replaces the detection engine of Snort [14,16]. Experimental evaluation shows that the speed of the detection process has been significantly improved, even compared to Snort's recently released, fully revised detection engine.

However, most of the analyzing methods are only available off-line. Last year we introduced a new idea which uses a time series-based decision tree induction to generate rules on-line. This paper follows that idea and introduces the approach in detail. We implemented this approach as a library function and are therefore able to use on-line coaches of various teams in order to test the method. The tests are based on two 'models.': (a) the behavior of a goalkeeper, and (b) the pass behavior of the opponent players. The approach generates propositional rules (first rules after 1000 cycles) which have to be pruned and interpreted in order to use this new knowledge for one's own team. We discuss the outcome of the tests in detail and conclude that on-line learning despite of the lack of time is not only possible but can become an effective method for one's own team.

Agents can sense their environment and share data to make optimal decisions for the benefit of the group. Evolutionary algorithm based data mining is conducted to determine the form of the membership functions for the fuzzy root concepts, rules and fuzzy decision tree structure. The resource manager is made up of four trees, the isolated platform tree, the multi-platform tree, the fuzzy parameter selection tree and the fizzy strategy tree. The self-organizing property of the multi-platform tree and the ability of the isolated platform tree to determine the intenionst of an enemy are discussed. The five approaches to validating the expert system are reviewed Finally, results are provided that show the ability of platforms controlled by the resource manager to respond to incoming threats significantly improving the allied group's security.

J	Aaronson, S				Aaronson, S			Algorithms for Boolean function query properties	SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article						algorithm; Boolean function; truth table; query complexity; quantum computation	DECISION TREE COMPLEXITY; QUANTUM LOWER BOUNDS	We investigate efficient algorithms for computing Boolean function properties relevant to query complexity. Such properties include, for example, deterministic, randomized, and quantum query complexities; block sensitivity; certificate complexity; and degree as a real polynomial. The algorithms compute the properties, given an n-variable function's truth table (of size N = 2(n)) as input. Our main results are the following: - O(N log(2) (3) log N) algorithms for many common properties, - an O(Nlog(2) (5) log N) algorithm for block sensitivity, - an O( N) algorithm for testing "quasi symmetry," - a notion of a " tree decomposition" of a Boolean function, proof that the decomposition is unique, and an O(N log(2) (3) log N) algorithm for finding it, - a subexponential-time approximation algorithm for space-bounded quantum query complexity. To develop this algorithm, we give a new way to search systematically through unitary matrices using finite-precision arithmetic. The algorithms discussed have been implemented in a linkable library.

The controller must be able to make decisions based on rules provided by experts. The fuzzy logic approach allows the direct incorporation of expertise. Genetic algorithm based optimization is conducted to determine the form of the membership functions for the fuzzy root concepts. The resource manager is made up of five parts, the isolated platform model, the multi-platform model, the fuzzy EA model, the fuzzy parameter selection tree and the fuzzy strategy tree. Automatic determination of fuzzy decision tree topology using a genetic program, an algorithm that uses the theory of evolution to create other algorithms is discussed. A tree originally obtained from expertise is compared to a tree evolved using a genetic program. The tree created by the genetic program is superior for some applications to one constructed solely based on expertise. The concept of self-morphing trees, i.e., decision trees that can change their own computational complexity in real-time is introduced. The strategy tree concept and how various fuzzy concepts overlap in phase space to create a more robust resource manager are considered. Finally, methods of validating the algorithm are discussed.

For this purpose, we applied two methodologies: a decision tree approach utilising Quinlan's See5 machine learning environment was compared with a modification of Cox's regression, a statistical approach and the two systems evaluated for classification accuracy. Data from 747 lower limb and 487 upper limb cases were analysed, with the model being extracted from key parameters, which were retrieved from the original database. We also used information from the medical personnel involved and indicators of significance from preliminary studies. Exactly the same model and parameters were utilised in both approaches to ensure comparability. Results are given for the classification performance for both approaches, with respect to the length of stay.

A new sinkhole probability map for Goodhue County is in production. The existing maps were constructed as paper maps with boundaries drawn by the maps' authors using subjective criteria. As part of the transition of this mapping effort into a digital GIS environment, we have attempted to quantify the map-making process to reduce the potential for subjective biases for developing sinkhole probability maps. Based on the distribution of distances to the nearest sinkhole and the sinkhole density in Fillmore County, a mathematical decision tree model has been developed to construct maps of relative sinkhole risk. The decision tree model was implemented to construct a revised map of relative sinkhole risk in Fillmore County using ArcView and ArcInfo GIS. To facilitate the comparison with the original maps the six probability zones were revised as six relative risk zones. The decision tree model reproduces most of the important features seen on the original maps in the high density areas and has led to new insights about the internal structure of high density areas. The model is less successful in capturing the details of the lower density areas where the subjective criteria are more significant and has no simple way of extrapolating across areas in which the sinkholes have not been mapped.

We describe an intelligent payload concept which processes RF lightning signal data onboard the spacecraft in a power-aware manner. Presently, onboard processing is severely curtailed due to the conventional management of limited resources and power-unaware payload designs. Delays of days to weeks are commonly experienced before raw data is received, processed into a human-usable format, and finally transmitted to the end-user. We enable this resource-critical technology of onboard processing through the concept of Algorithm Power Modulation (APM). APM is a decision process used to execute a specific software algorithm, from a suite of possible algorithms, to make the best use of the available power. The suite of software algorithms chosen for our application is intended to reduce the probability of false alarms through post-processing. Each algorithm however also has a cost in energy usage. A heuristic decision tree procedure is used which selects an algorithm based on the available power, time allocated, algorithm priority, and algorithm performance. We demonstrate our approach to power-aware onboard processing through a preliminary software simulation.

Normally, the training set is discarded once the training process is complete. By imprinting information about the training population onto the classifier, we can make use of the extrema at each node as "canaries", warning us that we have left the well explored area of parameter space and have crossed into a domain where the classifier is unreliable. This technique can identify training set deficiencies; provide reliability estimates for decision tree classifiers; improve the results of multi-tree voting; and provide helpful visualization tools.

For this purpose the multi-attribute decision theory was chosen as the methodology that provided the index main structure. Following this methodology a decision tree was built having three main branches or general attributes: financial evaluation, in-walls, and out-walls. Some of the attributes considered within the financial indicators were: economic value added, return of investment, expenses of operation, index of maintenance. Among the indoor indicators there were: power intensity, labor productivity, environmental management, & internal production. For the out-walls indicators we considered: power consumption per capita, regional production and certificate of clean industry, among others. This index was applied to a Mexican refinery, but it was designed so it could be applied to other industries with some modifications. The application of the index allows to identify in a prioritized way the problems that the industry has to solve in order to be congruent with the sustainable development of the region where it is located.

Use was made of the recently developed Mine Waste Decision Tree for assessing aquatic toxicity. The Chicago Tunnel site (off Schafer Gulch, which drains into Henson Creek) is an actively draining adit whose water is a pH of 6.5. The Golden Wonder Complex (which can drain into the Gunnison River just below Lake San Cristobel) consists of two adits that had only a trickle of water flowing from them whose pH was between 4.5 and 5.5. Two features of the decision tree were especially useful: when the paste pH of the mine waste pile is less than 5, then water flowing from that pile can be considered to be toxic to the aquatic environment; and the leachate tests used in the decision tree provide a good indication of the element concentration pattern that would be found in water flowing from the waste pile. The assessment found that the Chicago Tunnel water and waste pile represented little threat to the environment. However, the Water flowing from the Golden Wonder Complex would be quite toxic if it ever reached the Gunnison River.

On its accuracy and efficiency	THIRD IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd IEEE International Conference on Data Mining	NOV 19-22, 2003	MELBOURNE, FL	IEEE Comp Soc TCCI, IEEE Comp Soc TCPAMI			TREES	Inductive learning searches an optimal hypothesis that minimizes a given loss function. It is usually assumed that the simplest hypothesis that fits the data is the best approximate to an optimal hypothesis. Since finding the simplest hypothesis is NP-hard for most representations, we generally employ various heuristics to search its closest match. Computing these heuristics incurs significant cost, making learning inefficient and unscalable for large dataset. In the same time, it is still questionable if the simplest hypothesis is indeed the closest approximate to the optimal model. Recent success of combining multiple models, such as bagging, boosting and meta-learning, has greatly improved the accuracy of the simplest hypothesis, providing a strong argument against the optimality of the simplest hypothesis. However computing these combined hyotheses incurs significantly higher cost. In this paper, we first advert that as long as the error of a hypothesis on each example is within a range dictated by a given loss function, it can still be optimal. Contrary to common beliefs, we propose a completely random decision tree algorithm that achieves much higher accuracy than the single best hypothesis and is comparable to boosted or bagged multiple best hypotheses. The advantage of multiple random tree is its training efficiency as well as minimal memory requirement.

Markov Blankets inform feature selection, aid in causal discovery and serve as a basis for scalable methods of constructing Bayesian networks. This paper applies decision tree induction to the task of Markov Blanket identification. Notably, we compare (a) C5.0, a widely used algorithm for decision rule induction, (b) C5C, which post-processes C5.0's rule set to retain the most frequently referenced variables and (c) PC, a standard method for Bayesian Network induction. C5C performs as well as or better than C5.0 and PC across a number of data sets. Our modest variation of an inexpensive, accurate, off-the-shelf induction engine mitigates the need for specialized procedures, and establishes baseline performance against which specialized algorithms can be compared.

Experiments were performed on 28 publicly available datasets, using C4.5 release 8 as the base classifier While each of the other seven approaches has some strengths, we find that none of them is consistently more accurate than standard bagging when tested for statistical significance.

However, NN classification does not always require the NN search. Based on this idea, we propose a novel algorithm named k-d decision tree (KDDT). Since KDDT uses Voronoi condensed prototypes, it is less memory consuming than naive NN classifiers. We have confirmed that KDDT is much faster than NN search based classifiers through the comparative, experiment (from 9 to 369 times faster).

A heuristic rule-based decision tree is then employed to verify the resulting skin-color regions. The skin-color model comes from the sample pixels from the target video shots, so well tuned to adapt to various videos. It is a general scheme for color-segmentation, not depend on any pre-defined skin-color range. Our experiments shows that the face detection performance has been improved greatly, compared with the pure template based face detector. The face retrieval module is based on the Self-Eigenface method, where the Self-Eigenface space is constructed from the pseudo frontal faces obtained by region tracking.

In the article is described the model for classifying wood products according to their environment burdening during the manufacturing process. The aim of the model generation was to include the most important criteria of environment burdening appearing in wood industry and on the basis of these criteria to calculate the uniform estimate of environment burdening. With a generated mathematical model we gradually proceed from the entry criteria to the final estimate of environment burdening of a specific product, which enables us not only to calculate the final estimate but also to analyse and to present the differences among products at all levels of the decision tree.

This approach uses a local averaging classifier relying on decision trees, and in case of altered or noisy road regions, a special intelligent detection procedure. The local averaging classifier based on the decision tree provides real-time road/non-road classification. The main idea is that the neighbor feature vectors around the control point are analyzed, and the control point has conditioned feature vector by the decision tree. However, this algorithm performs poorly in case of noisy road regions. To overcome this problem, we use the intelligent detection method for missing road regions. Let us assume that there are two problematic situations in the high ways: in the first one, a lane marking is missing. in the second one, both lane markings are missing. In the first case, we can predict where the other lane marking is, and apply ordinary K-Mean onto that region. In the second case, we split image into six parts. and the ordinary K-Mean is applied onto the most left and right four regions. In the case of rural ways, we also split the image into six parts, and apply ordinary K-Mean like in the second situation of the high ways. The merits of the proposed method are that it provides efficient accurate, and low cost classification in the real-time application.

This data is a source of knowledge about different activities related to software development and maintenance. Many different techniques and tools have been developed and proposed for extracting knowledge and representing it in forms understandable by people. These techniques are based on different principles and they process data differently. This paper illustrates a multi-technique approach to analysis of data. A detailed case study of analyzing software maintenance data is presented. Different models are built, analyzed and evaluated. The first model is a Bayesian network. The second is a set of IF-THEN rules extracted from the data, and the third one is built using a decision tree. The emphasis of the analysis is put on two aspects - how the models support understanding of a process represented by the data, and how good prediction capabilities these models have.

Based on such information, a more focussed software testing and inspection plan can be devised. Decision trees are attractive for a software quality classification problem which predicts the quality of program modules in terms of risk-based classes. They provide a comprehensible classification model which can be directly interpreted by observing the tree-structure. A simultaneous optimization of the classification accuracy and the size of the decision tree is a difficult problem, and very few studies have addressed the issue. This paper presents an automated and simplified genetic programming (GP) based decision tree modeling technique for the software quality classification problem. Genetic programming is ideally suited for problems that require optimization of multiple criteria. The proposed technique is based on multi-objective optimization using strongly typed GP. In the context of an industrial high-assurance software system, two fitness functions are used for the optimization problem: one for minimizing the average weighted cost of misclassification, and one for controlling the size of the decision tree. The classification performances of the GP-based decision trees are compared with those based on standard GP, i.e., S-expression tree. It is shown that the GP-based decision tree technique yielded better classification models. As compared to other decision tree-based methods, such as C4.5, GP-based decision trees are more flexible and can allow optimization of performance objectives other than accuracy. Moreover, it provides a practical solution for building models in the presence of conflicting objectives, which is commonly observed in software development practice.

Using Ambainis' adversary method, we exactly characterize QC (f) as the square root of RC(f). We then use this result to prove the new relation R-0 (f) = O(Q(2) (f)(2) Q(0) (f) log n) for total f, where R-0, Q(2), and Q(0) are zero-error randomized, bounded-error quantum, and zero-error quantum query complexities respectively. Finally, we give asymptotic gaps between the measures, including a total f for which C(f) is superquadratic in QC (f), and a symmetric partial f for which QC(f) = 0 (1) yet Q(2) (f) = Q (n/log n).

To augment a computer crime investigator's efforts, the approach presented in this paper is an expert system. with a decision tree that uses predetermined invariant relationships between redundant digital objects to detect semantic incongruities. By analyzing data from a host or network and searching for violations of known data relationships, particularly when an attacker is attempting to hide his presence, an attacker's unauthorized changes may be automatically identified. Examples of such invariant data relationships are provided, as are techniques to identify new, useful ones. By automatically identifying relevant evidence, experts can focus on the relevant files, users, times and other facts first.

We have designed and built a software tool (expert system shell) called MeESE (McMaster Expert System Environment) that processes a set of production (decision) rules of a very general form. Such a production (decision) set can be equivalently symbolized as a decision tree. In real life, even if the logical structure of a production system (decision tree) is provided, the knowledge engineer may be faced with the lack of knowledge of other important parameters of the tree. For instance, in our system McESE, the weights, threshold, and the certainty propagation functions - all of these are a part of the machinery handling the certainty/uncertainty of decisions - have to be designed according to a set of training (representative) events, observations, and examples. One possible way of deriving these parameters is to employ machine learning (ML) or data mining (DM) algorithms. However, 'traditional' algorithms in both fields select immediate (usually local) optimal values in the context of a whole decision set such algorithms select optimal values for each rule without regard to optimal values for the whole knowledge base. Genetic algorithms comprise a long process of evolution of a large population of objects (chromosomes) before selecting (usually global) optimal values, and so giving a chance' to weaker, worse objects, that nevertheless may prove to be optimal in the context of the whole knowledge base. In this methodology case study, we expect that a set of McESE decision rules (or more precisely, the topology of a decision tree) is given. The paper discusses a simulation of an application of genetic algorithms to generate parameters of the given tree that can be then used in the rule-based expert system shell McESE.

To effectively guide the traffic flow, its status must be analyzed and, predicted in real-time.. This paper presents an analytical and prediction model for urban region traffic flow status, which uses several data mining technologies. With the predicting class neural network, the decision tree constraints set, the association rules constraints set, and the correcting class neural network in the model, we take into consideration the influences on future traffic flow of all factors, not only the traffic flow-itself, but also its static and the dynamic indices. Thus it has a great improvement in prediction accuracy.

The challenge for non-native speech recognition is to maximize the recognition performance with small amount of non-native data available. In this paper we report on the acoustic modeling adaptation for the recognition of non-native speech. Using non-native data from German speakers, we investigate how bilingual models, speaker adaptation, acoustic model interpolation and Polyphone Decision Tree Specialization methods can help to improve the recognizer performance. Results obtained from the experiments demonstrate the feasibility of these methods.

When the amount of training data is limited, the distributions of average voice model often have bias depending on speaker and/or gender and this will degrade the quality of synthetic speech. In the proposed method, to reduce the influence of speaker dependence, we incorporate a context clustering technique called shared decision tree context clustering and speaker adaptive training into the training procedure of average voice model. From the results of subjective tests, we show that the average voice model trained using the proposed method generates more natural sounding speech than the conventional average voice model. Moreover, it is shown that voice characteristics of synthetic speech generated from the adapted model using the proposed method are closer to the target speaker than the conventional method.

In this paper, we propose modeling pronunciation variations through triphone model reconstruction. We first generate partial change phone model (PCPM) to differentiate pronunciation variations. In order to improve the resolution of triphone models, PCPM is used as a hidden model and merged into the pre-trained acoustic model through model reconstruction. To avoid model confusion, auxiliary decision trees are established for triphone PCPMs. The acoustic model reconstruction on triphones is equivalent to decision tree merging. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated on the 1997 Hub4NE Mandarin Broadcast News Corpus (1997 MBN) with different styles of speech. It gives a significant 2.39%. absolute syllable error rate reduction in spontaneous speech.

However, even a well-defined lexicon cannot be used to support all variations in human's pronunciation. Besides, in order to cover all possible pronunciations, the size of the dictionary would be too large to implement. Sharing gaussian densities across phonetic models and decision tree for pronunciation variation are proved to be efficient for pronunciation variation system without dictionary modification. This paper presents the alternative methods that can be used even in the sparse database situation. Re-label training is modified to have rule-based pronunciation variation in order to obtain real phonetic acoustic models. Phonemic acoustic models are then retrained from the tying HMM states across phonetic models. These new phonemic models allow alternative search path during recognition. The system shows better performance in the experiment.

This paper describes a method involving binary-tree-structured statistical models for extending the phonetic context beyond that of standard n-grams (particularly bigrams) by exploiting statistical dependencies within a longer sequence window without exponentially increasing the model complexity, as is the case with n-grams. Two ways of dealing with data sparsity are also studied; namely, model adaptation and a recursive bottom-up smoothing of symbol distributions. Results obtained under a variety of experimental conditions using the NIST 2001 Speaker Recognition Extended Data Task indicate consistent improvements in equal-error rate performance as compared to standard bigram models. The described approach confirms the relevance of long phonetic context in phonetic speaker recognition and represents an intermediate stage between short phone context and word-level modeling without the need for any lexical knowledge, which suggests its language independence.

The goals of the work are (i) to save the engineer-hours spent on examining sample distributions in the feature space to select the right set of features (ii) to extract the smallest possible feature set that returns agreeable classification accuracy, so that the system finally developed adheres to the temporal limitations imposed by the production line. The idea is to encode feature subsets directly or indirectly as chromosomes and then to assign each chromosome a fitness depending upon the number of features it uses and the testing accuracy obtained by using the classifier constructed on the chromosome's features. The paper also discusses a genetic method that discretizes continuous features while simultaneously selecting optimal features for the Decision Tree Classifier. In the last section the performance of this method has been demonstrated by exemplifying a production line diagnosis system that has been built on the feature set prescribed by it.

We focus on the role of mobility, which discovers the dynamics and brings global information to the agent with local observation ability. In this paper, we propose a method of behavior-acquisition by an agent operating in POMDP by autonomous acquisition of the internal state-representation while autonomously constructing observation space. In order to deal with partial observability of the environment.. the agent constructs its internal state-representation that is a decision tree representing state-distinction according to its short-term memory of past observations and actions. The state-representation is constructed appropriately by successive segmentation based on real experience. We confirm that the proposed method can acquire navigation behavior of a real mobile robot by simulations and experiments.

In this paper, a new idea using a decision tree classifier is proposed. It first analyses the differences between packet filtering and general classification problems. Then the building and searching algorithms based on decision tree are explicated and the algorithm's performance is analyzed. At last, the weight-threshold method is proposed to make the classifier predicable and reduce the matching workload. It can be illustrated that packet filtering based on decision tree classifiers is more efficient and can study inductively from the rules.

We developed a new way to assign probability after multi-class SVM classification. Our approach achieved approximately 90% accuracy on a collection of images with minimal noise. On another image set containing manually unidentifiable particles, it also provided promising results. Furthermore, our approach is more accurate on the two data sets than a C4.5 decision tree and a cascade correlation neural network at the 95% confidence level.

They are commonly treated as nominal classification problem or regression problem in tree induction. On the other hand a monotonic decision tree is often desirable to aid decision making in such situations as credit rating and student admission. This paper proposes a novel approach called MDT to monotonic decision tree induction. Experiments show that generally this new approach produces decision trees that are more succinct and more effective predictors of the original implicit ordering, apart from being monotonic.

IEEE, Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc			UNIVERSAL APPROXIMATORS; BACKPROPAGATION; ALGORITHMS	Bio-informatics data sets may be large in the number of examples and/or the number of features. Predicting the secondary structure of proteins from amino acid sequences is one example of high dimensional data for which large training sets exist. The data from the KDD Cup 2001 on the binding of compounds to thrombin is another example of a very high dimensional data set. This type of data set can require significant computing resources to train a neural network. In general, decision trees will require much less training time than neural networks. There have been a number of studies on the advantages of decision trees relative to neural networks for specific data sets. There are often statistically significant, though typically not very large, differences. Here, we examine one case in which a neural network greatly outperforms a decision tree: predicting the secondary structure of proteins. The hypothesis that the neural network learns important features of the data through its hidden units is explored by a using a neural network to transform data for decision tree training. Experiments show that this explains some of the performance difference, but not all. Ensembles of decision trees are compared with a single neural network. It is our conclusion that the problem of protein secondary structure prediction exhibits some characteristics that are fundamentally better exploited by a neural network model.

The focus is to achieve detection and recognition of human affect based on physiological signals. This involves building an affect recognition system that accepts as input various physiological parameters and predicts the probable related affective state. Both decision tree and fuzzy logic methodologies have been applied to this problem. This paper presents the results of the two methods and discusses their comparative merit. Three human subject experiments were designed and trials were conducted with six participants. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed implicit human-machine interaction framework.

At the present time, requiring a meter as a prerequisite for power customers to choose a power supplier is not yet achievable. For customer screening, this paper proposes a technique that uses customers' monthly energy usage data to perform load profile assignment. Two steps are involved in the proposed method, they are the fuzzy c-means (FCM) method used for load profiling and a decision tree based pattern recognition technique for customer class assignments. Test data are from actual measurements and customer information system (CIS) of Taiwan Power Company (TPC). Promising results on assigning existing 500 customers to their proper load profiles are illustrated.

In some electricity markets, due to the number and size of the participants, the clearing price may be affected by the production supplied to the market. To model this effect, the residual demand curve (RDC) is considered. This paper proposes a methodology based on decision trees to estimate the probabilistic RDC that a generating agent faces in each hourly period of the market. The method explains the behavior of the RDC patterns (obtained through clustering techniques) by a set of factors (linear combinations of explanatory variables) determined by the statistical technique factor analysis. A decision tree is built to compute the probability of each RDC pattern, taking as input estimations of the numerical value of the explanatory factors. In addition, the paper describes the stochastic programming formulation of the RDC patterns to obtain optimal bidding curves. The methodology proposed is illustrated with a case study applied to the first intradaily market of the Spanish electricity market.

However, most methods suffer from serious drawback due to handling uncertain and missing continuous time-series data. We divide our study in two modules: data cleaning and decision making, first module includes preprocessing of stock market time series data mining which presents the extended form of extraction of both graphical structure and conditional probabilities of a Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) from a possible incomplete stock market time series databases. In second decision making module, we introduce Linguistic Rules-Tree (LR-Tree) which is the combination of fuzzy logics and decision tree but LR-Tree may not be the best generalization due to over-fitting. Consequently Neuro-Pruning method has been introduced for post pruning of LR-Tree. In Neuro-Pruning, instead of absolutely removing nodes, we employ a back-propagation neural network to give weights to nodes according to their significance. After data cleaning and decision making modules we hope that, our proposed approaches will be able to handle attributes with differing costs, improving computational efficiency, outperforms error-based pruning, handle uncertain and missing continuous time-series data.

Through statistical analysis of low-level and mid-level audio-visual features on compressed domain, the proposed method can achieve subjectively accurate shot classification within the movies into predefined genre set, which can be applied to various content handling applications, such as summarization, navigation, editing, filtering, and so on. By feeding subjectively evaluated feature set for each shot genre into the Linear Machine Decision Tree classifier, each shot is classified at very low cost. The experimental results show that most of the shots in the movies can be classified into subjectively accurate genres, and also the dominant shot genre can correctly resolve each movie genre.

Recently, machine-learning-based inverse halftoning techniques have been proposed. Decision-tree learning has been applied with success to various machine-learning applications for quite some time. In this paper, we propose to use decision-tree learning to solve the inverse halftoning problem. This allows us to reuse a number of algorithms already developed. Especially, the maximization of entropy gain is a powerful idea that makes the learning algorithm to automatically select the ideal window as the decision-tree is constructed. The new technique has generated gray images with PSNR numbers, which are several dB above those previously reported in the literature. Moreover, it possesses very fast implementation, lending itself useful for real time applications.

First, we define energy-based texture features which are steerable under rotation, i.e., such that features corresponding to the rotated version of an image can be easily obtained from the features of the original (non-rotated) image. We also propose an approach to measure similarity between images that is robust to rotation; images are compared after being aligned in angle. The retrieval process is performed by means of a Decision Tree Classifier where the angular alignment is performed at each node in the tree. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our system we consider a distributed image classification system, where the feature encoder and the classifier are physically apart and thus features are compressed before being transmitted.

A novel rule-based video classification approach is proposed. Firstly, in the video segmentation process, a set of video attributes is extracted to represent the content of video and a video attribute database are generated. Then the decision tree and class association rule mining techniques are performed on this video attribute database to extract a decision tree rule set and a class association rule set respectively. Lastly, a combination and pruning algorithm are applied to combine these two rule sets to generate a final classification rule set. The experimental result verifies the consistency of decision tree classification with class association classification. The result also shows the final combined rule set has higher classification precision than just one rule set.

Bayesian network classifier is one of the most popular classification methods, however, its stability is rarely studied. Tree Augmented Naive Bayes(TAN), and a restricted Bayesian network, have demonstrated stronger whole performance than the other Bayesian classification methods. The purpose of this paper is to study the stability of TAN. Bayesian network classification method and TAN model are firstly introduced, and then an empirical investigation comparing the stability of several typical classification approaches (decision tree, naive Bayes) with TAN are detailedly described. Experimental results show that Tree Augmented Naive Bayes network classifier is stable.

The algorithm applies to discrete-valued attributes. So the case of knowledge representation system with some discrete-valued condition attributes and one discrete-valued decision attribute is considered. Firstly, we select a condition attribute based on information gain; secondly, we use rough set theory to establish equivalence classes with respect to the selected condition attribute and decision attribute; finally, classification rules can be extracted from the equivalence classes. Furthermore, we can prove the RSE algorithm valid compared with ID3 algorithm.

Its key idea is using decision trees to form the structure of the neural network: to construct a decision tree and then convert the tree into a neural network. The decision tree and neural network for classification are similar and have equivalent property. Thereby a decision tree can be used to provide a systematic design method of neural network. We propose a new mapping between decision tree and neural network that can accurately specify the number of units, layers, connection and initial setting of parameters of neural network. Furthermore, we quote two theorems to show that the mapping is reasonable. In this paper, we use the decision tree-based neural network to solve the XOR problem.

The essential characteristic of fuzzy decision tree is to take of the value in [0, 1] to describe the subordinate relation between examples and linguistic terms, This avoids the unreasonability generated by the classical decision tree, which only use 0 and 1 to describe the subordinate relation. By well using the relation between examples and attributes, the fuzzy decision tree holds high performance, but at the same time, this fuzziness leads to the uncertainty of classification and disturb the building of a good decision tree. So, how to filter fuzzy data properly is an important segment in the building and the application of decision trees. This paper analyzes the effect of fuzzy filter on the fuzzy decision tree by using many experiments, which are based on both fuzzy ID3 heuristic method and the minimal ambiguity based heuristic method. This paper also discusses the fuzzy filter level from both the inherent mechanism of building a fuzzy decision tree and the essence of fuzzy information filter, and proposes a practical method to determine this filter level for different data sets.

For a data set of which the values of condition attributes are continuous, most of the current decision trees learning algorithms often select the previously selected attributes for branching. The repeated selection limits the accuracy of training and testing and the structure of decision trees may become complex. So in the selection of attributes, the previously selected attributes and the other attributes, which have high correlation to the previously selected attributes, should not be selected again. Here, we use mutual information to avoid selecting the previously selected attributes in the generation of decision trees and our test results show that this method can obtain good performance.

In this paper, we present an intrusion detection model based on hybrid neural network and C4.5. The key idea is to take advantage of different classification abilities of neural network and the C4.5 algorithm for different attacks. What is more, the model could also be updated by the C4.5 rules mined from the dataset after the event (intrusion). We employ data from the third international knowledge discovery and data mining tools competition (KDDcup'99) to train and test feasibility of our proposed model. From our experimental results with different network data, our model achieves more than 85 percent detection rate on average, and less than 19.7 percent false alarm rate for five typical types of attacks. Through the analysis after-the-event module, the average detection rate of 93.28 percent and false positive rate of 0.2 percent can respectively be obtained.

This paper presents a sketch-based graphics input system for conceptual design (SketchGIS), which is mainly based on online graphic recognition and dynamic user modeling. Online graphic recognition can discover latent primitive shapes among user-drawn strokes and show the regularized shape on the screen immediately based on spatial-relation graph (SRG) representation and conditioned partial matching by shape preparing, feature recognition, shape filtering and regularization. Dynamic user modeling method is used to recognize and predict sketchy composite shapes before they are completely drawn for user adaptation, which is based on the SVM-based incremental active learning method and the incremental decision tree induction method. Experiments show that the proposed method in this paper can yield good recognition precision, and the Prototype system proposed provides fine user interaction effect, especially for UML diagramming.

The proposed training strategy aims at creating an object-oriented decision tree classifier. The entire classifier is composed of a few separate sub-trees, each of which is a sub-classifier for some special pattern category and effectuated with a Kohonen Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) and the Multiple Layer Perceptron (MLP). The growing and pruning training algorithms of a neural tree are proposed to train four pattern categories samples, corresponding to digits, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and the mixture of digits and letters, respectively. After building the tree, there exists a number of leaf nodes that contain more than one character class, they must be further broken down into individual clusters since a definite recognition is demanded for a given input pattern. For this purpose, the MLP level training strategy is incorporated. The experimental result shows that the training algorithm strategy is feasible in the decision tree.

Method 1 is called BP-based INP boundary prediction, in which, BPs in a sentence are recognized at first, then INP boundaries are predicted on the basis of words and recognized BPs Method 2 is called BP-filtering INP boundary prediction, in which, recognized BPs are used to filter out some impossible boundaries. Decision Tree (DT) was used as learning method for both BP recognition and INP boundary prediction. Comparing to the conventional method without BP recognition, the two methods proposed here achieved 3.6% and 5.6% reduction in the measure of unacceptability separately. More analysis shows that, by improving the performance of BP recognition, there is maximally 36.9% reduction in unacceptability.

The drawback of these approaches is we can only take advantage of one single statistical test (optionally in association with simple frequency threshold), even though we often calculate the values of several statistical tests. Manually exploring a scheme to combine two or more different tests is out of the question. This paper reports experiments with machine learning for collocation identification using a variety of statistical association measurements. In particular, we develop a new decision tree learning algorithm based on C4.5 to be used for learning tasks with unbalanced data. The experiment results are presented and briefly discussed.

The basic idea of employing MI in IP prediction is that people is likely to pause between the less correlated words, where the MI value is low. The paper presents a decision tree based predictor which adopts POS as the main feature firstly as the baseline, and then the paper analyzes the correlation between MI and IP. The approach which only bases oil the MI to predict the IP boundary is demonstrated ill this paper, and three methods combining the MI and POS in the predictor is presented too. In the MI based approach, a considerable performance (F-Score: 64.2%) is achieved, and 3.4% promotion from the baseline is achieved after combining MI and POS in our experiment. All our work indicates that MI is all effective feature in the prosodic phrase boundaries prediction in Chinese text, and combining the MI and POS in the predictor is valuable.

The paper analyzes the shortage of the KRA methods at present and proposes a new KRA method based on the decision tree (DT). A decision tree represents expert knowledge by its nodes, branches and leave, thus the knowledge acquisition problem can be converted into the learning problem of decision tree. In the process of building decision tree, this paper proposes a new DT learning algorithm: rough-ID3 algorithm, which is based on the rough sets theory and information entropy theory. With this algorithm, the decision tree can be simplified and its classified capability is improved. The instance analysis shows hat the proposed approach can represent and acquire the expert knowledge very well and provide a new approach for the expert knowledge representation and acquisition.

The efficiency of the decoder can have a significant impact on the efficiency of these software tools. Automated synthesis of efficient binary decoders is therefore necessary for retargetable software tool development frameworks targeting the rapidly growing field of application-specific processor design. This paper describes a decoder synthesis algorithm that translates a simple instruction pattern specification into efficient binary decoders in C under given memory constraints. The algorithm constructs a decision tree with carefully chosen decoding primitives and cost models. As demonstrated through two case studies, the synthesized decoders achieve efficiency comparable to hand-coded decoders with ensured correctness. The algorithm has no limitation on the input instruction patterns and it requires only the least amount of knowledge about the instruction encoding. Therefore it can be used with any machine description scheme containing instruction encoding information.

We also introduce a new way of automatically identifying predicate argument structures, which is central to our IE paradigm. It is based on: (1) an extended set of features; and (2) inductive decision tree learning. The experimental results prove our claim that accurate predicate-argument structures enable high quality IE results.

Unlike previous studies that focus on user's knowledge or typical kinds of users, the user model we propose is more comprehensive. Specifically, we set up three dimensions of user models: skill level to the system, knowledge level on the target domain and the degree of hastiness. Moreover, the models are automatically derived by decision tree learning using real dialogue data collected by the system. We obtained reasonable classification accuracy for all dimensions. Dialogue strategies based on the user modeling are implemented in Kyoto city bus information system that has been developed at our laboratory. Experimental evaluation shows that the cooperative responses adaptive to individual users serve as good guidance for novice users without increasing the dialogue duration for skilled users.

We train the algorithms on both tasks individually and on the two tasks simultaneously. The parameters of both algorithms and the selection of features are optimized per task with iterative deepening, an efficient wrapper procedure that uses progressive sampling of training data. Results show a consistent significant advantage of MBL over CART, and also indicate that task combination can be done at the cost of little generalization score loss. Tests on cross-validated data and on held-out data yield F-scores of MBL on accent placement of 84 and 87, respectively, and on breaks of 88 and 91, respectively.

We use a road information window to decide the classification procedure related to the input image as a first step. Then we apply pre-classification by decision tree on the information window and analyze its histogram. According to the histogram, adaptive image splitting is performed and a reference feature vector of the road is obtained. We apply a combined method consisting of the pre-classification and the texture feature vector extracted by Gabor jet on the grayscale sub-image. A two classes classifier is used for the combined classification. For the discrimination of road classes from each sub-image, we use the reference feature vector of the road and the homogeneity checking based on the homogeneity conditions. The discriminated road and non-road classes are merged into a road region and a non-road region, respectively. For the edge detection of the road region, we use the backward and forward threshold method. When the edge of the road is decided, finally, we connect these edge points in order to make a border of the road by using Kalman filter and Breshenham line drawing with respect to rural road and high way, respectively. adaptive image splitting, reference feature vector, combined classification, Gabor jet, sub-image, homogeneity conditions.

When the database is complete, they provide an efficient and scalable solution to classification problems. In this paper we introduce an efficient simple Bayesian classifier algorithm to analyze a set of irises data and generate a set of grouping rules, which can be used to classify future data. The proposed algorithm uses a discriminate function, which can be calculated through a number of different formulas. The most important feature in the proposed algorithm for making the formulas easier is using Bayes' rule. Also an example of how the proposed algorithm can be applied in practical situations is presented. The algorithm is evaluated using real data of 150 samples of irises data. The ratio of the correct classification of new cases compared with a will-known Decision tree classifier is high.

J	Kudoh, Y; Haraguchi, M; Okubo, Y				Kudoh, Y; Haraguchi, M; Okubo, Y			Data abstractions for decision tree induction	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Discovery Science	DEC, 2000	KYOTO, JAPAN			data mining; machine learning; abstraction; classification		When descriptions of data values in a database are too concrete or too detailed, the computational complexity needed to discover useful knowledge from the database will be generally increased. Furthermore, discovered knowledge tends to become complicated. A notion of data abstraction seems useful to resolve this kind of problems, as we obtain a smaller and more general database after the abstraction, from which we can quickly extract more abstract knowledge that is expected to be easier to understand. In general, however, since there exist several possible abstractions, we have to carefully select one according to which the original database is generalized. An inadequate selection would make the accuracy of extracted knowledge worse. From this point of view, we propose in this paper a method of selecting an appropriate abstraction from possible ones, assuming that our task is to construct a decision tree from a relational database. Suppose that, for each attribute in a relational database, we have a class of possible abstractions for the attribute values. As an appropriate abstraction for each attribute, we prefer an abstraction such that, even after the abstraction, the distribution of target classes necessary to perform our classification task can be preserved within an acceptable error range given by user. By the selected abstractions, the original database can be transformed into a small generalized database written in abstract values. Therefore, it would be expected that, from the generalized database, we can construct a decision tree whose size is much smaller than one constructed from the original database. Furthermore, such a size reduction can be justified under some theoretical assumptions. The appropriateness of abstraction is precisely defined in terms of the standard information theory. Therefore, we call our abstraction framework Information Theoretical Abstraction. We show some experimental results obtained by a system ITA that is an implementation of our abstraction method. From those results, it is verified that our method is very effective in reducing the size of detected decision tree without making classification errors so worse. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Although many boosting algorithms have been proposed so far, most of them are developed essentially for binary classification problems, and in order to handle multiclass classification problems, they need to be reduced somehow to binary ones. In order to avoid such reductions, we introduce a notion of the pseudo-entropy function G that gives an information-theoretic criterion, called the conditional G-entropy, for measuring the loss of hypotheses. The conditional G-entropy turns out to be useful for defining the weakness of hypotheses that approximate, in some way, a multiclass function in general, so that we can consider the boosting problem without reduction. We show that the top-down decision tree learning algorithm using the conditional G-entropy as its splitting criterion is an efficient boosting algorithm. Namely, the algorithm intends to minimize the conditional G-entropy, rather than the classification error. In the binary case, our algorithm turns out to be identical to the error-based boosting algorithm proposed by Kearns and Mansour, and our analysis gives a simpler proof of their results.

This study presents a hierarchy of performance criteria that consists of performance categories such as strength, stiffness, configuration, and age of structures at a higher level while their subcategories considering the capacity of subsystems and components at lower levels mainly focus on the stage of preliminary evaluation. Two methods for determination of performance index are proposed; a simple composition method and a fuzzy inference method. Both methods use weighting factors to represent relative importance of multi-criteria in the determination of performance index. The simple composition method that operates on definite index values and assumes independence between performance criteria is easy to use but difficult to address the cases where complicity and uncertainty are of important problems. The fuzzy inference system uses fuzzy concepts where uncertainties are inherently unavoidable due to insufficient information and engineering assumption and exploits fuzzy rules in the multi-criteria evaluation by replicating heuristic knowledge and experience in logic-based descriptive rules. Moreover, the single performance index obtained by defuzzification enables us to draw a representative and comprehensive seismic performance index from a set of individual performance indexes at multi-levels.

Specifically, important factors influencing the inpatient mortality were identified using a decision tree method for data mining based on 8405 patients who were discharged from the study hospital during the period of December 1, 2000 and January 31, 2001. Important factors for the inpatient mortality were length of stay, disease classes, discharge departments, and age groups. The optimum range of target group in inpatient healthcare quality indicators were identified from the gains chart. In addition, a decision support system (DSS) was developed to analyze and monitor trends of quality indicators using Visual Basic 6.0. Guidelines and tutorial for quality improvement activities were also included in the system. In the future, other quality indicators should be analyzed to effectively support a hospital-wide continuous quality improvement (CQI) activity and the DSS should be well integrated with the hospital order communication system (OCS) to support concurrent review.

The objectives are to demonstrate that EAs can find classifiers whose accuracy is competitive with other oblique tree construction methods, and that, at least in some cases, this can be accomplished in a shorter time. We performed experiments with a (1 + 1) evolution strategy and a simple genetic algorithm on public domain and artificial data sets, and compared the results with three other oblique and one axis-parallel DT algorithms. The empirical results suggest that the EAs quickly find competitive classifiers, and that EAs scale up better than traditional methods to the dimensionality of the domain and the number of instances used in training. In addition, we show that the classification accuracy improves when the trees obtained with the EAs are combined in ensembles, and that sometimes it is possible to build the ensemble of evolutionary trees in less time than a single traditional oblique tree.

J	Lichtenberg, PA; MacNeill, SE				Lichtenberg, PA; MacNeill, SE			Streamlining assessments and treatments for geriatric mental health in medical rehabilitation	REHABILITATION PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							LICHTENBERG DECISION TREE; PROJECT TEST BATTERY; COMMUNITY POPULATION; PLEASANT ACTIVITIES; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CROSS-VALIDATION; OLDER-PEOPLE; DEPRESSION; DEMENTIA; PREVALENCE	The past decade has seen dramatic health care changes that profoundly affect the way rehabilitation psychologists are able to provide care for older adults. Increased medical comorbidities and decreased lengths of stay have made it necessary for rehabilitation psychologists to streamline their services. This commentary shares the authors' experience in creating new tools to increase efficiency while retaining effectiveness. The four areas the authors discuss include (a) a tool for triaging cases, (b) a brief battery for cognitive evaluations, (c) a treatment approach for depression that can be delivered in the hospital or outpatient clinic setting, and (d) increased interdisciplinary team communication and function. Each of these approaches has been researched, validated, and cross-validated in geriatric settings.

Study of 20 cases with literature review	REVUE DE MEDECINE INTERNE			French	Article						amoebic liver abscess; percuteneous puncture; percutaneous drainage; surgical drainage	PERCUTANEOUS CATHETER DRAINAGE; THERAPEUTIC APPROACH; NEEDLE ASPIRATION; AMEBIC-ABSCESSES; MANAGEMENT; DIAGNOSIS	Purpose. - The management of amoebic liver abscess includes antiamoebic drugs combined or not with percutaneous puncture or surgical drainage. This study was to suggest a decision tree for the therapeutic approach of such feature. Methods. - We report a retrospective analysis of 20 imported cases with amoebic liver abscesses admitted at the Department of Tropical Diseases during 1995-1999 at the Bordeaux University Hospital Centre, France, and a review of the literature. Results. - The twenty patients were 14 males and 6 females, mainly 20 to 40 years old. The clinical presentation was mainly accounting a painful liver enlargement with hyperthermia. The echographic picture was mostly represented by a unique liver element located at the liver right lobe. They were numerous in an HIV infected patient. Thirteen patients have been treated using a medical therapeutic approach. A percutaneous puncture has been necessary for 4 cases. A percutaneous drainage has been realised for two patients as regard to the persistence of the hepatalgia occurrence. A surgical drainage has been experienced by two patients after a lack of efficacyof a percutaneous drainage, after rupture of an abscess treated medically, respectively. A review of the literature and the analysis of the 20 cases history have been used to determine a therapeutic algorithm. Conclusion. - The occurrence of immediate complications at onset must indicate a first line sumical drainage procedure. Beside this situation, risk factors for rupture must be assessed (high size abscess, pejorative localization), as well as poor prognosis feature (liver failure, bacteraemia). If no pejorative condition occurs, a first-line exclusive medical approach can be undertaken with a clinical efficacy evaluation at H72. Otherwise, the indication of the percutaneous drainage Must be discussed. (C) 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

J	Sohn, SY; Lee, SH				Sohn, SY; Lee, SH			Data fusion, ensemble and clustering to improve the classification accuracy for the severity of road traffic accidents in Korea	SAFETY SCIENCE			English	Article						neural network; decision tree; Dempster-Shafer; Bayesian fusion; bagging; arcing; clustering algorithm	MULTISENSOR	Increasing amount of road traffic in 1990s has drawn much attention in Korea due to its influence on safety problems. Various types of data analyses are done in order to analyze the relationship between the severity of road traffic accident and driving environmental factors based on traffic accident records. Accurate results of such accident data analysis can provide crucial information for road accident prevention policy. In this paper, we use various algorithms to improve the accuracy of individual classifiers for two categories of severity of road traffic accident. Individual classifiers used are neural network and decision tree. Mainly three different approaches are applied: classifier fusion based on the Dempster-Shafer algorithm, the Bayesian procedure and logistic model; data ensemble fusion based on arcing and bagging; and clustering based on the k-means algorithm. Our empirical study results indicate that a clustering based classification algorithm works best for road traffic accident classification in Korea. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Yu, MS; Huang, FL				Yu, MS; Huang, FL			Disambiguating the senses of non-text symbols for Mandarin TTS systems with a three-layer classifier	SPEECH COMMUNICATION			English	Article						sense disambiguation; non-text symbol; three-layer classifier; Bayesian theory; voting scheme	WORD	Various kinds of non-text symbols appear in texts. The oral expressions. of these symbols may vary with their senses. This paper proposes a three-layer classifier (TLC) which can disambiguate the senses of these symbols effectively. The layers within TLC are employed in sequence. The 1st layer is composed of two components: pattern table and decision tree. if this layer can disambiguate the sense of the target symbol, the disambiguation task stops. Otherwise the next two layers will be triggered. In such a situation, the procedure will go through the TLC. Based on the Bayesian theory, the 2nd layer adopts the voting scheme to compute the disambiguation score. Several features of token, which may affect the effectiveness of our voting scheme, are analyzed and compared With each other to achieve better accuracy. According to the algorithm confidence of sense disambiguation, the 3rd layer may exploit an alter. native. model to enhance the performance. Experiments show that our approaches can learn well. even with only a small amount of data. The overall accuracies of training and testing sets are 99.8% and 97.5%, respectively.

A database consisting of measurements collected at 360 sampling sites in non-navigable watercourses in Flanders was applied to predict the absence/presence of benthic macroinvertebrate taxa by means of decision trees. The measured variables were a combination of physical-chemical (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen concentration, conductivity, total organic carbon, Kjeldahl nitrogen and total phosphorus), structural (granulometric analysis of the sediment, width, depth and flow velocity of the river) and two ecotoxicological variables. The predictive power of decision trees was assessed on the basis of the number of Correctly Classified Instances (CCI). A genetic algorithm was introduced to compare the predictive power of different sets of input variables for the decision trees. The number of input variables was reduced from 15 to 2-8 variables without affecting the predictive power of the decision trees significantly. Furthermore, reducing the number of input variables allowed to ease the identification of general data trends. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In particular, the wavelet coefficients of the bottom echo were investigated along with other echo parameters like energy, amplitude, slope of the falling part of the echo, etc. The data were processed in an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), which was implemented in two multistage structures, viz.; Incremental Fuzzy Neural Network (IFNN) and Aggregated Fuzzy Neural Network (AFNN). The number of input parameters for the networks was reduced by using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). A fuzzy decision tree algorithm was developed and used directly (without PCA data reduction) in the classification procedure utilizing the same data. The performances of both approaches were analyzed and compared. (C) 2003 MAIK "Nauka/Interperiodica".

Inspired by data mining, the new method employs time-delayed embedding and identifies temporal patterns in the resulting phase spaces. An optimization method is applied to search the phase spaces for optimal heterogeneous temporal pattern clusters that reveal hidden temporal patterns, which are characteristic and predictive of time series events. The fundemantal concepts and framework of the method are explained in detail. The method is then applied to the characterization and prediction, with a high degree of accuracy, of the release of metal droplets from a welder. The results of the method are compared to those from a Time Delay Neural Network and the C4.5 decision tree algorithm.

Many different methods for this type of post-processing concealment have been proposed, operating in the spatial, frequency, or temporal domains, or some hybrid combination of them. In this paper, we show how the use of a decision tree that can adaptively choose among several different error concealment methods can outperform each single method. We also propose two promising new methods for temporal error concealment.

The new method incorporates a classical multivariate statistical method, linear. discriminant function, into decision trees' recursive partitioning process. The proposed method considers not only the linear combination with all variables, but also combinations with fewer variables. It uses a tabu search technique to find appropriate variable combinations within a reasonable length of time. For problems with more than two classes, the tabu search technique is also used to group the data into two superclasses before each split. The results of our experimental study indicate that the proposed algorithm appears to outperform some of the major classification algorithms in terms of classification accuracy, the proposed algorithm generates decision trees with relatively small sizes, and the proposed algorithm runs faster than most multivariate decision trees and its computing time increases linearly with data size, indicating that the algorithm is scalable to large datasets.

In the technique, we first train speaker dependent models using multi-speaker speech database, and then construct a decision tree common to these speaker dependent models for context clustering. When a node of the decision tree is split, only the context related questions which are applicable to all speaker dependent models are adopted. As a result, every node of the decision tree always has training data of all speakers. After construction of the decision tree, all speaker dependent models are clustered using the common decision tree and a speaker independent model, i.e., an average voice model is obtained by combining speaker dependent models. From the results of subjective tests, we show that the average voice models trained using the proposed technique can generate more natural sounding speech than the conventional average voice models.

Here, a variety of different types of reduced graphs are compared in similarity searches. The reduced graphs are found to give comparable performance to Daylight fingerprints in terms of the number of active compounds retrieved. However, no one type of reduced graph is found to be consistently superior across a variety of different data sets. Consequently, a representative set of reduced graphs was chosen and used to-ether with Daylight fingerprints in data fusion experiments. The results show improved performance in 10 out of 11 data sets compared to using Daylight fingerprints alone. Finally, the potential of using reduced graphs to build SAR models is demonstrated using recursive partitioning. An SAR model consistent with a published model is found following just two splits in the decision tree.

In earlier applications, the multiple models to be combined were developed by altering the training set. The use of these so-called resampling techniques, however, poses the risk of reducing predictivity of the individual models to be combined and/or over fitting the noise in the data, which might result in poorer prediction of the composite model than the individual models. In this paper, we suggest a novel approach, named Decision Forest, that combines multiple Decision Tree models. Each Decision Tree model is developed using a unique set of descriptors. When models of similar predictive quality are combined using the Decision Forest method, quality compared to the individual models is consistently and significantly improved in both training and testing steps. An example will be presented for prediction of binding affinity of 232 chemicals to the estrogen receptor.

Our previous study has shown that the No. 13 posterior pancreaticoduodenal lymph node group constitutes the major regional drainage site from primary tumors in the pancreatic head, and that the status of these nodes predicts that of the No. 16 abdominal paraaortic lymph node group. Based on these results, we have developed SN navigation surgery for pancreatic cancer, in the search for more curable and less invasive surgery. In brief, 2% patent blue dye is injected into the peritumoral area. Approximately 5 min later, one or more blue-stained nodes within the area of the No. 13 lymph node group are identified and excised for intraoperative frozen section examination. The subsequent surgical decision-tree is as follows: i) if No. 13 SNs are negative, an extended No. 16 lymph node dissection is not performed to reduce morbidity, and ii) when cancer is found, the No. 16 lymph nodes are dissected completely. Since July 1997, nine of 21 patients scheduled to undergo an extended curative surgery underwent SN biopsy. SNs within the area of the No. 13 lymph node group were identified in 8 (89%) patients. An extended No. 16 lymph node dissection was avoided in 4 SN-negative patients. The overall 3-year survival rate of the 21 patients was 36%, and 4 patients (three SN-negative and one SN-positive patients) with stage IVa disease were alive 3 years after surgery. Three SN-negative patients underwent an extended curative pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PpPD) with combined portal vein resection, but without an extended No. 16 dissection. In conclusion, SN biopsy and curative PpPD can increase curability, reduce morbidity, and provide long-term survival in patients with locally advanced pancreatic head cancer as an alternative to routine extended No. 16 lymph node dissection.

J	Arvidsson, M; Gremyr, I				Arvidsson, M; Gremyr, I			Deliberate choices of restrictions in complete randomization	QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						design of experiments; complete randomization; randomization restrictions; resetting restrictions; split-plot	SPLIT-PLOT EXPERIMENTS; STATISTICS; DESIGN	Complete randomization is often emphasized in literature as an important feature in the planning phase of experimental design. However, complete randomization is seldom strictly applied in industrial experimentation, as it often demands resources not available to the experimenter. In this paper, consequences of incomplete randomization are discussed. To illustrate, an experiment conducted on an injection-moulding process is used. The objective of this paper is to develop a pragmatic and user-friendly decision tree which supports the experimenter in choosing about restrictions in complete randomization. Furthermore, the decision tree emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between randomization and resetting; increasing the awareness of their different consequences for the experimental result. In summary, the decision tree presented here should be useful in the planning phase of experiments. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

J	Lee, YC; Zocharski, PD; Samas, B				Lee, YC; Zocharski, PD; Samas, B			An intravenous formulation decision tree for discovery compound formulation development	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS			English	Article						solubility; decision tree; high throughput; discovery	DRUG DISCOVERY; COMBINATORIAL TECHNOLOGIES; SOLUBILIZATION; METABOLISM; EXCIPIENTS; COSOLVENT	Discovery and pre-clinical animal efficacy assessment formulation development efforts are challenged by limited compound availability and stringent timelines. The implementation and use of a systematic discovery formulation scheme can facilitate this important process. We observed that nearly 85% of Pfizer, Ann Arbor discovery compounds (n > 300) submitted for discovery and pre-clinical injectable formulation development in the year 2000 could be formulated by pH adjustment, cosolvent addition, or a combination of the two approaches. Based on the vehicle data generated by this laboratory, a discovery formulation decision tree, that utilizes the solubilization approaches described above, is proposed. The proposed decision tree can be adapted and modified by pharmaceutical scientists to conform to best practices put forth by their institutions for discovery animal studies requiring injectable dosage forms.

J	Sterling, TR; Lehmann, HP; Frieden, TR				Sterling, TR; Lehmann, HP; Frieden, TR			Impact of DOTS compared with DOTS-plus on multidrug resistant tuberculosis and tuberculosis deaths: decision analysis	BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	97th International Conference of the American-Thoracic-Society	MAY 18-23, 2001	SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA	Amer Thorac Soc			SHORT-COURSE CHEMOTHERAPY; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; DRUG-RESISTANCE; HIV-INFECTION	Objective This study sought to determine the impact of the World Health Organization's tuberculosis treatment strategy (DOTS) compared with that of DOTS-plus on tuberculosis deaths, mainly in the developing world. Design Decision analysis with Monte Carlo simulation of a Markov decision tree. Data sources People with smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis. Data analysis Analyses modelled different levels of programme effectiveness of DOTS and DOTS-plus, and high (10%) and intermediate (3%) proportions of primary multidrug resistant tuberculosis, while accounting for exogenous reinfection. Main outcome measure The cumulative number of tuberculosis deaths per 100 000 population over 10 years. Results The model predicted that under DOTS, 276 people would die from tuberculosis (24 multidrug resistant and 252 not multidrug resistant) over 10 years under optimal implementation in an area with 3% primary multidrug resistant tuberculosis. Optimal implementation of DOTS-plus would result in four (1.5%) fewer deaths. If implementation of DOTS-plus were to result in a decrease of just 5% in the effectiveness of DOTS, 16% more people would die with tuberculosis than under DOTS alone. In an area with 10% primary multidrug resistant tuberculosis, 10% fewer deaths would occur under optimal DOTS-plus than under optimal DOTS, but 16% more deaths would occur if implementation of DOTS-plus were to result in a 5% decrease in the effectiveness of DOTS Conclusions Under optimal implementation, fewer tuberculosis deaths would occur under DOTS-plus than under DOTS. If, however, implementation of DOTS-plus Were associated with even minimal decreases in the effectiveness of treatment, substantially more patients would die than under DOTS.

The objective was to increase classification accuracy by applying recently developed algorithms in machine learning that are fast in training. Three voting classification algorithms, Arc-4x, Adaboost and bagging were also tested. Initial results using a decision tree classifier showed that adding selected textural measures increased the accuracy of logged forest classification by almost 40%, although the class accuracy for logged forests was only approximately 50% when using spectral and textural features combined. No further significant increase in the classification of logged forests was obtained by voting classification.

J	Yen, ZS; Davis, MA; Chen, SC; Chen, WJ				Yen, ZS; Davis, MA; Chen, SC; Chen, WJ			A cost-effectiveness analysis of treatment strategies for acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis in women	ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE			English	Article						costs; cost-benefit analysis; pyelonephritis; norfloxacin; trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole	URINARY-TRACT INFECTIONS; TRIMETHOPRIM-SULFAMETHOXAZOLE; RANDOMIZED TRIAL; OBSERVATION UNIT; NORFLOXACIN; MANAGEMENT; THERAPY; ADULTS	At least 250,000 episodes of acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis are treated annually in the emergency department (ED). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and norfloxacin have both been used as treatments for acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis. Objectives: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of two outpatient treatment strategies, TMP-SMX and norfloxacin, for acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis in adult women between the ages of 18 and 65 years. Methods: Common principles of cost-effectiveness analysis were used for this evaluation. The authors developed a decision tree to estimate the costs and effectiveness of two different treatment strategies: TMP-SMX 160/800 mg twice per day for 10 days and norfloxacin 400 mg twice per day for 10 days. The time frame of the decision tree was 11 days. Outcomes were expressed in U.S. dollars, quality-adjusted life-days (QALDs), and dollars per QALD. Sensitivity analyses were performed on most variables. Results: Norfloxacin is more effective and less costly than the alternative, TMP-SMX. Norfloxacin treatment will save $195.85 per patient, resulting in an aggregate saving of more than $40 million annually. Patients are expected to enjoy a better quality of life with an incremental 0.0601 QALD per patient, if they are treated with norfloxacin. These results are robust across a wide range of probabilities and costs. Conclusions: In this analysis, norfloxacin 400 mg twice a day was a more cost-effective treatment than TMP/SMX 160/800 mg twice a day for women with pyelonephritis.

Biota are recovering in some lakes and rivers, as water quality improves, but they are not yet recovering in others. To make sense of these different responses, and to foster effective management of the acid rain problem, we need to understand 2 things: i) the sequence of ecological steps needed for biotic communities to recover; and ii) where and how to intervene in this process should recovery stall. Here our purpose is to develop conceptual frameworks to serve these 2 needs. In the first framework, the primarily ecological one, a decision tree highlights the sequence of processes necessary for ecological recovery, linking them with management tools and responses to bottlenecks in the process. These bottlenecks are inadequate water quality, an inadequate supply of colonists to permit establishment, and community-level impediments to recovery dynamics. A second, more management-oriented framework identifies where we can intervene to overcome these bottlenecks, and what research is needed to build the models to operationalize the framework. Our ability to assess the benefits of S emission reduction would be simplified if we had models to predict the rate and extent of ecological recovery from acidification. To build such models we must identify the ecological steps in the recovery process. The frameworks we present will advance us towards this goal.

In this study, we assessed the morphologic details of tissue elements that have turned out to be of diagnostic significance in the discrimination of benign common nevi and malignant melanoma. After creation of a data set based on a total of 12,000 cellular elements obtained from 100 benign common nevi and 100 malignant melanomas, classification and regression tree (CART) analysis was performed to differentiate between cellular elements of nevi and melanoma. In a second step, the slides were re-evaluated by the decision tree; cellular elements suggestive either for benign common nevi or for malignant melanoma were highlighted on zoomed images of the whole sections, and the individual elements were displayed in galleries. Eight groups of elements (so-called terminal nodes) seemed to indicate benign common nevi, whereas seven terminal nodes were suggestive for malignant melanoma. The elements of nodes suggestive for benign nevi largely contained nevus cells with amphiphilic cytoplasm intermingled with fibrillary material, whereas the elements of the nodes suggestive for malignant lesions often showed hyperchromatism, perinuclear halos, heavy pigmentation, or a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate. Tissue counter analysis automatically detects tissue elements that are in accordance with morphologic criteria used in conventional histopathology for diagnostic discrimination.

Standard treatment mainly comprises systemic immunosuppressive agents. Ocular involvement, mostly posterior uveitis with retinal vasculitis, leads to blindness in 20-50% of the involved eyes within 5 years. The efficacy of interferon alfa-2a was studied in patients with sight threatening posterior uveitis or retinal vasculitis. Methods: 50 patients were included in this open, non-randomised, uncontrolled prospective study. Recombinant human interferon alfa-2a (rhIFNalpha-2a) was applied at a dose of 6 million units subcutaneously daily. Dose reduction was performed according to a decision tree until discontinuation. Disease activity was evaluated every 2 weeks by the Behcets disease activity scoring system and the uveitis scoring system. Results: Response rate of the ocular manifestations was 92% (three non-responder, one incomplete response). Mean visual acuity rose significantly from 0.56 to 0.84 at week 24 (p<0.000 1). Posterior uveitis score of the affected eyes fell by 46% every week (p<0.001). Remission of retinal inflammation was achieved by week 24. Mean Behcet's disease activity score fell from 5.8 to 3.3 at week 24 and further to 2.8 at week 52. After a mean observation period of 36.4 months (range 12-72), 20 patients (40%) are off treatment and disease free for 7-58 months (mean 29.5). In the other patients maintenance IFN dosage is three million units three times weekly.

Given a database of records, each with a class label, a classifier generates a concise and meaningful description for each class that can be used to classify subsequent records. A number of popular classifiers construct decision trees to generate class models. Frequently, however, the constructed trees are complex with hundreds of nodes and thus difficult to comprehend, a fact that calls into question an often-cited benefit that decision trees are easy to interpret. In this paper, we address the problem of constructing "simple" decision trees with few nodes that are easy for humans to interpret. By permitting users to specify constraints on tree size or accuracy, and then building the "best" tree that satisfies the constraints, we ensure that the final tree is both easy to understand and has good accuracy. We develop novel branch-and-bound algorithms for pushing the constraints into the building phase of classifiers, and pruning early tree nodes that cannot possibly satisfy the constraints. Our experimental results with real-life and synthetic data sets demonstrate that significant performance speedups and reductions in the number of nodes expanded can be achieved as a result of incorporating knowledge of the constraints into the building step as opposed to applying the constraints after the entire tree is built.

This study was conducted by an interdisciplinary clinical group to evaluate the outcome of ICU treatment in cancer patients according to their characteristics at the time of referral. A retrospective analysis was used to identify relevant subgroups among 189 consecutive cancer patients referred as emergencies to one of four ICUs during a 2-year period. Reasons for ICU referral were pneumonia (29.6%), sepsis (27.0%), fungal infection (11.1%), another infection (9.5%), gastrointestinal emergency (16.9%), treatment-related organ toxicity (6.9%), or other, non-infectious complications (43.9%). Vasopressor support was required in 50.3%, mechanical ventilation in 49.7%, and haemodialysis/-filtration in 26.5% of the patients. Overall, 41.3% died during ICU treatment, 12.2% died after transfer from ICU to a non-ICU ward, and 35.4% were discharged alive. Sepsis, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, renal replacement therapy and neutropenia were independent risk factors for fatal outcome, but no single risk factor unequivocally predicted death. All patients with fungal infection who required vasopressor support and either had sepsis (n = 13) or needed mechanical ventilation (n = 14) died during ICU treatment, while all non-septic patients. who did not require mechanical ventilation, were younger than 74 years of age and had a non-infectious underlying complication (n = 29), survived. This analysis may help to early identify relevant subgroups of cancer patients with different prognoses under ICU treatment. A prospective study to confirm the predictive usefulness of this approach is needed. Cancer patients should not be excluded from referral to the intensive care unit in an emergency solely due to their underlying malignant disease or a single unfavourable prognostic factor.

A prerequisite is sequence analysis. We have critically reviewed the performance of the current guidelines proposed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) for allergenicity prediction based on protein sequence and show that its precision is very low. To improve prediction, we propose a new strategy based on sequence motifs identified from a new allergen database. If tested on random test sequences and known allergens, both methods are apparently very sensitive. However, the precision of our motif-based prediction (95.5%) is superior to the current method (36.6%). We conclude that the proposed motif-based prediction is a superior alternative to the current method for use in the decision-tree approach for allergenicity assessment.

J	Moshkov, MJ				Moshkov, MJ			Compressible infinite information systems	FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE			English	Article						information system; decision tree; weighted depth		We investigate infinite information systems. Such systems are widely used in pattern recognition, data mining, discrete optimization, computational geometry. An information system is called compressible relatively to a given weight function if for each problem over the information system with sufficiently large weight (i.e., total weight of attributes in the problem description) there exists a decision tree (i) solving this problem and (ii) having the weighted depth less than the problem weight. In the paper all pairs (information system, weight function) such that the information system is compressible relatively to the weight function are described. For each such pair the behavior of Shannon type function is investigated characterizing the growth in the worst case of the minimal weighted depth of decision trees with the growth of problem weight.

J	Tsang, ECC; Yeung, DS; Wang, XZ				Tsang, ECC; Yeung, DS; Wang, XZ			OFFSS: Optimal fuzzy-valued feature subset selection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						computational complexity; data mining; feature subset selection; fuzzy-valued feature; learning	NEURAL-NETWORK; DECISION TREES; SIMILARITY MEASURES; SENSITIVITY; SETS; INFORMATION; PERCEPTRON; ELEMENTS; INPUT	Feature subset selection is a well-known pattern recognition problem, which aims to reduce the number of features used in classification or recognition. This reduction is expected to improve the performance of classification algorithms in terms of speed, accuracy and simplicity. Most existing feature selection investigations focus on the case that the feature values are real or nominal, very little research is found to address the fuzzy-valued feature subset selection and its computational complexity. This paper focuses on a problem called optimal fuzzy-valued feature subset selection (OFFSS), in which the quality-measure of a subset of features is defined by both the overall overlapping degree between two classes of examples and the size of feature subset. The main contributions of this paper are that: 1) the concept of fuzzy extension matrix is introduced; 2) the computational complexity of OFFSS is proved to be NP-hard; 3) a simple but powerful heuristic algorithm for OFFSS is given; and 4) the feasibility and simplicity of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated by applications of OFFSS to fuzzy decision tree induction and by comparisons with three different feature selection techniques developed recently.

J	Wie, S; Shanklin, CW; Lee, KE				Wie, S; Shanklin, CW; Lee, KE			A decision tree for selecting the most cost-effective waste disposal strategy in foodservice operations	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN DIETETIC ASSOCIATION			English	Article								The purposes of this study were, to determine costs of disposal strategies for. wastes generated in foodservice operations and to develop a decision tree to determine the most cost-effective disposal strategy for foodservice operations. Four cases, including the central food processing center (CFPC) in a school district, a continuing-care retirement center (CCRC), a university dining center (UDC), and a commercial chain restaurant (CCR), were studied to determine the most cost-effective disposal strategy. Annual costs for the current and projected strategies were determined for each case. Results of waste characterization studies and stopwatch studies, interviews with foodservice directors, and water flow and electrical requirements from manufacturers' specifications were used to determine cost incurred. The annual percentage increases for labor, fees, and services were used to reflect an inflated economic condition for the ensuing 10 years of the study period. The Net Present Worth method was used to compare costs of strategies, and the multiparameter sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the tolerance of the chosen strategy. The most cost-effective strategy differed among foodservice operations because of the composition of food and packaging wastes, the quantify of recyclable materials, the waste-hauling charges, labor costs, start-up costs, and inflation rate. For example, the use of a garbage disposal for food waste and landfills and recycling for packaging waste were the most cost-effective strategies for the CCRC. A decision tree was developed to illustrate the decision-making process that occurs when conducting cost analysis and subsequent decisions. Dietetics practitioners can use the decision tree when evaluating the results of the cost analysis.

The rich variety of possible clinical presentations make it particularly difficult to represent the diagnostic process as a 'decision tree'. However, Bayesian networks offer the opportunity of a compact representation of the domain underlying the decision process: once the network portrays the natural history of the disease, the utility of investigations can be quantitatively evaluated. We developed a network for the diagnosis of PE, including 72 variables to represent both the risk factors and the pathophysiological consequences of the disease. Its structure has been specified by discussing which causal relationships explain the manifestations of the disease. The quantitative measures of associations were retrieved from the medical literature, through a critical review of available Studies and agreement on the assumptions made to cope with the lack of published information. Six examples are presented to illustrate the appropriateness of,entropy reduction' as a measure of the utility of investigation, once the set of examinations to be evaluated is bounded on the grounds of their cost and the patient's current risk. The network, which has been given the acronym 'BayPAD' (Bayesian network for Pulmonary embolism Assisted Diagnosis), appears to be able to detect which observations make others irrelevant, so that decisions can be tailored to single cases.

However, they do not allow an updating of the stored information without destroying the existing one. The method proposed in this paper allows a fast update of neural trees composed by supervised neural networks in their nodes; it is robust to noise and supplies good performances, in comparison with a new training, both in classification and in time required. Some tests are presented on four public domain real databases. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Irrigation of landscape vegetation within urban environments represents a large portion of the total urban water consumption for this region. Current estimates suggest that up to 50 percent of residential water is used for landscape irrigation. This paper examines the utility of Ikonos multispectral satellite imagery and expert classifier approaches for quantifying the amount and distribution of urban irrigated landscape vegetation. A decision tree, expert classifier model applied to Ikonos image and land-use GIS layer inputs was tested against conventional image classification approaches. With all branches of the decision tree activated, percentage estimates of urban irrigated vegetation versus impervious cover differed from airborne image-derived reference data by less than 8 percent. Highest agreement was achieved using all model branches except a spatial structure rule, which utilized a texture metric derived from Ikonos 1-m panchromatic data. For this same product, proportion estimates of two growth form types (Tree/ Shrub and Grass) and impervious cover differed from reference data by less than 3 percent, and root-mean-square error (RMSE) values for all neighborhood-size sampling units were within 5 percent for all cover types. This "optimal" expert classifier product yielded area proportion estimates and RMSE values that were approximately 2 percent closer to those of the reference data, compared to standard unsupervised classification applied to Ikonos multispectral data.

The aim of this study was to model drug biotransformation, utilising metabolism data for a heterogeneous group of drugs. ne data were the cumulative amount of unchanged drug excreted in the urine, expressed as percent of the intravenous dose, administered for 160 drugs. The data were categorised into classes according to excretion ranges. The cut-off values between those ranges were defined so as to enable optimal modelling. For each drug, a total of 72 physicochemical and structural descriptors were calculated. Modelling of the drug metabolism data was attempted utilising a hierarchical approach comprising a set of rules combining both linear discriminant analysis and recursive partitioning. The model developed into a decision tree involving the following descriptors: LogD(6.5), counts of H-bond donors, ionisation potential, COSMIC total energy, electronic energy, counts of OH-groups and COOH-groups and the sum of the total net charges. Overall, this model assigned 90% of the compounds correctly to the categories of extensively, or non-extensively, metabolised. The model was successfully validated using an external test set of 40 compounds.

In prior publications the research priorities used by the Research Institute for Fragrance Materials (RIFM), and the methods of exposure estimation used by industry have been summarized. This paper provides details of the approach used by the RIFM Expert Panel (REXPAN), to examine the dermal effects, systemic toxicity and environmental consequences of the use of and exposure to fragrance materials, which allow a reliable determination of safe use under intended conditions. The key to the usefulness of this analysis is the grouping of more than 2600 discrete ingredients into classes, based on chemical structures. Research sponsored by RIFM, data supplied by member companies, and relevant published reports from many sources are all considered during hazard characterization. A discussion is provided of REXPAN's decision tree approach to assessing the dermal, systemic and environmental endpoints and the types and quality of data included. This overall process results in well-documented conclusions which are provided to the International Fragrance Association (IFRA) as the basis for consideration of a new or existing Fragrance Material Standard and to industry for appropriate product risk management actions.

Structure-activity relationships (SARs) are models that could be used to efficiently predict the biological activity of potential developmental toxicants. However, at this time, no adequate SAR models of developmental toxicity are available for risk assessment. In the present study, a new developmental database was compiled by combining toxicity information from the Teratogen Information System (TERIS) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines. We implemented a decision tree modeling procedure, using Classification and Regression Tree software and a model ensemble approach termed bagging. We then assessed the empirical distributions of the prediction accuracy measures of the single and ensemble-based models, achieved by repeating our modeling experiment many times by repeated random partitioning of the working database. The decision tree developmental SAR models exhibited modest prediction accuracy. Bagging tended to enhance the accuracy of prediction. Also, the model ensemble approach reduced the variability of prediction measures compared to the single model approach. Further research with data derived from animal species- and endpoint-specific components of an extended and refined FDA/TERIS database has the potential to derive SAR models that would be useful in the developmental risk assessment of the thousands of untested chemicals.

Epidemiologic data document high risks for many sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among US adolescents and young adults. Goal: This case-control study used decision trees to investigate the relationship between STD incidence and emotional reactions to intercourse. Study Design: For this study, 188 adolescents and young adults (mean age, 24.9 years [SD = 8.2]) at a regional public STD clinic completed a behavioral and psychological questionnaire and underwent a workup for STD. Results: The prevalence of STD in this group was 44.8%. Decision-tree analysis identified emotional reactions to intercourse that were associated with STD diagnosis for some patients: feeling good about oneself after sex half the time or less (OR = 3.21; 95% CI 1.73-5.95), feeling comfortable during sex half the time or less (OR 2.17; 95% CI = 1.07-4.40), and feeling angry after sex (OR = 1.90; 95% CI = 0.91-3.99). Findings of a logistic regression model of emotional reactions to intercourse were significant (chi-square = 24.6; df = 8; P < 0.002), but adding behavioral variables did not improve prediction. Conclusions: For some of these young adults at the time of life when they are at highest risk of STD, emotional factors have higher odds ratios for STD diagnosis than the traditionally assessed behavioral variables.

This decay channel is considered as a discovery channel for Higgs scenarios for Higgs boson masses in the range 80-130 GeV. An NN model with a special type of data flow is used to separate t (t) over bar jj background from H --> b (b) over bar events. This NN combines a classical NN and linear decision tree. Parameters of these NNs are randomly generated and a population of predefined size of those networks is trained as an initial generation for a subsequent genetic algorithm optimization. A genetic algorithm tunes parameters of further NN individuals derived from the previous NNs by GA operations of crossover and mutation. The goal of this GA process is optimization of the final NN performance. Our results show that NN approach is applicable to the problem of Higgs boson detection. NN filters can be used to emphasize the difference of the M-bb distribution for events accepted by filter (with better signal/background rate) and the Mbb distribution for original events (with original signal/background rate) with no loss of significance. This improvement of the shape of the Mbb distribution can be used as a criterion for existence of Higgs boson decay in considered discovery channel. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

This is achieved by refinement of a general purpose static analyzer and later adaptation to particular programs of the family by the end-user through parametrization. This is applied to the proof of soundness of data manipulation operations at the machine level for periodic synchronous safety critical embedded software. The main novelties are the design principle of static analyzers by refinement and adaptation through parametrization (Sect. 3 and 7), the symbolic manipulation of expressions to improve the precision of abstract transfer functions (Sect. 6.3), the octagon (Sect. 6.2.2), ellipsoid (Sect. 6.2.3), and decision tree (Sect. 6.2.4) abstract domains, all with sound handling of rounding errors in floating point computations, widening strategies (with thresholds: Sect. 7.1.2, delayed: Sect. 7.1.3) and the automatic determination of the parameters (parametrized packing: Sect. 7.2).

J	Ratanamahatana, C; Gunopulos, D				Ratanamahatana, C; Gunopulos, D			Feature selection for the naive Bayesian classifier using decision trees	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article								It is known that Naive Bayesian classifier (NB) works very well on some domains, and poorly on others. The performance of NB suffers in domains that involve correlated features. C4.5 decision trees, on the other hand, typically perform better than the Naive Bayesian algorithm on such domains. This paper describes a Selective Bayesian classifier (SBC) that simply uses only those features that C4.5 would use in its decision tree when learning a small example of a training set, a combination of the two different natures of classifiers. Experiments conducted on ten data sets indicate that SBC performs markedly better than NB on all domains, and SBC outperforms C4.5 on many data sets of which C4.5 outperform NB. Augmented Bayesian classifier (ABC) is also tested on the same data, and SBC appears to perform as well as ABC. SBC also can eliminate, in most cases, more than half of the original attributes, which can greatly reduce the size of the training and test data as well as the running time. Further, the SBC algorithm typically learns faster than both C4.5 and NB, needing fewer training examples to reach a high accuracy of classifications.

A comparison was also made between decision tree and artificial neural networks (ANNs) classification accuracies. In the summer of the year 2000, a two-factor field experiment representing different crop conditions was carried out. Corn was grown under four weed management strategies: no weed control, control of grasses, control of broadleaf weeds, and full weed control with nitrogen levels of 60, 120, and 250 N kg/ha. Hyperspectral data using a Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager were acquired three times during the entire growing season. Decision tree technology was applied to classify different treatments based on the hyperspectral data. Various tree-growing mechanisms were used to improve the accuracy of classification. Misclassification rates of detecting all the combinations of different nitrogen and weed categories were 43, 32, and 40% for hyperspectral data sets obtained at the initial growth, the tasseling and the full maturity stages, respectively. However, satisfactory classification results were obtained when one factor (nitrogen or weed) was considered at a time. In this case, misclassification rates were only 22 and 18% for nitrogen and weeds, respectively, for the data obtained at the tasseling stage. Slightly better results were obtained by following the ANN approach. However, the advantage with the decision tree was the formulation of simple and clear classification rules. The highest accuracy was obtained for the data acquired at tasseling stage. The results indicate the potential of decision tree classification algorithms and ANN usage in the classification of hyperspectral data for crop condition assessment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Nomoto, T; Matsumoto, Y				Nomoto, T; Matsumoto, Y			The diversity-based approach to open-domain text summarization	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Annual ACM/SIGIR Meeting	SEP 09-13, 2001	NEW ORLEANS, LA	ACM, SIGIR		text summarization; clustering; decision tree; MDL; extrinsic and intrinsic evaluation		The paper introduces a novel approach to unsupervised text summarization, which in principle should work for any domain or genre. The novelty lies in exploiting the diversity of concepts in text for summarization, which has not received much attention in the summarization literature. We propose, in addition, what we call the information-centric approach to evaluation, where the quality of summaries is judged not in terms of how well they match human-created summaries but in terms of how well they represent their source documents in IR tasks such document retrieval and text categorization. To find the effectiveness of our approach under the proposed evaluation scheme, we set out to examine how a system with the diversity functionality performs against one without, using the test data known as BMIR-J2. The results demonstrate a clear superiority of the diversity-based approach to a non-diversity-based approach. The paper also addresses the question of how closely the diversity approach models human judgments on summarization. We have created a relatively large volume of data annotated for relevance to summarization by human subjects. We have trained a decision tree-based summarizer using the data, and examined how the diversity method compares with the supervised method in performance when tested on the data. It was found that the diversity approach performs as well as and in some cases superior to the supervised method. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Predicting outcomes such as end-stage renal disease (ESRD) by integration and better utilization at individual level of epidemiologic data may facilitate clinical decision-making processes. Methods. To predict individual ESRD risk in an average patient in the United States, ESRD prevalence and levels of uncertainty and conditional risk factors independence were considered by population data (1998) and pooled analysis of 11 randomized trials. Data integration and input were by decision-tree simulation approach (simple, parallel, and sequential scenarios) and Bayes' theorem. Sensitivity analysis and risk profiles were employed to address uncertainty and assess different risk factor combinations. A health state values, associated with ESRD outcome levels, were taken from the literature. Results. In this theoretical study, we provided a scholarly example about the use of two known risk factors (urinary protein greater than or equal to3 g/day and systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to140 mm Hg) to predict individual ESRD risk in an average patient in the United States. The highest posterior (decisional) probability of ESRD occurrence (risk of 3.61% to 5.07%) in the individual patient was associated with the worst health state, as assessed by multidimensional scenarios when both risk factors were present. Conclusion. Decision tree models through an empirical Bayesian approach may serve to predict the individual ESRD risk on the basis of simple epidemiologic, demographic, and clinical information that is easily available already at the first patient evaluation.

J	Muegge, I				Muegge, I			Selection criteria for drug-like compounds	MEDICINAL RESEARCH REVIEWS			English	Article						library design; neural network; decision tree; drug database; non-drug; diversity	POLAR MOLECULAR-SURFACE; COMBINATORIAL LIBRARIES; STRUCTURAL FEATURES; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; CHEMICAL DATABASES; POTENTIAL-DRUGS; PREDICTION; DIVERSITY; DESIGN; CHEMISTRY	The fast identification of quality lead compounds in the pharmaceutical industry through a combination of high throughput synthesis and screening has become more challenging in recent years. Although the number of available compounds for high throughput screening (HTS) has dramatically increased, large-scale random combinatorial libraries have contributed proportionally less to identify novel leads for drug discovery projects. Therefore, the concept of 'drug-likeness' of compound selections has become a focus in recent years. In parallel, the low success rate of converting lead compounds into drugs often due to unfavorable pharmacokinetic parameters has sparked a renewed interest in understanding more clearly what makes a compound drug-like. Various approaches have been devised to address the drug-likeness of molecules employing retrospective analyses of known drug collections as well as attempting to capture 'chemical wisdom' in algorithms. For example, simple property counting schemes, machine learning methods, regression models, and clustering methods have been employed to distinguish between drugs and non-drugs. Here we review computational techniques to address the drug-likeness of compound selections and offer an outlook for the further development of the field. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Shen, RP; Kheoruenromne, I				Shen, RP; Kheoruenromne, I			Monitoring land use dynamics in Chanthaburi Province of Thailand using digital remotely sensed images	PEDOSPHERE			English	Article						image classification; land use dynamics; remote sensing; tropical area		A comprehensive method of image classification was developed for monitoring land use dynamics in Chanthaburi Province of Tailand. RS (Remote Sensing), GIS (Geographical Information System), GPS (Global Positioning System) and ancillary data were combined by the method which adopts the main idea of classifying images by steps from decision tree method and the hybridized supervised and unsupervised classification. An integration of automatic image interpretation, ancillary materials and expert knowledge was realized. Two subscenes of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images of bands 3, 4 and 5 obtained on December 15, 1992, and January 17, 1999, were used for image processing and spatial data analysis in the study. The overall accuracy of the results of classification reached 90%, which was verified by field check. Results showed that shrimp farm land, urban and traffic land, barren land, bush and agricultural developing area increased in area, mangrove, paddy field, swamp and marsh land, orchard and plantation, and tropical grass land decreased, and the forest land kept almost stable. Ecological analysis on the land use changes showed that more attentions should be paid on the effect of land development on ecological environment in the future land planning and management.

Goals: The goals of the study were to compare the cost-effectiveness of "gold standard" care (GS), syndromic management (SM), and mass treatment (MT) protocols for the treatment of cervical gonococcal and chlamydial infections in a hypothetical model of 1 million women in Africa. Study Design: A decision tree model was constructed for each of the protocols. Sensitivity analyses were conducted and 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations were run to test the robustness of the cost-effectiveness estimates to changes in underlying assumptions. Results: MT with doxycycline for chlamydia was the most cost-effective protocol in terms of cost per cure. SM protocol had the lowest total programmatic costs. For the GS protocol, using azithromycin for chlamydial infections was found to be more cost-effective than using doxycycline. For both the GS and SM protocols, the total cost of the program was most sensitive to the percentage of women seeking STD treatment and the prevalence of non-STD vaginal discharge, whereas the cost of MT was almost exclusively determined by coverage rates. Conclusions: No single protocol carries with it all the desired conditions of an optimal cost-effective program. The treatment-seeking behavior, STD prevalence, and coverage of each locale must be evaluated to determine the most cost-effective and highest impact program. MT was found to be the most cost-effective protocol in terms of cost per woman treated when compared with the SM and GS protocols for STDs in women.

To do that, a methodology that integrates on-line, off-line and heuristic information has been proposed. This methodology consists of three steps: (i) development of a decision tree (which involves knowledge acquisition and representation); (ii) implementation into a rule-based system; and (iii) validation. The set of symptoms most useful in diagnosing the deflocculation problem has been identified, the different branches to diagnose pin-point floc and dispersed growth have been built (using generic and specific knowledge), and all this knowledge has been codified into an object-oriented shell. The results obtained in the application of this knowledge based approach to the Granollers WWTP (which treats about 130,000 inhabitants-equivalents) showed that the system was able to identify correctly the problem with reasonable accuracy. Our positive experience building this system suggests that this approach is a practical and valuable element to include in an intelligent supervisory system combining numerical and reasoning techniques.

J	Joy, SM; Reich, RM; Reynolds, RT				Joy, SM; Reich, RM; Reynolds, RT			A non-parametric, supervised classification of vegetation types on the Kaibab National Forest using decision trees	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							REMOTELY-SENSED DATA; LAND-COVER; ACCURACY; COMMUNITIES; ARIZONA	Traditional land. classification techniques for large areas that use Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery are typically limited to the fixed spatial resolution of the sensors (30 m). However, the study of some ecological processes requires land cover classifications at finer spatial resolutions. We model forest vegetation types on the Kaibab National Forest (KNF) in northern Arizona to a 10-m spatial resolution with field data, using topographical information and Landsat TM imagery as auxiliary variables. Vegetation types were identified by clustering the field variables total basal area and proportion of basal area by species, and then using a decision tree based on auxiliary variables to predict vegetation types. Vegetation types modelled included pinyon-juniper, ponderosa pine, mixed conifer, spruce- and deciduous-dominated mixes, and openings. To independently assess the accuracy of the final vegetation maps using reference data from different sources, we used a post- stratified, multivariate composite estimator. Overall accuracy was 74.5% (Kappa statistic= 49.9%). Sources of error included differentiating between mixed conifer and spruce-dominated types and between openings in the forest and deciduous-dominated mixes. Overall, our nonparametric classification method successfully identified dominant vegetation types on the study area at a finer spatial resolution than can typically be achieved using traditional classification techniques.

J	Blockeel, H; Struyf, J				Blockeel, H; Struyf, J			Efficient algorithms for decision tree cross-validation	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th International Conference on Machine Learning	JUN 28-JUL 01, 2001	WILLIAMSTOWN, MASSACHUSETTS			decision trees; cross-validation; inductive logic programming	FIRST-ORDER; INDUCTION	Cross-validation is a useful and generally applicable technique often employed in machine learning, including decision tree induction. An important disadvantage of straightforward implementation of the technique is its computational overhead. In this paper we show that, for decision trees, the computational overhead of cross-validation can be reduced significantly by integrating the cross-validation with the normal decision tree induction process. We discuss how existing decision tree algorithms can be adapted to this aim, and provide an analysis of the speedups these adaptations may yield. We identify a number of parameters that influence the obtainable speedups, and validate and refine our analysis with experiments on a variety of data sets with two different implementations. Besides cross-validation, we also briefly explore the usefulness of these techniques for bagging. We conclude with some guidelines concerning when these optimizations should be considered.

In this paper, we describe the use of supervised classification algorithms to generate land cover maps that characterize the vegetation types required for Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) retrievals from MODIS and MISR. As part of this analysis, we examine the sensitivity of remote sensing-based retrievals of LAI and FPAR to land cover information used to parameterize vegetation canopy radiative transfer models. Specifically, a decision tree classification algorithm is used to generate a land cover map of North America from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data with 1 km spatial resolution using a six-biome classification scheme. To do this, a time series of normalized difference vegetation index data from the AVHRR is used in association with extensive site-based training data compiled using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and ancillary map sources. Accuracy assessment of the map produced via decision tree classification yields a cross-validated map accuracy of 73%. Results comparing LAI and FPAR retrievals using maps from different sources show that disagreement in land cover labels generally do not translate into strong disagreement in LAI and FPAR maps. Further, the main source of disagreement in LAI and FPAR maps can be attributed to specific biome classes that are characterized by a continuum of fractional cover and canopy structure.

J	Stroppiana, D; Gregoire, JM; Pereira, JMC				Stroppiana, D; Gregoire, JM; Pereira, JMC			The use of SPOT VEGETATION data in a classification tree approach for burnt area mapping in Australian savanna	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							MONSOONAL NORTHERN AUSTRALIA; LAND-COVER; BOREAL FORESTS; DECISION TREE; FIRE REGIMES; EMISSIONS; EXTENT; INDEX	An algorithm to map burnt areas has been developed for SPOT VEGETATION (VGT) data in Australian woodland savannas. A time series of daily VGT images (15 May to 15 July 1999) was composited into 10-day periods by applying a minimum value criterion to the near-infrared band (0.78-0.89 mum). The algorithm was developed using a classification tree methodology that was confirmed as a powerful means of image classification. This methodology allowed the identification of three classes of burnt surfaces that appear to be differentiated by the proportion of the pixel that is burnt, the intensity of the fire and the density of the tree layer. The performance of the algorithm was assessed by classification of one VGT composite image (31 May-9 June) using, as representative of the ground truth, burnt areas extracted from two Landsat TM scenes (9 June). We randomly extracted 30 windows (each of similar to 14 km by 14 km) for which we compared the percentage of area burnt as derived from TM and VGT. The estimated mean absolute deviation in the percentage of the area burnt in each window is +/- 6.3%. In the area common to the two datasets a total amount of 6473 km(2) was estimated to be burnt in the VGT classification against 7536 km(2) that was burnt according to TM images. The accuracy of the classification was found to vary with the vegetation type being the most accurate estimate in low woodland with an underestimation error of 8.6%. These results show that VGT could be a very useful sensor for burnt area mapping over large woodland areas, although the low spatial resolution and the lack of a thermal band can be a limitation in certain conditions (e.g. understorey burns). The same methodology will be applied to map burnt areas for the entire Australian continent.

Despite their many benefits and general flexibility, the use of decision trees with high spatial resolution data has not yet been fully explored. In support of the National Park Service (NPS) Vegetation Mapping Program (VMP), we have examined the feasibility of using a commercially available decision tree classifier with multitemporal satellite data from the Enhanced Thematic Mapper-Plus (ETM+) instrument to map 11 land cover types at the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area near Milford, PA. Ensemble techniques such as boosting and consensus filtering of the training data were used to improve both the quality of the input training data as well as the final products. Using land cover classes as specified by the National Vegetation Classification Standard at the Formation level, the final land cover map has an overall accuracy of 82% (kappa = 0. 80) when tested against a validation data set acquired on the ground (n = 195). This same accuracy is 99.5% when considering only forest vs. nonforest classes. Usage of ETM+ scenes acquired at multiple dates improves the accuracy over the use of a single date, particularly for the different forest types. These results demonstrate the potential applicability and usability of such an approach to the entire National Park system, and to high spatial resolution land cover and forest mapping applications in general.

Each tillage/cropping combination was replicated; three times; for a total of 18 plots: Five hyperspectral reflectance measurements per-plot were taken randomly to obtain a total of 90 measurements. Images were taken on June 30, August 5; and August 25, 2000 to reflect three stages of crop development. Each measurement consisted of reflectances in 71 wave ranging from 400 to 950 nm. C&RT models were developed separately for the three observation dates, using-the 71 reflectances as inputs to classify the image according to: (a) practice; (b) residue level, (c) cropping practices, (d) tillage/cropping (residue) combination. C&RT models could generally distinguish tillage practices with a classification accuracy of 0.89 and residue levels with a classification accuracy of 0.98. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The kinematic synthesis of four bar mechanisms is a difficult design problem. A novel method that combines the genetic programming and decision tree learning methods is presented. We give a structural description for the class of mechanisms that produce desired coupler curves. Constructive induction is used to find and characterize feasible regions of the design space. Decision trees constitute the learning engine, and the new features are created by genetic programming.

J	Rosenman, MB; Mahon, BE; Downs, SM; Kleiman, MB				Rosenman, MB; Mahon, BE; Downs, SM; Kleiman, MB			Oral erythromycin prophylaxis vs watchful waiting in caring for newborns exposed to Chlamydia trachomatis	ARCHIVES OF PEDIATRICS & ADOLESCENT MEDICINE			English	Article							HYPERTROPHIC PYLORIC-STENOSIS; PERINATAL TRANSMISSION; OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM; FOLLOW-UP; INFECTION; CONJUNCTIVITIS; INFANTS; DISEASE; MOTHERS; CHILDHOOD	Background: Chlamydia trachomatis exposure at birth may cause conjunctivitis or pneumonia. Until recently, a course of oral erythromycin prophylaxis was recommended for C trachomatis-exposed neonates. However, recognition of an association between erythromycin and pyloric stenosis, prompted a change to a watchful waiting recommendation under which only infants who develop symptomatic C trachomatis infection are treated with oral erythromycin. Objective: To compare erythromycin prophylaxis with watchful waiting for a hypothetical cohort of 100 000 neonates exposed to C trachomatis. Methods: In a decision tree, potential outcomes were C trachomatis conjunctivitis, C trachomatis pneumonia (which could require inpatient or outpatient therapy), no clinical disease, and pyloric stenosis. Published data were reviewed to derive probability point estimates and ranges. Estimated charges served as outcome measures. Results: Watchful waiting is less expensive than erythromycin prophylaxis ($15.1 million vs $28.3 million); prophylaxis,prevents 5986 cases of C trachomatis pneumonia, including 1197 hospital admissions, but causes 3284 pyloric stenosis, cases. (For every 30 infants given oral erythromycin prophylaxis, one additional case of pyloric stenosis. would be expected to occur, and approximately 1.8 cases of C trachomatis pneumonia would be prevented.) In sensitivity analyses, if more than 3.4% of exposed neonates are hospitalized for C trachomatis pneumonia, prophylaxis becomes favored. Conclusions: This study supports the watchful waiting recommendation for asymptomatic neonates exposed to C trachomatis. However, there are wide plausible ranges for pyloric stenosis risk after erythromycin administration and for the incidence of C trachomatis pneumonia severe enough to require hospitalization; under some combinations of these rates, prophylaxis could be favored.

J	Aukland, L; Costa, PM; Brown, S				Aukland, L; Costa, PM; Brown, S			A conceptual framework and its application for addressing leakage: the case of avoided deforestation	CLIMATE POLICY			English	Article						carbon offsets; leakage; baselines; greenhouse gas mitigation; avoided deforestation; sinks; forest conservation	LAND-USE	One of the most challenging technical issues associated with project-based mechanisms is that of leakage. A conceptual framework is proposed for the identification and analysis of leakage potentially generated by a project. The categorization of leakage based on the actors responsible for their manifestation is proposed, which divides sources of leakage into primary and secondary types. It is the actors or agents responsible for the baseline activities that cause primary leakage. Secondary leakage occurs when the project's outputs create incentives for third parties to increase emissions elsewhere. This distinction, based on the source of leakage, provides a basis for the analysis outlined in the paper. The extent and type of leakage will vary depending on the project typology and design. Using a decision tree approach, the process of identifying potential sources of leakage is demonstrated for the case study of avoided deforestation projects. If the main elements determining a baseline are properly identified and understood, in particular the 'baseline agents', a combination of the decision tree approach and apportioning responsibility, can assist in the quantification and monitoring of primary leakage. An analysis at the project design stage can also assist in minimizing the risk of future leakage. Econometric methods may prove more useful in analyzing secondary leakage.

In particular, we consider the Boolean function deciding whether a given polynomial over F-2 is squarefree. We obtain an exponential lower bound on the size of a decision tree for this function, and derive an asymptotic formula, having a linear main term, for its average sensitivity. This allows us to estimate other complexity characteristics such as the formula size, the average decision tree depth and the degrees of exact and approximative polynomial representations of this function. Finally, using a different method, we show that testing squarefreeness and irreducibility of polynomials over F-2 cannot be done in AC(0)[p] for any odd prime p. Similar results are obtained for deciding coprimality of two polynomials over F-2 as well.

J	Metcalfe, DD				Metcalfe, DD			Introduction: What are the issues in addressing the allergenic potential of genetically modified foods?	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES			English	Article						biotechnology; decision tree; food allergy; genetically modified crops; IgE; immunology; sensitization	BIOTECHNOLOGY; PREVALENCE; BENEFITS; PLANTS; US	There is growing concern among the general public and the scientific community regarding the potential toxicity of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The use of biotechnology to enhance pest resistance or nutritional value has raised a number of fundamental questions including the consequences of insertion of reporter genes, the spread of resistance genes to surrounding plants, and the use of suicide genes to prohibit reuse of seed from engineered plants. Of particular interest is the ability of proteins from GMOs to elicit potentially harmful immunologic responses, including allergic hypersensitivity. The lack of information of the potential toxicity of these products suggests a need to identify the critical issues and research needs regarding these materials and to develop testing strategies to examine the allergenicity of these compounds.

One component of this decision tree is a determination of whether the protein of interest is resistant to proteolytic digestion. Although these in vitro methodologies have been useful, the correlation between resistance to proteolysis and allergenic activity is not absolute. Two views and highlights of supporting research regarding the relationship of resistance to digestion and allergenicity are presented in this article.

The first step is to assess any remaining function. There are six inflexion points in the decision-making process. These depend on the functional status of the patient: 1) some residual movement; 2) no movement, but some residual electromyographic (EMG) activity; 3) fully locked-in with no EMG activity or movements but with conjugate eye movements; 4) same as 3 but with disconjugate eye movements; 5) same as 4 but with inadequate assistance from the available EEG-based systems; 6) same as 5 and accepting of an invasive system.

PSM is made possible by geocomputational technologies developed over the past few decades. For example, advances in geographic information science, digital terrain modeling, remote sensing, fuzzy logic has created a tremendous potential for improvement in the way that soil maps are produced. The State Factor soil-forming model, which was introduced to the western world by one of the early Presidents of the American Association of Geographers (C.F. Marbut), forms the theoretical basis of PSM. PSM research is being driven by a need to understand the role soil plays in the biophysical and biogeochemical functioning of the planet. Much research has been published on the subject in the last 20 years ( mostly outside of geographic journals) and methods have varied widely from statistical approaches (including geostatistics) to more complex methods, such as decision tree analysis, and expert systems. A geographic perspective is needed because of the inherently geographic nature of PSM.

The system involves the generation of a decision tree based on learning of examples. Absolute and relative power values, as well as inter and intrahemispheric correlation values were used to feed the system, which resulted in Successful classification of patients and controls. Frequency values provided more information than broad bands. Esquizor could also be useful to classify other groups based on their EEG.

J	McLaughlin, WA; Berman, HM				McLaughlin, WA; Berman, HM			Statistical models for discerning protein structures containing the DNA-binding helix-turn-helix motif	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						helix-turn-helix motif; DNA-binding; machine learning; structure classification	CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; GENE ACTIVATOR; DATA-BANK; RECOGNITION; DOMAIN; CLASSIFICATION; SPECIFICITY; SUBSTRATE; DATABASE	A method for discerning protein structures containing the DNA-binding helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif has been developed. The method uses statistical models based on geometrical measurements of the motif. With a decision tree model, key structural features required for DNA binding were identified. These include a high average solvent-accessibility of residues within the recognition helix and a conserved hydrophobic interaction between the recognition helix and the second alpha helix preceding it. The Protein Data Bank was searched using a more accurate model of the motif created using the Adaboost algorithm to identify structures that have a high probability of containing the motif, including those that had not been reported previously.

Objective: To assess the diagnostic and economic impact of combined Tl-201 and Ga-67 brain SPECT on the management of patients suspected of having CNS lymphoma or germinoma. Methods: Sequential Tl-201 and Ga-67 brain SPECT was performed in 40 patients with cranial tumors to assess the diagnostic and economic impact of combined Tl-201 and Ga-67 SPECT on the management of patients suspected of having CNS lymphoma or germinoma. All intracranial masses were pathologically confirmed. The final diagnoses of a total of 47 foci were: 11 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in 10 patients, 3 germinomas in 2 patients, 10 glioblastomas in 9 patients, 10 cerebral metastases in 8 patients, 13 meningiomas in 11 patients. Decision-tree sensitivity analysis for pretest probability regarding expected cost saving was performed for introduction of the combined study. Results: All but one focus of CNS lymphomas or germinomas (92.9%, 13/14) exhibited more intense uptake of Ga-67 than of Tl-201 (p < 0.001). All foci of glioblastomas (10/10) and meningiomas (13/13), and 60% of metastatic foci (6/10) exhibited higher uptake of Tl-201 than of Ga-67 (p < 0.035). Expected cost saving in the 1% to 50% range of pretest probability of CNS lymphoma or germinoma would be from minus $842US to plus $2,047US per patient for introduction of the combined study, because of substitution of stereotactic biopsy for craniotomy. The pretest probability was the key factor for cost saving of the combined study. Conclusions: A Ga-67-positive and Tl-201-positive pattern with more intense uptake of Ga-67 than Tl-201 probably suggests CNS lymphoma or germinoma. This combination study appears to be cost-effective only in patients highly suspected of having CNS lymphoma or germinoma.

Our method is based on selective sampling with committees of decision trees. The committee members are trained on a small set of labeled examples which are then augmented by a large number of unlabeled examples. Using unlabeled examples is important because obtaining labeled data is expensive and time-consuming while it is easy and inexpensive to collect a large number of unlabeled examples. The idea behind this approach is that the labels of unlabeled examples can be estimated by using committees. Using additional unlabeled examples, therefore, improves the performance of word sense disambiguation and minimizes the cost of manual labeling. Effectiveness of this approach was examined on a raw corpus of one million words. Using unlabeled data, we achieved an accuracy improvement up to 20.2%.

There is a need, therefore, to develop and demonstrate technologies and scientific methodologies that could be used to explore these extreme subice realms with the goal of establishing whether or not some form of life has evolved. A NASA search-for-life mission to Europa would involve site reconnaissance, site selection, landing, deep drilling through ice, small autonomous submersibles traversing the purported sea under the ice, and in-situ life detection. Many advanced technologies not currently available would be required. Identification and rank ordering of enabling technologies in a portfolio that can be developed for a certain specified research and development budget is crucial for mission success.

J	Proctor, DD				Proctor, DD			Low-resolution pattern recognition-sorting triples in the FIRST database	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING			English	Article							IMAGE-ANALYSIS; RADIO-SOURCES; CLASSIFICATION; GALAXIES; MOMENTS	The application of pattern recognition techniques to the data from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters Survey (FIRST) is explored. The methodology developed for the automatic classification of a particular type of radio-source morphology, the so-called "bent doubles" is described. While the procedures and techniques for doing supervised pattern recognition using accurately classified training sets, high-resolution images, and determinate shapes are well established, there exists little guidance for dealing with more ambiguous populations. The implications of low resolution for pattern recognition are discussed and methods for dealing with more ambiguous populations are presented. Bent doubles with three components are considered. With approximately 6% of the catalog sources being a component of a triple, visual classification suggests that approximately 6% of triples are bent. In addition to the problems associated with low resolution, the classification task is complicated by the lack of scale and orientation information, the chance superposition of sources, the very ambiguous nature of the visual classifications, and the considerable variation in bent morphology. For a bent or ambiguous or nonbent visual classification, classifiers are presented that produce results having up to an 80% recognition rate when looking at the top-ranked 16% of sources. The associated nonambiguous false positive rate vanes between 14 and 18%. Given that recognition rates cannot be expected to be better than the accuracy of the training set, this is believed to be within a few percent of the maximum recognition rates attainable without an observationally verified training set. Decision tree and neural network results are compared and show, within associated errors, substantially equivalent results. Ranking of sources is demonstrated and the highest-ranked sources are in good agreement with visual classifications. In addition to providing determinate expressions for characterizing the target class, the resulting distributions suggest that the automated classifications constrain the target class in a better manner than the visual classifications.

J	Osei-Bryson, KM; Giles, K; Kositanurit, B				Osei-Bryson, KM; Giles, K; Kositanurit, B			Exploration of a hybrid feature selection algorithm	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						feature selection; discretization; classification; multi-objective optimization; decision tree		In the Knowledge Discovery Process, classification algorithms are often used to help create models with training data that can be used to predict the classes of untested data instances. While there are several factors involved with classification algorithms that can influence classification results, such as the node splitting measures used in making decision trees, feature selection is often used as a pre-classification step when using large data sets to help eliminate irrelevant or redundant attributes in order to increase computational efficiency and possibly to increase classification accuracy. One important factor common to both feature selection as well as to classification using decision trees is attribute discretization, which is the process of dividing attribute values into a smaller number of discrete values. In this paper, we will present and explore a new hybrid approach, ChiBlur, which involves the use of concepts from both the blurring and chi(2)-based approaches to feature selection, as well as concepts from multi-objective optimization. We will compare this new algorithm with algorithms based on the blurring and chi(2)-based approaches.

The source catalogue	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						methods : data analysis; catalogues; surveys; astrometry; galaxies : statistics; radio continuum; general	MOLONGLO REFERENCE CATALOG; GALAXIES	This paper is the second in a series describing the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS) being carried out at 843 MHz with the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST). The survey will consist of similar to590 4.3degreesx 4.3degrees mosaic images with 45 x 45 cosec\delta\ arcsec(2) resolution, and a source catalogue. In this paper we describe the initial release (version 1.0) of the source catalogue consisting of 107 765 radio sources made by fitting elliptical Gaussians in 271 SUMSS 4.3degreesx 4.3degrees mosaics to a limiting peak brightness of 6 mJy beam(-1) at delta less than or equal to -50degrees and 10 mJy beam(-1) at delta > -50degrees. The catalogue covers approximately 3500 deg(2) of the southern sky with delta less than or equal to -30degrees, about 43 per cent of the total survey area. Positions in the catalogue are accurate to within 1-2 arcsec for sources with peak brightness A (843) greater than or equal to 20 mJy beam(-1) and are always better than 10 arcsec. The internal flux density scale is accurate to within 3 per cent. Image artefacts have been classified using a decision tree, which correctly identifies and rejects spurious sources in over 96 per cent of cases. Analysis of the catalogue shows that it is highly uniform and is complete to 8 mJy at delta less than or equal to -50degrees and 18 mJy at delta > -50degrees. In this release of the catalogue about 7000 sources are found in the overlap region with the National Radio Astronomy Observatories Very Large Array Sky Survey at 1.4 GHz. We calculate a median spectral index of alpha = -0.83 between 1.4 GHz and 843 MHz. This version of the catalogue will be released via the World Wide Web with future updates as new mosaics are released.

A new structural database of allergenic proteins, SDAP-Food, hftp://fermi.utmb.edu/SDAP/, has been developed to aid in predicting the IgE-binding potential of novel food proteins and cross-reactivities among known allergens. The site is designed to facilitate the first steps of a decision tree approach to determine the allergenicity of a given protein, based on the sequence and structural similarity to known allergens and their IgE binding sites. Immunological tests can then be used to confirm the predictions. A hierarchical procedure for identifying potential allergens, using a physical property-based sequence similarity index, has been designed to identify regions that resemble known IgE binding sites. As an example, SDAP tools were used to find food allergen sequences similar to an IgE binding site of the Jun a 3 allergen from mountain cedar pollen. The SDAP sequence similarity search matched the Jun a 3 epitope to regions in several food allergens, including cherry (Pru av 2), apple (Mal d 2) and pepper (Cap a 1), which are, like Jun a 3, members of the plant pathogenesis-related (PR-5) protein family. Homology modeling, using our EXDIS/DIAMOD/FANTOM program suite, indicated a similar surface location and structure for the potential epitope region on all of these allergens. The quantitative approach presented here can be used as part of a screening process for potential allergenicity of recombinant food products.

J	Mathew, A; Riley, TR; Young, M; Ouyang, A				Mathew, A; Riley, TR; Young, M; Ouyang, A			Cost-saving approach to patients on long-term anticoagulation who need endoscopy: A decision analysis	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	65th Annual Meeting of the American-College-of-Gastroenterology	OCT 16-18, 2000	NEW YORK, NEW YORK	Amer Coll Gastroenterol				OBJECTIVE: The management strategies used when patients requiring long-term anticoagulation need endoscopic procedures vary considerably. Two commonly used approaches are a "heparin window" strategy in the inpatient setting and, more recently, a "switch to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)" strategy for elective procedures. The aim of this study was to determine whether an initial diagnostic endoscopy (visualization only) is a cost-effective strategy in these patients. METHODS: Decision analysis was performed for two scenarios using probability estimates from our retrospective study. Scenario 1: Patients with any (urgent and elective) indication for endoscopy while on anticoagulation, A decision tree was made outlining two strategies: 1) a diagnostic endoscopy on full anticoagulation followed by therapeutic endoscopy if needed using standard practice; and 2) standard approach. Scenario 2: Patients requiring elective endoscopy. Here, the decision tree Outlined three strategies: 1) initial diagnostic endoscopy on full anticoagulation followed by a therapeutic endoscopy if needed using a "heparin window"; 2) initial diagnostic endoscopy followed by therapeutic endoscopy if needed using "switch to LMWH" strategy; and 3) "direct switch to LMWH strategy." RESULTS: Initial diagnostic endoscopy is the preferred strategy when patients requiring anticoagulation need endoscopy. In scenario 1, (all patients), the diagnostic endoscopy approach will reduce need for hospital stay and save $85,006 per 100 patients when a therapeutic impact is not predictable before endoscopy. Similarly, in scenario 2, an initial diagnostic endoscopy followed by switch to LMWH strategy is the most cost saving. CONCLUSIONS: In anticoagulated patients, an initial diagnostic endoscopy approach on anticoagulation is the most cost-saving strategy, when a direct therapeutic impact is not predictable.

Our characterization provides a uniform representation for all traditional evaluation metrics. Such representation leads naturally to a measure for the distance between the bias of two evaluation metrics. We give a practical value to our measure by observing the distance between the bias of two evaluation metrics and its correlation with differences in predictive accuracy when we compare two versions of the same learning algorithm that differ in the evaluation metric only. Experiments on real-world domains show how the expectations on accuracy differences generated by the distance-bias measure correlate with actual differences when the teaming algorithm is simple (e.g., search for the best single feature or the best single rule). The correlation, however, weakens with more complex algorithms (e.g., learning decision trees). Our results show how interaction among learning components is a key factor to understand learning performance.

J	Lurette, C; Lecoeuche, S				Lurette, C; Lecoeuche, S			Unsupervised and auto-adaptive neural architecture for on-line monitoring. Application to a hydraulic process	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						on-line monitoring; fault detection; drift; classification; unsupervised learning; auto-adaptation; hydraulic process	NETWORK; CLASSIFICATION	Generally, the functioning of a monitored system is characterized by some parameters. Each evolution of these parameters may be assimilated with a drift or a fault. Therefore it may be considered to estimate the functioning state of the system by analyzing the drifts of these critical parameters evolving with time. So, this paper presents a new architecture, based on a new neural network classifier, for on-line monitoring of complex industrial systems. The first stage consists in the choice and the extraction of the significant parameters. The second stage extracts some parameter characteristics to be used in order to discriminate the different kinds of evolution. Then, in the third stage, a specialized neural network is used to classify, on-line, the evolutions for each significant parameter. The neural network is initialized with a set of synthetic and experimental data and a copy of this classifier is used to achieve the trend detection for each monitored parameter. Due to unsupervised rules and auto-adaptive abilities, each copy is adapted according to the specific evolutions of its monitored parameter in order to take account of new kinds of evolutions in situ and on-line. In the fourth stage, a decision tree is used to establish the diagnostic by analyzing the results of the trend detection stage for all the monitored parameters. The application to the monitoring of an industrial hydraulic process shows the ability of the classifier to learn and detect the different drifts. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Chen, YL; Hsu, CL; Chou, SC				Chen, YL; Hsu, CL; Chou, SC			Constructing a multi-valued and multi-labeled decision tree	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						decision tree; data mining; classification; multi-valued attribute; multi-labeled attribute; prediction; customer relation management		Most decision tree classifiers are designed to classify the objects whose attributes and class labels are single values. However, many practical classification problems need to deal with multi-valued and multi-labeled data. For example, a customer data in a tour company may have multi-valued attributes such as the cars, the hobbies and the houses of the customer and multiple labels corresponding to the tours joined before. If the company intends to use customers'-data to build a classifier to predict what kinds of customers are likely to participate in what kinds of tours; then a requirement arises immediately is how to design a new classification algorithm to classify the multi-valued and multilabeled data. Therefore, this research has engaged in developing such a new classifier. We found that the design of some major functions used in our classifier is different from the existing ones, including how to select the next splitting attribute, when to stop the splitting of a node, how to determine a node's labels, and how to predict the labels of a new data. In this paper, all these issues are addressed and the problems are solved. The simulation result shows that the proposed algorithm performs well both in computing time and in accuracy.

When the amount of training data is limited, the distributions of average voice model often have bias depending on speaker and/or gender and this will degrade the quality of synthetic speech. In the proposed method, to reduce the influence of speaker dependence, we incorporate a context clustering technique called shared decision tree context clustering and speaker adaptive training into the training procedure of average voice model. From the results of subjective tests, we show that the average voice model trained using the proposed method generates more natural sounding speech than the conventional average voice model. Moreover, it is shown that voice characteristics and prosodic features of synthetic speech generated from the adapted model using the proposed method are closer to the target speaker than the conventional method.

J	Park, SB				Park, SB			Decision tree based disambiguation of semantic roles for Korean adverbial postpositions	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						decision tree; semantic role disambiguation; word class; Korean adverbial postposition		The case postpositions usually have more than one semantic role in Korean. The adverbial postpositions among various postpositions especially make the development of Korean-based machine translation system difficult, because they have more semantic roles than others. In this paper, we describe a new method for resolving semantic ambiguities of adverbial postpositions using decision tree induction. The lack of training examples in decision tree induction is overcome by clustering words into classes using a kind of greedy algorithm.

J	Su, CT; Shiue, YR				Su, CT; Shiue, YR			Intelligent scheduling controller for shop floor control systems: a hybrid genetic algorithm/decision tree learning approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article							FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS; WORKSTATION CONTROLLER; JOB SHOP; RULES; SELECTION; FMS; ARCHITECTURE; SIMULATION; ALGORITHMS; KNOWLEDGE	This work develops an intelligent scheduling controller (ISC) to support a shop floor control system (SFCS) to make real-time decisions, robust to various production requirements. Selecting near-optimal subset system attributes (or features) based on various production requirements to construct ISC knowledge bases is a critical issue because of the existence of much shop floor information in an SFCS. Accordingly, this work developed a learning-based ISC methodology to acquire knowledge of a dynamic dispatching rule control mechanism. The proposed approach integrates genetic algorithms (GAs) and decision trees (DTs) learning to evolve a combinatorial optimal subset of features from possible shop floor information concerning a DT-based ISC knowledge classifier. A GA is employed to search the space of all possible subsets of a large set of candidate features. For a given feature subset, a DT algorithm is invoked to generate a DT. Applying the GA/DT-based knowledge learning mechanism to the experimental results demonstrates that the use of an optimal subset of system attributes to build scheduling knowledge bases enhanced generalization ability of the learning bias above that in the absence of an attribute selection procedure, in terms of prediction accuracy of unseen data under various performance criteria. Furthermore, simulation results indicate that the GA/DT-based ISC improves system performance in the long run over that obtained with classical DT-based ISC and the heuristic individual dispatching rule, according to various performance criteria.

However, the high false-positive rate of the serum prostate specific antigen test necessitates the development of more accurate diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for CaP. Promising diagnostic potential of serum protein patterns detected by surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry for CaP has recently been reported. Independent evaluation of this new technology is warranted to realize its translational utility. We determined whether serum protein profiling by surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry and a decision tree algorithm classification system could accurately discriminate between patients with CaP and unaffected individuals. Materials and Methods: Proteomic spectra of crude serum were generated using the Ciphergen ProteinChip System and pattern detection was performed using Biomarker Patterns Software (Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc., Fremont, California). A total of 106 patients with CaP and 56 controls were randomly allocated to a training set and a test set. The training set, which consisted of 44 patients with cancer and 30 controls, was used to build a decision tree algorithm. The test set, which consisted of 62 patients with cancer and 26 controls, was used in blinded fashion to validate the decision tree. Results: Accuracy of classification using the test set was 67% and 42% for the weak cation exchange array and the copper metal affinity capture array, respectively. Combined spectral data from the weak cation exchange and copper metal affinity capture arrays generated an algorithm that achieved 85% sensitivity and 85% specificity for the detection of CaP. Conclusions: These preliminary findings support recent observations that complex protein profiles have promising potential for the early detection of CaP and warrant future studies with streamlined technology. Furthermore, the combined effect of using 2 array types can greatly enhance the ability of protein profile patterns, suggesting the potential usefulness of alternative approaches to evaluate this new emerging technology.

This paper first describes the fundamental connections between MCLP and data mining, including several general models of MCLP approaches. Given the general models, it focuses on a designing architecture of MCLP-data mining algorithms in terms of a process of real-life business intelligence. This architecture consists of finding MCLP solutions, preparing mining scores, and interpreting the knowledge patterns. Secondly, this paper elaborates the software development of the MCLP-data mining algorithms. Based on a pseudo coding, two versions of software (SAS- and Linux-platform) will be discussed. Finally, the software performance analysis over business and experimental databases is reported to show its mining and prediction power. As a part of the performance analysis, a series of data testing comparisons between the MCLP and induction decision tree approaches are demonstrated. These findings suggest that the MCLP-data mining techniques have a great potential in discovering knowledge patterns from a large-scale real-life database or data warehouse.

When making a clinical decision, medical practice is determined by taking into consideration PG, a patient's preferences, and a country's social and healthcare systems. Even if a PG provides a treatment method based on a high-level of evidence, the method simply represents a mean result obtained from past clinical studies, which are not always uniformly applicable to all patients. When consulting a PG, it is advisable to know in advance what group/society/organization prepared it, the purpose of its preparation, and the developmental method, including social equity, whether healthcare costs are assumed in the PG or whether the pharmaceutical industry had substantial involvement in its development. Thus, PGs need to be developed according to the actual conditions in a country or institution. As to the questions whose answers are not provided in a PG, these issues have to be defined and assessed through a literature search. This is the so-called implementation of Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM). The concepts of EBM further require the provision of better evidence. A PG is always fated to be out of date by the time it is published because new evidence is continually being published. It is therefore, always necessary to search for the most up to date evidence available. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To examine the distribution of periurethral collagen by three-dimensional ultrasonography (3D US) and to incorporate this technology into a practical treatment decision tree for women with stress urinary incontinence desiring collagen injection. Methods. Forty-six women who received periurethral collagen injection were assessed with 3D US to document the position and volume of collagen around the urethra. Patients with a good clinical response were observed with serial 3D US scans. Women with no persistent improvement who showed a low volume or asymmetric distribution of collagen were offered repeat injections. When the patient had no improvement despite symmetric or circumferential distribution of collagen with good volume retention, another anti-incontinence treatment was recommended. Group 1 was composed of women who had a good clinical outcome and group 2 of those who did not. A statistical comparison between the two outcome groups was done to determine whether any particular distribution pattern was associated with an increased likelihood of clinical success. Results. Of the 46 patients, 21 (46%) were satisfied with their continence after their last periurethral collagen injection, with a median follow-up of 14.0 months (range 2 months to 4.25 years). A significantly greater proportion of patients in group 1 had circumferentially distributed collagen on 3D US compared with those in group 2 (62% versus 20%, P = 0.006). Conclusions. Circumferential distribution of collagen around the urethra is associated with a higher likelihood of clinical success.

J	Chakrabarti, S; Roy, S; Soundalgekar, MV				Chakrabarti, S; Roy, S; Soundalgekar, MV			Fast and accurate text classification via multiple linear discriminant projections	VLDB JOURNAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	28th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases	AUG 20-23, 2002	HONG KONG, PEOPLES R CHINA			text classification; discriminative learning; linear discriminants		Support vector machines (SVMs) have shown superb performance for text classification tasks. They are accurate, robust, and quick to apply to test instances. Their only potential drawback is their training time and memory requirement. For n training instances held in memory, the best-known SVM implementations take time proportional to n(a), where a is typically between 1.8 and 2.1. SVMs have been trained on data sets with several thousand instances, but Web directories today contain millions of instances that are valuable for mapping billions of Web pages into Yahoo!-like directories. We present SIMPL, a nearly linear-time classification algorithm that mimics the strengths of SVMs while avoiding the training bottleneck. It uses Fisher's linear discriminant, a classical tool from statistical pattern recognition, to project training instances to a carefully selected low-dimensional subspace before inducing a decision tree on the projected instances. SIMPL uses efficient sequential scans and sorts and is comparable in speed and memory scalability to widely used naive Bayes (NB) classifiers, but it beats NB accuracy decisively. It not only approaches and sometimes exceeds SVM accuracy, but also beats the running time of a popular SVM implementation by orders of magnitude. While describing SIMPL, we make a detailed experimental comparison of SVM-generated discriminants with Fisher's discriminants, and we also report on an analysis of the cache performance of a popular SVM implementation. Our analysis shows that SIMPL has the potential to be the method of choice for practitioners who want the accuracy of SVMs and the simplicity and speed of naive Bayes classifiers.

We studied whether bedside clinical data can predict in-hospital complications from pulmonary embolism. METHODS: We performed a multicenter derivation phase, followed by validation in a single center. All patients were normotensive; the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was established by objective imaging. Classification and regression analysis was performed to derive a decision tree from 27 parameters recorded from 207 patients. The validation study was conducted on a separate group of 96 patients to determine the derived criterion's diagnostic accuracy for in-hospital complications (cardiogenic shock, respiratory failure, or death). RESULTS: Mortality in the derivation phase was 4% (n = 8) at 24 hours and 10% (n = 21) at 30 days. A room-air pulse oximetry reading <95% was the most important predictor of death; mortality was 2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0% to 6%) in patients with pulse oximetry greater than or equal to95% versus 20% (95% CI: 12% to 29%) with pulse oximetry <95%. In the validation phase, the room-air pulse oximetry was <95% at the time of diagnosis in 9 of 10 patients who developed an in-hospital complication (sensitivity, 90%) and greater than or equal to95% in 55 of 86 patients without complications (specificity, 64%). CONCLUSION: Mortality from pulmonary embolism in normotensive patients is high. A room-air pulse oximetry reading greater than or equal to95% at diagnosis is associated with a significantly lower probability of in-hospital complications from pulmonary embolism.

J	Pal, M; Mather, PM				Pal, M; Mather, PM			An assessment of the effectiveness of decision tree methods for land cover classification	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						decision tree; land cover; classification algorithm	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; SUPERVISED CLASSIFICATION; DATA SET; ACCURACY; SELECTION; DESIGN	Choice of a classification algorithm is generally based upon a number of factors, among which are availability of software, ease of use, and performance, measured here by overall classification accuracy. The maximum likelihood (ML) procedure is, for many users, the algorithm of choice because of its ready availability and the fact that it does not require an extended training process. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are now widely used by researchers, but their operational applications are hindered by the need for the user to specify the configuration of the network architecture and to provide values for a number of parameters, both of which affect performance. The ANN also requires an extended training phase. In the past few years, the use of decision trees (DTs) to classify remotely sensed data ha's increased. Proponents of the method claim that it has a number of advantages over the ML and ANN algorithms. The DT is computationally fast, make no statistical assumptions, and can handle data that are represented on different measurement scales. Software to implement DTs is readily available over the Internet. Pruning of DTs can make them smaller and more easily interpretable, while the use of boosting techniques can improve performance. In this study, separate test and training data sets from two different geographical areas and two different sensors-multispectral Landsat ETM+ and hyperspectral DAIS-are used to evaluate the performance of univariate and multivariate DTs for land cover classification. Factors considered are: the effects of variations in training data set size and of the dimensionality of the feature space, together with the impact of boosting, attribute selection measures, and pruning. The level of classification accuracy achieved by the DT is compared to results from back-propagating ANN and the ML classifiers. Our results indicate that the performance of the univariate DT is acceptably good in comparison with that of other classifiers, except with high-dimensional data. Classification accuracy increases linearly with training data set size to a limit of 300 pixels per class in this case. Multivariate DTs do not appear to perform better than univariate DTs. While boosting produces an increase in classification accuracy of between 3% and 6%, the use of attribute selection methods does not appear to be justified in terms of accuracy increases. However, neither the univariate DT nor the multivariate DT performed as well as the ANN or ML classifiers with high-dimensional data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

On the other hand, repeated cesarean sections are associated with increased maternal morbidity and mortality from placental pathologic conditions (previa or accreta) on subsequent pregnancies. The study was undertaken to analyze the decision for a trial of labor or a repeated cesarean section, after a prior cesarean section, with varying desire for an additional pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: A model was formulated using a decision tree, based on the reported risks of the two approaches. Sensitivity analysis was performed over a variety of probabilities (eg, chance of uterine rupture or neonatal death, chance of rescue cesarean section, desire for an additional pregnancy) and utilities (eg, use of hysterectomy or neonatal death). RESULTS: The model favors a trial of labor if it has a chance of success of 50% or above and if the wish for additional pregnancies after a cesarean section is estimated at near 10% to 20% or above because the delayed risks from a repeated cesarean section are greater than its immediate benefit. The model was robust over a wide range of assumptions. CONCLUSION: An optimal decision for a trial of labor or a repeated cesarean section is substantially determined by the wish for future pregnancies.

OncoDoc is a decision support system designed to provide best therapeutic recommendations for breast cancer patients. Developed as a browsing tool of a knowledge base structured as a decision tree, OncoDoc allows physicians to control the contextual instantiation of patient characteristics to build the best formal equivalent of an actual patient. Used as a computer-based eligibility screening system, depending on whether instantiated patient parameters are matched against guideline knowledge or available clinical trial protocols, it provides either evidence-based therapeutic options or relevant patient-specific clinical trials. Implemented at the Gustave Roussy Institute and routinely used at the point of care during a 4-month period, it significantly improved physician compliance with guideline recommendations and enhanced physician awareness of open trials while increasing patient enrolment to clinical trials by 50%. But, when analyzing reasons of non-accrual of potentially eligible patients, it appeared that physicians' psychological reluctance to refer patients to clinical trials, measured during the experiment at 25%, may not be resolved by the simple dissemination of clinical trial information at the point of care.

J	Beynon, MJ; Buchanan, KL				Beynon, MJ; Buchanan, KL			An illustration of variable precision rough set theory: The gender classification of the European barn swallow (Hirundo rustica)	BULLETIN OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							NEURAL NETWORKS; PREDICTION; ATTRIBUTES; INDUCTION; DISCRETIZATION	This paper introduces a new technique in the investigation of object classification and illustrates the potential use of this technique for the analysis of a range of biological data, using avian morphometric data as an example. The nascent variable precision rough sets (VPRS) model is introduced and compared with the decision tree method ID3 (through a 'leave it out' approach), using the same dataset of morphometric measures of European barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) and assessing the accuracy of gender classification based on these measures. The results demonstrate that the VPRS model, allied with the use of a modern method of discretization of data, is comparable with the more traditional non-parametric ID3 decision tree method. We show that, particularly in small samples, the VPRS model can improve classification and to a lesser extent prediction aspects over ID3. Furthermore, through the 'leave n out' approach, some indication can be produced of the relative importance of the different morphometric measures used in this problem. In this case we suggest that VPRS has advantages over ID3, as it intelligently uses more of the morphometric data available for the data classification, whilst placing less emphasis on variables with low reliability. In biological terms, the results suggest that the gender of swallows can be determined with reasonable accuracy from morphometric data and highlight the most important variables in this process. We suggest that both analysis techniques are potentially useful for the analysis of a range of different types of biological datasets, and that VPRS in particular has potential for application to a range of biological circumstances.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four diagnostic strategies were evaluated using decision tree analysis: conventional CT alone; conventional CT followed by QECT; conventional CT followed positron emission tomography (PET); and conventional CT followed by QECT and PET (QECT + PET). The average cost per patient, accuracy of management and incremental cost:accuracy ratio (ICAR) were determined for each strategy. Although baseline assumptions reflected the Australian setting, sensitivity analysis was used to extrapolate the results to the UK. RESULTS: At the baseline prevalence of malignancy (54%) and cost of PET relative to surgery (16%), the QECT strategy incurs the least cost ($5560/patient) but the QECT + PET strategy is the most cost-effective (ICAR $12059/patient). At reported levels of disease prevalence (68.5%) and cost of PET relative to surgery (29.9%) in the UK, the QECT strategy is the most cost-effective. CONCLUSION: QECT offers a cost-effective approach to evaluation of SPNs. Whether QECT is used alone or in combination with PET will depend upon local availability and regional values for prior probability of malignancy within SPNs and the cost of PET relative to surgery.

J	Hewett, R; Leuchner, J				Hewett, R; Leuchner, J			Restructuring decision tables for elucidation of knowledge	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						knowledge engineering; knowledge acquisition; machine learning; representation; knowledge-based systems	MINIMIZATION	Decision tables are widely used in many knowledge-based and decision support systems. They allow relatively complex logical relationships to be represented in an easily understood form and processed efficiently. This paper describes second-order decision tables (decision tables that contain rows whose components have sets of atomic values) and their role in knowledge engineering to: (1) support efficient management and enhance comprehensibility of tabular knowledge acquired by knowledge engineers, and (2) automatically generate knowledge from a tabular set of examples. We show how second-order decision tables can be used to restructure acquired tabular knowledge into a condensed but logically equivalent second-order table. We then present the results of experiments with such restructuring. Next, we describe SORCER, a learning system that induces second-order decision tables from a given database. We compare SORCER with IDTM, a system that induces standard decision tables, and a state-of-the-art decision tree learner, C4.5. Results show that in spite of its simple induction methods, on the average over the data sets studied, SORCER has the lowest error rate. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This method combines tree growing and pruning, to determine the structure of the soft decision tree, with refitting and backfitting, to improve its generalization capabilities. The method is explained and motivated and its behavior is first analyzed empirically on 3 large databases in terms of classification error rate, model complexity and CPU time. A comparative study on 11 standard UCI Repository databases then shows that the soft decision trees produced by this method are significantly more accurate than standard decision trees. Moreover, a global model variance study shows a much lower variance for soft decision trees than for standard trees as a direct cause of the improved accuracy. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

J	Carnahan, B; Meyer, G; Kuntz, LA				Carnahan, B; Meyer, G; Kuntz, LA			Comparing statistical and machine learning classifiers: Alternatives for predictive modeling in human factors research	HUMAN FACTORS			English	Article							ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS; CARPAL-TUNNEL-SYNDROME; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; DRIVING PERFORMANCE; GENETIC ALGORITHM; BEHAVIOR; PATTERN; CLASSIFICATION; VIOLATIONS; SEVERITY	Multivariate classification models play an increasingly important role in human factors research. In the past, these models have been based primarily on discriminant analysis and logistic regression. Models developed from machine learning research offer the human factors professional a viable alternative to these traditional statistical classification methods. To illustrate this point, two machine learning approaches - genetic programming and decision tree induction - were used to construct classification models designed to predict whether or not a student truck driver would pass his or her commercial driver license (CDL) examination. The models were developed and validated using the curriculum scores and CDL exam performances of 37 student truck drivers who had completed a 320-hr driver training course. Results indicated that the machine learning classification models were superior to discriminant analysis and logistic regression in terms of predictive accuracy. Actual or potential applications of this research include the creation of models that more accurately predict human performance outcomes.

J	Jarvis, CH; Stuart, N; Cooper, W				Jarvis, CH; Stuart, N; Cooper, W			Infometric and statistical diagnostics to provide artificially-intelligent support for spatial analysis: the example of interpolation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article							GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; NEURAL NETWORKS; KNOWLEDGE; CLASSIFICATION; SELECTION; SPLINES; MODELS; TOOL; GIS	The wider uptake of GIS tools by many application areas outside GIScience means that many newer users of GIS will have high-level knowledge of the wider task, and low-level knowledge of specific system commands as given in reference manuals. However, these newer users may not have the intermediate knowledge that experts in GI science have gained from working with GI systems over several years. Such intermediate knowledge includes an understanding of the assumptions implied by the use of certain functions, and an appreciation of how to combine functions appropriately to create a workflow that suits both the data and overall goals of the geographical analysis task. Focusing on the common but non-trivial task of interpolating spatial data, this paper considers how to help users gain the necessary knowledge to complete their task and minimise the possibility of methodological error. We observe that both infometric ( or cognitive) knowledge and statistical knowledge are usually required to find a solution that jointly and efficiently meets the requirements of a particular user and data set. Using the class of interpolation methods as an example, we outline an approach that combines knowledge from multiple sources and argue the case for designing a prototype 'intelligent' module that can sit between a user and a given GIS. The knowledge needed to assist with the task of interpolation is constructed as a network of rules, structured as a binary decision tree, that assist the user in selecting an appropriate method according to task-related knowledge ( or 'purpose') and the characteristics of the data sets. The decision tree triggers exploratory diagnostics that are run on the data sets when a rule requires to be evaluated. Following evaluation of the rules, the user is advised which interpolation method might be and should not be considered for the data set. Any parameters required to interpolate the particular data set ( e. g. a distance decay parameter for Inverse Distance Weighting) are also supplied through subsequent optimisation and model selection routines. The rationale of the decision process may be examined, so the 'intelligent interpolator' also acts as a learning tool.

Methods: Cost-effectiveness analysis were performed using decision-tree analysis and a Markov model. Four alternative strategies were compared: no screening and no treatment; initiation of HCV treatment after the diagnosis of cirrhosis; and two alternative strategies refer to the current French policies of HCV testing, i.e., two enzyme immunoblot assay (EIA) tests in series, or a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis after the first positive EIA test. Costs were computed from the viewpoint of the health care system. The analysis has been applied to populations particularly at risk of infection, as well as the general population. Results: The "wait and treat cirrhosis" strategy was more cost-effective in the general population and in transfusion recipients. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of this strategy compared with baseline strategy was 3,476 of euros and EUO 5,300 in respective cohorts. Considering the HCV screening strategy, the additional cost would be of EURO 4,933 and EURO 240,250 per additional year of life saved, respectively. In the intravenous drug user (IDU) population, the "two EIA" screening strategy was the more cost-effective alternative, with an additional cost of EURO 3,825 per additional year of life saved. Conclusions: HCV screening would be discarded for transfusion recipients but should be encouraged for IDUs and also for the general population, in which the additional cost of screening is an order of magnitude more acceptable.

Methods: The study population was a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 patients sixty years of age with severe diabetic foot ulcers. A decision tree model was constructed to estimate the CE of HBO2 therapy in the treatment of diabetic ulcers at years 1, 5, and 12. Scenario and one-way sensitivity analyses were also undertaken to identify parameters that may significantly influence the estimates. Results: The CE model estimated that the incremental cost per additional quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained at years 1, 5, and 12, was $27,310, $5,166, and $2,255, respectively. Conclusions: The study results indicate that HBO2 therapy in the treatment of diabetic ulcers is cost-effective, particularly based on a long-term perspective. However, the results are limited by the clinical studies that provide the basis of the CE estimation.

Probable sources of inhomogeneity are the various domain boundaries endemic in such materials: twin, Ca ordering, and antiphase boundaries. The material in, and neighboring, such boundaries can be insulating or conducting. We construct a decision tree for the resulting six possible morphologies, and derive or present expressions for the dielectric constant for models of each morphology. We conclude that all six morphologies can yield dielectric behavior consistent with observations. Thus, present experimental findings are insufficient to establish the internal morphology responsible for the remarkable properties of CaCu(3)Ti(4)O(12), and we suggest further experiments to distinguish among them.

J	Stockfisch, TP				Stockfisch, TP			Partially unified multiple property recursive partitioning (PUMP-RP): A new method for predicting and understanding drug selectivity	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article								The decision tree method for classification problems has been extended to accommodate multiple dependent properties. When applied to drug discovery efforts this means a separate activity class can be predicted for each of several targets with a single tree model. A new tree representation and growth procedure, PUMP-RP, has been developed. The final architecture of the tree allows for easy interpretation as to which independent variables and split values are important for all targets and which are specific to a given target. It should thus be usefully applied to studies of drug specificity. A side benefit of the new method is that it can make use of data with missing (or even sparse) dependent property values. This has the potential to leverage copious data from an older, well-studied target while beginning to study a newer target for which only a small amount of data are available.

J	Kim, H; Loh, WY				Kim, H; Loh, WY			Classification trees with bivariate linear discriminant node models	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS			English	Article						decision tree; linear discriminant analysis; tree-structured classifier		This article introduces a classification tree algorithm that can simultaneously reduce tree size, improve class prediction, and enhance data visualization. We accomplish this by fitting a bivariate linear discriminant model to the data in each node. Standard algorithms can produce fairly large tree structures because they employ a very simple node model, wherein the entire partition associated with a node is assigned to one class. We reduce the size of our trees by letting the discriminant models share part of the data complexity. Being themselves classifiers, the discriminant models can also help to improve prediction accuracy. Finally, because the discriminant models use only two predictor variables at a time, their effects are easily visualized by means of two-dimensional plots. Our algorithm does not simply fit discriminant models to the terminal nodes of a pruned tree, as this does not reduce the size of the tree. Instead, discriminant modeling is carried out in all phases of tree growth and the misclassification costs of the node models are explicitly used to prune the tree. Our algorithm is also distinct from the "linear combination split" algorithms that partition the data space with arbitrarily oriented hyperplanes. We use axis-orthogonal splits to preserve the interpretability of the tree structures.

J	Lotan, Y; Duchene, DA; Cadeddu, JA; Koeneman, KS				Lotan, Y; Duchene, DA; Cadeddu, JA; Koeneman, KS			Cost comparison of hand assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy and open nephrectomy: Analysis of individual parameters	JOURNAL OF UROLOGY			English	Article						kidney; laparoscopy; nephrectomy; cost-benefit analysis	RADICAL NEPHRECTOMY; DONOR NEPHRECTOMY; EXPERIENCE; CARCINOMA	Purpose: Hand assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy (HAL) is an effective approach to nephrectomy that is less morbid than open nephrectomy (ON). In response to budgetary pressure at our large county hospital we reviewed the published experience and identified the cost components of HAL that could be targeted to decrease procedure cost. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive literature review of HAL and ON was performed and certain parameters were abstracted, including operative (OR) time, operative equipment and hospital stay (LOS). Using these data the projected overall cost and individual cost centers at our institution for HAL and ON were compared. Decision tree analysis models were devised to estimate the cost of each treatment using computer software. One and 2-way sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of individual treatment variables on overall cost. Results: The literature showed 6 and 9 reports on 127 and 419 patients for ON and HAL, respectively. LOS was 5 and 3 days for ON and HAL, respectively. OR time was 169 and 204 minutes for ON and HAL, respectively. Based on a review of the costs at our institution ON was a less costly procedure by $205 ($6,882 vs $7,087). The slight cost superiority of the open approach was due to significantly lower costs associated with operating room time and equipment. On the other hand, HAL demonstrated a cost advantage for LOS. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that HAL was less costly if HAL OR time was less than 184 minutes, LOS following HAL was less than 2.5 days or HAL OR supply costs were less than $718. Two-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that HAL was cost advantageous if performed in less than 3 hours and the patient was discharged home within 3 postoperative days. Conclusions: Primary cost variables for nephrectomy include OR time, LOS stay and equipment cost. Using published data and decision tree analysis ON is slightly less costly by $205 than HAL at our institution. However, HAL can be more cost-effective than ON when OR time and LOS are low. Our model identifies several measures that can be used at any institution to render HAL economically superior to ON.

However, many applications require cases to be ranked by the probability of class membership. Probability estimation trees (PETs) have the same attractive features as classification trees ( e. g., comprehensibility, accuracy and efficiency in high dimensions and on large data sets). Unfortunately, decision trees have been found to provide poor probability estimates. Several techniques have been proposed to build more accurate PETs, but, to our knowledge, there has not been a systematic experimental analysis of which techniques actually improve the probability-based rankings, and by how much. In this paper we first discuss why the decision-tree representation is not intrinsically inadequate for probability estimation. Inaccurate probabilities are partially the result of decision-tree induction algorithms that focus on maximizing classification accuracy and minimizing tree size ( for example via reduced-error pruning). Larger trees can be better for probability estimation, even if the extra size is superfluous for accuracy maximization. We then present the results of a comprehensive set of experiments, testing some straightforward methods for improving probability-based rankings. We show that using a simple, common smoothing method - the Laplace correction - uniformly improves probability-based rankings. In addition, bagging substantially improves the rankings, and is even more effective for this purpose than for improving accuracy. We conclude that PETs, with these simple modifications, should be considered when rankings based on class-membership probability are required.

Attempting to improve the performance of individual matchers in such situations may not prove to be effective because of these inherent problems. Multibiometric systems seek to alleviate some of these drawbacks by providing multiple evidences of the same identity. These systems help achieve an increase in performance that may not be possible using a single biometric indicator. Further, multibiometric systems provide anti-spoofing measures by making it difficult for an intruder to spoof multiple biometric traits simultaneously. However, an effective fusion scheme is necessary to combine the information presented by multiple domain experts. This paper addresses the problem of information fusion in biometric verification systems by combining information at the matching score level. Experimental results on combining three biometric modalities (face, fingerprint and hand geometry) are presented. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The CART model built on all of the specimens (no cross-validation) had an error rate of 4/41 = 10%. The CART model suggests that mass spectra peaks in the 8000-10 000, 20000-30000, 45000-60000, and > 125 000 m/z ranges may be valuable in distinguishing between the disease/nondisease specimens.

The uniqueness of these tools is that although they can be used to find meaningful patterns in large, complex quantitative databases, they are qualitative in orientation. To illustrate the utility of these tools, the authors review the two most popular: the SOM and DTA. They provide a basic definition of health informatics, focusing on how data mining assists this field, and apply the SOM and DTA to a hypothetical example to demonstrate what these tools are and how qualitative researchers can use them.

Depending on the age groups vaccinated, the cost per symptomatic case avoided varied between Euro 700 and 1300 ( Euro 1 = US$ 0.93) for household contacts. Vaccination of contacts in day care centers and schools resulted in cost-savings. However, these findings are contingent on the limited and controversial data available on vaccine protective efficacy.

J	Ward, MP; Patronek, GJ; Glickman, LT				Ward, MP; Patronek, GJ; Glickman, LT			Benefits of prophylactic gastropexy for dogs at risk of gastric dilatation-volvulus	PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE			English	Article						dogs; gastric dilatation-volvulus; gastropexy; cost-effectiveness; decision analysis	THORACIC CONFORMATION; DECISION-ANALYSIS; VACCINATION; TREE	The lifetime probability of death from gastric dilation-volvulus (GDV) for five dog breeds was estimated based on published breed-specific longevity and GDV incidence. These breeds were Great Dane, Irish Setter, Rottweiler, Standard Poodle and Weimaraner. Lifetime risk (95% CI) of GDV in these breeds ranged from 3.9% (0-11.2%) for Rottweiler to 36.7% (25.2-14.6%) for Great Dane. A decision-tree analysis for prophylactic gastropexy-using lifetime probability of death from GDV and expected cost savings for veterinary services as outcome measures-was undertaken to determine the preferred course of action in several dog breeds. Prophylactic gastropexy was the preferred choice of action for all breeds examined, with the reduction in mortality (versus no gastropexy) ranging from 2.2-fold (Rottweiler) to 29.6-fold (Great Dane). Assuming a prophylactic gastropexy costs US$ 400, the procedure was cost-effective when the lifetime risk of GDV was greater than or equal to34%. The maximum and minimum estimated breakeven costs for the gastopexy procedure ranged from US$ 20 (Rottweiler) to US$ 435 (Great Dane). The cost-effectiveness of prophylactic gastropexy was most sensitive to the cost of treating GDV (US$ 1500). Prophylactic gastropexy raises ethical issues that need to be considered by veterinarians and dog breeders. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

Patients: Eleven consecutive patients with stage NO SCC of the head and neck. Methods: Head and neck lymphoscintigraphy was performed 2 hours after the injection of technetium Tc 99m tin colloid or phytate. A handheld gamma probe was used to detect the SN before and directly after making a skin incision. Nodes were evaluated histopathologically for micrometastasis. To determine the expected cost savings, a decision tree sensitivity analysis was designed based on the 2 competing strategies: ipsilateral neck dissection vs SN navigation surgery. The costs referred to billed costs based on the Japanese national insurance reimbursement system. Results: The sensitivity of SN navigation surgery in our series was 100% (11/11) on a patient-by-patient basis and 94% (17/18) on a node-by-node basis. Micrometastasis was found in 36% (4/11). Assuming the micrometastasis prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity of navigation surgery for detecting SN to be 30%, 90%, and 100%, respectively, the decision tree sensitivity analysis showed that introduction of SN navigation surgery in place of ipsilateral neck dissection would yield cost savings of $1218 (US) per stage NO patient in Japan and avoid 7 surgical deaths per 1000 patients who are supposed to undergo neck dissection in the neck dissection strategy. Break-even point analysis for the SN navigation surgery strategy showed that the threshold value required more than 41 patients for the savings to begin to accrue. Conclusion: Our results indicate that SN navigation surgery using radiolocalization is feasible and cost-effective, based on decision tree sensitivity analysis, in patients with stage NO SCC of the head and neck.

Cows (n = 690) from spring-calving dairy herds (n = 22) were enrolled on the basis of a history of dystocia, having a calf dead at calving or within 24 hours of calving, retained foetal membranes (RFM), metabolic disease, twins or having a vulval discharge > 13 days postpartum. Cows were blocked by age, disease status and calving date and randomly assigned to either be treated with 0.5 g of cephapirin by intrauterine infusion or left as an untreated control. Treatment occurred on average 31 days before the start of the seasonal breeding programme (Day 0). Cephapirin treatment increased the proportion of cows inseminated by Day 28 of the seasonal breeding programme (93.1% vs. 87.1%; P < 0.05) and the start of breeding programme to first insemination was shorter in treated compared to control cows (9 +/- 1 vs. 11 +/- 1 days; P < 0.05). In cows diagnosed with a RFM, dead calf or a vaginal discharge, treatment increased the proportion of cows pregnant by Day 28 and 56 of the breeding programme (P < 0.05). Cows with a purulent cervical os discharge were less likely to have been inseminated (P < 0.01) or to have conceived (P < 0.05) by Day 28 of the seasonal breeding programme and were less likely to have conceived by the end of the seasonal breeding programme (P < 0.05) than cows with nil or mucoid cervical os discharges. An economic analysis of not treating, undertaking vaginoscopy and treating only those that had purulent cervical os discharges or treating all cows with a history of RFM, a dead calf or vulval discharge was undertaken using a decision tree and Monte Carlo simulation. Under the assumptions used, treatment based on a history of one or more peripartum risk factors had a higher estimated monetary value than vaginoscopy followed by treatment of those animals that had a purulent cervical os discharge or no treatment at all. It is concluded intrauterine treatment with 0.5 g cephapirin improved reproductive performance of dairy cattle, especially those with RFM, a calf dead at calving or within 24 hours of calving and cows with a vulval discharge and that this intervention was cost-effective.

Like the previously best known algorithm, HiCuts, HyperCuts is based on a decision tree structure. Unlike HiCuts. however, in which each node in the decision tree represents a hyperplane, each node in the HyperCuts decision tree represents a k-dimensional hypercube. Using this extra degree of freedom and a new set of heuristics to find optimal hypercubes for a given amount of storage, HyperCuts can provide an order of magnitude improvement over existing classification algorithms. HyperCuts uses 2 to 10 times less memory than HiCuts optimized for memory, while the worst case search time of HyperCuts is 50 - 500% better than that of HiCuts optimized for speed. Compared with another recent scheme, EGT-PC, HyperCuts uses 1.8 - 7 times less memory space while the worst case search time is up to 5 times smaller. More importantly, unlike EGT-PC, HyperCuts can be fully pipelined to provide one classification result every packet arrival time, and also allows fast updates.

J	Liu, Y; Fung, P				Liu, Y; Fung, P			Modeling partial pronunciation variations for spontaneous Mandarin speech recognition	COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE			English	Article								The high error rate in spontaneous speech recognition is due in part to the poor modeling of pronunciation variations. An analysis of acoustic data reveals that Pronunciation variations include both complete changes and partial changes. Complete changes are the replacement of a canonical phoneme by another alternative phone, such as V being pronounced as 'p'. Partial changes are the variations within the phoneme, such as nasalization, centralization, voiceless, voiced, etc. Most current work in pronunciation modeling attempts to represent Pronunciation variations either by alternative phonetic representations or by the concatenation of subphone units at the hidden Markov state level. In this paper, we show that partial changes are a lot less clear-cut than previously assumed and cannot be modeled by mere representation by alternate phones or a concatenation of phone units. We propose modeling partial changes through acoustic model reconstruction. We first propose a partial change phone model (PCPM) to differentiate pronunciation variations. In order to improve the model resolution without increasing the parameter size too much, PCPM is used as a hidden model and merged into the pre-trained acoustic model through model reconstruction. To avoid model confusion, auxiliary decision trees are established for PCPM triphones, and one auxiliary decision tree can only be used by one standard decision tree. The acoustic model reconstruction on triphones is equivalent to decision tree merging. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated on the 1997 Hub4NE Mandarin Broadcast News corpus (1997 MBN) with different styles of speech. It gives a significant 2.39% syllable error rate absolute reduction in spontaneous speech. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The method usually results ill the lack or redundancy of hidden neurons, and causes the shortage of capacity for storing information or learning overmuch. This research proposes a new method for optimizing the number of hidden neurons based on information entropy. Firstly, an initial neural network with enough hidden neurons should be trained by a set of training samples. Secondly, the activation values of hidden neurons should be calculated by inputting the training samples that can be identified correctly by the trained neural network. Thirdly, all kinds of partitions should be tried and its information gain should be calculated, and then a decision tree for correctly dividing the whole sample space call be constructed. Finally, the important and related hidden neurons that are included in the tree can be found by searching the whole tree, and other redundant hidden neurons can be deleted. Thus, the number of hidden neurons can be decided. Taking a neural network with the best number of hidden units for tea quality evaluation as all example, the result shows that the method is effective. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

To update the state-of-the-art on pneumonia in adult patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), with special emphasis on new developments in management. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, using the following keywords: hospital-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia and healthcare-associated pneumonia, diagnosis, therapy, prevention. Results. Interventions to prevent pneumonia in the ICU should combine multiple measures targeting the invasive devices, microorganisms, and protection of the patient. Once pneumonia develops, the appropriateness of the initial antibiotic regimen is a vital determinant of outcome. Three questions should be formulated: a) Is the patient at risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus?; b) Is Acinetobacter baumannii a problem in the institution?; and c) is the patient at risk of Pseudomonas aeruginosa? Antibiotic therapy should be started immediately and must circumvent pathogen-resistance mechanisms developed after previous antibiotic exposure. Therefore, antibiotic choice should be institution specific and patient oriented. Microbiologic investigation is useful on evaluating the quality of the respiratory sample and permits early modification of the regimen in light of the microbiologic findings. Conclusion: A decision tree outlining an approach to the evaluation and management of ventilator-associated pneumonia is provided.

Medication therapy has made significant advances and improvements especially over the last 10 years. A number of new treatments and new strategies have emerged and the quality of life for the average sufferer has improved. This review will describe the rationale and strategies for current medical therapies in PD, with special emphasis on the use of antipsychotic agents. Levodopa remains the most efficacious medication for the management of PD. Long-term use of levodopa, however, is associated with the development of motor fluctuations including dyskinesia. Trials with dopamine agonists have demonstrated a delay in the onset of dyskinesia with the use of this therapy. There is also active, ongoing investigation to determine whether a neuroprotective effect may be present with agonist therapy. Anticholinergics have been successfully used to treat tremor as well as sialorrhoea and urinary urgency. Catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors increase 'on time', decrease 'off time', and improve motor scores. Continuous stimulation of dopamine receptors may decrease the fluctations observed with pulsatile delivery of anti-Parkinsonian medications, but this will require more study. Monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors, specifically selegiline, may provide symptomatic improvement; the question as to whether a neuroprotective benefit is present remains unanswered. Amantadine has demonstrated both symptomatic benefit and dyskinesia benefit in some patients. Selective dopamine blockers such as clozaril and quetiapine, have been shown to be effective in the treatment of psychosis. This class of medications is particularly useful as an adjunctive to levodopa and dopamine agonists. Doses of dopaminergic drugs can be escalated to treat Parkinsonian symptoms, whereas selective dopamine blockers can be added to block psychosis. Old management strategies required a reduction in dopaminergic therapy and therefore worsened Parkinsonian symptoms. Even though there have been great advances in the medical options for symptomatic management of PD, there are still many unmet needs for this patient population.

J	Lee, WP; Yang, TH				Lee, WP; Yang, TH			Personalizing information appliances: a multi-agent framework for TV programme recommendations	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						intelligent agent; personalization; machine learning; recommender system; information appliance		It has been advocated to develop information appliances to provide ubiquitous Internet information access. After the invention of digital set-top-box, television is expected to become one of the most popular information appliances because of the tremendous digital multi-media programmes it can broadcast. However, as in the World Wide Web, the available TV programmes and their correspondingly electronic information within the increasing digital channels may cause the problem of information overload. Though the audience has more alternatives while choosing programmes, he also has to spend more and more time to read the on-line information about the programme contents or to browse different channels in order to decide what to watch. One way to overcome such a problem is to build intelligent recommender systems to provide personalized information services. By analyzing the information collected from the user, a personalized recommender system is able to reason his personal preferences and then choose the programmes for him. This paper presents a multi-agent framework in which a decision tree-based approach is proposed to learn a user's preferences. The experimental studies concentrate on how to recommend programmes of films and news to a user, and on how the system can adapt to a user's most recent preferences. The results and analysis show the promise of our system. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This algorithm can integrate many algorithms together to solve a single problem. The strength of AOT is demonstrated by solving a High-Level Synthesis problem. A High-Level Synthesis problem consists of many design steps and many algorithms to solve each of them. AOT can easily integrate these algorithms to limit the search space and use them as heuristic weights to guide the search. During the search, AOT generates a dynamic decision tree. A boosting technique similar to branch and bound algorithms is applied to guide the search in the decision tree. The storage explosion problem is eliminated by the evaporation of pheromone trail generated by ants; the inherent property of our search algorithm.

J	Wang, XY; Schroeder, D; Dobbs, D; Honavar, V				Wang, XY; Schroeder, D; Dobbs, D; Honavar, V			Automated data-driven discovery of motif-based protein function classifiers	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th Joint Conference on Information Sciences	MAR 08-13, 2002	RES TRIANGLE PK, NC	Assoc Intelligent Machinery, Informat Sci Journal, Duke Univ, Acad Affairs, Tamkang Univ, N Carolina Biotechnol Ctr, GalxoSmithKline, George Mason Univ			STRUCTURAL GENOMICS; SEQUENCE; CLASSIFICATION; FAMILIES; PREDICTION; HOMOLOGIES; RESOURCE; ERA	This paper describes an approach to data-driven discovery of decision trees or rules for assigning protein sequences to functional families using sequence motifs. This method is able to capture regularities that can be described in terms of presence or absence of arbitrary combinations of motifs. A training set of peptidase sequences labeled with the corresponding MEROPS functional families or clans is used to automatically construct decision trees that capture regularities sufficient to assign the sequences to their respective functional families. The performance of the resulting decision tree classifiers is then evaluated on an independent test set. We compared the rules constructed using motifs generated by a multiple sequence alignment based motif discovery tool (MEME) with rules constructed using expert annotated PROSITE Motifs (patterns and profiles). Our results indicate that the former provide a potentially powerful high throughput technique for constructing protein function classifiers when adequate training data are available. Examination of the generated rules in relation to known three-dimensional structures of members in the case of two families (MEROPS families C14 and M12) suggests that the proposed technique may be able to identify combinations of sequence - motifs that characterize functionally significant three-dimensional structural features of proteins.

J	McCoy, SA; Martin, TP; Baldwin, JF				McCoy, SA; Martin, TP; Baldwin, JF			Learning rules for odour recognition in an electronic nose	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF UNCERTAINTY FUZZINESS AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						electronic nose; odour sensing; fuzzy matching; fril; fuzzy decision tree induction; mass assignment	PATTERN-RECOGNITION; NETWORKS; VAPORS	The problem of automating the sensing and classification of odours is one which promises a wide range of industrial applications. During the INTESA project, a prototype electronic nose was developed, using sensors based on novel conducting polymer materials and also more traditional MOS materials. The software component of the prototype processes the transient resistance change signals recorded by the hardware, and classifies the odour sample into one of a number of "odour classes". This paper describes two of the soft computing methods investigated for learning classification rules in this domain. The first method builds on previous work done on the Fril data browser, using clustering, fuzzy matching, Fril rules and evidential logic rules. The second method uses a fuzzy extension of the ID3 decision tree induction method, called "mass assignment tree induction (MATI)". Some of the results of applying these methods to data obtained from the INTESA prototype are presented and discussed.

J	Myles, AJ; Brown, SD				Myles, AJ; Brown, SD			Induction of decision trees using fuzzy partitions	JOURNAL OF CHEMOMETRICS			English	Article						decision tree; classification; fuzzy; recursive partitioning		A new method for the induction of fuzzy decision trees is introduced. The fuzzy decision tree classifier improves prediction accuracy using smaller models by locating more robust splitting regions. The proposed method also provides a measure of confidence for sample classification by propagating partition memberships into all leaf nodes, thereby relaxing local subspace restrictions. The fuzzy decision tree algorithm is presented and compared against standard and bagged decision tree classifiers. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

J	Fern, A; Givan, R				Fern, A; Givan, R			Online ensemble learning: An empirical study	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						online learning; ensemble learning; boosting; bagging; decision trees; branch prediction		We study resource-limited online learning, motivated by the problem of conditional-branch outcome prediction in computer architecture. In particular, we consider ( parallel) time and space-efficient ensemble learners for online settings, empirically demonstrating benefits similar to those shown previously for offline ensembles. Our learning algorithms are inspired by the previously published "boosting by filtering" framework as well as the offline Arc-x4 boosting-style algorithm. We train ensembles of online decision trees using a novel variant of the ID4 online decision-tree algorithm as the base learner, and show empirical results for both boosting and bagging-style online ensemble methods. Our results evaluate these methods on both our branch prediction domain and online variants of three familiar machine-learning benchmarks. Our data justifies three key claims. First, we show empirically that our extensions to ID4 significantly improve performance for single trees and additionally are critical to achieving performance gains in tree ensembles. Second, our results indicate significant improvements in predictive accuracy with ensemble size for the boosting-style algorithm. The bagging algorithms we tried showed poor performance relative to the boosting-style algorithm ( but still improve upon individual base learners). Third, we show that ensembles of small trees are often able to outperform large single trees with the same number of nodes ( and similarly outperform smaller ensembles of larger trees that use the same total number of nodes). This makes online boosting particularly useful in domains such as branch prediction with tight space restrictions (i.e., the available real-estate on a microprocessor chip).

METHODS: We used a decision tree in this cost-effectiveness analysis to model outcomes among pregnant women in high-risk communities and nationwide who received an initial, negative HIV antibody test during the first trimester. The main outcome measure was discounted costs per year of infant life saved. RESULTS: In high-risk communities with estimated HIV incidence of 6.2 per 1000 person-years, a second HIV test compared with no second test would detect 192 infections in women, prevent approximately 37 infant infections, and save 655 infant life-years per 100,000 women tested. Net savings would be $5.2 million. Applied to an estimated national incidence of .17 per 1000 person-years, a second test would detect 5.3 infections in women, prevent 1.3 infant infections, and save 23.3 infant life-years per 100,000 women tested. Net costs would be $1.06 million, or $45,708 for each year of infant life saved. A second test would result in net savings in populations with HIV incidence of 1.2 per 1000 person-years or higher. CONCLUSION: Health care providers serving women in communities with an HIV incidence of 1 per 1000 person-years or higher should strongly consider implementing a second voluntary universal HIV test during the third trimester.

To build and test a computational model for predicting small molecule solubility, to improve the cost-effectiveness of the selection of vendor compounds suitable for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) screening. Methods. A simple recursive partitioning decision tree-based classification model was generated utilizing "off-the-shelf" commercial software from Accelrys Inc., with a training set of 1992 compounds based on a series of calculated topologic and physical properties. The predictive ability of the decision tree was then assessed by employing it to classify a test set of 2851 vendor compounds, and the classification was subsequently used to guide the purchase of 686 compounds for the purpose of NMR screening. Results. When the decision tree was used to guide purchasing, the percentage of "acceptable" compounds suitable for NMR screening doubled compared with the use of a simple cLogP cutoff, improving the successful selection rate from 25% to 50%. Conclusions. A simple recursive partitioning decision tree may successfully be used to improve cost-effectiveness by reducing the wastage associated with the unnecessary purchase of vendor compounds unsuitable for NMR screening because of insolubility.

A number of protective mechanisms have evolved in the edge strands of beta-sheets, preventing the aggregation and insolubility of most natural beta-sheet proteins. Such mechanisms are unfavorable in the interior of a beta-sheet. The problem of distinguishing edge strands from central strands based on sequence information alone is important in predicting residues and mutations likely to be involved in aggregation, and is also a first step in predicting folding topology. Here we report support vector machine (SVM) and decision tree methods developed to classify edge strands from central strands in a representative set of protein domains. Interestingly, rules generated by the decision tree method are in close agreement with our knowledge of protein structure and are potentially useful in a number of different biological applications. When trained on strands from proteins of known structure, using structure-based (Dictionary of Secondary Structure in Proteins) strand assignments, both methods achieved mean cross-validated, prediction accuracies of similar to78%. These accuracies were reduced when strand assignments from secondary structure prediction were used. Further investigation of this effect revealed that it could be explained by a significant reduction in the accuracy of standard secondary structure prediction methods for edge strands, in comparison with central strands.

J	Rocco, CM				Rocco, CM			A rule induction approach to improve Monte Carlo system reliability assessment	RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY			English	Article						decision tree; rule induction; Monte Carlo simulation; reliability evaluation		A Decision Tree (DT) approach to build empirical models for use in Monte Carlo reliability evaluation is presented. The main idea is to develop an estimation algorithm, by training a model on a restricted data set, and replacing the Evaluation Function (EF) by a simpler calculation, which provides reasonably accurate model outputs. The proposed approach is illustrated with two systems of different size, represented by their equivalent networks. The robustness of the DT approach as an approximated method to replace the EF is also analysed. Excellent system reliability results are obtained by training a DT with a small amount of information.

J	Hakkinen, J; Suontausta, J; Riis, S; Jensen, KJ				Hakkinen, J; Suontausta, J; Riis, S; Jensen, KJ			Assessing text-to-phoneme mapping strategies in speaker independent isolated word recognition	SPEECH COMMUNICATION			English	Article						speaker independent speech recognition; isolated word recognition; text-to-phoneme mapping; decision trees; neural networks		A phonetic transcription of the vocabulary, i.e., a lexicon, is needed in sub-word based speech recognition and text-to-speech systems. Decision trees and neural networks have successfully been used for creating lexicons on-line from an open vocabulary. We briefly review these methods and compare them in detail in the text-to-phoneme mapping task as part of a phoneme based speaker independent speech recognizer. The decision tree and neural network based methods were first evaluated in terms of phoneme accuracy and then in extensive speech recognition tests. American english dictionaries and speech databases were used in all experiments. The decision tree based method achieved high phoneme accuracies when the training material covered the test vocabulary well. In typical speech recognition tests, the recognition rates obtained using the decision tree based lexicons were close to the baseline that was obtained using accurate transcriptions. Although the lexicons obtained using neural networks resulted in somewhat lower baseline recognition rates, they provided slightly better results in generalization tests. Moreover, when the neural network based mappings were appended with a look-up table comprising the most likely vocabulary items, which would be the practical set-up, their performance increased significantly. The main advantage of neural networks over decision trees is their low memory consumption. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Chen, L				Chen, L			Computing complete answers to queries in the presence of limited access patterns	VLDB JOURNAL			English	Article						limited access patterns to relations; complete answers to queries; query stability	RELATIONAL EXPRESSIONS; EQUIVALENCES	In data applications such as information integration, there can be limited access patterns to relations, i.e., binding patterns require values to be specified for certain attributes in order to retrieve data from a relation. As a consequence, we cannot retrieve all tuples from these relations. In this article we study the problem of computing the complete answer to a query, i.e., the answer that could be computed if all the tuples could be retrieved. A query is stable if for any instance of the relations in the query, its complete answer can be computed using the access patterns permitted by the relations. We study the problem of testing stability of various classes of queries, including conjunctive queries, unions of conjunctive queries, and conjunctive queries with arithmetic comparisons. We give algorithms and complexity results for these classes of queries. We show that stability of datalog programs is undecidable, and give a sufficient condition for stability of datalog queries. Finally, we stud), data-dependent computability of the complete answer to a nonstable query, and propose a decision tree for guiding the process to compute the complete answer.

J	Horsch, B				Horsch, B			Modelling the spatial distribution of montane and subalpine forests in the central Alps using digital elevation models	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						remote sensing; GIS; vegetation distribution; parallel-epiped-vegetation model (PED); DEM; geomorphometry; Alps	VEGETATION PATTERNS; TERRAIN DATA; PREDICTING VEGETATION; DECISION-TREE; TOPOGRAPHY; COMMUNITIES; SWITZERLAND; ENVIRONMENT; LANDSCAPES; SATELLITE	The analysis of complex interactions between spatial distribution patterns of site factors and vegetation types is crucial for understanding high mountain ecosystems, especially in the view of a changing climate., Therefore, in the present study, a GIS and remote sensing-based approach is followed to produce a vegetation map for a study area in the Western Alps (Switzerland). Two major forest alliances are chosen for analysis: subalpine coniferous forest Vaccinio-Piceion/Larici-Pinetum cembrae and montane oak forest Quercion pubescenti-petraeae. As spatial information on site factors is commonly lacking in mountain areas, the use of a digital elevation model (DEM) is a potential substitute for use in vegetation analyses: it highly correlates with temperature, moisture, geomorphological processes and disturbance factors. Thus, it is important to analyse the capabilities of a DEM for indicating habitat conditions in a landscape characterised by high topodiversity and a patchwork of microclimatic habitats. For the purpose of identifying the potential of landform parameters for the indication of forest habitat structures in the present study, 24 primary and secondary landform parameters have been derived, indicating temperature and moisture distribution, exposure towards wind, snow, etc. Quantitative analyses were performed using statistical means such as contingency correlation coefficients and principal components analysis. The results formed the basis for the development of parallel-epiped-vegetation models (PED) used to simulate the spatial distribution patterns of the subalpine coniferous and the montane oak forest. It can be shown that topographic variables derived from a DEM at a spatial resolution of 25 m are very useful for indicating habitats of large forest types. Additionally potential forest sites in the cultural landscape, removed by human logging, can be reconstructed. Inaccuracies within the simulation results can partly be attributed to the insufficient parameterisation of geomorphologic activity and to poor spatial resolution of the DEM as compared to the vegetation data. Although the lack of information on the human dimension leads to some uncertainties in the interpretation of spatial patterns of vegetation, the exclusive use of topographic variables in vegetation models for the indication of forest habitats is very promising.

Four mechanisms including polar narcosis, respiratory uncoupling, pro-electrophilicity, and soft electrophilicity were involved. Using molecular descriptors as splitting variables, a three level decision tree with six terminal nodes was obtained. The tree model first separated polar narcosis/pro-electrophilicity from respiratory uncoupling/soft electrophilicity by E-lumo in the first level of the tree. In subsequent levels of the tree, polar narcosis was separated from pro-electrophilicity by N-hdon and E-homo, and respiratory uncoupling was separated from soft electrophilicity by E-lumo and log K-ow. Validation of the decision tree approach indicated that the overall mechanism prediction accuracy was approximately 85%. The decision tree model had the advantage of easy interpretation.

However, symptom assessment alone is not reliable for diagnosis, and an initial evaluation with pouch endoscopy (test-first strategy) has been shown to be more accurate. Cost-effectiveness of these strategies has not been compared. The aim of this study was to compare cost-effectiveness of different clinical approaches for patients with symptoms suggestive of pouchitis. METHODS: Pouchitis was defined as pouchitis disease activity index scores greater than or equal to 7. The frequency of pouchitis in symptomatic patients with ileal pouch was estimated to be 51%; the efficacy for initial therapy with metronidazole (MTZ) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) was 75% and 85%, respectively. Cost estimates were obtained from Medicare reimbursement data. RESULTS: Six competing strategies (MTZ trial, CIP trial, MTZ-then-CIP trial, CIP-then-MTZ trial, pouch endoscopy with biopsy, and pouch endoscopy without biopsy) were modeled in a decision tree. Costs per correct diagnosis with appropriate treatment were $194 for MTZ trial, $279 for CIP trial, $208 for MTZ-then-CIP trial, $261 for CIP-then-MTZ trial, $352 for pouch endoscopy with biopsy, and $243 for pouch endoscopy without biopsy. Of the two strategies with the lowest cost, the pouch endoscopy without biopsy strategy costs $50 more per patient than the MTZ trial strategy but results in an additional 15 days for early diagnosis and thus initiation of appropriate treatment (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $3 per additional day gained). The results of base-case analysis were robust in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Although the MTZ-trial strategy had the lowest cost, the pouch endoscopy without biopsy strategy was most cost-effective. Therefore, based on its relatively low cost and the avoidance of both diagnostic delay and adverse effects associated with unnecessary antibiotics, pouch endoscopy without biopsy is the recommended strategy among those tested for the diagnosis of pouchitis.

J	Oppl, R; Kalberlah, F; Evans, PG; Van Hemmen, JJ				Oppl, R; Kalberlah, F; Evans, PG; Van Hemmen, JJ			A toolkit for dermal risk assessment and management: An overview	ANNALS OF OCCUPATIONAL HYGIENE			English	Article						dermal exposure; exposure assessment; risk assessment; risk management; skin exposure		The European Research project RISKOFDERM (QLK4-CT-1999-01107) has two major goals. One is the development of a conceptual model for dermal risk assessment for regulatory purposes, such as the registration of new chemicals. The other goal is to develop a simple-to-use toolkit for assessment and management of health risks from occupational dermal exposure. This toolkit was constructed by analysing the major determinants of dermal hazard and dermal exposure. The results were combined in the form of a decision-tree that leads the user of the toolkit through a number of questions on the hazardous properties of the chemical in use, and on the exposure situation. The toolkit translates the information given by the user into broad data categories of hazard and exposure that lead to a rough estimate of health risk from dermal exposure. This is done separately for local skin effects and skin allergy on the one hand, and systemic effects after skin penetration on the other hand. After going through the decision-tree, the user is advised to act to control the risk, and to read general information on dermal exposure and a statement describing the uncertainty of the risk estimate produced by the toolkit. The final version of the toolkit will be available for use on portable or stationary computers and runs the decision algorithms in the background so that the non-expert user only will see the judgements, the recommendations and the general information. The toolkit will be evaluated before release by experts on the various elements included in the toolkit and by field experts in its practical use. The toolkit is an attempt to adapt elements of exact science to a situation where the necessary input data are of limited quality and are only estimates. The toolkit does not claim to give precise answers based on imprecise information. The purpose is to enable the user to estimate the order of magnitude of hazard, exposure and risk, and to encourage the user to deal with the issues of dermal hazard, exposure and control.

All virus strains with insertions between amino acids 67 and 70 of the reverse transcriptase (n=6) were highly resistant. Virus strains with the Q151M mutation were divided into susceptible (n=12) and highly resistant (n=8) viruses. This difference was due to the absence or presence of the K65R mutation, which was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis. Viral clones with various combinations of the mutations M41L, K70R, L210W, and T215F or T215Y were analyzed for cross-resistance induced by thymidine analogue mutations (TAMS). The levels of increased resistance induced by single, double, and triple mutations at the indicated positions could be ranked as follows: for mutants with single mutations, mutations at positions 41>215>70; for mutants with double mutations, mutations at positions 41 and 215>70 and 215=210 and 215>41 and 70; for mutants with triple mutations, mutations at positions 41, 210, and 215>41, 70, and 215. Viral clones with M184V or M184I exhibited slightly increased susceptibilities to tenofovir (0.7-fold). Almost all clones with TAM-induced resistance were resensitized when M184V was present (P<0.001). Among the viruses in the clinical samples, the rate of tenofovir resistance significantly increased with the number of TAMS both in the samples with 184M and in those with 184V (P=0.005 and P=0.003, respectively). A resensitizing effect of M184V was confirmed for all samples exhibiting at least one TAM (P=0.03). However, accumulation of at least two TAMS resulted in more than 2.0-fold reduced susceptibility to tenofovir, irrespective of the presence of M184V. Decision tree building, a classical machine learning technique, was used to generate models for the interpretation of mutations with respect to tenofovir resistance. The application of previously proposed cutoffs for a reduced response to therapy and treatment failure demonstrated the central roles of positions 215 and 65 for 1.5- and 4.0-fold reduced susceptibilities, respectively. Thus, clinically relevant resistance may be conferred by the accumulation of TAMS, and the resensitizing effect of M184V should be considered only minor.

J	Hewett, R				Hewett, R			Data mining for generating predictive models of local hydrology	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics (SMC)	OCT 07-10, 2001	TUCSON, AZ	IEEE, Raytheon		data mining; machine learning; inductive technique; decision tables	RAINFALL	The problem of downscaling the effects of global scale climate variability into predictions of local hydrology has important implications for water resource management. Our research aims to identify predictive relationships that can be used to integrate solar and ocean-atmospheric conditions into forecasts of regional water flows. In recent work we have developed an induction technique called second-order table compression, in which learning can be viewed as a process that transforms a table consisting of training data into a second-order table ( which has sets of atomic values as entries) with fewer rows by merging rows in consistency preserving ways. Here, we apply the second-order table compression technique to generate predictive models of future water inflows of Lake Okeechobee, a primary source of water supply for south Florida. We also describe SORCER, a second-order table compression learning system and compare its performance with three well-established data mining techniques: neural networks, decision tree learning and associational rule mining. SORCER gives more accurate results, on the average, than the other methods with average accuracy between 49% and 56% in the prediction of inflows discretized into four ranges. We discuss the implications of these results and the practical issues in assessing the results from data mining models to guide decision-making.

J	Reinert, P; Soubeyrand, B; Gauchoux, R				Reinert, P; Soubeyrand, B; Gauchoux, R			35-year measles, mumps, rubella vaccination assessment in France	ARCHIVES DE PEDIATRIE			French	Article						vaccination; program evaluation; measles vaccine; mumps vaccine; rubella vaccine		Aim. - The setting-up and the follow-up of a vaccination programme require important human and economical investments. Our study objective consists of the clinical benefit evaluation given by measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination since monovalent and combined vaccines availability (35 years for measles. 30 years for rubella and 20 years for mumps). Method. - Vaccination impact has been evaluated from the modelisation for each disease under the shape of a decision tree relying on epidemiological data and on efficacy data of the vaccines. We have compared the results in terms of complications, sequaela, deaths in the population (vaccination period) with the results that we would obtain if this same population had not been vaccinated (non vaccination period). The general model was applied to each of the three diseases excluding congenital rubella syndrome. They have been modelised according to the occurrence, or not, of a complication leading to an evolution towards either recovery or sequaela or death. The estimation of the number of avoided congenital rubella syndromes has been made from the number of protected women by vaccination and incidence figures of congenital rubella syndromes reported in the population considered before and after vaccination. Results. - In France over the period of time considered, almost 2 million meningitis. 60 000 encephalitis, 170 subacute sclerosis panencephalitis and more than 5600 neurological sequaela including more than 600 deafness cases have been avoided as a result of the MMR vaccination programme. Moreover, 590 000 pneumonia. more than one million of acute otitis media and 300 000 orchitis, 3000 rubella infection cases occurring during pregnancy have also been avoided. Overall, more than 12 000 deaths that have been avoided as a result of the MMR vaccination. Conclusions. - In France, MMR vaccination programme leads to a huge benefit in terms of public health, which emphasises the true value of vaccination in the daily medical practice.

J	Combes, RD; Dandrea, J; Balls, M				Combes, RD; Dandrea, J; Balls, M			FRAME and the royal commission on environmental pollution: Common recommendations for assessing risks posed by chemicals under the EU REACH system	ATLA-ALTERNATIVES TO LABORATORY ANIMALS			English	Editorial Material						chemicals testing; environmental pollution; FRAME; REACH; royal commission	DECISION-MAKING FRAMEWORKS; EUROPEAN-UNION; TOXICITY; SUBSTANCES; ALTERNATIVES; QSARS	This document discusses recommendations made by FRAME and the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution (RCEP) with regard to the current European Commission proposals on the Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH) system for assessing the risks of chemicals to humans, wildlife and the environment. Of several common aims and recommendations, the two most important are: a) the greater use of non-animal testing methods, especially computational prediction methods (for example, [quantitative] structure-activity relationships, expert systems and biokinetic modelling) for prioritising chemicals for hazard assessment; and b) the greater use of intelligent exposure-based targeted risk assessment, with less emphasis being placed on tonnage-triggers. FRAME has produced a decision-tree testing scheme to illustrate the way in which these approaches could be used, together with in vitro test methods. This scheme has been slightly modified to take account of proposals subsequently made by the RCEP. In addition, FRAME points out that new and improved computational methods are needed through more coordinated research, and that these and existing methods need to be validated. The similarities between the independent publications of FRAME and the RCEP add weight to the recommendations that each have made concerning the implementation of the REACH system.

J	Delaney, G; Barton, M; Jacob, S				Delaney, G; Barton, M; Jacob, S			Estimation of an optimal radiotherapy utilization rate for breast carcinoma - A review of the evidence	CANCER			English	Article						breast carcinoma incidence; epidemiologic data; optimal radiotherapy use; sensitivity analysis	CANCER PATIENTS; CLINICAL-COURSE; HIGH-RISK; POSTOPERATIVE RADIOTHERAPY; PREMENOPAUSAL WOMEN; AMERICAN-SOCIETY; BONE METASTASES; CHEMOTHERAPY; RECURRENCE; SURVIVAL	BACKGROUND. Radiotherapy utilization rates for breast carcinoma vary widely, both within and between countries. Current estimates of the proportion of patients with carcinoma who optimally should receive radiotherapy are based either on expert opinion or on the measurement of actual utilization rates, and not on the best scientific evidence. METHODS. To develop an evidence-based benchmark for radiotherapy utilization in patients with breast carcinoma, the authors undertook a systematic review of treatment guidelines on the use of radiotherapy for breast carcinoma. A decision tree was constructed, and the proportions of patients with clinical features that lead to a decision for radiotherapy were obtained from epidemiological data. This ideal utilization rate was compared with the utilization rates of radiotherapy over the last decade for breast carcinoma in Australia and internationally. RESULTS. The proportion of patients with breast carcinoma in whom radiotherapy would be recommended according to the best available evidence was calculated at 83% (95% confidence interval, 82-85%) of all patients with breast carcinoma. A review of actual radiotherapy utilization rates for breast carcinoma revealed that, in clinical practice, actual utilization rates varied between 24% and 71%. CONCLUSIONS. A substantial difference was found between the recommended optimal utilization of radiotherapy based on evidence and the actual rates reported in clinical practice. The reasons for these differences need to be examined, and a plan for addressing the suboptimal use of radiotherapy needs to be implemented. (C) 2003 American Cancer Society.

J	Braha, D; Shmilovici, A				Braha, D; Shmilovici, A			On the use of decision tree induction for discovery of interactions in a photolithographic process	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING			English	Article						aata mining; decision tree induction; photolithography; semiconductor process control; yield management	YIELD; SYSTEM	This paper delineates a comprehensive and successful application of decision tree induction to 1054 records of production lots taken from a lithographic process with 45 processing steps. Complex interaction effects among manufacturing equipment that lead to increased product variability have been detected. The extracted information has been confirmed by the process engineers, and used to improve the lithographic process. The paper suggests that decision tree induction may be particularly useful when data is multidimensional, and the various process parameters and machinery exhibit highly complex interactions. Another implication is that on-line monitoring of the manufacturing process (e.g., closed-loop critical dimensions control) using data mining may be highly effective.

After partitioning a set of protein sequences using SOM, conventional homology alignment is applied to each cluster to determine the conserved local motif (biological pattern) for the cluster. These local motifs are then regarded as rules for prediction and classification. In the application to the prediction of HIV protease cleavage sites in proteins, we found that the rules derived from this method are much more robust than those derived from the decision tree method.

To investigate the interaction between urinary calcium, oxalate, and citrate as major risk factors for calcium stones formation, their 24-h urinary excretion was determined in 30 children with urolithiasis and 15 normal healthy children. The cutoff points between children with urolithiasis and healthy children, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for each risk factor alone as well as for all three taken together were determined. OneR and J4.8 classifiers as parts of the larger data mining software Weka, based on machine learning algorithms, were used for the determination of the cutoff points for differentiation of the children. The decision tree based on J4.8 classifier analysis of all three risk factors together proved to be the best for differentiating stone formers from normal children. In comparison to the accuracy of the differentiation after calcium and oxalate of 80% and 75.6%, respectively, the decision tree showed an accuracy of 97.8%. Even when its stability was tested by the leave-one-out cross-validation procedure, the accuracy remained at a very acceptable percentage of 93.2% correctly classified patients. J4.8 classifier analysis gave a look inside urinary calcium, oxalate, and citrate interaction. Urinary calcium excretion was shown as the most informative in discrimination of the children with urolithiasis from healthy children. However, it was shown that oxalate and citrate excretions might influence the stone formation in a subpopulation of the stone formers. In patients with low urinary calcium, a major role in lithogenesis belongs to oxalate, in some of them alone and in others in conjunction with citrate. Decreased urinary citrate excretion in the presence of increased oxalate excretion may lead to stone formation.

Methods: ROC analyses were performed on pharmacy records of 476 VA patients who had been treated on a high potency neuroleptic then changed to either OLA or RIS. Results: Overall 68% patients switched to OLA and 32% to RIS. The best predictor of neuroleptic choice was age at switch, with 78% of patients aged less than 55 years receiving OLA and 51% of those aged greater than or equal to 55 years receiving OLA (chi(2) = 38.2, P < 0.001). Further analysis of the former group indicated that adding the predictor of one or more inpatient days to age increased the likelihood of an OLA switch from 78% to 85% (chi(2) = 7.3, P < 0.01) while further analysis of the latter group indicated that adding the predictor of less than 10 inpatients days to age decreased the likelihood of an OLA switch from 51% to 45% (chi(2) 7.0, P < 0.01). Conclusions: ROC analyses have the advantage over other analyses, such as regression techniques, insofar as their "cut-points" are readily interpretable, their sequential use forms an intuitive "decision tree" and allows the potential identification of clinically relevant "subgroups". The software used in this analysis is in the public domain (http://mirecc.stanford.edu). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

GIS data have been used to calculate parameters for objects belonging to major classes of man-made objects represented on large-scale topographic maps. A moment-based mathematical approach was used for the formal description of objects and calculation of their shape parameters. A decision tree method was employed to formulate classification rules applied to classify objects extracted from high-resolution aerial or satellite images.

J	Ammann, RA; Hirt, A; Luthy, AR; Aebi, C				Ammann, RA; Hirt, A; Luthy, AR; Aebi, C			Identification of children presenting with fever in chemotherapy-induced neutropenia at low risk for severe bacterial infection	MEDICAL AND PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY			English	Article						bacterial infection; febrile neutropenia; myelotoxicity	BINOMIAL CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; EARLY HOSPITAL DISCHARGE; CANCER-PATIENTS; FEBRILE; EPISODES	Background. Febrile neutropenia (FN) remains a frequent complication in pediatric oncology, requiring emergency hospitalization and empirical broad spectrum antibiotics. The distinction of patients at high versus low risk for severe bacterial infection (SBI) is not fully established. The purpose of this study was to define a rule predicting the risk to develop SBI in children and adolescents with FN, based on information accessible at presentation. Procedure. Information accessible within 2 hr from presentation was collected retrospectively on all pediatric cancer patients presenting with FN from 1993 to 2001 in a single institution. Patients with established SBI at presentation were excluded. After univariate analyses, two multivariate models predicting the risk of SBI were constructed and their performance evaluated using crossvalidation. Results. An 5131 developed in 106 (37%) of 285 episodes of 111 children. The logistic regression model outperformed the decision tree model in predicting SBI. It was based on seven variables: bone marrow involvement, no clinical signs of viral infection, high level of C-reactive protein, high hemoglobin, low leukocyte count, presence of central venous catheter, and diagnosis of pre-B-cell leukemia. At 96% sensitivity, the crossvalidated specificity was 26%, and the negative predictive value 91%. Conclusions. Combining selected information accessible at presentation, SBI in FN can be predicted with clinically useful specificity maintaining very high sensitivity. Induction therapy and absence of clinical signs of viral infection were identified as new predictors of SBI.

J	Jakob, C; Siebesma, AP				Jakob, C; Siebesma, AP			A new subcloud model for mass-flux convection schemes: Influence on triggering, updraft properties, and model climate	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW			English	Article							GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; ATMOSPHERIC BOUNDARY-LAYER; SHALLOW CUMULUS CONVECTION; LARGE-SCALE MODELS; CLOUD ENSEMBLE; PARAMETERIZATION; PARAMETRIZATION; REPRESENTATION; SENSITIVITY; RADIATION	All convection parameterizations in models of the atmosphere include a decision tree to decide on at least the occurrence, and often the type, of convection in a model grid volume. This decision tree is sometimes referred to as the "trigger function." This study investigates the role that the decision-making processes play in the simulation of convection in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts global forecast model. For this purpose, a new simple parcel-ascent model based on an entraining plume model is developed to replace the currently used undilute ascent in the initial decision making. The consequences of the use of the more realistic model for the behavior of convection itself and its impact on the model climate are investigated. It is shown that there are profound changes to both the convection characteristics, and consequently, the model climate. The wider implications of the findings here for the general design of a mass-flux convection parameterization are discussed.

In this paper, we introduce the idea of combining a decision tree's expected value and variance in a new probabilistic measure for assessing the performance of a tree. We develop a genetic algorithm for constructing a tree using our new measure and conduct computational experiments that show the advantages of our approach. Further, we investigate the effect of introducing diversity into the population used by our genetic algorithm. We allow the genetic algorithm to simultaneously focus on two distinct probabilistic measures-one that is risk averse and one that is risk seeking. Our bivariate genetic algorithm for constructing a decision tree performs very well, scales up quite nicely to handle data sets with hundreds of thousands of points, and requires only a small percent of the data to generate a high-quality decision tree. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on three large data sets.

We present here the use of microarrays of tumor-derived proteins to profile the antibody repertoire in the sera of prostate cancer patients and controls. Two-dimensional liquid chromatography was used to separate proteins from the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP into 1760 fractions. These fractions were spotted in microarrays on coated microscope slides, and the microarrays were incubated individually with serum samples from 25 men with prostate cancer and. controls. The amount of immunoglobulin bound to each fraction by each serum 25 male.. sample was quantified. Statistical analysis revealed that 38 of the fractions had significantly higher levels of immunoglobulin binding in the prostate cancer samples compared to the controls. Two fractions showed higher binding in the control samples. The significantly higher immunoglobulin reactivity from the prostate cancer samples may reflect a strong immune response to the tumors in the prostate cancer patients. We used multivariate analysis to classify the samples as either prostate cancer or control. In a crossvalidation study, recursive partitioning classified the samples with 84% accuracy. A decision tree with two levels of partitioning classified the samples with 98% accuracy. Additional studies will allow further characterization of tumor antigens in prostate cancer and their significance for diagnosis. These results suggest that microarrays of fractionated proteins could be a powerful tool for tumor antigen discovery and cancer diagnosis.

In the first step of this algorithm, we use either decision-tree analysis (DTA) or information theoretic subset selection (ITSS) as a database mining technique to identify which process input variables best classify each of the process outputs (maximum cell concentration, maximum product concentration, and productivity) monitored in the experimental fermentations. The second step of the optimization method is to train an artificial neural network (ANN) model of the process input-output data, using the critical inputs identified in the first step. Finally, a hybrid genetic algorithm (hybrid GA), which includes both gradient and stochastic search methods, is used to identify the maximum output modeled by the ANN and the values of the input conditions that result in that maximum. The results of the database mining techniques are compared, both in terms of the inputs selected and the subsequent ANN performance. For the E. coli process used in this study, we identified 6 inputs from the original 13 that resulted in an ANN that best modeled the GFP fluorescence outputs of an independent test set. Values of the six inputs that resulted in a modeled maximum fluorescence were identified by applying a hybrid GA to the ANN model developed. When these conditions were tested in laboratory fermentors, an actual maximum fluorescence of 2.16E6 AU was obtained. The previous high value of fluorescence that was observed was 1.51E6 AU. Thus, this input condition set that was suggested by implementing the proposed optimization scheme on the available historical database increased the maximum fluorescence by 55%.

J	Souza, C; Firestone, L; Silva, LM; Roberts, D				Souza, C; Firestone, L; Silva, LM; Roberts, D			Mapping forest degradation in the Eastern Amazon from SPOT 4 through spectral mixture models	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						mixture models; forest degradation; Amazon; nonphotosynthetic vegetation; selective logging; fire	TROPICAL FORESTS; BRAZILIAN-AMAZON; FIRE; CLASSIFICATION; IMAGES	In this paper, we present a methodology to map classes of degraded forest in the Eastern Amazon. Forest degradation field data, available in the literature, and I-m resolution IKONOS image were linked with fraction images (vegetation, nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), soil and shade) derived from spectral mixture models applied to a Satellite Pour L'observation de la Terre (SPOT) 4 multispectral image. The forest degradation map was produced in two steps. First, we investigated the relationship between ground (i.e., field and IKONOS data) and satellite scales by analyzing statistics and performing visual analyses of the field classes in terms of fraction values. This procedure allowed us to define four classes of forest at the SPOT 4 image scale, which included: intact forest; logged forest (recent and older logged forests in the field); degraded forest (heavily burned, heavily logged and burned forests in the field); and regeneration (old heavily logged and old heavily burned forest in the field). Next, we used a decision tree classifier (DTC) to define a set of rules to separate the forest classes using the fraction images. We classified 35% of the forest area (2097.3 km(2)) as intact forest. Logged forest accounted for 56% of the forest area and 9% of the forest area was classified as degraded forest. The resultant forest degradation map showed good agreement (86% overall accuracy) with areas of degraded forest visually interpreted from two IKONOS images. In addition, high correlation (R-2 = 0.97) was observed between the total live aboveground biomass of degraded forest classes (defined at the field scale) and the NPV fraction image. The NPV fraction also improved our ability to mapping of old selectively logged forests. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Inc.

J	Li, DC; Chen, LS; Lin, YS				Li, DC; Chen, LS; Lin, YS			Using Functional Virtual Population as assistance to learn scheduling knowledge in dynamic manufacturing environments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORK; DECISION TREE; ACQUISITION; SYSTEM	When a scheduling environment is static and system attributes are deterministic, a manufacturing schedule can be obtained by applying analytical tools such as mathematical modelling technology, dynamic programming, the branch- and-bound method or other developed searching algorithms. Unfortunately, a scheduling environment is usually dynamic in a real manufacturing world. A production system may vary with time and require production managers to change schedule repeatedly. Therefore, the main aim here was to find a scheduling method that could reduce the need for rescheduling. An approach called Functional Virtual Population was proposed as assistance to learn robust scheduling knowledge for manufacturing systems under rationally changing environments. The used techniques include machine learning with artificial neural networks and IF-THEN scheduling rules. To illustrate the study in detail, a simulated flexible manufacturing system consisting of four machines, four parts, one automatic guided vehicle and eight buffers was built as the foundation for learning the concept. Also, Pythia software (a back-propagation-based neural networks) was employed as the learning tool in the learning procedure.

Classification and regression tree (C&RT) analysis is a nonparametric decision tree methodology that has the ability to efficiently segment populations into meaningful subgroups. However it is not commonly used in public health. Purpose: This study provides a methodological overview of C&RT analysis for persons unfamiliar with the procedure. Methods and Results: An example of a C&RT analysis is provided and interpretation of results is discussed. Results are validated with those obtained from a logistic regression model that was created to replicate the C&RT findings. Results obtained from the example C&RT analysis are also compared to those obtained from a common approach to logistic regression, the stepwise selection procedure. Issues to consider when deciding whether to use C&RT are discussed, and situations in which C&RT may and may not be beneficial are described. Conclusions: C&RT is a promising research tool for the identification of at-risk populations in public health research and outreach.

J	Abe, K; Kosuda, S; Kusano, S				Abe, K; Kosuda, S; Kusano, S			Medical economics of whole-body FDG PET in patients suspected of having non-small cell lung carcinoma - Reassessment based on the revised Japanese national insurance reimbursement system	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						cost-benefit; F-18-FDG; lung cancer; staging	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; TREE SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; BONE METASTASES; CANCER; MANAGEMENT	Focusing on the savings expected from the revised Japanese national insurance reimbursement system in the management of patients suspected of having non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), cost-effectiveness was assessed using decision tree sensitivity analysis on the basis of the 2 competing strategies of whole-body FDG PET (WB-PET) and conventional imaging (CI). Methods: A WB-PET strategy that models dependence upon chest FDG PET scan, WB-PET scan, and brain MR imaging with contrast was designed. The cost of a FDG PET examination was updated and determined to be US$625.00. The CI strategy involves a combination of conventional examinations, such as abdominal CT with contrast, brain MR imaging with contrast, and a whole-body bone scan. A simulation of 1,000 patients suspected of having NSCLC (Stages I to IV) was created for each strategy using a decision tree and baselines of other relevant variables cited from published data. Results: By using the WB-PET strategy in place of the CI strategy for the management of patients suspected of having NSCLC in hospitals with an NSCLC prevalence of 75%, the cost saving (CS) for each patient would be US$697.69 for an M1 prevalence of 20% and US$683.52 for an M1 prevalence of 40%, but the CS gradually decreases as the NSCLC prevalence increases. The break-even point requires less than an 80% prevalence in order for the WB-PET strategy to gain life expectancy (LE) per patient. By using the WB-PET strategy in place of the Cl strategy for the management of patients suspected of having NSCLC in hospitals with an NSCLC prevalence of 75%, the gain in LE for each patient would be 0.04 years (11.06 vs. 11.02 years) for an M1 prevalence of 20% and 0.10 years (10.13 vs. 10.03 years) for an M1 prevalence of 40%. The maximum cost of a PET study without losing LE would be US$1322.68 per patient for prevalences of 75% NSCLC and 20% M1 disease. Conclusions: The present study quantitatively showed WB-PET, employed in place of CI for managing NSCLC patients, to be cost-effective in the Japanese revised insurance reimbursement system. However, the present cost is very low from the industrial viewpoint.

The N- hypercube is different from the classical hypercube used in communication theory, and in Boolean algebra. This new structure has been created based on a novel algorithm for embedding a binary decision tree and binary decision diagram into a N- hypercube. It is shown that N- hypercube topology is a reasonable solution to implement NN of threshold gates, in particular, on the single- electron devices. The 3D design methodology of feedforward NN is oriented to technology mapping to nanodevices. Results of extensive experimental study of feedforward networks consisting of over 3500 N- hypercubes are presented.

J	Kim, YS; Sohn, SY; Yoon, CN				Kim, YS; Sohn, SY; Yoon, CN			Screening test data analysis for liver disease prediction model using growth curve	BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY			English	Article						screening test; liver disease; growth curve; logistic regression; decision tree; neural network	CANCER	This study was done based on screening test data accumulated from 1994 to 2001 for studying of risk factor related with liver disease and prediction model of liver disease. In the existing study related with liver, the main current is studying on liver cancer, not on liver disease, previous step into liver cancer. As a result of estimating prediction model through the risk factors of liver disease and the growth curve on the basis of data, it is shown that most of the risk factors about liver disease are also those about known well as liver cancer. In addition, to investigate liver disease prevalence from the viewpoint of the future, this study presumed risk factor through the various growth curve analysis and examined logistic regression, decision tree and neural network from those estimators. In the case of neural network using growth curve estimator of X(t(5)) = alpha(i) + beta(i)T + epsilon(iT), accuracy of liver disease was 72.55% and sensitivity was 78.62%. On the other hand, in the case of liver disease prediction model using recent screening test data estimator, accuracy was 72.09% and sensitivity was 71.72%. Those are lower than liver disease prediction model of growth curve analysis. In the various liver disease prediction models assumed by growth curve and many distinction models. when growth curve estimator was used, sensitivity value was improved.

We developed and tested a web-based decision support tool to aid investigators in matching patients to open clinical trials for children with rhabdomyosarcoma in the context of an international cooperative cancer clinical trials network. A decision tree for trial eligibility based on eight clinical variables representing major disease characteristics was translated into a web-based format. In a blinded fashion, we assessed the accuracy of the tool in assigning 100 randomly selected cases to the proper clinical trial. The web-based tool assigned patients to the proper clinical trial in all 100 randomly selected cases. The time needed to enter data and receive results using this tool is about 1 minute per patient entered. It is feasible to develop a web-based tool to help investigators in matching patients to clinical trials. When such decisions are complex and nonintuitive, such tools have the potential to improve the accuracy of clinical trial assignment and save time. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Sorensen, K; Janssens, GK				Sorensen, K; Janssens, GK			Data mining with genetic algorithms on binary trees	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th EURO Summer-Winter-Institute on Meta-Heuristics in Combinatorial Optimization (ESWI XVIII)	2000	SWITZERLAND	Summer Winter Inst		genetic algorithms; data mining; binary trees		This paper focuses on the automatic interaction detection (AID)-technique, which belongs to the class of decision tree data mining techniques. The AID-technique explains the variance of a dependent variable through an exhaustive and repeated search of all possible relations between the (binary) predictor variables and the dependent variable. This search results in a tree in which non-terminal nodes represent the binary predictor variables, edges represent the possible values of these predictor variables and terminal nodes or leafs correspond to classes of subjects. Despite of being self-evident, the AID-technique has its weaknesses. To overcome these drawbacks a technique is developed that uses a genetic algorithm to find a set of diverse classification trees, all having a large explanatory power. From this set of trees, the data analyst is able to choose the tree that fulfils his requirements and does not suffer from the weaknesses of the AID-technique. The technique developed in this paper uses some specialised genetic operators that are devised to preserve the structure of the trees and to preserve high fitness from being destroyed. An implementation of the algorithm exists and is freely available. Some experiments were performed which show that the algorithm uses an intensification stage to find high-fitness trees. After that, a diversification stage recombines high-fitness building blocks to find a set of diverse solutions. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, a time-frequency domain analysis of the nocturnal heart rate variability (HRV) was evaluated as the single diagnostic marker for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). The predictive accuracy of time-frequency HRV variables (wavelet (Wv) decomposition parameters from level 2 (Wv2) to level 256 (Wv256)) obtained from nocturnal electrocardiogram Holter monitoring were analysed in 147 consecutive patients aged 53.8+/-11.2 yrs referred for possible OSAS. OSAS was diagnosed in 66 patients (44.9%) according to an apnoea/hypopnoea index greater than or equal to10. Using receiver-operating characteristic curves analysis, the most powerful predictor variable was Wv32 (W 0.758, p<0.0001), followed by Wv16 (W 0.729, p<0.0001) and Wv64 (W 0.700, p<0.0001). Classification and Regression Trees methodology generated a decision tree for OSAS prediction including all levels of Wv coefficients, from Wv2 to Wv256 with a sensitivity reaching 92.4% and a specificity of 90.1% (percentage of agreement 91.2%) with this nonparametric analysis.

These products may take the form of dietary supplements or of foods. The health benefits are given by particular ingredients, and in many cases these are derived from botanicals. The variety of plants providing these functions is large, ranging from staple food sources such as cereals, fruits and vegetables, to herbals as used in traditional medicine. The food or ingredient conferring health properties may consist of the plants themselves, extracts thereof, or more purified components. The scientific literature is abundant with articles not only on the beneficial properties, but also on possible adverse health effects of plants and their components. The present report discusses the data required to determine the safe use of these types of ingredients, and provides advice on the development of risk assessment strategies consistent with due diligence under existing food regulations. Product specifications, composition and characterisation of standardised and authentic materials, documented history of use and comparison to existing products (taking into account the effect of industrial processing), description of the intended use and consequent exposure are highlighted as key background information on which to base a risk evaluation. The extent of experimental investigation required, such as in vitro, animal, and/or human studies, depends on the adequacy of this information. A decision tree is presented as an aid to determine the extent of data requirements based on product comparison. The ultimate safety in use depends on the establishment of an adequate safety margin between expected exposure and identified potential hazards. Health hazards may arise from inherent toxicities or contaminants of the plant materials, including the mechanism of the intended beneficial effect. A lower safety margin may therefore be expected than for food ingredients or additives where no physiological effects are intended. In rare cases, post launch monitoring programmes may be envisaged to confirm expected exposures and adequacy of the safety margin. This guidance document was elaborated by an expert group of the Natural Toxin Task Force of the European Branch of the International Life Sciences Institute-ILSI Europe and discussed with a wider audience of scientists at a workshop held on 13-15 May 2002 in Marseille, France.

Plant species composition was recorded from a total of 9514 fixed plots located in a stratified, random sample of 501 1 km squares across Britain. Changes in plant species composition along a gradient of substrate fertility were inferred from statistical tests of change in mean Ellenberg fertility value calculated for each fixed plot. Plots were grouped by eight vegetation types, five landscape features (hedges, road verges, watercourse banks, small biotopes, larger units in fields and unenclosed land) and six environmental zones. Tests of change in mean Ellenberg value were carried out on all combinations of these strata. Decision tree modelling was used to identify groups of test outcomes sharing the same direction of change and where each group was defined by a minimum number of strata. Post hoc power analysis was used to select statistically non-significant test outcomes that could be used to infer stability in the sampled sub-population. Out of a total of 142 tests of change in fertility value, 67% were increases, 8% were reductions and 25% indicated stability. The best overall predictor of increases in fertility value, and therefore of shifts in favour of plants suited to higher substrate fertility, was vegetation type. Irrespective of landscape feature and environmental zone, increased means were associated with infertile grasslands, moorland, upland woodlands and heath/bog. Already highly fertile grasslands and woodland assemblages in lowland Britain remained largely stable. The small number of decreasing test outcomes were associated with arable land in Scotland, Wales and western England. These patterns of change are hypothesized to reflect pervasive land-use drivers combined with the inherent responsiveness of the vegetation.

J	Zhou, C; Xiao, WM; Tirpak, TM; Nelson, PC				Zhou, C; Xiao, WM; Tirpak, TM; Nelson, PC			Evolving accurate and compact classification rules with gene expression programming	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION			English	Article						classification rule; data mining; gene expression programming (GEP); genetic algorithms (GAs) .	INDUCTION	Classification is one of the fundamental tasks of data mining. Most rule induction and decision tree algorithms perform local, greedy search to generate classification rules that are often more complex than necessary. Evolutionary algorithms for pattern classification have recently received increased attention because they can perform global searches. In this paper, we propose a new approach for discovering classification rules by using gene expression programming (GEP), a new technique of genetic programming (GP) with linear representation. The antecedent of discovered rules may involve many different combinations of attributes. To guide the search process, we suggest a fitness function considering both the rule consistency gain and completeness. A multiclass classification problem is formulated as multiple two-class problems by using the one-against-all learning method. The covering strategy is applied to learn multiple rules if applicable for each class. Compact rule sets are subsequently evolved using a two-phase pruning method based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle and the integration theory. Our approach is also noise tolerant and able to deal with both numeric and nominal attributes. Experiments with several benchmark data sets have shown up to 20% improvement in validation accuracy, compared with C4.5 algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed GEP approach is more efficient and tends to generate shorter solutions compared with canonical tree-based GP classifiers.

J	Fu, ZW; Golden, BL; Lele, S; Raghavan, S; Wasil, EA				Fu, ZW; Golden, BL; Lele, S; Raghavan, S; Wasil, EA			A genetic algorithm-based approach for building accurate decision trees	INFORMS JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			English	Article						genetic algorithm; decision tree		In dealing with a very large data set, it might be impractical to construct a decision tree using ail of the points. Even when it is possible, this might not be the best way to utilize the data. As an alternative, subsets of the original data set can be extracted, a tree can be constructed on each subset, and then parts of individual trees can be combined in a smart way to produce an improved final set of feasible trees or a final tree. In this paper, we take trees generated by a commercial decision tree package, namely, C4.5, and allow them to crossover and mutate (using a genetic algorithm) for a number of generations in order to yield trees of better quality. We conduct a computational study of our approach using a real-life marketing data set. In this study, we divide the data set into training, scoring, and test sets, and find that our approach produces uniformly high-quality decision trees. In addition, we investigate the impact of scaling and demonstrate that our approach can be used effectively on very large data sets.

J	Qi, F; Zhu, AX				Qi, F; Zhu, AX			Knowledge discovery from soil maps using inductive learning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article							FOREST ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES; LEAF-AREA INDEX; WATERSHED SCALE; EXTRACTION; NETWORKS; MODEL	This paper develops a knowledge discovery procedure for extracting knowledge of soil-landscape models from a soil map. It has broad relevance to knowledge discovery from other natural resource maps. The procedure consists of four major steps: data preparation, data preprocessing, pattern extraction, and knowledge consolidation. In order to recover true expert knowledge from the error-prone soil maps, our study pays specific attention to the reduction of representation noise in soil maps. The data preprocessing step has exhibited an important role in obtaining greater accuracy. A specific method for sampling pixels based on modes of environmental histograms has proven to be effective in terms of reducing noise and constructing representative sample sets. Three inductive learning algorithms, the See5 decision tree algorithm, Naive Bayes, and artificial neural network, are investigated for a comparison concerning learning accuracy and result comprehensibility. See5 proves to be an accurate method and produces the most comprehensible results, which are consistent with the rules (expert knowledge) used in producing the soil map. The incorporation of spatial information into the knowledge discovery process is found not only to improve the accuracy of the extracted knowledge, but also to add to the explicitness and extensiveness of the extracted soil-landscape model.

J	Kim, SJ; Kim, H; Lee, KB				Kim, SJ; Kim, H; Lee, KB			On tree-based classifications with multi-response variables	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING-THEORY APPLICATIONS AND PRACTICE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th Annual International Conference on Industrial Engineering	OCT 24-26, 2002	PUSAN, SOUTH KOREA			data mining; classification; decision tree; multi-response variables; node splitting criteria		Data mining has recently received much attention in a wide range of business and engineering fields. Classification is one of the most important topics in data mining. Tree-based approach, for example decision tree, is a very useful technique for finding classification models. Most researches on decision trees have been conducted for the case of single response variable. However, situations where multi-response variables should be considered arise from many areas such as process monitoring, marketing science, and clinical analysis. This paper is concerned with tree-based classification methods when there are two or more response variables in the data set. We first give an overview of tree-based approaches and then provide three kinds of node splitting methods for the case in which multi-response variables are of concern. An illustrative example of tree-based classifications is also given with discussion. Significance: In developing classification tree models, how to deal with multiple response variables is an important issue. The node splitting schemes presented herein are applicable to such situations. Our comparison and discussion can be a useful guideline for practitioners.

J	Prakash, C				Prakash, C			Crucial factors that influence cost-effectiveness of universal hepatitis B immunization in India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT IN HEALTH CARE			English	Article						hepatitis B; universal immunization; cost-effectiveness; DALY	VACCINATION STRATEGIES; PERINATAL TRANSMISSION; UNITED-STATES; VIRUS; PREVENTION	This study examines the parameters crucial to cost-effectiveness of universal hepatitis B immunization in India. An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was done using a decision tree (Markov model) to follow up a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 newborns for the effects of hepatitis B acquired vertically at birth. The measure of effectiveness was disability-adjusted life-years gained. Uncertainty analysis and Scenario analysis were done using Latin hypercube sampling. Hepatitis B endemicity is the most important factor, followed by the cost of vaccine. Other factors of some influence are vaccination coverage, vaccine efficacy, HBeAg positivity, and vaccine wastage.

J	Meyer, O				Meyer, O			Evaluating inflammatory joint disease: how and when can autoantibodies help?	JOINT BONE SPINE			English	Article						inflammatory joint disease; rheumatoid factors; anticitrullinated protein antibodies; antinuclear antibodies; antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies	CONNECTIVE-TISSUE DISEASES; EARLY RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; SYSTEMIC-LUPUS-ERYTHEMATOSUS; CYCLIC CITRULLINATED PEPTIDE; LINKED-IMMUNOSORBENT-ASSAY; HUMAN EPIDERMIS FILAGGRIN; EVIDENCE-BASED GUIDELINES; 5-YEAR FOLLOW-UP; ANTIBODY C-ANCA; ANTIPERINUCLEAR FACTOR	The diagnosis of inflammatory joint disease rests on a constellation of symptoms, signs, laboratory test results and, occasionally, histological findings. Classification criteria have been developed by national learned societies, international panels of experts or, more rarely, an expert working alone. These criteria are intended to provide a common language for therapeutic trials and international publications. Yet, they are often inappropriately used as diagnostic tools for the individual patient. Identification of an early serommumologic marker with high sensitivity and specificity for classifying patients with recent-onset joint disease is a daunting challenge. Test performance characteristics such as sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and the positive or negative likelihood ratio help to assess the diagnostic usefulness of a laboratory test in a specific situation. The difference between the pretest and posttest likelihoods of obtaining a positive or negative result measures the usefulness, or performance, of a laboratory test in a specific situation according to the prevalence of the disease. A higher positive likelihood ratio indicates a more useful test. In a patient with inflammatory joint disease, the diagnosis can be sought by assaying a limited number of autoantibodies according to a decision tree. Thus, IgM rheumatoid factors (latex test or ELISA) and antibodies to filaggrin or other citrullinated proteins (antikeratin antibodies by indirect immunofluorescent assay or anticyclic citrullinated peptides by ELISA) identify more than 70% of cases of early rheumatoid arthritis with greater than 98% specificity. If these markers are negative, testing for antinuclear antibodies by indirect immunofluorescent assay on HEp-2 cells identifies 99% of cases of lupus and progressive systemic sclerosis. Confirmation of the diagnosis can be obtained by characterizing the autoantibodies: thus, presence of antidouble-stranded DNA (dsDNA, by the Farr radioimmunoassay, indirect immunofluorescent assay on Crithidia luciliae, or ELISA (IgG)) or of antinucleosome antibodies (ELISA) indicates lupus, whereas anticentromere, antitopoisomerase I (Scl 70), and antinucleolar antibodies point to progressive systemic sclerosis. A positive test for antibodies to soluble nuclear antigens of the U1 RNP type suggests mixed connective tissue disease or lupus but may indicate scleroderma. Anti-Sm antibodies are found in fewer than 10% of lupus patients but are highly specific. Anti-SSA (Ro) and anti-SSB (La) suggest lupus or primary Sjogren's syndrome. When tests are negative for ANA, several antibodies to cytoplasmic organelles are valuable diagnostic tools, such as anti-J01 for polymyositis syndromes and antiribosome antibodies for lupus, although their sensitivity is modest (20-25%). Finally antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) ensure the diagnosis of small-vessel vasculitides, which often involve the lungs and kidneys. Thus, in diffuse Wegener's granulomatosis, ANCAs exhibiting the classic cytoplasmic pattern and corresponding by ELISA to anti-PR3 are found. In microscopic polyangiitis the ANCAs are peripheral and correspond by ELISA to antinnyeloperoxidase antibodies. Tests for other antibodies are less often needed to evaluate inflammatory joint disease. (C) 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

Doesn't this violate "Occam's razor"-the widespread belief that "the simpler of competing alternatives is preferred"? We argue no: if complexity is measured by function rather than form-for example, according to generalized degrees of freedom (GDF)-the razor's role is restored. On a two-dimensional decision tree problem, bagging several trees is shown to actually have less GDF complexity than a single component tree, removing the generalization paradox of ensembles.

J	Domingos, P; Hulten, G				Domingos, P; Hulten, G			A general framework for mining massive data streams	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Statistical Analysis of Massive Data Streams	DEC 13-14, 2002	WASHINGTON, D.C.			data mining; Hoeffding bounds; machine learning; scalability; subsampling		In many domains, data now arrive faster than we are able to mine it. To avoid wasting these data, we must switch from the traditional "one-shot" data mining approach to systems that are able to mine continuous, high-volume, open-ended data streams as they arrive. In this article we identify some desiderata for such systems, and outline our framework for realizing them. A key property of our approach is that it minimizes the time required to build a model on a stream while guaranteeing (as long as the data are iid) that the model learned is effectively indistinguishable from the one that would be obtained using infinite data. Using this framework, we have successfully adapted several learning algorithms to massive data streams, including decision tree induction, Bayesian network learning, k-means clustering, and the EM algorithm for mixtures of Gaussians. These algorithms are able to process on the order of billions of examples per day using off-the-shelf hardware. Building on this, we are currently developing software primitives for scaling arbitrary learning algorithms to massive data streams with minimal effort.

J	Landrum, GA; Genin, H				Landrum, GA; Genin, H			Application of machine-learning methods to solid-state chemistry: ferromagnetism in transition metal alloys	JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY			English	Article						ferromagnetism; transition metal alloys; disorder; machine learning; data mining; cluster analysis; decision trees; quantitative structure-activity relationships	MATHEMATICAL-THEORY; COMMUNICATION; PREDICTION	Machine-learning methods are a collection of techniques for building predictive models from experimental data. The algorithms are problem-independent: the chemistry and physics of the problem being studied are contained in the descriptors used to represent the known data. The application of a variety of machine-learning methods to the prediction of ferromagnetism in ordered and disordered transition metal alloys is presented. Applying a decision tree algorithm to build a predictive model for ordered phases results in a model that is 100% accurate. The same algorithm achieves 99% accuracy when trained on a data set containing both ordered and disordered phases. Details of the descriptor sets for both applications are also presented.

The 221 different loci (1/16-degree squares) on record reflect an extensive but discontinuous distribution, except in Lesotho and in parts of the Mpumalanga, Gauteng and North West provinces of South Africa. Although recorded from 12 different types of waterbody, it was mostly (42.0%) recovered from swamps. Most samples (45.8%) were collected in habitats with slow-flowing water. A muddy substratum was recorded for 62.5% of the samples. Most samples (86.3%) were collected in habitats with a mean annual air temperature of 10-20 degreesC, and more than 69% came from localities with a mean annual rainfall of 600-900 mm. An integrated decision tree constructed from the data indicated that temperature and types of waterbody play a decisive role in determining the presence of L. truncatula in a given area. A temperature index calculated for all mollusc species ranked L. truncatula second in a total of 53 species according to its association with low temperatures. It remains to be established whether its distribution is indeed discontinuous, and whether its preference for a particular habitat, amphibious habits and ability to aestivate could have resulted in some populations having been overlooked during surveys.

Two recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported that inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) decreased the incidence of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or death in term and near-term newborns with hypoxic respiratory failure. Our objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness ratio of iNO in this population. Methods. We studied 1000 simulation cohorts (n = 483 for each cohort) of term/near-term newborns with hypoxemic respiratory failure. We conducted our study following US Public Health Service Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine guidelines, adopting the US societal perspective. We constructed a decision tree reflecting iNO use, subsequent ECMO use, death, and long-term neurologic and respiratory morbidity in survivors, as determined from the combined outcomes of the 2 RCTs ( n = 483). We estimated costs on the basis of length-of-stay data for the initial episode of care from 1 of the RCTs, unit costs from administrative data sets, and current pricing for iNO. We ran a Monte Carlo simulation to generate estimates of differences in costs and effects at 1 year, along with the stochastic uncertainty around these estimates. We expressed effects as quality-adjusted survival, assuming quality of life = 1 with no comorbidity, 0.7 with 1 comorbidity, and 0.49 ( 0.7 x 0.7) with 2 comorbidities. We constructed a base case, in which iNO was initiated at tertiary care ECMO centers ( mimicking the RCTs) and a Public Health Service Panel on Cost-effectiveness in Health and Medicine reference case, in which iNO was initiated at the local hospital before transfer ( mimicking real-world practice). We exposed our assumptions to a sensitivity analysis. Results. Direct application of the trial results ( base case) suggested that iNO was both more effective and cheaper ( cost savings of $ 1880 per case despite acquisition costs of $ 5150, predominantly as a result of decreased need for ECMO), with 84.6% probability that the cost-effectiveness ratio was better than $ 100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Under the reference case, iNO was also more effective ( though slightly less so) and was even cheaper ( cost savings of $ 4400 per case), with 71.6% probability that iNO was cheaper and more effective and 91.6% probability that the cost effectiveness ratio was better than $ 100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Sensitivity analyses showed these estimates to be sensitive to patient selection and the price of iNO but insensitive to assumptions regarding quality of life. Conclusions. From a US societal perspective, iNO has a favorable cost-effectiveness profile when initiated either at ECMO centers or at local hospitals in term/nearterm neonates with hypoxemic respiratory failure.

J	Lee, WP; Lu, CC				Lee, Wei-Po; Lu, Cheng-Che			Customising WAP-based information services on mobile networks	PERSONAL AND UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING			English	Article						Customisation; Machine learning; Mobile information services; Software agents; WAP devices		In addition to voice transmission over mobile networks, the demand of data communication has been increasing. To deploy data-oriented applications for mobile terminals, the wireless application protocol (WAP) has provided a promising solution. However, as in the World Wide Web (WWW), the increasing information leads to the problem of information overload. One way to overcome such a problem is to build intelligent recommender systems to provide customised information services. By analyzing the information collected from the user, a customised recommender system is able to reason his personal preferences and to build a model of predictions. In this way, only the information predicted as user-interested can reach the end user. This paper presents a multi-agent framework in which a decision tree-based approach is employed to learn a user's preferences. To assess the proposed framework, a mobile phone simulator is used to represent a mobile environment and a series of experiments are conducted. The experimental studies have concentrated on how to recommend appropriate information to the individual user, and on how the system can adapt to a user's most recent preferences. The results and analysis show that based on our framework the WAP-based customised information services can be successfully performed.

J	Schneider, A; Friedl, MA; Mciver, DK; Woodcock, CE				Schneider, A; Friedl, MA; Mciver, DK; Woodcock, CE			Mapping urban areas by fusing multiple sources of coarse resolution remotely sensed data	PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; DECISION-TREE CLASSIFICATION; THEMATIC MAP ACCURACY; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; SATELLITE DATA; CITY LIGHTS; DATA SET; ALGORITHM; MODIS	In recent decades, rapid rates of population growth and urban expansion have led to widespread conversion of natural ecosystems and agricultural lands to urban land cover. The amount and rate of this land conversion affects local and regional ecosystems, climate, biogeochemistry, as well as food production. The main objective of the research described in this paper is to improve understanding of the methodological and validation requirements for mapping urban land cover over large areas from coarse resolution remotely sensed data. A technique called boosting is used to improve supervised classification accuracy and provides a means to integrate MODIS data with the DMSP nighttime lights data set and gridded population data. Results for North America indicate that fusion of these three data types improves urban classification results by resolving confusion between urban and other classes that occurs when any one of the data sets is used by itself. Traditional measures of accuracy assessment as well as new, maplet-based methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology for creating maps of cities at continental scales.

For successful treatment including surgery, early detection is essential. Currently there is no screening method such as biomarker assays for early diagnosis of RCC. Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF) is a recent technical advance that can be used to identify biomarkers for cancers. In this study, we investigated whether SELDI protein profiling and artificial intelligence analysis of serum could distinguish RCC from healthy persons and other urologic diseases (nonRCC). The SELDI-TOF data was acquired from a total of 36 serum samples with weak cation exchange-2 protein chip arrays and filtered using ProteinChip software. We used a decision tree algorithm c4.5 to classify the three groups of sera. Five proteins were identified with masses of 3900, 4107, 4153, 5352, and 5987 Da. These biomarkers can correctly separate RCC from healthy and nonRCC samples.

CD3 is robust against drift in the underlying rules over time (concept drift): it both detects drift and protects the induction process from its effects. Specifically, the task is to data mine customer details and call records to determine whether the profile of customers registering for a 'friends and family' service is changing over time and to maintain a rule set profiling such customers. CD3 and the rationale behind it are described and experimental results on customer data are presented.

The objective of this study was to determine if the commercially available classification algorithm biomarker patterns software (BPS), which is based on a classification and regression tree (CART), would be effective in discriminating ovarian cancer from benign diseases and healthy controls. Serum protein mass spectrum profiles from 139 patients with either ovarian cancer, benign pelvic diseases, or healthy women were analyzed using the BPS software. A decision tree, using five protein peaks, resulted in an accuracy of 81.5% in the cross-validation analysis and 80% in a blinded set of samples in differentiating the ovarian cancer from the control groups. The potential, advantages, and drawbacks of the BPS system as a bioinformatic tool for the analysis of the SELDI high-dimensional proteomic data are discussed.

Spectroscopic analysis requires significantly more sophistication than has been employed in conventional broadband remote sensing analysis. We describe a new system that is effective at material identification and mapping: a set of algorithms within an expert system decision-making framework that we call Tetracorder. The expertise in the system has been derived from scientific knowledge of spectral identification. The expert system rules are implemented in a decision tree where multiple algorithms are applied to spectral analysis, additional expert rules and algorithms can be applied based on initial results, and more decisions are made until spectral analysis is complete. Because certain spectral features are indicative of specific chemical bonds in materials, the system can accurately identify and map those materials. In this paper we describe the framework of the decision making process used for spectral identification, describe specific spectral feature analysis algorithms, and give examples of what analyses and types of maps are possible with imaging spectroscopy data. We also present the expert system rules that describe which diagnostic spectral features are used in the decision making process for a set of spectra of minerals and other common materials. We demonstrate the applications of Tetracorder to identify and map surface minerals, to detect sources of acid rock drainage, and to map vegetation species, ice, melting snow, water, and water pollution, all with one set of expert system rules. Mineral mapping can aid in geologic mapping and fault detection and can provide a better understanding of weathering, mineralization, hydrothermal alteration, and other geologic processes. Environmental site assessment, such as mapping source areas of acid mine drainage, has resulted in the acceleration of site cleanup, saving millions of dollars and years in cleanup time. Imaging spectroscopy data and Tetracorder analysis can be used to study both terrestrial and planetary science problems. Imaging spectroscopy can be used to probe planetary systems, including their atmospheres, oceans, and land surfaces.

J	Zhang, SW; Pan, Q; Zhang, HC; Zhang, YL; Wang, HY				Zhang, SW; Pan, Q; Zhang, HC; Zhang, YL; Wang, HY			Classification of protein quaternary structure with support vector machine	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							PREDICTION; DATABASE	Motivation: Since the gap between sharply increasing known sequences and slow accumulation of known structures is becoming large, an automatic classification process based on the primary sequences and known three-dimensional structure becomes indispensable. The classification of protein quaternary structure based on the primary sequences can provide some useful information for the biologists. So a fully automatic and reliable classification system is needed. This work tries to look for the effective methods of extracting attribute and the algorithm for classifying the quaternary structure from the primary sequences. Results: Both of the support vector machine (SVM) and the covariant discriminant algorithms have been first introduced to predict quaternary structure properties from the protein primary sequences. The amino acid composition and the auto-correlation functions based on the amino acid index profile of the primary sequence have been taken into account in the algorithms. We have analyzed 472 amino acid indices and selected the four amino acid indices as the examples, which have the best performance. Thus the five attribute parameter data sets (COMP, FASG, NISK, WOLS and KYTJ) were established from the protein primary sequences. The COMP attribute data set is composed of amino acid composition, and the FASG, NISK, WOLS and KYTJ attribute data sets are composed of the amino acid composition and the auto-correlation functions of the corresponding amino acid residue index. The overall accuracies of SVM are 78.5, 87.5, 83.2, 81.7 and 81.9%, respectively, for COMP, FASG, NISK, WOLS and KYTJ data sets in jackknife test, which are 19.6, 7.8, 15.5, 13.1 and 15.8%, respectively, higher than that of the covariant discriminant algorithm in the same test. The results show that SVM may be applied to discriminate between the primary sequences of homodimers and non-homodimers and the two protein sequence descriptors can reflect the quaternary structure information. Compared with previous Robert Garian's investigation, the performance of SVM is almost equal to that of the Decision tree models, and the methods of extracting feature vector from the primary sequences are superior to Robert's binning function method.

In this article, a decision tree is described in which the ability of the data to match simple models of quantal transmission is rigorously compared with its ability to fit progressively more complex models. The Wilks statistic is the basis for this comparison. The procedure commences with optimal transformation of peak amplitude measurements into a probability density function (PDF). It then examines this PDF against various models of transmission, commencing with a multi-modal but non-quantal distribution, then to a multi-modal distribution with quantal peak separation with and without quantal variability, and, finally, the constraints of uniform and non-uniform release probabilities are imposed. These procedures are illustrated by example. A comparison is made between the relative sensitivities of the Wilks statistic and the chi(2) goodness-of-fit criteria in rejecting inappropriate models at all stages in these procedures.

The presence of disjoint areas for each class creates special problems for techniques that cannot partition each class into more than one region. Among the various techniques that have been applied with some success to multi-modal problems are decision tree classifiers (DTCs) and back propagation neural networks. DTCs use a recursive partitioning algorithm to partition the feature space into disjoint areas. In principle, DTCs should perform well on multi-modal data sets because they have the ability to partition each class into disjoint areas. In practice, however, DTCs can have significant difficulty with such data sets. In the presence of multimodality decision trees can became very bushy leading to high error rates. We show that clustering of the data before classification can lead to simpler trees and lower error rates.

This paper proposes a novel predictive method named TWDP (Ticket data Warehouse and Decision-tree Prediction), which provides an effective means to build strategic models in CRTTS and enhances the predictive ability of interactive and hierarchical analysis. The Key components of TWDP are an efficient data warehouse model named TW (Ticket data Warehouse) and a decision tree predictive algorithm named DP (Decision-tree Prediction). In TW a new structure named Interface Tree is presented Interface Tree perfectly breaches the limitation about arbitrariness of multi-level requirements. The scalable and dynamical data structure of DP breaks through restriction of memory-resident and is fit to process huge data set. Applications to maximize transport capacity and control passenger flow density, suggest that TWDP is a contributive and powerful tool for the train ticket analysis.

In other words, product is the core business process of traditional marketing, while customer is the core business process of CRM. The former concerns which product is the best sales while the latter does which customer is faithful. In order to digest the individual customer, we should set up customer's perfect database which contains date of interaction with each customer, such as primary information, transaction, service, activities and the like. To evaluate the performance, we should forecast customer's buying preference; to trace the trailing, we should use Bob Stone's (1996) R-F-M criteria (recency, frequency, monetary amount) through database. The research collects and analyzes references on promoting buying rate; moreover, it introduces R-F-M criteria, brings up the idea of identify each individual customer to promote both the marketing profit and the customer's lifetime value. The result shows that marketing performance derive from gini-weighted RFM model has the advantage over traditional RFM model by 24.80%.

It is designed to find out the best (from the point of view of separation of different classes) divisions of continuous features or the best combinations of symbolic values of discrete features. It has been tested on several datasets to construct classification decision trees and decision rules. It can also be useful in continuous features discretization and estimation of feature's importance, which forms a first step of neural algorithms for extraction of logical rules from data.

The data is obtained from a wristwatch-type sensor, called "LifeMinder"(R). This sensor measures 2-axis acceleration, the pulse rate, the galvanic skin response (GSR), and the skin temperature. The purpose of the study is to enable recognition of general actions such as "walking" or "having a meal" in real-time using the sensor data. Recognition of such actions is useful for healthcare management services and medical treatment support. To enable recognition of actions, we extracted features from the sensor data and constructed a decision tree using the features. We achieved recognition accuracies of over 96% for the actions by the appropriate feature extraction.

The method can not only obtain data that contains the rich information. of practical situation by distribution-oriented sampling and educes the distributed model of relative error rate with maximum entropy theory; but realize the verifying and matching among multi-system data through a verifiable match algorithm and verify the wrong data in system transmission, at the same time it can assess effect of speed, weather and car type on relative error rate through statistical test on decision-tree classified samples. The results of experiment and the actual application indicate that the relative error rate of the devices has nothing with speed, weather and car type, and prove theoretically the reliability and uniformity of them, moreover this method can be further applied in data analysis process of other testing devices.

We propose an efficient Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based phonetic decision tree construction within the VBEC framework. The proposed method features a novel approach to reduce the unrealistically large number of computations needed for iterative calculations in the GMM-based decision tree method to a practical level by assuming that each Gaussian per state has the same occupancy and is represented by the same posterior distribution for the covariance parameter. The experimental results confirmed that VBEC automatically provided a optimum model topology with the highest performance level.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is an important risk factor for preterm birth. BV is detected in 10-30% of pregnant women and is often asymptomatic. Treatment of BV during pregnancy seems to reduce the risk of preterm delivery among high-risk women. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of screening and treatment for BV in early pregnancy among asymptomatic women at low risk for preterm delivery. Methods. A decision tree was built with two arms. For the screening (and treatment) arm the probabilities were derived from our earlier randomized trial on screening and treatment for BV, consisting of BV-positive women treated with intravaginal clindamycin cream or placebo and also of BV-negative pregnant women. The probabilities of outcomes among these women were collected from antenatal clinic records and hospital records, and for the no-screening arm mainly from the Finnish Perinatal Statistics. The outcomes considered were preterm delivery, mode of delivery, peripartum infections and postpartum complications. The unit costs associated with these outcomes were mainly based on disease-related groups (DRGs). No-screening was compared with two screening programs (one with clindamycin, the other with metronidazole treatment) and subjected to sensitivity analyses. Results. There was no significant difference between screening and no-screening strategies in the costs and in the rate of preterm deliveries but the screening strategy produced significantly fewer peripartum infections and postpartum complications. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the screening strategy may become cost-saving if the rate of preterm deliveries exceeds 3%. Conclusion. Screening and treatment for BV in early pregnancy may not reduce costs compared to no-screening in a population at low risk for preterm birth but would produce, at the same cost, more health benefits in terms of fewer peripartum infections and postpartum complications. However, it may be cost-saving if the rate of preterm deliveries is higher than 3%.

J	Graham, D; Smith, SD				Graham, D; Smith, SD			Estimating the productivity of cyclic construction operations using case-based reasoning	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						cyclic construction operations; case-based reasoning; productivity rates; estimation	DESIGN; SYSTEM	The estimation of productivity rates in cyclic construction processes is a difficult, but essential task in the planning of construction projects. The conventional method-a calculation by intuition-for devising such estimates is often laborious and inaccurate. To overcome these difficulties this paper proposes that Case-Based Reasoning could be employed to provide estimates from historical cases of construction. To this end a model, Case-Based Estimator (CBE) is presented. CBE is a small model, consisting of five input features, one output and a small case base, and it is suggested that the findings within this paper could be applied to any small model of similar characteristics-not only within the construction field. The development and implementation of the model is discussed and an experiment was performed to assess the ability of two retrieval mechanisms (one a simple mathematical formula, the other an adaptation of the ID3 decision tree generating algorithm) to measure similarity. The simple formula was found to be more preferable, both in terms of consistency and development effort. CBE was validated, not only against the performance of past operations (which were not used in the model development), but also against estimates provided by a professional construction planner. The model was found to provide more precise and consistent estimates than the planner, with 90% of the estimates being within a 10% relative error of the observed value.

NIR observations of GRBs early afterglow are of crucial importance for GRBs science, revealing even optical obscured or high redshift events. The core of the pipeline is an algorithm for automatic transient detection, based on a decision tree that is continuously upgraded through a Bavesian estimator (DecOAR). It assigns to every transient candidate different reliability coefficients and delivers an alert when a transient is found above the reliability threshold.

In this paper, GA was used to select a subset of the suitable features at each node in the binary decision tree. The feature subset with maximum fitness is chosen and the patterns are divided into two classes using a linear decision function. In this way, the classifier using the binary decision tree can be constructed automatically, and the final recognizer is implemented by a neural network trained by standard patterns at each node. Experimental results are given to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed scheme.

In this work we study the problem of learning when the distribution that generate the examples changes over time. We present a method for detection of changes in the probability distribution of examples. The idea behind the drift detection method is to control the online error-rate of the algorithm. The training examples are presented in sequence. When a new training example is available, it is classified using the actual model. Statistical theory guarantees that while the distribution is stationary, the error will decrease. When the distribution changes, the error will increase. The method controls the trace of the online error of the algorithm. For the actual context we define a warning level, and a drift level. A new context is declared, if in a sequence of examples, the error increases reaching the warning level at example k(w), and the drift level at example k(d). This is an indication of a change in the distribution of the examples. The algorithm learns a new model using only the examples since k(w). The method was tested with a set of eight artificial datasets and a real world dataset. We used three learning algorithms: a perceptron, a neural network and a decision tree. The experimental results show a good performance detecting drift and with learning the new concept. We also observe that the method is independent of the learning algorithm.

This measure allows us to define a metric on such partions used for constructing decision trees. Experimental results suggest that by replacing the usual splitting criterion used in C4.5 by a metric criterion based on the Goodman-Kruskal coefficient it is possible, in most cases, to obtain smaller decision trees without sacrificing accuracy.

Through statistical analysis of audio-visual features on compressed domain, the proposed method achieves subjectively accurate shot classification within the movies into a predefined genre set, as well as scene segmentation based on the shot classification results. By feeding subjectively evaluated feature vectors for each genre into the decision tree classifier, each shot is classified at very low computational cost. Then a sequence of shots belonging to the same genre is determined as a scene. The experimental results show that most of the shots in the movies are classified into subjectively accurate genres, and also that the scene segmentation results are more accurate and robust than the conventional approach.

The first uses features of the ECG signal (R wave, QRS duration, P wave, RR interval, PR interval, PP interval, QRS similarity and P wave similarity), which are fed into a decision-tree like knowledge-based system. The system can classify all types of arrhythmias. The second is based on the utilization of the RR-duration signal only. Initially, rules based on medical knowledge are used for arrhythmic beat classification and the results are fed into a deterministic automato for arrhythmic episode detection and classification. The system can be used for the classification of limited types of arrhythmia due to the fact that only limited information is carried by the RR-duration signal.

However, misclassification error is not the only error in classification problem. Recently, researchers have begun to consider both test and misclassification costs. Previous works assume the test cost and the misclassification cost must be defined on the same cost scale. However, sometimes we may meet difficulty to define the multiple costs on the same cost scale. In this paper, we address the problem by building 4 cost-sensitive decision tree by involving two kinds of cost scales, that minimizes the one kind of cost and control the other in a given specific budget. Our work will be useful for many diagnostic tasks involving target cost minimization and resource consumption for obtaining missing information.

S	Kim, S; Kim, H		Webb, GI; Yu, X		Kim, S; Kim, H			Reliable unseen model prediction for vocabulary-independent speech recognition	AI 2004: ADVANCES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th Annual Australian Conference on Artificial Intelligence	DEC 04-06, 2004	Cairns, AUSTRALIA		Cent Queensland Univ			Speech recognition technique is expected to make a great impact on many user interface areas such as toys, mobile phones, PDAs, and home appliances. Those applications basically require robust speech recognition immune to environment and channel noises, but the dialogue pattern used in the interaction with the devices may be relatively simple, that is, an isolated-word type. The drawback of small-vocabulary isolated-word recognizer which is generally used in the applications is that, if target vocabulary needs to be changed, acoustic models should be re-trained for high performance. However, if a phone model-based speech recognition is used with reliable unseen model prediction, we do not need to re-train acoustic models in getting higher performance. In this paper, we propose a few reliable methods for unseen model prediction in flexible vocabulary speech recognition. The first method gives optimal threshold values for stop criteria in decision tree growing, and the second uses an additional condition in the question selection in order to overcome the overbalancing phenomenon in the conventional method. The last proposes twostage decision trees which in the first stage get more properly trained models and in the second stage build more reliable unseen models. Various vocabulary-independent situations were examined in order to clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed methods. In the experiments, the average word error rates of the proposed methods were reduced by 32.8%, 41.4%, and 44.1% compared to the conventional method, respectively. From the results, we can conclude that the proposed methods are very effective in the unseen model prediction for vocabulary-independent speech recognition.

In particular, a user-friendly interface to enable a general practitioner to decide a diagnosis with the minimum number of questions asked is proposed. Specifically, we propose a technique to improve the usefulness of a decision tree approach in terms of general rather than specific questions. Additionally, we describe a new technique to minimise the number of questions presented to the user in the query process for training the CBR system. Importantly we apply FCA technique to enable the consultant dermatologist to validate new knowledge and supervised the incremental learning of the CBR system.

The performance of these two hybrid classification schemes have been empirically tested and compared with C4.5 decision tree using two US data sets (raw data set and new data set incorporated with domain knowledge) simultaneously to predict US bank failure. Significant improvements in prediction accuracy and training efficiency have been achieved in the schemes based on new data set. The empirical test results suggest that the proposed hybrid schemes perform marginally better in term of AUC criterion.

Question classification received interest recently in the context of question answering systems for which categorizing a given question would be beneficial to allow improved processing of the document to identify an answer. Our approach relies on relative simple preprocessing of the question and uses standard decision tree learning. We also compared our results from decision tree learning with those obtained using Naive Bayes. Both results compare favorably to several very recent studies using more sophisticated preprocessing and/or more sophisticated learning techniques. Furthermore, the fact that decision tree learning proved more successful than Naive Bayes is significant in itself as decision tree learning is usually believed to be less suitable for NLP tasks.

The scheme uses MML coding as an objective (goodness-of-fit) function on model selection and searches with a simple evolution strategy. We test our multivariate tree inference scheme on UCI machine learning repository data sets and compare with the decision tree programs C4.5 and C5. The preliminary results show that on average and on most data-sets, MML oblique trees clearly perform better than both C4.5 and C5 on both "right"/"wrong" accuracy and probabilistic prediction - and with smaller trees, i.e., less leaf nodes.

We give a somewhat surprising observation that InfoBoost can be viewed as an algorithm for growing a branching program that divides and merges the domain repeatedly. We generalize the merging process and propose a new class of boosting algorithms called BP.InfoBoost with various merging schema. BP.InfoBoost assigns to each node a weight as well as a weak hypothesis and the master hypothesis is a threshold function of the sum of the weights over the path induced by a given instance. InfoBoost is a BP.InfoBoost with an extreme scheme that merges all nodes in each round. The other extreme that merges no nodes yields an algorithm for growing a decision tree. We call this particular version DT.InfoBoost. We give an evidence that DT.InfoBoost improves the master hypothesis very efficiently, but it has a risk of overfitting because the size of the master hypothesis may grow exponentially. We propose a merging scheme between these extremes that improves the master hypothesis nearly as fast as the one without merge while keeping the branching program in a moderate size.

We consider such algorithms on special forms of functions and distributions. We deal with the uniform distribution and functions that can be described as a boolean linear threshold functions or a read-once DNF. We show that for boolean linear threshold functions and read-once DNF, maximal purity gain and maximal influence are logically equivalent. This leads us to the exact identification of these classes of functions by impurity-based algorithms given sufficiently many noise-free examples. We show that the decision tree resulting from these algorithms has minimal size and height amongst all decision trees representing the function. Based on the statistical query learning model, we introduce the noise-tolerant version of practical decision tree algorithms. We show that if the input examples have small classification noise and are uniformly distributed, then all our results for practical noise-free impurity-based algorithms also hold for their noise-tolerant version.

With random access, an advice string of exponential length becomes meaningful for polynomially bounded complexity classes. We compare the power of complexity classes under this model. It gives a more stringent notion than the usual model of computation with relativization. Under this model of random access, we prove that there exist advice strings such that the Polynomial-time Hierarchy PH and Parity Polynomial-time circle plusP all collapse to P.

J	Sonnenberg, A				Sonnenberg, A			Decision analysis in clinical gastroenterology	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY			English	Review							COST-EFFECTIVENESS; MANAGEMENT; DISEASE; STRATEGY; DILATION; THERAPY	OBJECTIVES: Although the tools of medical decision analysis have been mostly used to address complex issues of healthcare and management policies, an important role remains for decision analysis to play in solving mundane medical problems of daily practice. The present article alms to restate the origins of decision analysis and to demonstrate the utility of decision models in clinical gastroenterology. METHODS: Three clinical scenarios are presented to illustrate the applicability of decision analysis in clinical gastroenterology. The examples are modeled as simple decision trees and phrased in terms of threshold analysis. RESULTS: In spite of its striking simplicity, the framework of threshold analysis is able to capture a large variety of heterogeneous and often perplexing medical problems. Rather than calculate a cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit ratio, the result of the analysis is expressed as a probability value, which forms the threshold between the two choices against or in favor of a particular medical action. For most analyses little if any calculation is needed to solve the decision tree, and the final outcome of the analysis can be derived based on comparative estimates and considerations of magnitude only. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that threshold analysis can serve as a simple and convenient instrument to solve a large variety of problems in clinical gastroenterology.

The main idea is to employ a classification technique, trained on a restricted subset of data, to produce an estimate of the Reliability Expression (RE), which provides reasonably accurate values of the reliability. The algorithm develops a tree by recursively dividing a collection of random examples (training set) for the network at hand, on the basis of the state (operating or failed) of network components. This produces a classifier that can be easily transformed into a set of intelligible disjoint rules. In the examples presented the AREs, built from a very small fraction of the total state space, produce very close reliability estimates, with errors less than 2 %. The excellent results obtained in the experiments show the potential of the method for the evaluation of the reliability of a system through an ARE.

This paper shows how to automatically design a diagnostic decision tree from a dynamic fault tree used for reliability analysis. In particular the methodology makes use of Markov chains since they are mathematical models used for reliability analysis. We use approximate sensitivity as an intermediary step to obtain the Vesely-Fussell measure from the Markov chain. We used the Vesely-Fussell measure of importance as the corner stone of our methodology, because it provides an accurate measure of components' relevance from a diagnosis perspective. The outcome of this paper is a diagnostic decision tree, which was generated for a real dynamic system. The diagnostic decision tree produced is a map that can be used by repair and maintenance crew to diagnose a system without having previous knowledge or experience about the diagnosed system. The methodology we develop is capable of producing diagnostic decision trees that reduces the number of tests or checks required for a systems diagnosis.

This paper presents our experiences from a pilot project applying case-based reasoning techniques to match the needs of the elderly and those with disabilities to SMARTHOUSE technology. The SMARTHOUSE problem is decomposed into sub-tasks, and generalised concepts added for each sub-task. This decomposition and generalisation enables multiple case reuse employing a standard decision tree index based iterative retrieval strategy. Documented real situations were used to create a small case base. A prototype implemented using RECALL (1) with TCL script is evaluated empirically using leave-one-out testing, and separately with the domain expert on newly created test cases. Results show the generated solutions to be comparable to those of a domain expert. Importantly, the iterative retrieval strategy employing multiple indices generated solutions that were significantly better compared to a best match retrieval without indices.

In a classification model, the connection between classes and properties can be defined by something as simple as a flowchart or as complex and unstructured as a procedures manual. Classifier committee learning methods generate multiple classifiers to form a committee by repeated application of a single base learning algorithm. The committee members vote to decide the final classification. Two such methods are bagging and boosting for improving the predictive power of classifier learning systems. This paper studies a different approach progressive boosting of decision trees. Instead of sampling the same number of data points at each boosting iteration t, our progressive boosting algorithm draws n(t) data according to the sampling schedule. an empirical evaluation of a variant of this method shows that the progressive boosting can significantly reduce the error rate of decision tree learning. On average this is more accurate than bagging and boosting.

Such criteria can also be used to augment methods which require or prefer symbolic data. A tool for continuous data discretization based on the SSV criterion (designed for decision trees) has been constructed. It significantly improves the performance of Naive Bayes Classifier. The combination of the two methods has been tested on 15 datasets from UCI repository and compared with similar approaches. The comparison confirms the robustness of the system.

The proposed GP contains several syntactic constraints to be enforced by the system using a disjunctive normal form representation, so that individuals represent valid rule sets that are easy to interpret. The GP is compared with C4.5, a well-known decision-tree-building algorithm, and with another GP that uses Boolean inputs (BGP), in five medical data sets: chest pain, Ljubljana breast cancer, dermatology, Wisconsin breast cancer, and pediatric adrenocortical tumor. For this last data set a new preprocessing step was devised for survival prediction. Computational experiments show that, overall, the GP algorithm obtained good results with respect to predictive accuracy and rule comprehensibility, by comparison with C4.5 and BGP.

Although, many methods of ensemble creation have been proposed, there is as yet no clear picture of which method is best. In this work, we propose Bagged Voting using different subsets of the same training dataset with the concurrent usage of a voting methodology that combines a Bayesian and a decision tree algorithm. In our algorithm, voters express the degree of their preference using as confidence score the probabilities of classifiers' prediction. Next all confidence values are added for each candidate and the candidate with the highest sum wins the election. We performed a comparison of the presented ensemble with other ensembles that use either the Bayesian or the decision tree classifier as base learner and we took better accuracy in most cases.

Automated techniques have aided in this process, but this has largely been at a quantitative level. In contrast, we present a qualitative approach which produces verified theorems, which classify algebras of a particular type and size into isomorphism classes. We describe both a semi-automated and a fully automated bootstrapping approach to building and verifying classification theorems. In the latter case, we have implemented a procedure which takes the axioms of the algebra and produces a decision tree embedding a fully verified classification theorem. This has been achieved by the integration (and improvement) of a number of automated reasoning techniques: we use the Mace model generator, the HR and C4.5 machine learning systems, the Spass theorem prover, and the Gap computer algebra system to reduce the complexity of the problems given to Spass. We demonstrate the power of this approach by classifying loops, groups, monoids and quasigroups of various sizes.

Although infection with high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) has been identified as the primary cause of cervical cancer, only some of those infected go on to develop cervical cancer. Obviously, the progression from HPV infection to cancer involves other environmental and host factors. Recent population-based twin and family studies have demonstrated the importance of the hereditary component of cervical cancer, associated with genetic susceptibility. Consequently, SNP markers and microsatellites should be considered genetic factors for determining what combinations of genetic factors are involved in precancerous changes to cervical cancer. This study employs a Bayesian network and four different decision tree algorithms, and compares the performance of these learning algorithms. The results of this study raise the possibility of investigations that could identify combinations of genetic factors, such as SNPs and microsatellites, that influence the risk associated with common complex multifactorial diseases, such as cervical cancer.

Visualization techniques can enable the exploration and detection of patterns and relationships in a complex data set by presenting the data in a graphical format in which the key characteristics become more apparent. The dimensionality and size of array data sets however present significant challenges to visualization. The purpose of this study is to present an interactive approach for visualizing variations in gene expression profiles and to assess its usefulness for classifying samples. Results: The first Fourier harmonic projection was used to map multi-dimensional gene expression data to two dimensions in an implementation called VizStruct. The visualization method was tested using the differentially expressed genes identified in eight separate gene expression data sets. The samples were classified using the oblique decision tree (OC1) algorithm to provide a procedure for visualization-driven classification. The classifiers were evaluated by the holdout and the cross-validation techniques. The proposed method was found to achieve high accuracy.

Symbolic data analysis treats new units that are underlying concepts of the given data base or that are found by clustering. In this way, it is possible to reduce the size of the data to be treated by transforming the initial classical variables into variables called symbolic variables. In symbolic data analysis, we consider, among other types, interval and histogram variables. The algebraic structure of these variables leads us to adapt dissimilarity measures to be able to study them. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov criterion is used as a test selection metric for decision tree induction. Our contribution in this paper is to adapt this criterion of Kolmogorov-Smirnov to these types of variables. We present an example to illustrate this approach.								Bock H.

These areas are also often characterised by important intertidal habitats that support large populations of sediment-dwelling animals and the birds that feed upon them. Such areas are generally protected under national, European or international nature conservation legislation and agreements. Proposed developments that involve loss of or alteration to intertidal habitats must, therefore, give careful consideration to impacts on the associated faunal communities. At present, the ability to make quantitative predictions of how habitats and their faunal communities will change in response to physical changes in an estuary is limited. This paper describes two ecological models that predict such responses. Long-term monitoring data from the Humber Estuary (UK) were used to identify the distributions of key habitat types and invertebrate communities. Multivariate statistical methods were then used to identify key physical parameters that describe the variation in the distribution of these habitats and communities. A rule-based model was developed using a decision tree algorithm to predict changes in the distribution and occurrence of habitats and associated faunal communities using the strength of their association with the physical environment. The resulting predicted patterns were well correlated with observed data for the estuary. The same sets of rules were then applied to predict the changes that would occur in response to changes in the physical environment (predictor variables) following long-term natural changes in the morphology and hydrodynamics of the estuary. Such ecological models have the potential to make a significant contribution to the sustainable management of estuaries.

Those two classification models have been applied to a number of diverse areas for the identification of 'biologically relevant' molecules. Surface enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) is a novel approach to biomarker discovery and has been successfully used in projects ranging from rapid identification of potential maker proteins to segregation of abnormal cases from normal cases. SELDI-TOF MS can contain thousands of data points. This high dimensional data causes a more complex neural network architecture and slow training procedure. In the approach we proposed in this paper, a decision tree is first applied to select possible biomarker candidates from the SELDI-TOF MS data. At this stage, the decision tree selects a small number of discriminatory biomarker proteins. This candidate mass data defined by the peak amplitude values is then provided as input patterns to the MLP neural network which is trained to classify the mass spectrometry patterns. The key feature of this hybrid approach is to take advantage of both models: use the neural network for classification with significantly low-dimensional mass data obtained by the decision tree. We applied this bioinformatics tool to identify proteomic patterns in serum that distinguish prostate cancer samples from normal or benign ones. The results indicate that the proposed method for mass spectrometry analysis is a promising approach to classify the proteomic patterns and is applicable for the significant clinical diagnosis and prognosis in the fields of cancer biology.

Currently many classification mining algorithms deal with this problem by using an incremental learning approach or ensemble classifiers approach. However, both of them can not make a prediction at any time exactly. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for the maintenance of knowledge. Our approach stores and maintains knowledge in ambiguous decision table with current statistical indicators, With our disambiguation algorithm, a decision tree without any time problem can be synthesized on the fly efficiently. Our experiment results have shown that the accuracy rate of our approach is higher and smoother than other approaches. So, our algorithm is demonstrated to be a real anytime approach.

The paradigm includes an agent-based approach for distributed learning of a decision tree to fully analyze data located at several distributed sites without revealing any information at each site. The distributed decision tree approach has been developed from the well-known decision tree algorithm, for the distributed and privacy preserving data mining process. It is performed on the agent based architecture dealing with distributed databases in a collaborative fashion. This approach is very useful to be applied to a variety of domains which require information security and privacy during data mining process.

We present methods that extract features from breast regions characterizing normal and cancerous tissue. A subset of the features is used to construct a classifier. This classifier is then used to classify each mammogram as normal or abnormal. We designed a unique two-stage cascading classifier system. A binary decision tree classifier was used in the first stage. It is designed to correctly classify cancerous regions. The regions classified as abnormal in the first-stage were used as input to the second-stage classifier, a linear classifier. We will show that the overall performance of our two-stage cascading classifier is better than a single classifier.

As a method to overcome this difficulty, we applied a multidimensional association rule algorithm with some restriction to the branches of generated decision tree, and found that most of the branches in the decision tree have shorter and more reliable multidimensional association rules as subsets of the branches so that reducing the number of testing items may be possible. Therefore, by using the found shorter and reliable rules, costs related to testing each item in the branches can be reduced.

The distributed decision tree approach is applied to intrusion detection domain, the interest of which is recently increasing. In the approach, a network profile is built by applying a distributed data analysis method for the collection of data from distributed hosts. The method integrates inductive generalization and agent-based computing, so that classification rules are learned via: tree induction from distributed data to be used as intrusion profiles. Agents, in a collaborative fashion, generate partial trees and communicate the temporary results among them in the form of indices to the data records. Experimental results are presented for military network domain data used for the network intrusion detection in KDD cup 1999. Several experimental results show that the performance of distributed version of decision tree is much better than that of non-distributed version with data collected manually from distributed hosts.

The technique represents classification rules inferred from data, as landscapes of graphical objects in a 3D visualization space, which can provide valuable insights into knowledge discovery and model-building processes. Such visual organization of classification rules can contribute to additional human insights into classification models that are hard to attain using traditional displays. It also includes navigational locomotion and high interactivity to facilitate the interpretation and comparison of results obtained in various classification scenarios. This is especially apparent for large rule sets where browsing through textual syntax of thousands of rules is beyond human comprehension. Visualization of both knowledge and data aids in assessing data quality and provides the capability for data cleansing.

A decision protocol is a kind of decision tree implemented in an object-based representation formalism. A reasoner based on such a formalism and on hierarchical classification is coupled with a knowledge editor. This association provides an assistance for editing and maintenance of protocols, enabling the detection of errors and the companson between versions of the protocol. In this way, a management of protocols takes fully advantage of the underlying knowledge representation and reasoning tools. This straightforward use of the protocol may be insufficient in some situations. Then, the protocol may have to be adapted for these situations. A study of protocol adaptation is presented. In particular a reasoner based on a combination of hierarchical classification and fuzzy logic is introduced.

J	Hoste, V; Daelemans, W; Gillis, S				Hoste, V; Daelemans, W; Gillis, S			Using rule-induction techniques to model pronunciation variation in Dutch	COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE			English	Article							LANGUAGE	In this paper, we present an inductive approach to the automatic extraction of knowledge about inter-regional pronunciation variation. We compare two different rule-induction techniques, both popular in language engineering applications, viz. the rule sequence learner Transformation-Based Error-Driven Learning (TBEDL) Brill (1995) and the decision tree learner C5.0 Quinlan (1993). We investigate whether both techniques detect the same regularities and evaluate the extracted rules in terms of accuracy and in terms of linguistic relevance. As a case study, we apply the approach to Dutch and Flemish (the variety of Dutch spoken in Flanders, a part of Belgium), based on Celex and Fonilex, pronunciation lexica for Dutch and Flemish, respectively. Our main goal is to show that this approach allows the automatic acquisition of compact, interpretable translation rules between pronunciation varieties, on the basis of phonemic representations of words in both varieties (as output of phoneme recognition or, as in our case, on the basis of existing lexica). We also show that the observed differences coincide with the tendencies studied and described in linguistic comparative research of inter-regional pronunciation variation in standard Dutch.

We adapt the decision tree concept to a setting where data changes rapidly and hundreds or thousands of attributes may be relevant. Decision tree branches are evaluated as needed, based on the most recent data, focusing entirely on the data that needs to be classified. Our algorithm is based on the P-tree data structure that allows fast evaluation of counts of data points, and results in scaling that is better than linear in the data set size.

While the primary goal is usually to achieve the highest possible prediction accuracy, the interpretation of the resulting prediction model is important to understand its shortcomings for further improvements. Throughout this paper we focus on branch prediction, where the (binary) outcome of a test is needed for enhancing the performance of pipelined computer architectures. Many research has been done in this domain and different branch prediction solutions are described in the literature. The quality of a prediction model is highly dependent on the quality of the available data. Especially the choice of the related variables or features to base the prediction on is important. In this paper we evaluate the predictive power of different branch prediction features using the metric Gini-index, which is used as feature selection measure in the construction of decision trees. We observe that through this Gini-metric an explanation can be provided for the performance of existing branch predictors. We show that the Gini-index is a good metric for comparing branch prediction features. Further, we found that a feature can have good discriminative capacities, although this does not result in very good accuracies because of shortcomings in the predictor implementation.

Flexible NBTree uses Bayes measure 6 to select proper test and applies post-discretization strategy to construct decision tree. The finial decision tree nodes contain univariate splits as regular decision trees, but the leaf nodes contain General Naive Bayes, which is a variant of standard Naive Bayesian classifier. Empirical studies on a set of natural domains show that Flexible NBTree has clear advantages with respect to the generalization ability when compared against its counterpart, NBTree.

This paper put out a risk-cost probability assessment method combined with a decision tree method. Thought the methods, potential additional cost can easily be calculated and compared, which is helpful for project engineers to make a rational decision. In a case across Huangpu River, Shanghai, China, risk factors were firstly identified, which mainly included disadvantage geological conditions, accidents in drill holes, inclement weather, and deviating from designed drilling routes. And relative risk results were also introduced in the view of expense. Secondly, all sub-risk results were analyzed, and cost distributions of high risks were predicted. Contractors can more willingly adopt the risk analysis results during a decision-making process besides their experience and intuition. Finally, it was suggested to take active steps to realign the probabilities for success. In the case, such steps included making a further detail site investigation, changing a more power trenchless equipment, and developing careful contingency planning.

The basic data mining algorithms of decision tree, regression-based, and neural network models are considered, using both categorical and continuous data. Two of the data sets have binary outcomes, while the third has a set of four possible outcomes. Key findings are that when the data is highly unbalanced, algorithms tend to degenerate by assigning all cases to the most common outcome. When data is balanced, accuracy rates tend to decline. If data is balanced, that reduces the training set size, and can lead to the degeneracy of model failure through omission of cases encountered in the test set. Decision tree algorithms were found to be the most robust with respect to the degree of balancing applied.

A previous work has determined three financial leverage intervals, classifying companies as great, fuzzy and bad, regarding their debt condition. A determinist model (Data Envelopment Analysis) to minimize indebtedness for a given return on assets, return on equity and assets turnover was the first step to rank companies. This technique resulted in a large fuzzy financial leverage interval for many companies. The use of two different non-deterministic methodologies, which were: neural network and decision tree, helped reduced this fuzzy area, allowing enhanced classification of companies. By combining a set of techniques, this study demonstrated how to reduce the number of company observations classified in the fuzzy area by nearly 84%. Therefore, this study provides a better reference to managers regarding their company's position in relation to their financial performance.

The approach is founded on the notion of Redundant Decision Trees (RDT), a generalisation of regular crisp Decision Trees (DT). RDTs suffice in capturing the attribute tests required for recognising crisp concepts, from which the related fuzzy concepts may be unambiguously derived. Potential applications of this method include categorisation and the semiautomatic construction and the statistical evaluation of fuzzy concepts. In addition, since the definition of the membership degrees is effectively based on a robust DT machine learning algorithm, the induced fuzzy membership functions generalise. Thus, with certain assumptions, they output sensible membership degrees of previously unseen objects. In addition to introducing and analysing the basic definitions and algorithms, we briefly evaluate their applicability with examples and present some remarks concerning the scope of the approach.

But those algorithms usually work with only one attribute at a time. The dependencies among attributes are not considered in those algorithms. Thus, it is very important to construct a model to discover the dependencies among attributes and to improve the accuracy of the decision tree learning algorithms. Association mining is a good choice for us to concern with the problems of attribute dependencies. Generally, these dependencies are classified into three types: categorical -type, numerical-type, and categorical-numerical-mixed dependencies. This paper proposes a CAM (Classification based on Association Mining) model to deal with such kind of dependency. The CAM model combines the association mining technologies and the traditional decision-tree learning capabilities to handle the complicated and real cases. According to the experiments on fifteen datasets from the UCI database repository, the CAM model can significantly improve both the accuracy and the rule size of C5. At the same time, the CAM model also outperforms the existing association-based classification models, i.e., ADT (Association-based Decision Tree) and CBA (Classification Based on Association).

This approach is derived from the ordered attribute trees method, proposed by Lobo and Numao in 2000, which builds a decision tree for each attribute and uses these trees to fill the missing attribute values. It is based on the Mutual Information between the attributes and the class. Our approach primarily extends this method on three points: 1) it does not impose an order of construction; 2) a probability distribution is used for each missing attribute instead of the most probable value; 3) the result of the classification process is a probability distribution instead of a single class. Moreover, our method takes the dependence between attributes into account. We present Lobo's approach and our extensions, we compare them, and we discuss some perspectives.

In addition, fuzzy rules allow us to effectively classify data having non-axis-parallel decision boundaries, which is difficult for the conventional attribute-based methods. In this paper, we propose an optimized fuzzy rule generation method for classification both in accuracy and comprehensibility (or rule complexity). We investigate the use of genetic algorithm to determine an optimal set of membership functions for quantitative data. In our method, for a given set of membership functions a fuzzy decision tree is constructed and its accuracy and rule complexity are evaluated, which are combined into the fitness function to be optimized. We have experimented our algorithm with several benchmark data sets. The experiment results show that our method is more efficient in performance and comprehensibility of rules compared with the existing methods including C4.5 and FID3.1.

This method extends Ni-Black windowed thresholding technique and hue (H), saturation (S) and value (V) are employed. First, an observation window is retrieved, and based on standard deviation of H, S and V, a pre-defined decision tree is used for selecting proper variables that should be employed. Secondly, Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT) is used for eliminating correlation and reducing dimension. Finally, center point of the window is classified based on 2-D standard normal distribution. The result shows that our binarization method generates better result than Ni-Black and other global thresholding binarization method such as Otsu's in color document images. A comparison using a commercial OCR system shows that our method can be used in various situations for high quality text retrieval.

The release of oxybutynin from oxybutynin ER occurs in a sustained manner, resulting in a smoother plasma concentration-time profile and a lower maximum plasma concentration than those seen with oxybutynin immediate-release (IR). The ER formulation has been developed with the aim of improving the tolerability of oxybutynin therapy and facilitating once-daily administration. Moreover, oxybutynin ER offers greater flexibility in dosage (5-30 mg/day) than the other available treatment options. At dosages of 5-30mg once daily, oxybutynin ER produced significant decreases from baseline. in weekly urinary urge incontinence in patients with OAB. In addition, there were significant decreases in weekly total incontinence episodes and micturition frequency. In two randomised, double-blind studies in patients with OAB, the improvement in all the symptoms with once-daily oxybutynin ER 5-30 mg/day was similar to that produced by oxybutynin IR 5-20 mg/ day given one to four times daily. Once-daily oxybutynin ER 10mg was superior to tolterodine IR 4 mg/day given as two daily doses and as effective as once-daily tolterodine ER 4 mg/day in decreasing urinary incontinence; the decreases in micturition frequency with oxybutynin ER were significantly greater than those seen with either of tolterodine formulations. Oxybutynin ER was well tolerated in all the trials, with adverse events usually being mild to moderate and transient. In direct comparisons, the overall tolerability profile of oxybutynin ER was better than that of oxybutynin IR. Oxybutynin ER was similar to tolterodine (IR and ER) with respect to the incidence of clinically important dry mouth. A large 12-month tolerability study demonstrated no significant risks associated with the long-term use of oxybutynin ER. A few noncomparative studies have shown promising results with oxybutynin ER in the treatment of adult and paediatric patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction secondary to neuronal injury. Long- and short-term studies have reported significant improvements in health-related quality of life with oxybutynin ER therapy. In addition, pharmacoeconomic studies have suggested that oxybutynin ER is more cost effective than oxybutynin IR and at least as cost effective as tolterodine IR. In conclusion, oxybutynin ER shows excellent efficacy in the treatment of symptoms associated with OAB in adults and the elderly with a good tolerability profile over a prolonged period of use (12 months). The ER formulation of oxybutynin provides a smooth plasma concentration profile over the 24-hour dosage interval, facilitating once-daily administration. Hence, given its overall efficacy/tolerability profile and dosage flexibility, oxybutynin ER provides an excellent treatment option in the first-line pharmacotherapy of OAB. Oxybutynin is an antimuscarinic drug with a high affinity for the muscarinic receptors in the bladder and the parotid gland. The active metabolite of oxybutynin, N-desethyloxybutynin (NDO) shares the pharmacological actions of the parent drug. Both oxybutynin and NDO exhibit stereoisomerism and experimental studies have shown that their antimuscarinic activity mainly resides in the (R)isomers. The antimuscarinic properties of oxybutynin result in several beneficial urodynamic effects, such as increases in bladder capacity and micturition threshold pressure, prolongation of micturition interval and reduction in maximum intravesical pressure during the collecting phase. There are few clinical data available on the urodynamic effects of OROS(R)-based oxybutynin extended-release (ER). Oxybutynin ER increases the void volume and total bladder capacity; clinically insignificant increases in post-void residual volume have also been observed. In clinical studies, the inhibition of saliva production with oxybutynin ER was similar to that produced by tolterodine immediate-release (IR), but was significantly less pronounced than with oxybutynin IR. These studies also suggest that NDO, especially the (R)-isomer, may be primarily responsible for the inhibitory effects on salivary production, thus producing dry mouth with oxybutynin therapy. OROS(R)-based oxybutynin ER provides sustained drug delivery, facilitating a 24-hour dosage interval. The fluctuations in plasma oxybutynin concentrations seen with 2- to 4-times-daily administration of the IR formulation are minimised with the once-daily oxybutynin ER. Maximum plasma concentrations (C-max) of oxybutynin and its active metabolite were lower and time to Cmax was longer with oxybutynin ER than with oxybutynin IR. In addition, the bioavailability of oxybutynin is increased and that of its metabolite is decreased with oxybutynin ER, compared with oxybutynin IR, thereby shifting the ratio of the oxybutynin and NDO in plasma towards the parent compound. Concomitant administration of food with oxybutynin ER does not affect the Cmax or area under concentration-time curve of oxybutynin. Both oxybutynin and NDO are >97% protein bound. Oxybutynin is extensively metabolised mainly by cytochrome P450 3A4, resulting in the formation of the active metabolite, NDO. Metabolism of oxybutynin is stereoselective and results in lower plasma concentration of (R)-oxybutynin than that of (S)-oxybutynin. Owing to an extensive metabolism, <0.1% of oxybutynin is excreted as unchanged drug in the urine. In healthy volunteers, the plasma elimination half-lives of oxybutynin and NDO were 14 and 8 hours, respectively. Oxybutynin ER was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the weekly urinary urge incontinence (UUI) episodes in patients with overactive bladder (OAB) in a randomised, double-blind study. At the end of 6-week dose-escalating treatment with oxybutynin ER 5-15mg once daily, a significantly higher proportion of patients receiving oxybutynin ER were free from incontinence compared with patients receiving the same dosage of oxybutynin IR or those on placebo. Oxybutynin ER 5-30 mg/day was as effective as oxybutynin IR 5-20 mg/day in relieving UUI and other symptoms of OAB. UUI episodes decreased from baseline by 83-92% in patients receiving oxybutynin ER and by 72-88% in oxybutynin IR recipients. However, the increase in 'normal' (voluntary) micturition frequency with oxybutynin ER was significantly greater than with oxybutynin IR in one trial. In randomised, double-blind, 12-week trials, oxybutynin ER 10mg once daily was significantly more effective than tolterodine IR 2mg twice daily (Overactive Bladder: Judging Effective Control and Treatment [OBJECT] trial) and as effective as tolterodine ER 4mg once daily (Overactive bladder: Performance of Extended Release Agents [OPERA] trial) in relieving weekly UUI episodes in patients with OAB. Oxybutynin ER was more effective than tolterodine IR and similar to tolterodine ER in reducing weekly total incontinence episodes. Patients receiving oxybutynin ER had significantly greater reductions in micturition frequency than either tolterodine IR or tolterodine ER recipients. A significantly higher proportion of patients achieved total continence (relief from both urge and non-urge incontinence) with oxybutynin ER than with tolterodine ER. The results of the above trials were corroborated in a single-treatment study using the same dose-titration schedule of oxybutynin ER (5-30mg) in a communi- ty-dwelling population. Both therapy-naive and previously treated patients had significant reductions in weekly UUI episodes after 12 weeks of maintenance treatment with oxybutynin ER at their optimal doses. Limited data from two small, noncomparative studies in patients with neurogenic detrusor dysfunction secondary to neuronal injury (one each in multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury patients) and three nonblind studies in paediatric patients with neurogenic or non-neurogenic detrusor overactivity have shown favourable results on urinary dysfunction in these patient populations. Oxybutynin ER significantly improves health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) in patients with urinary incontinence. In a large, noncomparative trial in patients with urge or mixed incontinence (including the elderly) in a community-dwelling population, oxybutynin ER (5-30 mg/day) produced significant improvements in all three questionnaires (General Health and Bother Scale, Individual Incontinence Impact Questionnaire and Sleep Impact Questionnaire) used to assess quality of life. These improvements were maintained for up to 12 months of therapy. Results of short-term studies have also shown similar improvements in HR-QOL measures with oxybutynin ER. Analysis of retrospective clinical trial data using a decision-tree model from a payer perspective showed that oxybutynin ER was a more cost-effective treatment option for patients with OAB than oxybutynin IR or tolterodine IR. A further analysis of this study suggested that oxybutynin ER and tolterodine IR may be similarly cost effective. Pharmacoeconomic analyses in the UK and Canada of data from the OBJECT trial showed that treatment with oxybutynin ER was more cost effective than tolterodine IR therapy. Oxybutynin ER was equivalent to tolterodine ER with respect to the direct health-care cost and medication persistence, although the risk of hospitalisation was lower when treatment was initiated with the latter. Oxybutynin ER 5-30mg once daily has been well tolerated for up to 23 weeks in clinical trials assessing its therapeutic efficacy in patients with OAB including the elderly. In a pooled analysis of four clinical trials, approximately 7% of patients treated with oxybutynin ER discontinued treatment because of adverse events. The adverse events reported in >5% of patients included dry mouth, constipation, somnolence, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, dizziness, bluffed vision and dry eyes. Oxybutynin does not appear to produce any significant adverse cardiac effects. A dose-related incidence of dry mouth was noted in clinical trials; however, most of the dry mouth events with oxybutynin ER were of mild intensity. In direct comparisons, the tolerability profile of oxybutynin ER 5-30 mg/day was at least as good as that of oxybutynin IR 5-20 mg/day, and similar to that of tolterodine IR or ER 4 mg/day, except for the incidence of dry mouth. The incidence of dry mouth events of any severity in patients receiving oxybutynin ER was at least similar or similar, respectively, to that in recipients of oxybutynin IR or tolterodine IR; these events were more frequent in oxybutynin ER than in tolterodine ER recipients. However, the propensity of oxybutynin ER to produce clinically bothersome dry mouth was lower than that of okybutynin IR and similar to that of tolterodine (IR or ER). The nature and frequency of all other adverse events with oxybutynin ER were generally similar to those reported with oxybutynin IR, tolterodine IR or tolterodine ER. In long-term treatment (for up to 1 year), oxybutynin ER was well tolerated in patients with OAB, including the elderly, with no serious adverse effect reported. Adverse CNS events were uncommon during oxybutynin ER therapy, and only headache and dizziness occurred in greater than or equal to5% of patients in the long-term study. The incidence of CNS adverse events with oxybutynin ER was similar between the elderly ( greater than or equal to65 years) and the younger (<65 years) patients. Oxybutynin ER is indicated for the treatment of urinary incontinence, urgency and frequency in patients with idiopathic detrusor overactivity. The drug is also indicated for the treatment of adult and paediatric (aged greater than or equal to6 years; approved only in the US) patients with symptoms of detrusor overactivity secondary to neurogenic disease (e.g. spina bifida). The recommended dosage range for oxybutynin ER is 5-30mg once daily. Treatment is generally started at 5 mg/day and titrated by 5 mg/day every week until a balance of efficacy and tolerability is achieved. The dosage may be increased up to a maximum of 30 mg/day if the desired efficacy is not achieved. In the US, the maximum recommended dosage in paediatric patients ( :6 years) with detrusor overactivity secondary to neurological injury is 20mg once daily. For patients switching from oxybutynin IR, clinical judgement should be exercised in selecting the appropriate initial dose of oxybutynin ER, with subsequent titration according to the response. Oxybutynin ER may be administered with or without food.

S	Alvarez, I		LopezdeMantaras, R; Saitta, L		Alvarez, I			Explaining the result of a decision tree to the end-user	ECAI 2004: 16TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, PROCEEDINGS	FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND APPLICATIONS		English	Proceedings Paper	16th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence	AUG 22-27, 2004	Valencia, SPAIN	European Coordinating Comm Artificial Intelligence, Asoc Espanola Inteligencia Artificial, Assoc Catalana Intelligencia Artificial, Univ Politecn Valencia, Grp Tecnol Informat			EXPLANATION	This paper addresses the problem of the explanation of the result given by a decision tree, when it is used to predict the class of new cases. In order to evaluate this result, the end-user relies on some estimate of the error rate and on the trace of the classification. Unfortunately the trace doesn't contain the information necessary to understand the case at hand. We propose a new method to qualify the result given by a decision tree when the data are continuous-valued. We perform a geometric study of the decision surface (the boundary of the inverse image of the different classes). This analysis gives the list of the tests of the tree that are the most sensitive to a change in the input data. Unlike the trace, this list can easily be ordered and pruned so that only the most important tests are presented. We also show how the metric can be used to interact with the end-user.

J	af Geijerstam, JL; Britton, M; Marke, LA				af Geijerstam, JL; Britton, M; Marke, LA			Mild head injury: observation or computed tomography? Economic aspects by literature review and decision analysis	EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL			English	Article							TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY; MANAGEMENT; ADMISSION; RISK	Objectives: To compare the costs of two strategies for acute management of mild head injury: inhospital observation compared with acute computed tomography (CT) and home care. Methods: Studies comparing costs for the two strategies that seem to have similar outcomes for patients were systematically reviewed. A decision tree analysis to compare the costs was also constructed, based on Swedish national costs and the risks found in a recent review on mild head injury complications. Results: No studies were found that directly measured and compared risks, benefits, and costs of the two strategies. In the four studies retrieved, involving 4126 patients, the costs for hospital observation were factual, but a model was used to evaluate costs for the CT strategy. On average, costs were one third lower with CT. Also, the decision tree analysis demonstrated that the CT strategy was one third less expensive than inhospital observation. A sensitivity analysis showed this to be valid for nearly all cases. If these calculations hold true, a change of strategy could result in annual savings of pound280 000/million inhabitants. Conclusion: The CT strategy seems to cost one third less than hospital observation.

J	Bogaert, J; Ceulemans, R; Salvador-Van Eysenrode, D				Bogaert, J; Ceulemans, R; Salvador-Van Eysenrode, D			Decision tree algorithm for detection of spatial processes in landscape transformation	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						decision tree algorithm; fragmentation; land cover change; landscape transformation; spatial pattern	GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; PATCH SIZE; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; SHAPE COMPACTNESS; INDEX; ECOLOGY; PERIMETER; PATTERN; RASTER; CONSEQUENCES	The conversion of landscapes by human activities results in widespread changes in landscape spatial structure. Regardless of the type of land conversion, there appears to be a limited number of common spatial configurations that result from such land transformation processes. Some of these configurations are considered optimal or more desirable than others. Based on pattern geometry, we define ten processes responsible for pattern change: aggregation, attrition, creation, deformation, dissection, enlargement, fragmentation, perforation, shift, and shrinkage. A novelty in this contribution is the inclusion of transformation processes causing expansion of the land cover of interest. Consequently, we propose a decision tree algorithm that enables detection of these processes, based on three parameters that have to be determined before and after the transformation of the landscape: area, perimeter length, and number of patches of the focal landscape class. As an example, the decision tree algorithm is applied to determine the transformation processes of three divergent land cover change scenarios: deciduous woodland degradation in Cadiz Township (Wisconsin, USA) 1831-1950, canopy gap formation in a terra firme rain forest at the Tiputini Biodiversity Station (Amazonian Ecuador) 1997-1998, and forest regrowth in Petersham Township (Massachusetts, USA) 1830-1985. The examples signal the importance of the temporal resolution of the data, since long-term pattern conversions can be subdivided in stadia in which particular pattern components are altered by specific transformation processes.

The methodology makes it simple to perform "what if' scenarios fairly quickly. A Java based application has been developed to implement this methodology and it uses computational algorithms and a graphical user interface to enable designers to simulate product designs. The front end user interface is a Java based application while the back-end is the combination of a data parser and disassembly engine, which also makes use of Java and XML technologies. The disassembly engine performs calculations based on data represented in an XML data store and runs as the back-end component of the computational tools. The user interface has the ability to display a dynamically configurable disassembly tree. The disassembly knowledge is represented in XML format to allow robust and scalable parsing and processing of the various disassembly alternatives that correspond to the configurable disassembly tree. Examples are presented to demonstrate the implementation and capabilities of the computational design methodology presented in this paper.

The concept that there are levels of exposure that do not cause adverse effects is inherent in setting acceptable daily intakes (ADIs) for chemicals with known toxicological profiles. The TTC principle extends this concept by proposing that a de minimis value can be identified for many chemicals, in the absence of a full toxicity database, based on their chemical structures and the known toxicity of chemicals which share similar structural characteristics. The establishment and application of widely accepted TTC values would benefit consumers, industry and regulators. By avoiding unnecessary toxicity testing and safety evaluations when human intakes are below such a threshold, application of the TTC approach would focus limited resources of time, cost, animal use and expertise on the testing and evaluation of substances with the greatest potential to pose risks to human health and thereby contribute to a reduction in the use of animals. An Expert Group of the European branch of the International Life Sciences Institute-ILSI Europe-has examined the TTC principle for its wider applicability in food safety evaluation. The Expert Group examined metabolism and accumulation, structural alerts, endocrine disrupting chemicals and specific endpoints, such as neurotoxicity, teratogenicity, developmental toxicity, allergenicity and immunotoxicity, and determined whether such properties or endpoints had to be taken into consideration specifically in a step-wise approach. The Expert Group concluded that the TTC principle can be applied for low concentrations in food of chemicals that lack toxicity data, provided that there is a sound intake estimate. The use of a decision tree to apply the TTC principle is proposed, and this paper describes the step-wise process in detail. Proteins, heavy metals and polyhalogenated-dibenzodioxins and related compounds were excluded from this approach. When assessing a chemical, a review of prior knowledge and context of use should always precede the use of the TTC decision tree. The initial step is the identification and evaluation of possible genotoxic and/or high potency carcinogens. Following this step, non-genotoxic substances are evaluated in a sequence of steps related to the concerns that would be associated with increasing intakes. For organophosphates a TTC of 18mug per person per day (0.3 mug/kg bw/day) is proposed, and when the compound is not an OP, the TTC values for the Cramer structural classes III, II and I, with their respective TTC levels (e.g. 1800, 540 and 90 mug per person per day; or 30, 9 and 1.5 mug/kg bw /day), would be applied sequentially. All other endpoints or properties were shown to have a distribution of no observed effect levels (NOELs) similar to the distribution of NOELs for general toxicity endpoints in Cramer classes I, II and III. The document was discussed with a wider audience during a workshop held in March 2003 (see list of workshop participants). (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However it is an equally important issue to consider how to handle the test costs associated with querying the missing values in a test case. When the value of an attribute is missing in a test case, it may or may not be worthwhile to take the effort to obtain its missing value, depending on how much the value will result in a potential gain in the classification accuracy. In this paper we show how to obtain a test-cost sensitive naive Bayes classifier (csNB) by including a test strategy which determines how unknown attributes are selected to perform test on in order to minimize the sum of the misclassification costs and test costs. We propose and evaluate several potential test strategies including one that allows several tests to be done at once. We empirically evaluate the csNB method, and show that it compares favorably with its decision tree counterpart.

We compare our algorithm against a standard centralized decision tree implementation in terms of accuracy as well as the communication complexity. Our experimental results show that by using only 20% of the communication cost necessary to centralize the data we can achieve trees with accuracy at least 80% of the trees produced by the centralized version.

However in most real-world problems, labelled data streams are rarely immediately available. Due to this reason, models are reconstructed only when labelled data become available periodically. This passive stream mining model has several drawbacks. We propose a new concept of demand-driven active data mining. In active mining, the loss of the model is either continuously guessed without using any true class labels or estimated, whenever necessary, from a small number of instances whose actual class labels are verified by paying an affordable cost. When the estimated loss is more than a tolerable threshold, the model evolves by using a small number of instances with verified true class labels. Previous work on active mining concentrates on error guess and estimation. In this paper we discuss several approaches on decision tree evolution.

TCP is suboptimal in hybrid wired/wireless networks because it reacts in the same way to losses due to congestion and losses due to link errors. We thus propose to use machine learning techniques to build automatically a loss classifier from a database obtained by simulations of random network topologies. Several machine learning algorithms are compared for this task and the best method for this application turns out to be decision tree boosting. It outperforms ad hoc classifiers proposed in the networking literature.

Orthogonal decision trees are functionally orthogonal to each other and they correspond to the principal components of the underlying function space. This paper offers a technique to construct such trees based on eigen-analysis of the ensemble and offers experimental results to document the performance of orthogonal trees on grounds of accuracy and model complexity.

We have used simple Binning [11] and Laplace Transform [2] techniques to improve the reliability of these learners and compare their effectiveness with that of the newly developed Venn Probability Machine (VPM) meta-learner [9]. We assess improvements in reliability using loss functions, Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves and Empirical Reliability Curves (ERC). The VPM outperforms the simple techniques to improve reliability, although at the cost of increased computational intensity and slight increase in error rate. These trade-offs are discussed.

Traditional learning algorithms, however aim only at high classification accuracy. It has been observed that both traditional decision trees and naive Bayes produce good classification accuracy but poor probability estimates. In this paper we use a new model, conditional independence tree (CITree), which is a combination of decision tree and naive Bayes and more suitable for ranking and more learnable in practice. We propose a novel algorithm for learning CITree for ranking, and the experiments show that the CITree algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art decision tree learning algorithm C4.4 and naive Bayes significantly in yielding accurate rankings. Our work provides an effective data mining algorithm for applications in which an accurate ranking is required.

Two different fitness functions are used in the genetic program, one based on information gain and the other based on the gini index. The classification algorithms used are three classification tree algorithms, namely C5, CART, CHAID and an MLP neural network. The intention of the research is to ascertain if the decision tree classification algorithms benefit more using features constructed using a genetic programme whose fitness function incorporates the same fundamental learning mechanism as the splitting criteria of the associated decision tree.

Food allergy is a complex adverse reaction towards food that is difficult to diagnose or treat. Potential unintended effects in food and food processing related to allergenicity increase the complexity of the safety assessments. A detailed decision tree to evaluate the potential allergenicity of GM food starts with the source of the gene. Comparison to known allergens is the only known way to predict the allergenic potential of a protein without laboratory tests. Biochemical characteristics have limited predictive power. Here, an overview is given of bioinformatics approaches towards prediction of allergenicity. These are based on advanced multi-alignment, clustering and pattern recognition tools as well as on three-dimensional structural analysis, using a variety of databases. The criteria what establishes 'sufficient similarity' to identify allergens are still being discussed. Cur-rent criteria may need improvements. Ongoing developments will contribute to the future ability to predict the potential allergenicity of proteins in silico and may result in new approaches to circumvent the issue for future novel crops.

J	Lark, RM; Ferguson, RB				Lark, RM; Ferguson, RB			Mapping risk of soil nutrient deficiency or excess by disjunctive and indicator kriging	GEODERMA			English	Article						geostatistics; indicator kriging; disjunctive kriging; uncertainty	CONDITIONAL-PROBABILITY; OPTIMAL INTERPOLATION; CONTAMINATION	For many practical problems in land management, information about soil properties, relative to threshold values that may be of practical importance (regulatory limits, management guidelines etc.), is needed at unsampled sites. Nonlinear geostatistical methods allow us to estimate the probability that the true value of a soil property at an unsampled location exceeds a specified threshold, conditional on our observations at sampled sites. Two principal techniques for this purpose are indicator kriging (IK) and Gaussian Disjunctive Kriging (DK). There are some theoretical reasons to prefer the latter, although it is based on more restrictive assumptions about the variability of the soil properties that are to be mapped. The objective of this study was to compare DK and IK empirically. This was done using a large data set on available phosphorus in the topsoil of a field in Nebraska. A prediction subset of the data (247 points) was extracted and DK and IK were used to estimate, from these data, for each of the remaining (1622) validation data points, the conditional probabilities that available phosphorus was less than or equal to three threshold values. The two techniques were then compared by computing the proportion of the validation sites incorrectly classified, with respect to each threshold, by reference to the conditional probabilities. In fact IK and DK gave very similar results by this criterion. It was concluded that neither of the techniques could be generally recommended in preference to the other. There are practical considerations that could determine the best method to use in any given circumstance and these are summarized in a decision tree.

The adaptation principle is based on incremental active learning and dynamic user modeling. Incremental active learning is used for sketchy stroke classification such that important data can actively be selected to train the classifiers. Dynamic user modeling is used to model the user's sketching style in an incremental decision tree, which is then used to recognize the composite shapes dynamically by means of fuzzy matching.

In this paper, we use ontology model represent user's interests instead of using the conventional Vector Space Model. Each interest concept hierarchy is then interpreted within the Information Theory framework as a probabilistic decision tree. The interest-matching algorithm uses the KL (Kullback-Leiber) distance as a measure of deviation between two probabilistic decision trees. Then we use an interest-based group model to organize the peers with similar interests into a subnet. Our content location solution is on top of the existing Gnutella network. When using our algorithm, called interest-based subnet, a significant amount of flooding can be avoided, making Gnutella a more competitive solution. The extensive simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed model in peer-to-peer system.

Study results led to several observations and recommendations. On average, 60% of carpool vehicles arrived in the carpool lane before the afternoon school dismissal time and spent an average of triple the amount of time of those who arrived shortly after the bell-ring time. Establishing multiple loading bays and staffing each bay with safety patrol to assist loading can greatly reduce vehicle loading and unloading time. The act of loading and unloading students should take less than 10 s per vehicle; the complete process of a vehicle entering, loading and unloading passengers, and then exiting can be completed in less than 45 s. Limiting options for drivers will reduce circumventions that may lead to crashes. If spillage onto adjacent roadways is a problem, a double lane for the queue at some point in the carpool lane is a viable solution. School traffic congestion can be addressed by encouraging a mode shift from private vehicles to school bus transportation, walking, or biking. To convey the study results to school administrators and to illustrate recommendations, a website (www.itre.ncsu.edu/stg) was created; it contains a simple decision tree to assist administrators in identifying the nature of a traffic concern and to provide recommendations for appropriate solutions. It also illustrates schematics of the optimal layout for loading and unloading students, with explanations of the recommended operating procedures and video clips of actual operations.

Frequently, the predictive power of an inductive machine learning environment strongly depends on the way knowledge is represented. When the structure of the problem is not known, knowledge has to be encoded with primitive, atomic features. Constructive induction centers on the automatic generation of higher-level combinations of primitive features with the goal to enhance the predictive accuracy of a machine learning system. This paper centers on the design, implementation, and evaluation of a tool named C5_CI that makes constructive induction available for C5 learning environments. Empirical results are presented that compare the learning performance of C5 with C5_CI for a set of inductive learning benchmarks.

First two features based on motion and color are constructed and extracted from video shots: play field color ratio for specific types of sports, background motion and consistency ratio, then they are combined to generate an 11-dimension shot feature to feed into a C4.5 decision tree for shot classification. Based on our video data sets - the sports news video from the CNN Headline News video used in the TRECVID 2003, 7 predefined video shot classes were defined: 4 types of sports field video (basketball, baseball, ice hockey and golf), and sports news lead-in/lead-out, text, and others. Sports news video segments from 15 half-hour CNN News video were used for the training and testing. A performance of average precision and recall 88%, 82% has been achieved, respectively. The proposed method can be further developed and used to search news video for individual sports news and sports highlights.

The technique generates machine learning models of program properties known to result from errors, and applies these models to program properties of user-written code to classify and rank properties that may lead the user to errors. Given a set of properties produced by the program analysis, the technique selects a subset of properties that are most likely to reveal an error. An implementation, the Fault Invariant Classifier, demonstrates the efficacy of the technique. The implementation uses dynamic invariant detection to generate program properties. It uses support vector machine and decision tree learning tools to classify those properties. In our experimental evaluation, the technique increases the relevance (the concentration of fault-revealing properties) by a factor of 50 on average for the C programs, and 4.8 for the Java programs. Preliminary experience suggests that most of the fault-revealing properties do lead a programmer to an error.

To date, most approaches to constraint satisfaction have focused on solving a problem using some form of backtrack search. Furthermore, the typical view is that a constraint satisfaction problem will be solved only once. However in many real-world contexts, problems are solved repeatedly over time. Also such problems often exhibit some structure. This motivates the application of some form of learning to improve the performance of search from previously discovered solutions. In this paper we present an approach that uses knowledge about known solutions to a problem to improve search. The approach we present is based on a combination of decision tree learning and constraint satisfaction. We demonstrate that significant improvements, almost an order-of-magnitude, in search effort can be achieved using this hybrid approach over traditional search. We also show that the space complexity using this approach is almost negligible. This work is of interest in domains such as product configuration, and interactive constraint solving in general where the system takes the initiative by asking questions.

These are serves for people and use for personal usage. So, we named these robots personal robot. As the possible applications for personal robots increase and involve more complicated environments and tasks, they become to have very complicated kinematics configurations and need more appropriate control architectures. Previous control architectures have fixed and simple configurations that are optimized for specific applications or with limited flexibility. Consequently, they fail to provide the flexibility necessary for various robot kinematical configurations as well as various tasks. To overcome this problem, we proposed a new personal robot platform and task-based control architecture called "Supervised Hybrid Architecture (SHA)". This platform is composed of reconfigurable modules. SHA is based on supervised organization and distributed arbitration of hybrid controls of reconfigurable deliberative and reactive modules. It is composed of upper level hybrid control for high-level intelligence to interact with human and to plan tasks, as well as lower level hybrid control to allow low-level intelligence for prompt reaction in each robot configuration module. Through these double layers of the hybrid controller, we could easily provide the flexibility needed for so many different kinematical configurations and tasks. In this paper, we will show that how organize this architecture and how operate various tasks in SHA. We will design the task manager for SHA.

S	Jung, YG; Lee, DH; Yoon, AS; Kwon, HC			IEEE	Jung, YG; Lee, DH; Yoon, AS; Kwon, HC			Transliteration system for Arabic-numeral expressions using decision tree for intelligent Korean TTS	IECON 2004 - 30TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY, VOL. 1	IEEE Industrial Electronics Society		English	Proceedings Paper	30th Annual Conference of the IEEE-Industrial-Electronics-Society (IECON)	NOV 02-06, 2004	Busan, SOUTH KOREA	IEEE Ind Elect Soc, IEEE				Though there has been much work on TTS technologies and several TTS systems have customized for Korean, current TTS systems output many errors in transliterating nonalphabetic symbols such as Arabic numerals and text symbols. Arabic Numeral Expressions (ANEs) show a high occurrence-frequency and deliver significant senses, especially in scientific or informative documents and texts. This paper proposes TAN (Transliteration system for Arabic-Numeral expressions) which can efficiently disambiguate the meaning and reading of Arabic Numeral Expressions in texts by using a decision tree. For the purpose of analyzing and teaming data, three phases of teaming elements were suggested: patterns of Arabic numerals combined with text symbols, contextual features and heuristic information were classified according to the senses and sounds of ANEs. Our corpus was made up of news articles issued from January 1(st), 2000 to December 31(st), 2001 from 10 major newspapers in Korea. By teaming the three phases of teaming elements, the system shows 97.52% and 97.29% accuracies for the training set and the test set, respectively. This result shows that the accuracy of our system is 9.72% higher than that of a current TTS system for Korean.

Existing methods for building domain-specific Web search engines require human expertise or specific facilities. However, we can build a domain-specific search engine simply by adding domain-specific keywords, called "keyword spices," to the user's input query and forwarding it to a general-purpose Web search engine. Keyword spices can be effectively discovered from Web documents using machine learning technologies. This paper will describe domain-specific Web search engines that use keyword spices for locating recipes, restaurants, and used cars.

However, efficient recognition of the currently active modulation system in real-time is a major problem faced by many applications. In this paper, an efficient method for the recognition of modulation system in a SDR receiver is proposed. The method is a classical two-stage approach based on (i) decision feature extraction and (ii) modulation system classification. In the first stage, decision features are extracted by the use of digital quadrature polyphase filter. In the second stage, an efficient parallel decision algorithm is proposed to classify the active modulation type. This proposed algorithm is proof to be more efficient than the conventional type of decision-tree approach. The complete recognition system is implemented using MATLAB. Simulation result shows that the proposed method achieved good robustness even with the presence of band-limited Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). The overall successful recognition rate of 98.5% can be achieved even at a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 8 dB.

Since the land cover is one of the input parameters for the hydrological model, the critical feature of classification method is to control the classification result using threshold values. The tentative result shows good correlations with existing digital land use map, thou.-h the small overestimation or underestimation are recognized in several categories and the improvement is necessary in discriminating the single cropped agricultural field from natural grassland. The adjustments of the threshold values established in the decision tree would be done by the aid of higher resolution satellite data.

Different levels of knowledge from very large volume of RS data will he applied to RS image classification, so as to improve the efficiency and accuracy of RS image analysis and to establish an intelligent GIS based on RS images. Difficulties in RS images data mining are listed in the paper, and a prototype system of RS image data mining is designed. Besides experiments are made with RSIDMM-DTM, RS image data mining classification model, based on the Microsoft decision tree mining algorithm. By comparison with ERDAS IMAGINE Expert Classifier's effects, the experiments show that the RSIDMM-DTM takes spatial relationships and other contextual information into account. In addition, the acquisition, presentation and application of knowledge are highly automatic, and the classification is rather accurate.

The method solves a series of max-cut problems to hierarchically and recursively partition the set of classes into two-subsets, till pure leaf nodes that have only one class label, are obtained. The SVM is applied at each internal node to construct the discriminant function for a binary meta-class classifier. Because max-cut unsupervised decomposition uses distance measures to investigate the natural class groupings, HSVM has a fast and intuitive SVM training process that requires little tuning and yields both high accuracy levels and good generalization. The HSVM method was applied to Hyperion hyperspectral data collected over the Okavango Delta of Botswana. Classification accuracies and generalization capability are compared to those achieved by the Best Basis Binary Hierarchical Classifier, a Random Forest CART binary decision tree classifier and Binary Hierarchical Support Vector Machines.

Here, the aim is to build vegetation maps using automatic classification. Besides a general linear multi-class classifier (Linear Discriminant Analysis), several strategies for combining binary classifiers are proposed: one based on a hierarchical decision tree, one based on the Hamming distance between the codewords obtained by binary classifiers and one based on the coupling of posterior probabilities. In addition, a new procedure is proposed for spatial classification smoothing. This procedure takes into account spatial information by letting the decision for classification of a pixel depend on the classification probabilities of neighboring pixels. This is shown to render smoother classification images.

However, the execution time of BTGA+ is quite long on large datasets. In this paper. a novel decision tree algorithm, called Binary Tree Genetic Algorithm with Quadtree (BTGA with Quadtree) is proposed by extending BTGA+. In the proposed algorithm. a generalized quadtree is constructed when a new node of a linear decision tree is, created. The proposed algorithm runs faster than BTGA+ on datasets with sufficiently large number of samples. without sacrificing the quality of decision trees constructed by BTGA+.

Due to the overestimation of snow depth in West China (especially, the Tibet Plateau regions), the global retrieval algorithm of snow depth from SSM/I data is modified ground observations in West China region. Both of the global and modified algorithms adopt the negative gradient of brightness temperature at 19 and 37GHz frequencies at horizontal polarization that were generated the snow layer's scattering feature. However, other surface features such as the precipitation, cold desert, frozen ground, may have similar scattering signature to snow cover. Grody's decision tree containing various filters, is used to separate the scattering signature of snow cover from other scattering signature. For the snow cover pixels after the filters technique, we retrieved the snow depth by global and modified algorithms in East and West China, respectively. The retrieval results have been assessed by the MODIS snow products (MODISC1 snow products) with two methods of accuracy assessment, i.e. the overall accuracy and Kappa analysis based on the error matrix. The two snow products agree very well based on the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficients.' Finally, the operational scheme has been performed to obtain the snow depth datasets in China in a complete hydrological year.

We compared the spectrum development between winter wheat and seed rape before, during and after the flowering stage of seed rape. Then, we provide two different classification schemas to discriminate the two crops depend on different image combination. The first one using images between the jointing stage and flowering stage of seed rape, the other one using images between the jointing stage and leguminous stage. At last, we selected two ETM images, on March 8 2001 and April 1 in 2001, to build a decision tree to discriminate seed rape and winter wheat. And the result was compared with that from IKONOS image classification and proved that the discrimination accuracy was 87% high. And the results also told us that discrimination errors were happened in two kinds of regions. One is the regions that crop growing status were very poor, another is that the planting patches were very thin or small.

Because the TM (Thematic Mapper) images of Beijing area during 2003 summer suffered from weather conditions, such as cloud or haze, it is difficult to obtain the satisfying classification with only one kind of remote sensing data. To get the first data of the exact area and spatial distribution of Beijing crops, a perfect classification strategy is designed in this paper. The images of 2003's TM/ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) in comparative better weather conditions, MODIS(Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro radiometer) NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) standard products in 2003 and DEM (Digital Elevation Model) at 30 in spatial resolution of Beijing area are adopted. The classification system for main crops in Beijing is constructed which includes winter wheat, maize, soybean, clover, garden, orchard, etc. Based on the phenological features of the main crops, the different crops extracting plan is constructed respectively. The orchard and vegetable in greenhouse planting information are from the supervised classification with maximum likelihood methods. By means of the decision tree classification function of the ENVI (The Environment for Visualizing Images) software, the winter wheat and clover planting information are extracted by the logic operation algorithm among the 4 NDVI data from the TM/ETM+ images adopted in this paper while the spring maize and soybean are extracted with the logic algorithm with MODIS NDVI. The results indicated that this classification strategy can not only improve the classification precision, but also decrease the post classification work.

Our method, by contrast, attempts to generate classification rules by using an interactive multidimensional data visualization and classification tool, called PolyCluster. PolyCluster is a system that adopts state-of-art algorithms for data visualization and integrates human domain knowledge into the classification rules construction process. By utilizing PolyCluster, users can obtain the visual representation for underlying datasets, and then they may draw polygons to encompass those well-formed clusters. Each polygon with its corresponding projection plane will be saved as a classification rule for later prediction task Preliminary evaluation shows that this new technique is an effective and efficient method compared with previous existed visual-based methods.

This paper gives the formation process from building synthetic database to designing decision tree model, knowledge base to provide some forms of data for extracting LUCC information, there are three aspect data include about: 1 grid data such as remote sensing data TM, SPOT, 2 Ground-measured data such as DEM and 3 thematic Vector data such as land use data and so on. Regularity base consists of all the transformation rules from the source state to the destination of the problem, each dot include at least one rule, the foundation can resolve recognize where change in land area and type. At last, according to the level of complexity of the change of LUCC, it gives two kinds of decision tree models: the classified comparative between single result and the synchronic analysis with multi-temporal images. (1)The classified comparison between single results We take the information extracting for ice changes as an example, and the result is very ideal. (2)The synchronic analysis with multi-temporal images We construct decision tree in Hei bei, the condition include the grey value and the other features such as slope gradient and GIS thematic supported data, the result shows that the biggest change type is that other lands are transferred to the forest.

An object image is an image with object(s). An object in an image is defined as a set of regions located near the center of the image, which has significant color distribution compared with its surrounding (or background) region. We define three measures for the classification based on the characteristics of an object. The center significance is calculated from the difference in color distribution between the center area and its surrounding region. Second measure is the variance of significantly correlated colors in the image plane. Significantly correlated colors are first defined as the colors of two adjacent pixels that appear more frequently around center of an image rather than at the background of the image. The last one is the edge strength at the boundary of the region that is estimated as an object. To classify the images we combine each measure by training the neural network. A test with 900 images shows a classification accuracy of 84.2%. We also compare our result with the performance of several other classifiers, Naive Bayes, Decision Table, and Decision Tree.

The use of an ICA for the preprocessing stage, makes the structure of both classifiers simpler, and therefore improves the generalization properties. The hypothesis behind the proposed preprocessing is that an ICA analysis will transform the feature space into a space where the components are independent, and aligned to the axes and therefore will be more adapted to the way that a decision tree is constructed. Also the inference of the weights of a multilayer perceptron will be much easier because the gradient search in the weight space will follow independent trajectories. The result is that classifiers are less complex and on some databases the error rate is lower. This idea is also applicable to regression.

In propositional learning, the method has been shown to work well when lots of features are available. This certainly is the case in first order learning, especially when aggregate functions, combined with selection conditions on the set to be aggregated, are included in the feature space. In this paper, we introduce a random forest based approach to learning first order theories with aggregates. We experimentally validate and compare several variants: first order random forests without aggregates, with simple aggregates, and with complex aggregates in the feature set.

J	Remeikis, N; Skucas, I; Melninkaite, V				Remeikis, N; Skucas, I; Melninkaite, V			Text categorization using neural networks initialized with decision trees	INFORMATICA			English	Article						text classification; decision trees; neural networks		Text categorization - the assignment of natural language documents to one or more predefined categories based on their semantic content - is an important component in many information organization and management tasks. Performance of neural networks learning is known to be sensitive to the initial weights and architecture. This paper discusses the use multilayer neural network initialization with decision tree classifier for improving text categorization accuracy. Decision tree from root node until a final leave is used for initialization of each single unit. Growing decision trees with increasingly larger amounts of training data will result in larger decision tree sizes. As a result, the neural networks constructed from these decision trees are often larger and more complex than necessary. Appropriate choice of certainly factor is able to produce trees that are essentially constant in size in the face of increasingly larger training sets. Experimental results support the conclusion that error based pruning can be used to produce appropriately sized trees, which are directly mapped to optimal neural network architecture with good accuracy. The experimental evaluation demonstrates this approach provides better classification accuracy with Reuters-21578 corpus, one of the standard benchmarks for text categorization tasks. We present results comparing the accuracy of this approach with multilayer neural network initialized with traditional random method and decision tree classifiers.

In classifying complex patterns with high similarity like these defect patterns, the selection of an optimal feature set and an appropriate recognizer is a pre-requisite to a high recognition rate. In this paper GA and K-means algorithm were used to select a subset of the suitable features at each node in the binary decision tree. The feature subset with maximum fitness is chosen and the patterns are divided into two classes using a linear decision function. This process is repeated at each node until all the patterns are classified into individual classes. In this way, the classifier using the binary decision tree can be constructed automatically, and the final recognizer is implemented by a neural network trained by standard patterns at each node. Experimental results are given to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed scheme.

To construct classifiers of emotions, we used the dialogue data between a humanoid robot, Robovie, and children, which was collected with the WOZ (Wizard of Oz) method. Besides prosodic features extracted from a single utterance, characteristics specific to dialogues such as utterance intervals and differences with previous utterances were also used. We used the SVM (Support Vector Machine) as a classifier to recognize two temporary emotions such as embarrassment or pleasure, and the decision tree learning algorithm, C5.0, as a classifier to recognize persistent emotion, i.e. affinity. The accuracy of classification was 79% for embarrassment, 74% for pleasure, and 87% for affinity. The humanoid Robovie in which this emotion classification module was implemented demonstrated adaptive behaviors based on the emotions it recognized.

This paper proposes a new practical application of data mining in the study of problems related to the Internet performance. Well-predicted performance is a key engineering issue in Internet based processing, e.g. in peer-to-peer systems. The measurements of round-trip-time performed by the traceroute probing technique are used for Internet path performance evaluation. We show how data mining can be used by the end-users to evaluate the performance of the communication path between their location and a specific Internet host in a long-term performance prediction scale. The mining data is mined using the IBM Intelligent Miner for Data system. We discover how the round-trip times of the packets and the number of hops they pass vary with the day of the week and the time of the measurement and use this knowledge to built the decision tree that can be a useful guide to the future characteristics of relevant properties of given Internet path in a long-term scale.

Our aim was two-fold. First, to compare the performance of models built using the above-mentioned techniques and, second, to analyze the characteristics of the input sensitivity in order to better understand the relationship between the performance evaluation process and the actual performance and in this way help improve the performance of call centers.

Application of the standard machine learning techniques for user modeling seems appropriate and effective but they have drawbacks. The need for large labeled data, 'concept drift' concerns due to the dynamic nature of user's features. and computational complexity are the three major problems. Further, the standard machine learning techniques do not handle adequately the inherent incomplete, imprecise and uncertain knowledge about users. The objective of the study is for handling of uncertainty due to imprecision and vagueness in inferring a user's interest.. This study compares the effectiveness of the Neuro-fuzzy modeling approach to artificial neural network, decision tree induction, and the Naive Bayes. The results indicate that the Neuro-fuzzy modeling approach has potential and practical application in handling uncertainty and predicting a user interest in a Web Page and related pages.

While some of data analysis algorithms can work with incomplete data, a large portion of them require complete data. Therefore, different strategies, such as deletion of incomplete examples, and imputation (filling) of missing values through variety of statistical and machine learning (ML) procedures, are developed to preprocess the incomplete data. This study concentrates on performing experimental analysis of several algorithms for imputation of missing values, which range from simple statistical algorithms like mean and hot deck imputation to imputation algorithms that work based on application of inductive ML algorithms. Three major families of ML algorithms, such as probabilistic algorithms (e.g. Naive Bayes), decision tree algorithms (e.g. C4.5), and decision rule algorithms (e.g. CLIP4), are used to implement the ML based imputation algorithms. The analysis is carried out using a comprehensive range of databases, for which missing values were introduced randomly. The goal of this paper is to provide general guidelines on selection of suitable data imputation algorithms based on characteristics of the data. The guidelines are developed by performing a comprehensive experimental comparison of performance of different data imputation algorithms.

Classification accuracy and, by implication, tree structure, are sensitive to changes in the training data. Successful approaches to counteract this effect include multiple classifiers, e.g. boosting, bagging or windowing. The downside of these multiple classification models, however, is the plethora of trees that result, often making it difficult to extract the classifier in a meaningful manner. We show that, by using some very weak knowledge in the sampling stage, when the data set is partitioned into the training and test sets, a more consistent and improved performance is achieved by a single decision tree classifier.

A genetic program is an algorithm that evolves other algorithms or mathematical expressions. Methods of accelerating convergence of the data mining procedure including a new innovation based on computer algebra are examined. Experimental results related to using computer algebra are given. A comparison between a tree obtained using a genetic program and one constructed solely by interviewing experts is made. A genetic program evolved tree is shown to be superior to one created by hand using expertise alone. Finally, additional methods that have been used to validate the data mining algorithm are discussed.

For quantitative evaluation of classification uncertainty, we use an Uncertainty Envelope dealing with the class posterior distribution and a given confidence probability. Counting the classifier outcomes, this technique produces feasible evaluations of the classification uncertainty. Using this technique in our experiments, we found that the Bayesian DT technique is superior to the randomised DT ensemble technique.

Inductive loop detectors are by far the most widely deployed vehicle detectors. In the present work, vehicle reidentification is performed by combining vehicle-specific information (length and electromagnetic signatures) and some contextual information (lane, speed, and time) to form a decision tree. This approach provides a specific decision tree for tracking vehicles along each highway section. After training, the decision tree successfully classified about 95% of the unseen test records-a significant improvement relative to the literature and our own previous work on the same data. This success rate has been consistently obtained from two data sets: one consisting only of passenger vehicles and another consisting of a representative traffic mix.

We record runtime properties of each request and apply automated machine learning and data mining techniques to identify the causes of failures. We train decision trees on the request traces from time periods in which user-visible failures are present. Paths through the tree are ranked according to their degree of correlation with failure, and nodes are merged according to the observed partial order of system components. We evaluate this approach using actual failures from eBay, and find that, among hundreds of potential causes, the algorithm successfully identifies 13 out of 14 true causes of failure, along with 2 false positives. We discuss some results in applying simplified decision trees on eBay's production site for several months. In addition, we give a cost-benefit analysis of manual vs. automated diagnosis systems. Our contributions include the statistical learning approach, the adaptation of decision trees to the context of failure diagnosis, and the deployment and evaluation of our tools on a high-volume production service.

This paper describes how systems can automatically learn to classify the properties of files (e.g., read-only access pattern, short-lived, small in size) and predict the properties of new files, as they are created, by exploiting the strong associations between a file's properties and the names and attributes assigned to it. These associations exist, strongly but differently, in each of four real NFS environments studied. Decision tree classifiers can automatically identify and model such associations, providing prediction accuracies that often exceed 90%. Such predictions can be used to select storage policies (e.g., disk allocation schemes and replication factors) for individual files. Further changes in associations can expose information about applications, helping autonomic system components distinguish growth from fundamental change.

This goal is achieved by integrating these algorithms within a Database Management System. We are thus only limited by disk capacity, and not by available main memory. However, the disk accesses that are necessary to scan the database induce long response times. Hence, we propose an original method to reduce the size of the learning set by building its contingency table. The machine learning algorithms are then adapted to operate on this contingency table. In order to validate our approach, we implemented the ID3 decision tree construction method and showed that using the contingency table helped us obtaining response times equivalent to those of classical, in-memory software.

In the recently published (Dutch) Handbook on LCA, economic allocation is advised as baseline method for most allocation situations in a detailed LCA Although the Handbook on LCA aimed to provide a 'cookbook' with operational guidelines for conducting each step of an LCA, this was not completely achieved for the allocation step. The guidelines for allocation largely remained at the level of principles. This restricted elaboration of economic allocation may hamper application in practice. Therefore, this paper elaborates some examples applying economic allocation. Method. Two concepts are of particular importance when applying economic allocation: functional flow and multi-functional process. The definitions of these concepts are presented and discussed. The basic principle of economic allocation is that having determined the various functional flows of a multi-functional process, all other flows need to be allocated to these functional flows according to their shares in the total proceeds. Proceeds are based on prices and these are not always easy to determine for a process. A summary of possible solutions for different problems when determining prices is given. Results and Discussion. The examples presented focus on co-production and various recycling situations. All examples are hypothetical in order to avoid discussions on the data. The examples show that the prices of the functional flows determine the allocation results. It is of importance to have correct information on the relative prices of the functional flows at stake, especially whether they are negative or positive. Learning from these examples, we establish a decision tree for economic allocation. The decision tree is meant for identifying and handling multi-functionality situations starting from a defined (product) system. This decision tree is with minor adaptations also applicable to other allocation methods and has a more general value than for the economic allocation method only. Conclusions and perspective. The examples have helped us to establish a decision tree for handling the multi-functionality problem by economic allocation. The examples can be broadened to other materials and allocation situations.

The EU 5(th) framework project OMNIITOX will develop models calculating characterisation factors for assessing the potential toxic impacts of chemicals within the framework of LCA. These models will become accessible through a web-based information system. The key objective of the OMNIITOX project is to increase the coverage of substances by such models. In order to reach this objective, simpler models which need less but available data, will have to be developed while maintaining scientific quality. Methods. Experience within the OMNIITOX project has taught that data availability and quality are crucial issues for calculating characterisation factors. Data availability determines whether calculating characterisation factors is possible at all, whereas data quality determines to what extent the resulting characterisation factors are reliable. Today, there is insufficient knowledge and/or resources to have high data availability as well as high data quality and high model quality at the same time. Results. The OMNIITOX project is developing two inter-related models in order to be able to provide LCA impact assessment characterisation factors for toxic releases for as broad a range of chemicals as possible: 1) A base model representing a state-of-the-art multimedia model and 2) a simple model derived from the base model using statistical tools. Discussion. A preliminary decision tree for using the OMNIITOX information system (IS) is presented. The decision tree aims to illustrate how the OMNIITOX IS can assist an LCA practitioner in finding or deriving characterisation factors for use in life cycle impact assessment of toxic releases. Conclusions and Outlook. Data availability and quality are crucial issues when calculating characterisation factors for the toxicity impact categories. The OMNIITOX project is developing a tiered model approach for this. It is foreseen that a first version of the base model will be ready in late summer of 2004, whereas a first version of the simple base model is expected a few months later.

The data mining system makes use of the decision tree algorithm and classification model in exploring the meaningful information, which is useful in the process of decision making. Subsequently, the rules discovered by the data mining system are expressed through the rule based knowledge presentation method of the expert system. The intelligent CIM system is applied to semiconductor packing factories and also point at the great fluctuation of DRAM (dynamic random access memory) prices. The results of this paper are the product yield, the manufacturing cycle time and the frequency of holding lot, which have been improved. The contribution can increase business competitiveness, reduce production cost, and promote the rate of available promise for order.

The approach is inductive and the models have to be predictive and executable. The data is gathered through the online logistical benchmarking tool Webscan. This tool has been set up last year and is aimed to SME's to measure their logistical performances. At the very moment we limited our research to build decision trees using the c4.5 programs from Quinlan. C4.5 is based on the Information Theory and the algorithm uses the Gain criterion i.e. the attribute with the highest information gain is selected. In order to meet the key requirements for this inductive approach the benchmarking data has been transformed and restructured. A decision tree is built by decision nodes, branches and leafs. As a result the branches and the decision nodes produce the required knowledge expressed by the leafs, i.e. branches and nodes indicate which best practices to apply in order to become Best-in-Class in one particular part of the supply chain.

In firms, R&D and innovation via patents (or trade marks) can increase firm productivity as well as labor and capital services. Most IPRs are subject to at least decisions regarding licensing and sale. However, patents subject to particularly wide range of decisions both whilst they are being applied for and following grant. Patents thus involve both a high degree of flexibility in how they are managed and also a high degree of uncertainty as eventual value. As to a firm, making decision about patents during the application process, on renewal and for licensing, purchase and sale negotiations needs assessing the value of patents. At each stage of the application procedure the potential future benefits of continuing the application have to be balanced against the cost proceeding to the next stage. However, the cost can vary considerably in practice and the distribution of them over the various stages of the application procedure can vary too. Needless to say professional fees can considerably add to the initial official cost of applications and these also need to be taken in to account. On the revenue side there are, extra profits and licensing revenue due to holding a patent be available over the life of the patent. Current practice in patent valuations are reviewed as is relevant literature gathered from number of fields including accounting methods, discounted cash flow (DCF), related decision tree analysis (DTA) methods, and econometric methods based on renewal data. This paper tries to analysis the process of firm's decisions about patents from the point of the valuation of patents. Then a series of methods must be introduced and developed based on the cost/benefit analysis. This abstract is a start, and a lot of work must to be done in the future research, which involves challenge and chances.

J	Jung, F				Jung, F			Detecting building changes from multitemporal aerial stereopairs	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						change detection; classification; object recognition; digital elevation model; decision trees	RECONSTRUCTION; IMAGERY	Our goal is to detect changes in an aerial scene by comparing grey scale stereopairs taken several years apart in order to update a geographic database. A set of image locations that have a high likelihood to contain changes will be submitted to a human operator who will either reject the proposed change or validate it and update the database accordingly. We are mainly interested in changes in buildings. To isolate new construction and buildings, which disappear, we provide an algorithm that works in two steps. First, during a focusing phase, we eliminate a large part of the scene without losing any actual changes by comparing a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for the two dates. Second, we classify the resulting regions of interest (ROI) based on four images-stereopairs of the area at the two dates. To decide whether or not the ROI contains a change, we classify each of the four images as "building" or "no-building". This classifier is a combination of several decision trees induced from training data. Each node of each decision tree is identified with a graph of features which is more likely to occur on buildings than background. Finally, the classification results at the two different dates are compared. The final set of locations submitted to an operator omits less than 10% of the true changes. The false positive rate represents less than 5% of the scene surface. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

They frequently rely on signature matching detection method and focus on the security of low level network protocols. Because of the large number of false positives from one side, and the incapacity to detect some attack types from another side, IDS must allow more interest to the monitoring of application level protocols. We propose in this paper a combination of pattern matching and protocol analysis approaches. While the first method of detection relies on a multi pattern matching strategy, the second one benefits from an efficient decision tree adaptative to the network traffic characteristics.

We consider the classification task in two domains: Breast tumors and skin lesions. Classifier outputs are used as a basis for computing beliefs. Dynamic uncertainty assessment is based on class differentiation. We combine the beliefs of three classifiers: k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Naive Bayesian and Decision Tree. Dempster's rule of combination combines three beliefs to arrive at one final decision. Our experiments with k-fold cross validation show that the nature of the data set has a bigger impact on some classifiers than others and the classification based on combined belief shows better overall accuracy than any individual classifier. We compare the performance of Dempster's combination (with differentiation-based uncertainty assignment) with those of performance-based linear and majority vote combination models. We study the circumstances under which the evidence combination approach improves classification.

Using a heuristic-based local serach, DT induction appends attribute at a time to rules in the order of goodness. This method may eliminate some typical structures that several attributes collectively determine the class. Recently, there has been growing interest in the problem of discovering functional dependencies (FDs) from existing databases [2,3,6,8]. Some efficient and scalable algorithms have been proposed. In this paper, we present a new method to build a DT classifier using approximate FDs [3]. The new method is different from the traditional ways of building DTs in that it searches composite attributes for individual node of a DT which leads to substantially smaller and more understandable DTs without adversely affecting the accuracy gains. Experiments showed that the new method not only builds more accurate classifiers, but also does this with more compact structures.

Simulated data, with a pre-specified structure, were "bagged" with the results presented using five graphical tools that recreated (and/or portrayed) the known data structures captured by the bagging algorithm. Then the same methodology was generalized to a structurally unknown, virgin (survey) data set. Results of the research are that five visual aids tools were examined (two of which are new approaches) and found to be useful for making action oriented interpretations from e.g, web-survey data.

The models obtained by all three methodologies were estimated; then validated on the same hold-out sample, and their performance is compared. There is an evident significant difference among the best neural network model, decision tree model, and logistic regression model. The most successful neural network model was obtained by the probabilistic algorithm. The best model extracted the most important features for small business credit scoring from the observed data.

We present a new hybrid error concealment algorithm, relying on temporal and spatial concealment. This algorithm includes consideration of the spatial and temporal activity in the surrounding of a lost block, and introduces four thresholds, which lead to choosing the suitable concealment scheme for each block.

With this knowledge of driver's workload, the in-vehicle information systems (IVIS) can provide information when the driver has the spare capacity to receive and comprehend it, which is both effective and efficient. However, after years of study, it is still difficult to build a robust DWE system. In this paper, we analyze the difficulties facing the existing methodology of developing DWE systems and propose a machine-learning-based DWE development process. Some preliminary but promising results are reported using a popular machine-learning method, decision tree.

The predictive performances of these eight models were subsequently compared using an 88 COX-2 inhibitor test set. Each ligand is described by 52 2D descriptors expressed as van der Waals Surface Areas (P_VSA) and its COX-2 binding IC50. One of our best predictive models is the neural network model (BRANN), which is able to select a subset, from the 88 ligand test set, that contains 94% COX-2 active inhibitors (PIC50 > 7.5) and detects 71% of all the actives. We then introduce a QSAR consensus prediction protocol that is shown to be more predictive than any single QSAR model: our C3 consensus approach is able to select a subset from the 88 ligand test set that contains 94% active inhibitors and 83% of all the actives. The 2D QSAR consensus protocol was finally applied to the high-throughput virtual screening of the NCI database, containing 193 477 organic compounds.

The purpose of this study was to determine the added value of the new ACS algorithm in assisting ED physicians to obtain a more accurate diagnosis in patients with ACS. The new algorithm combines a rule-based decision tree, which uses well-known clinical criteria and a data-centered neural network model for more robust pattern recognition. Input parameters of the neural network model consist of morphology features of derived Frank X, Y, Z waveforms and the patient's gender and age. The neural network model was trained with electrocardiograms obtained from documented acute myocardial infarction patients at the Mayo Clinic who were a part of a research ACS database, which includes electrocardiograms (ECGs) of more than 5,000 individuals at hospital admission (1(st) ECG in the ED). The test set portion of the study was conducted in 2 steps: 1) One emergency physician and 1 cardiologist classified 1,902 clinically correlated out-of-hospital ECGs without seeing the interpretation statement from the algorithm into 1 of the following categories: 1) acute myocardial infarction, acute ischemia, or nonischemic; 2) After 9 months, the same 2 physicians classified the same group of ECGs but with the interpretation statement of the algorithm printed on the tracing. The results demonstrated that with the assistance of the new algorithm, the emergency physician and cardiologist improved their sensitivity of interpreting acute myocardial infarction by 50% and 26%, respectively, without a loss of specificity. The new algorithm also improved the emergency physician's acute ischemia interpretation sensitivity by 53% and still maintained a reasonable specificity (91%). The new ACS algorithm provides added value for improving acute ischemia and infarction detection in the ED.

For the evaluation of genetic risk factors of multifactorial diseases, it is not sufficient to focus on individual SNPs. It is preferable to evaluate combinations of multiple markers, because it allows Lis to examine the interactions between multiple factors. If all the combinations possible were evaluated round-robin, the number of calculations would rapidly explode as the number of markers analyzed increased. To overcome this limitation, we devised the exact tree method based on decision tree analysis and applied it to 14 SNP data from 68 Japanese stroke patients and 189 healthy controls. From the obtained tree models, we succeeded in extracting multiple statistically significant combinations that elevate the risk of stroke. From this result, we inferred that this method would work more efficiently in the whole genome study, which handles thousands of genetic markers. This exploratory data mining method will facilitate the extraction of combinations from large-scale genetic data and provide a good foothold for further verificatory research.

When an environment is changed to another, relearning is needed in order to acquire an appropriate policy in the new environment. In order to reduce relearning costs, an algorithm has been proposed to estimate failing states using a decision tree C4.5, and it relearns new policies only for the estimated failing states in the new environment. We try to reduce failing states furthermore by applying successful policies to the estimated failing states. Computer simulations show that our method can reduce relearning costs and improve the successful rate in reinforcement learning.

In this paper we explore the use of a machine learning method based on decision trees using CART for verifying clinically established diagnostic criteria and also for seeking new criteria in different autopsy-confirmed Parkinsonian disorders. Since differentiating various types of Parkinsonian disorders can often present great difficulties due to the overlapping of clinical signs and symptoms, we present a strategy for extracting additional attributes from our database. From the clinical point of view, we obtained interesting results that confirm the importance of already established diagnostic criteria, but we also found some attributes (signs and symptoms) which deserve closer clinical observation. The compatibility of results obtained by our method with those from already established clinical criteria speaks in favor of the validity of the method.

In particular, we explore the application of decision tree learning methods to the classification of spatial datasets. Spatial datasets, according to the Geographic Information System approach, are represented as stack of layers, where each layer is associated with an attribute. We propose an ID3-like algorithm based on an entropy measure, weighted on a specific spatial relation (i.e. overlap). We describe an application of the algorithm to the classification of geographical areas for agricultural purposes.

Such networks of RCP deteriorate with time due to internal corrosion (Peter-Lazar 2000). Due to the low O-2 - content of aggressive water, a slow corrosion speed is expected for such applications. If the RCP in these networks are not periodically replaced, they will eventually fail. Strategies for replacement for these pipes depend on (1) the risks associated with failure of a water distribution network, and (2) the costs associated with replacing the pipes, including the cost of removing existing pipes, the cost of the new pipes and the cost of service interruption of there is any temporary closure (Luong 2002). Due to the lack of statistical data in regards with RCP failure, the development of a risk-based replacement strategy is not an easy task. This paper gives an example of how predictive models of the deterioration of RCP and the consequences of failure can be used to develop risk-based replacement strategies for RCP networks. Replacement strategies are determined for a series network consisting of 251 RCP. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a theoretical approach based on (1) the results of a reliability study, the use of (2) random drawing (binomial law) and (3) the decision tree method to determine optimal replacement strategy.

Because these queries are executed often, the trade-off between meta-calling and compiling & running them has been in favor of the latter, as compiled code is faster. This paper presents a technique named control flow compilation, which improves the compilation time of the queries by an order of magnitude without reducing the performance of executing the queries. We exploit the technique further by using it in a just-in-time manner. This improves performance in two ways: it opens the way to incremental compilation of the generated queries, and also gives potentially large gains by never compiling dynamically unreachable code. Both the implementation of (lazy) control flow compilation and its experimental evaluation in a real world application are reported on.

Prior to this study, defect detection by human inspectors. Unfortunately, the time involved is performed in the inspection procedure was far too long and the missclassification rate too high. Our project consists in detecting anomalies under manufacturer production and cost constraints as well as in classifying the anomalies among twenty listed categories. Manufacturer's specifications require a minimum of ten inspections per second without a decrease in the quality of the produced parts. This problem can be solved with a classification system relying on a real-time machine vision. To fulfill both real time and quality constraints, two classification algorithms and a tree based classification method were compared. The first one. Hyperrectangle based, has proved to be well adapted for real-time constraints. The second one, based on Support Vector Machine (SVM), is more robust, more complex and more greedy regarding the computing time. Finally, naive rules were defined, to build a decision tree and to combine it with one of the previous classification algorithms.

In a modified version of SVMs, called Least Squares SVM classifiers (LS-SVMs), a least squares cost function is proposed so as to obtain a linear set of equations in the dual space. While the SVM classifier has a large margin interpretation, the LS-SVM formulation is related in this paper to a ridge regression approach for classification with binary targets and to Fisher's linear discriminant analysis in the feature space. Multiclass categorization problems are represented by a set of binary classifiers using different output coding schemes. While regularization is used to control the effective number of parameters of the LS-SVM classifier, the sparseness property of SVMs is lost due to the choice of the 2-norm. Sparseness can be imposed in a second stage by gradually pruning the support value spectrum and optimizing the hyperparameters during the sparse approximation procedure. In this paper, twenty public domain benchmark datasets are used to evaluate the test set performance of LS-SVM classifiers with linear, polynomial and radial basis function (RBF) kernels. Both the SVM and LS-SVM classifier with RBF kernel in combination with standard cross-validation procedures for hyperparameter selection achieve comparable test set performances. These SVM and LS-SVM performances are consistently very good when compared to a variety of methods described in the literature including decision tree based algorithms, statistical algorithms and instance based learning methods. We show on ten UCI datasets that the LS-SVM sparse approximation procedure can be successfully applied.

When the data are numerical, we compute the distance of a case from the decision surface. This distance measures the sensitivity of the result to a change in the input data. With a different distance it is also possible to measure the sensitivity of the result to small changes in the tree. The distance from the decision surface can also be combined to the error rate in order to provide a context-dependent information to the end-user.

However, many real-world domains may contain several objectives each characterized by its own set of labels. Though one may induce a separate model for each objective, there are several reasons to prefer a shared multi-objective model over a collection of single-objective models. We present a novel, greedy algorithm, which builds a shared classification model in the form of an ordered (oblivious) decision tree called Multi-Objective Info-Fuzzy Network (M-IFN). We compare the M-IFN structure to Shared Binary Decision Diagrams and bloomy decision trees and study the information-theoretic properties of the proposed algorithm. These properties are further supported by the results of empirical experiments, where we evaluate M-IFN performance in terms of accuracy and readability on realworld multi-objective tasks from several domains.

In many applications, however, a ranking based on class probabilities is desired. For example, a ranking of customers in terms of the likelihood that they buy one's products is useful in direct marketing. What is the general performance of naive Bayes in ranking? In this paper, we study it by both empirical experiments and theoretical analysis. Our experiments show that naive Bayes outperforms C4.4, the most state-of-the-art decision-tree algorithm for ranking. We study two example problems that have been used in analyzing the performance of naive Bayes in classification [3]. Surprisingly, naive Bayes performs perfectly on them in ranking, even though it does not in classification. Finally, we present and prove a sufficient condition for the optimality of naive Bayes in ranking.

In many applications, however, a probability estimation tree (PET) with accurate probability estimates is desirable. Some researchers ascribe the poor probability estimates of decision trees to the decision tree learning algorithms. To our observation, however, the representation also plays an important role. Indeed, the representation of decision trees is fully expressive theoretically, but it is often impractical to learn such a representation with accurate probability estimates from limited training data. In this paper, we extend decision trees to represent a joint distribution and conditional independence, called conditional independence trees (CITrees), which is a more suitable model for PETs. We propose a novel algorithm for learning CITrees, and our experiments show that the CITree algorithm outperforms C4.5 and naive Bayes significantly in classification accuracy.

To determine whether a PM strategy is more cost-effective than a conventional maintenance strategy, various technical and economic analyses were carried out. Currently, most agencies have limited information on the cost-effectiveness (CE) and long-term performance of PM strategies, so it is difficult to determine when and where these treatments should be used. The use of PM treatments based on a CE calculation and analysis is examined, and a decision tree (including treatments and strategies) is developed for each functional pavement class of the Ontario road network. Pavement data from the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario are used to perform a CE calculation for each suggested PM treatment and strategy. On the basis of a comparison and analysis of CE calculation results, guidance is provided on the right treatment, time, and strategy cost level for each functional pavement PM program within the Ontario environment. The results are summarized in the form of a decision tree.

Option decision tree (ODT), based on the characters of financial options, is used to make up for NPV shortages. Option decision tree method embedded real option thinking takes the value of uncertainty environment into account. Taking advantage of option decision tree, the paper has given respectively the real option value of the varied decisions by adopting different option pricing,formulations (B-S, McDonald and Siegel). This paper has given further discusses of the magnitude and the influence of uncertainty in making decision. Comparing the results of option decision tree evaluation with that of traditional methods, finally, this paper concludes that the option decision tree method considers the uncertainty value and chooses the maximum value of project according to the value of different contingent claims, and then make one invest more effectively and scientifically.

In this paper, mass identification and segmentation methods are discussed in brief Fuzzy region-growing techniques are applied to effectively segment the tumour candidate from surrounding breast tissue. Boundary extraction is implemented using a unit vector rotating about the mass core. The focus of this work is on the feature extraction and classification processes. Important information relating to the malignancy of a mass may be derived from its morphological properties. Mass shape and boundary roughness are primary features used in this research to discriminate between the two types of lesions. A subset from thirteen shape descriptors is input to a binary decision tree classifier that provides a final diagnosis of tumour malignancy. Features that combine to produce the most accurate result in distinguishing between malignant and benign lesions include: spiculation index, zero crossings, boundary roughness index and area-to-perimeter ratio. Using this method, a classification result of high sensitivity and specificity is achieved, with false-positive and false-negative rates of 9.3% and 0% respectively.

Quantitative analysis of these and other parameters from ventriculograms is infrequently performed due to the expense of manual segmentation. We present a method for semi-automatic segmentation of ventriculograms based on a two-stage boosted decision-tree pixel classifier. The classifier determines which pixels are inside the ventricle at key end-diastole and end-systole frames. The classifier is semi-automatic, requiring a user to select 3 points in each frame: the endpoints of the aortic valve and the apex. The classifier uses about 90 feature images, computed from the raw ventriculogram image frames, including simple per pixel gray-level statistics (e.g. median brightness) and image geometry (e.g. coordinates relative to user supplied 3 points). Border pixels are determined from segmented images using dilation and erosion. A curve is then fit to the border pixels, minimizing a penalty function that trades off fidelity to the border pixels with smoothness. Volumes and ejection fraction are estimated from border curves using standard area-length formulas. On independent test data, the differences between automatic and manual volumes (and ejection fractions) are similar in size to the differences between two human observers.

We describe a method of knowledge specification based on a structured and systematic analysis of text allowing detailed specification of a decision tree. We use decision tables to validate the decision algorithm and decision trees to specify and represent this algorithm, along with elementary messages of recommendation. Edition tools are also necessary to facilitate the process of validation and workflow between expert physicians who will validate the specified knowledge and computer scientist who will encode the specified knowledge in a guideline model. Applied to eleven different guidelines issued by an official agency, the method allows a quick and valid computerization and integration in a larger decision support system called EsPeR (Personalized Estimate of Risks). The quality of the text guidelines is however still to be developed further. The method used for computerization could help to define a framework usable at the initial step of guideline development in order to produce guidelines ready for electronic implementation.

One reason comes from the difficulty to synchronize a patient's therapeutic history with the guideline-based sequence of treatments. We represent guideline knowledge as a two-level decision tree, a clinical level describing theoretical clinical situations and a therapeutic level formalizing the different steps of corresponding recommended therapeutic strategies. Guideline-based strategies are first represented as bidimensional matrices structured in lines of therapy and levels of therapeutic intention. A revised version introducing levels of therapeutic combination is then developed The therapeutic level is operationalized for any patient therapeutic history to provide the next best step of treatment. Evaluated on actual patient records, our system proved to impact physicians' decisions in 78% of the cases and led to a significant improvement of their compliance with recommendations.

By using data mining methods, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the most important criteria for predicting patient survival and to profile patients to estimate their survival chances together with the most appropriate technique for health care. METHODS: Five hundred and thirty three patients who had suffered from cardiac arrest were included in the analysis. We performed classical statistical analysis and data mining analysis using mainly Bayesian networks. RESULTS: The mean age of the 533 patients was 63 ( 17) and the sample was composed of 390 (73 %) men and 143 (27 %) women. Cardiac arrest was observed at home for 411 (77 %) patients, in a public place for 62 (12 %) patients and on a public highway for 60 (11 %) patients. The belief network of the variables showed that the probability of remaining alive after heart failure is directly associated to five variables: age, sex, the initial cardiac rhythm, the origin of the heart failure and specialized resuscitation techniques employed. CONCLUSIONS: Data mining methods could help clinicians to predict the survival of patients and then adapt their practices accordingly. This work could be carried out for each medical procedure or medical problem and it would become possible to build a decision tree rapidly with the data of a service or a physician. The comparison between classic analysis and data mining analysis showed us the contribution of the data mining method for sorting variables and quickly conclude on the importance or the impact of the data and variables on the criterion of the study. The main limit of the method is knowledge acquisition and the necessity to gather sufficient data to produce a relevant model.

Decision trees are one of the most frequently occurring knowledge representation schemes used in classification algorithms. Decision trees can offer a more practical way of capturing knowledge than coding rules in more conventional languages. Decision trees are generally constructed by means of a top down growth procedure, which starts from the root node and greedily chooses a split of the data that maximizes some cost function. The order, in which attributes are chosen, according to the cost function, determines how efficient the decision tree is. Gain, Gain ratio, Gini and Twoing are some of the most famous splitting criteria used in calculating the cost function. In this paper, we propose a new splitting criterion, namely the False-Positives criterion. The key idea behind the False-Positives criterion is to consider the instances having the most frequent class value, with respect to a certain attribute value, as true-positives and all the instances having the rest class values, with respect to that attribute value, as false positives. We present extensive empirical tests, which demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed criterion.

Besides its hierarchical structure, the latter has the following characteristics: i) a closed set of pre-determined acceptable answers is associated to every question, and ii) the questionnaire should return a certain numerical outcome based on the answers, each of these being associated with a numerical weight. The model uses a program called a results generator, which generates all possible results; thus the requirement to have a finite number of possible answers. The generator transforms the questionnaire into a mega-decision tree to process every possible result from which we derive a curve. From that curve (a depiction of a mathematical function), we propose a way to interpret the results. The model is applied to a real-life computerized hierarchical questionnaire to demonstrate its capabilities.
