This process reduces the computation time at the output layer of the RBFNN by neglecting the ineffective RBFY and also it reduces the false recognition rate of the system. The centers of the different RBFs are identified by a modified version of the conventional k-means algorithm. A knowledge-based approach and point symmetry distance as similarity, measure have been used in this algorithm to identify the centers of different PBFs of the network. The proposed method has been tested on both the simulated and real patient magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) images of the human brain and found to be better when compared with tire approaches using the k-means, fuzzy c-means (FCM), and RBF-NN using conventional k-means algorithm to model the hidden layer neurons.

After object was clustered, we can carry on further analysis to the characteristic of each cluster. Now the most common used clustering algorithm like PAM and k-means are all calculate the Euclidean distance between the object and the central point of cluster as the clustering association rules. This thesis aims at to each item in the transactional databases, view it as the object of clustering, and make the most similar itemsets into the same cluster. We proposed a PAM clustering algorithm on basis of the xor and the shift Boolean computation, and experiment shows that it is more efficient than the algorithm with calculate the distance.

Several relevant and interdependent factors may influence TV viewers' behavior. In this work we focus on the time factor and derive Temporal Patterns of TV watching, based on panel data. Clustering base attributes are originated from 1440 binary minute-related attributes, capturing the TV watching status (watch/not watch). Since there are around 2500 panel viewers a data reduction procedure is first performed. K-Means algorithm is used to obtain daily clusters of viewers. Weekly patterns are then derived which rely on daily patterns. The obtained solutions are tested for consistency and stability. Temporal TV watching patterns provide new insights concerning Portuguese TV viewers' behavior.

However, its shortcomings such as over-segmentation and sensitivity to noise often make it unsuitable as an automatic tool for segmenting medical images. Utilizing prior shape knowledge has been demonstrated to improve robustness of medical image segmentation algorithms. In this paper we propose a novel method for incorporating prior shape and appearance knowledge into watershed segmentation. Our method is based on iteratively aligning a shape-histogram with the result of an improved k-means clustering algorithm. No human interaction is needed in the whole process. We demonstrate the robustness of our method through segmenting the corpora callosa from a set of 51 brain magnetic resonance (MR) images. Numerical validation of the results is provided.

The sample comprised 102 elite athletes divided into three groups: aerobic, mixed and anaerobic (original clusters). The testing encompassed morphological, motor and functional parameters (VO2max exhaustion treadmill test). Discriminant analysis of the original clusters, k-means clustering, and discriminant analysis of the obtained clusters were performed. Original clusters did differ from each other (significant morphology and aerobic capacity functions) but cluster analysis showed mixing of the subjects between obtained clusters and pointed to the entities that differed from others in their group but still performed well in competitions. It meant that the years of specific training did not alter in a large extent, some of their cardio-respiratory characteristic, which could be explained by heritage. The evaluation of the athletes made strictly according to the results of functional testing should be avoided because in some athletes who developed compensatory mechanisms it could underestimate their potential.

In recent years, how to perform the learning performance assessment is a critical issue in the web-based learning field. The traditional summative evaluation can be applied to evaluate the learning performance both for the conventional classroom learning and web-based learning. However, it only considers final learning outcomes without considering the learning progress of learners. This paper proposes a learning performance assessment approach which combines four computational intelligence theories including grey relational analysis, K-means clustering method, fuzzy association rule mining and fuzzy inference to perform this task based on the learning portfolio of individual learner. Experimental results indicate that the evaluation result of proposed method is positive relevance with those of summative assessment. Namely, this method can help teachers to precisely perform the formative assessment for individual learner utilizing only the learning portfolio in web-based learning environment.

The CLA-EC is a model obtained by combining the concepts of cellular learning automata and evolutionary algorithms. The CLA-EC is used to search for cluster centers in such a way that minimizes the squared-error criterion. The simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm produces clusters with acceptable quality with respect to squared-error criteria and provides a performance that is significantly superior to that of the K-means algorithm.

In this article, a recent metaheuristic technique, the noising method, is introduced to explore the proper clustering of data sets under the criterion of minimum sum of squares clustering. Meanwhile, K-means algorithm as a local improvement operation is integrated into the noising method to improve the performance of the clustering algorithm. Extensive computer simulations show that the proposed approach is feasible and effective.

It uses frequent term sets to cluster texts. First, it extracts useful information from documents and inserts into databases. Then, it uses the Apriori algorithm based on association rules mining efficiently to discover the frequent items sets. Finally, it clusters the documents according to the frequent words in subsets of the frequent term sets. This algorithm can reduce the dimension of the text data efficiently for very large databases, thus it can improve the accuracy and speed of the clustering algorithm. The results of clustering texts by the FTSC algorithm cannot reflect 14 the overlap of texts' classes. Based on the FTSC algorithm, an improved algorithm-Frequent Term Set-based Hierarchical Clustering algorithm (FTSHC) is given. This algorithm can determine the overlap of texts' classes by the overlap of the frequent words sets, and provide an understandable description of the discovered clusters by the frequent terms sets. The FTSC, FTSHC and K-Means algorithms are evaluated quantitatively by experiments. The results of the experiments prove that FTSC and FTSHC algorithms are more efficient than K-Means algorithm in the performance of clustering.

In this paper, we apply ICA to transform multivariate time series data into independent components (ICs), and then propose a clustering algorithm called ICACLUS to group underlying data series according to the ICs found. This clustering algorithm can be used to identify stocks with similar stock price movement. The experiments show that this method is effective and efficient, which also outperforms other comparable clustering methods, such as K-means.

Of the four methods -- Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), Document Frequency (DF) and Random Projection (RP) -- ICA and LSI are clearly superior when the k-means clustering algorithm is applied, irrespective of the data sets. Random projection consistently returns the worst results, where this appears to be due to the noise distribution characterizing the document clustering task.

Firstly, it uses the variances and covariancs on the wavelet coefficients of different color channels as color textural features to characterize text and non-text areas. Secondly, the k-means algorithm is chosen to classify the image into text candidates and background. Finally, the detected text candidates undergo the empirical rules analysis to identify text areas and project profile analysis to refine their localization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach could efficiently be used as an automatic text detection system, which is robust for font-size, font-color, background complexity and language.

So far there have existed many cluster analysis approaches such as partitioning method, density-based, k-means, k-nearest neighborhood, etc. Recently, some researchers have explored a few kernel-based clustering methods, e.g., kernel-based K-means clustering. The new algorithms have demonstrated some advantages. So it's needed to explore the basic principle underlain the algorithms such as whether the kernel function transformation can increase the separability of the input data in clustering and how to use the principle to construct new clustering methods. In this paper, we will discuss the problems.

The method is based on a new subspace clustering algorithm that automatically calculates the feature weights in the k-means clustering process. In clustering sparse text data the feature weights are used to discover clusters from subspaces of the document vector space and identify key words that represent the semantics of the clusters. We present a modification of the published algorithm to solve the sparsity problem that occurs in text clustering. Experimental results on real-world text data have shown that the new method outperformed the Standard KMeans and Bisection-KMeans algorithms, while still maintaining efficiency of the k-means clustering process.

The proposed method first utilizes the K-means algorithm to decompose a detected text block into different binary image layers. Then an effective post-processing is followed to eliminate background residues in each layer. In this step we develop a group of robust constraints to characterize general text regions based on color, edge and stroke thickness. We also propose the components relation constraint (CRC) designed specifically for Chinese characters. Finally the text image layer is identified based on the periodical and symmetrical layout of text lines. The experimental results show that our method can effectively eliminate a wide range of background residues, and has a better performance than the K-means method, as well as a high speed.

One of the challenges in modern multimedia system is to classify and retrieve certain kinds of audio from the database. This paper proposes a novel classification algorithm for a content-based audio retrieval. The algorithm, called Gradient-Based Fuzzy c-Means Algorithm with Divergence Measure (GBFCM(DM)), is a neural network-based algorithm which utilizes the Divergence Measure to exploit the statistical nature of the audio data to improve the classification accuracy. Experiment results confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms 3.025%-5.05% in accuracy in comparison with conventional algorithms such as the k-Means or the Self-Organizing Map.

Inspired by the swarm intelligence shown through the social insects' self-organizing behavior, in A(3)CD we assign acceptance weights on the directed edges of a pheromone digraph. The weights of the digraph is adaptively updated by the pheromone left by ants in the seeking process. Finally, strong connected components are extracted as clusters under a certain threshold. A(3)CD has been implemented and tested on several clustering benchmarks and real datasets to compare the performance with the classical K-means clustering algorithm and LF algorithm which is also based on ACO. Experimental results show that our algorithm is easier to implement, more efficient and performs faster and has better clustering quality than other methods.

In our method, first, we divided the large samples space into subspace using k-means clustering; second, a set of neural networks are used to study the every subspace for intrusion detection separately. By this way, we can avoid some inherent problems of neural networks, such as the slow speed of convergence and the burden of computation; On the other hand, during subspace training, because program data, which are in the same subspace, have the similar behavior characters, neural networks can quickly recognize normal or anomalous area of input space; We also note that system call frequency is replaced of system call order in this method, program behavior is represented by frequencies of system calls; Experiment with 1998 DARPA BSM audit data has also shown that the method has good performance.

In the first stage, self-organizing map clustering is used to measuring the similarity of the input data, unlike k-means approach, number and centers of clusters can be determined dynamically and automatically. The Value-related Self Organizing Map (VSOM) is proposed to improve predicting accuracy for high loss subject. During the second stage, the weights from the hidden layer to output layer are determined by multivariate linear regression method. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can be applied successfully to build flood loss prediction models and provide higher accuracy and more direct decision support compared to current approaches.

Most existing methods, however, suffer from two main drawbacks; they cannot provide an understandable representation for text clusters, and cannot scale to very large text collections. Highly scalable text clustering algorithms are becoming increasingly relevant. In this paper, we present a performance study of a new subspace clustering algorithm for large sparse text data. This algorithm automatically calculates the feature weights in the k-means clustering process. The feature weights are used to discover clusters from subspaces of the text vector space and identify terms that represent the semantics of the clusters. A series of experiments have been conducted to test the performance of the algorithm, including resource consumption and clustering quality. The experimental results on real-world text data have shown that our algorithm quickly converges to a local optimal solution and is scalable to the number of documents, terms and the number of clusters.

The most popular document clustering method K-Means has the shortcoming of its cluster intradissimilarity, i.e. inclining to clustering unrelated documents together. One of the reasons is that all objects (documents) in a cluster produce the same influence to the mean of the cluster. SOM (Self Organizing Map) is a method to reduce the dimension of data and display the data in low dimension space, and it has been applied successfully to clustering of high-dimensional objects. The scalar factor is an important part of SOM. In this paper, an optimized K-Means algorithm is proposed. It introduces the scalar factor from SOM into means during K-Means assignment stage for controlling the influence to the means from new objects. Experiments show that the optimized K-Means algorithm has more F-Measure and less Entropy of clustering than standard K-Means algorithm, thereby reduces the intra-dissimilarity of clusters effectively.

User profiling technique upon Web transaction data is able to capture such informative knowledge of user task or interest. With the discovered usage pattern information, it is likely to recommend Web users more preferred content or customize the Web presentation to visitors via collaborative recommendation. In addition, it is helpful to identify the underlying relationships among Web users, items as well as latent tasks during Web mining period. In this paper, we propose a Web recommendation framework based on user profiling technique. In this approach, we employ Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) to model the co-occurrence activities and develop a modified k-means clustering algorithm to build user profiles as the representatives of usage patterns. Moreover, the hidden task model is derived by characterizing the meaningful latent factor space. With the discovered user profiles, we then choose the most matched profile, which possesses the closely similar preference to current user and make collaborative recommendation based on the corresponding page weights appeared in the selected user profile. The preliminary experimental results performed on real world data sets show that the proposed approach is capable of making recommendation accurately and efficiently.

The proposed system consists of three major stages. First, a wavelet transform based method is used for extracting important contrast features as guides to search for desired license plates. Then, finding a reference line in HL subimage plays an important role to locate the desired license plate region roughly. According to the reference line we can decrease the searching region of license plate and speed up the execution time. The last stage of the method is to locate the license plate accurately by license plate adjustment. More importantly, the proposed detection method can locate multiple plates with different orientations in one image. Since the feature extracted is robust to complex backgrounds, the proposed method works well in extracting differently illuminated and oriented license plates. The average accuracy of detection is 92.4%.

To estimate if the location of air monitoring stations was correct, a single-layer artificial neural network (ANN) was used. In the procedure of unsupervised network training, a standard competitive training based on the k-means algorithm with a modification called the "neural gas" was used. The goal of modeling was to indicate the best locations of the hypothetical monitoring stations. The parameters, varying during model optimization, covered the value of subareas, the value of iterations and the value of hypothetical stations. As a result, an optimal model, useful for the EMEP monitoring network evaluation, was derived.

Lloyd's method) for k-means clustering. Our upper bounds are polynomial in the number of points, number of clusters, and the spread of the point set. We also present a lower bound, showing that in the worst case the k-means heuristic needs to perform Omega(n) iterations, for n points on the real line and two centers. Surprisingly, the spread of the point set in this construction is polynomial. This is the first construction showing that the k-means heuristic requires more than a polylogarithmic number of iterations. Furthermore, we present two alternative algorithms, with guaranteed performance, which are simple variants of the k-means method. Results of our experimental studies on these algorithms are also presented.

It is well-known that the general version of this problem is NP-hard. Numerous approximation algorithms have been proposed for this problem. In this paper, we proposed three constant approximation algorithms for k-means clustering. The first algorithm runs in time O((k/epsilon)(k)nd), where k is the number of clusters, n is the size of input points, d is dimension of attributes. The second algorithm runs in time O(k(3)n(2) log n). This is the first algorithm for k-means clustering that runs in time polynomial in n, k and d.

Methods: Forty-four survey variables assessing attitudes and beliefs about immunizations and health were analyzed. The K-means clusters technique was used to identify homogeneous groups of parents based upon their responses to the questions. Results: Five clusters were identified: Immunization Ad- vocates (33.0%), Go Along to Get Alongs (26.4%), Health Advocates (24.8%), Fencesitters (13.2%), and Worrieds (2.6%). Conclusions: Although only a small percentage of parents are seriously concerned, other parents who are generally supportive of immunizations for their child are also affected by immunization safety issues.

To avoid the expensive ground survey, hyperspectral remote sensing image is adopted due to its narrow spectral bandwidth and high spectral resolution. However conventional unsupervised classification techniques often suffer from requiring priori as input parameter and sensitiveness to interference. This paper proposes an Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based unsupervised classification algorithm. ICA is a technique that stems out from the Blind Source Separation. In hyperspectral data processing, ICA projects data vectors to the space where the items of the vectors are mutually statistically independent, and therefore is capable of extracting various kinds of plant information. So as to strengthen the contrast of the resulted independent components, histogram adjustment and mathematical morphology post-processing procedure are appended after ICA decomposition. Through real hyperspectral data experiments, our algorithm has been verified to have better performance for classification than K-means and ISODATA. Besides, computation efficiency and noise robustness have also been improved by a noise filtering preprocessing procedure.

Use of microarray-based methods represents a new and challenging approach that allows molecular dissection of complex autoimmune diseases such as arthritis. In order to characterize the temporal gene expression profile in joints from the reactivation model of streptococcal cell wall (SCW)-induced arthritis in Lewis (LEW/N) rats, total RNA was extracted from ankle joints from naive, SCW injected, or phosphate buffered saline injected animals ( time course study) and gene expression was analyzed using Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarray technology (RAE230A). After normalization and statistical analysis of data, 631 differentially expressed genes were sorted into clusters based on their levels and kinetics of expression using Spotfire(R) profile search and K-mean cluster analysis. Microarray-based data for a subset of genes were validated using real-time PCR TaqMan(R) analysis. Analysis of the microarray data identified 631 genes ( 441 upregulated and 190 downregulated) that were differentially expressed ( Delta > 1.8, P < 0.01), showing specific levels and patterns of gene expression. The genes exhibiting the highest fold increase in expression on days - 13.8, - 13, or 3 were involved in chemotaxis, inflammatory response, cell adhesion and extracellular matrix remodelling. Transcriptome analysis identified 10 upregulated genes ( Delta > 5), which have not previously been associated with arthritis pathology and are located in genomic regions associated with autoimmune disease. The majority of the downregulated genes were associated with metabolism, transport and regulation of muscle development. In conclusion, the present study describes the temporal expression of multiple disease-associated genes with potential pathophysiological roles in the reactivation model of SCW-induced arthritis in Lewis (LEW/N) rat. These findings improve our understanding of the molecular events that underlie the pathology in this animal model, which is potentially a valuable comparator to human rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Of particular interest is the AntClust which is modeled after the nestmate recognition system of real ants. We propose an algorithm called the Hybrid Ant-based Clustering Algorithm (HACA) which is a hybrid approach for unsupervised clustering problems. This algorithm combines the features of AntClust and k-means. HACA employs three different strategies the blacklist strategy, the sniffing strategy and the nests fusion method, to improve the performance of the algorithm. We have conducted experimental investigations to demonstrate the effectiveness of HACA and the results have shown the advantages of the three strategies proposed as well as the improved performance of HACA compared to two other algorithms.

Generally, existing clustering methods, such as k-means algorithm, start with a known set of objects, measured against a known set of attributes. But there are numerous applications where the attribute set characterizing the objects evolves. We propose an incremental, k-means based clustering method, Core Based Incremental Clustering (CBIC), that is capable to re-partition the objects set, when the attribute set increases. The method starts from the partitioning into clusters that was established by applying k-means or CBIC before the attribute set changed. The result is reached more efficiently than running k-means again from the scratch on the feature-extended object set. Experiments proving the method's efficiency are also reported.

The features for classifications are extracted from real time voltage waveform within a sliding time window and a signature vector is formed. The signature vector consists of different types of features such as local wavelet transform extrema at various decomposition levels, spectral harmonic ratios and local extrema of higher order statistical parameters. Before the classification, the clustering has been achieved using SOM in order to define codebook vectors, then LVQ3 (Learning Vector Quantizer) algorithm is applied to find exact classification borders. The k-means algorithm with Davies-Boulding clustering index method is applied to figure out the classification regions. Here it has been observed that, successful classification of two major PQ event types corresponding to arcing faults and motor start-up events for different load conditions has been achieved.			egermen@anadolu.edu.tr; dgece@anadolu.edu.tr; ongerek@anadolu.edu.tr					KOHONEN T, 1990, P IEEE, V78, P1464, DOI 10.1109/5.58325; WAEL R, 2002, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V17; WANG M, 2004, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V19; YANG HT, 2004, IEEE T POWER DELIVER, V19	4	4	4	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743		3-540-28752-3	LECT NOTES COMPUT SC			2005	3696						403	408				6	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Biomedical; Neurosciences	Computer Science; Engineering; Neurosciences & Neurology	BCZ96	WOS:000232193800063

In this paper, we demonstrate the use of SOM-based method for process state monitoring and optimization of NOx emissions. The SOM was trained using a dataset from a fluidized bed energy plant. Reference vectors of the SOM were then classified by K-means algorithm into five clusters, which represented different states of the process. One neuron in each cluster was defined optimal based on the NOx emission of the process. The difference between reference vectors of the optimal neuron and the neuron in each time step could be used for determination of reasons of non-optimal process states.

We prove these properties for the k-median and the discrete k-means clustering problems, resulting in O(2((k/epsilon))(1)dn) time (1 + epsilon)-approximation algorithms for these problems. These are the first algorithms for these problems linear in the size of the input (nd for n points in d dimensions), independent of dimensions in the exponent, assuming k and epsilon to be fixed. A key ingredient of the k-median result is a (1 + epsilon)-approximation algorithm for the 1-median problem which has running time O(2((1/epsilon)) (1)d). The previous best known algorithm for this problem had linear running time.

In this study, we discuss a framework of multi-scale clustering, where clustering is done with multiple scale values and then the obtained results are compiled into a visually appropriate form to observe overall structures of the clusters. For such purpose, a brick view method is proposed in this study. The construction of a brick view diagram consists of a re-indexing procedure of clusters obtained with various scale values and a sorting procedure of samples so as to minimize the distortion defined based on the multiple clustering results. Although some popular clustering methods, such as K-means, spherical K-means, and hierarchical clustering, have been used within the multi-scale framework we introduce mean-shift clustering based on the kernel density estimation for directional data. We evaluate our approach and existing hierarchical clustering by using an artificial data set and a real data set of gene expression profiles. The results show global structures of distributions can be observed well and in a stable manner, in the brick view diagram.

In this paper, we present a novel Kernel Method, Kernel K-Means for clustering problems. Unlike other popular clustering algorithms that yield piecewise linear borders among data, Kernel K-Means allows to get nonlinear separation surfaces in the data. Kernel K-Means compares better with popular clustering algorithms, on a synthetic dataset and two UCI real data benchmarks.

We determined groups by using K-means, the Hellinger index and the maximum Calinski-Harabasz pseudo-F-statistic as stopping rule. Indicator species were assessed with the IndVal index. Relationships between groups and environmental factors were determined by correspondence analysis, and results were validated by a canonical correspondence analysis of species and environment. To compare the group biodiversities we used species richness and diversity indices and abundance biomass comparisons curves. Analysis with incidence data discriminated one shallow Iridaea assemblage and one deep Himantothallus assemblage. Analysis using biomass discriminated three facies, the first in the upper zone (Iridaea cordata, Monostroma hariotii, Adenocystis utricularis, Enteromorpha bulbosa), the second (Desmarestia menziesii, D. antarctica, Ascoseira mirabilis, Curdiea racovitzae, Gigartina skottsbergii, Kallymenia antarctica, Neuroglossum delesseriae, Phaeurus antarcticus, Gymnogongrus turquetil) at intermediate depth and the third (H. grandifolius, D. anceps, Georgiella confluens, Ballia callitricha, Plocamium cartilagineum), coincident with the deep qualitative assemblage, was found in a less disturbed environment. The difference in species composition between the groups was mainly related to depth as an environmental variable. The high specific diversity at intermediate depths can be explained by the presence of patches in different successional stages caused by iceberg scouring.

It is simple, totally unsupervised and able to find clusters of complex and not necessarily convex shape. Groups are identified as the connected components of a Reduced Delaunay Graph (RDG) that we define in this paper. Our method can be seen as an algorithmic equivalent of the gestalt law of perceptual grouping according to proximity. We introduce a measure of dissimilarity between two different groupings of a point set and use this measure to compare our algorithm with human visual perception and the kappa-means clustering algorithm. Our algorithm mimics human perceptual grouping and outperforms the k-means algorithm in all cases that we studied. We also sketch a potential application in the segmentation of structural textures.

In contrast to simultaneous methods like e.g. Kohonen SOM this new approach, called KMC/EDAM, runs through two stages. In the first stage the data is clustered by classical methods like K-means clustering. In the second stage the centroids of the obtained clusters are visualized in a fixed target space which is directly comparable to that of SOM.

The contest task is to cluster, classify and interpret the 170 districts of the city of Dortmund with respect to their 'social milieux'. A data set containing 204 variables measured for every district is given. We apply annealed k-means clustering to the preprocessed contest data. Superparamagnetic clustering is used to foster insight into the natural partitions of the data. A stable and interpretable solution is obtained with k = 3 clusters, dividing Dortmund into three social milieux. A decision tree is deduced from this cluster solution and is used for interpretation and rule generation. The tree offers the possibility to monitor and predict future assessments. To gain information about cluster solutions with k > 3 a stability analysis based on a resampling approach is performed resulting in further interesting insights.

CA visualizes associations between rows and columns of a frequency matrix and can be used for dimension reduction. Based on the first three dimensions after CA mapping we find a stable partition into five clusters. We further identify variables that are highly associated with the cluster centroids and thus represent a cluster's social condition.

Several parameters bring different information and this paper tries to explain how to use this complementarity. It is mainly based on the discrimination between two kinds of backgrounds: clean or complex. On one hand, this separation is useful to apply a particular algorithm on each of these cases and on the other hand to decrease the computation time for clean cases for which a faster method could be considered. Finally, several experiments were done to discuss results and to conclude that the use of a discrimination between kinds of backgrounds gives better results in terms of Precision and Recall.

In the first step we apply the ICA to the dataset without dimension reduction, in the second step we reduce the dimension of the data to find clusters of independent components that are similar in their entries in the mixture matrix found by the ICA. We demonstrate that our algorithm out-performs k-means in the case of toy data and works well with a real world fMRI example, thus allowing a closer look the way how different parts of the brain work together.

This paper is an extended work related to our previous work (1). In our previous work we used k-means algorithm to detect and diagnosis breast cancer tumor's region. However, to find the better results from the algorithm we need to add more numerical parameters of the breast cancer image and this algorithm has limited usage when applied with more number of parameters. Even if the cancer tumor is abnormal it was quite difficult to distinguish among those tumors. This paper summarizes the different comparative study of neural network algorithms to get the best classification of the breast cancer and explains how to acquire more numerical parameters from the breast cancer image data, so that it can help doctors to diagnosis efficiently between benign and malignance tumors.

In particular, the purpose of the paper is to improve the previously developed TWNN equalizer with training using K-means and LMS methods; reducing the TWNN network size by considering a lesser number of TWNN kernels, and developing new techniques for determining channel order which is required to specify the structure of an TWNN equalizer. A linear regression model was used for estimating the channel order. The basic idea of reducing the network size is to select the centers, based on the channel lag. This work includes the comparison of the limits of mean square error (MSE) convergence of both a linear equalizer and an TWNN equalizer. mean square error.

We developed a modified architecture and expanded it by showing refinements on every process of the clustering and knowledge discovery stages. We used the mentioned hierarchical clustering model to partition the data into smaller groups of attributes so that we would determine the data structure before applying the data mining tools. The experiment shows that the model using the clustering resulted to an isolated but imperative association rules based on clustered data, which in return could be practically explained for decision making purposes. Shorter processing time had been observed in computing for smaller clusters implying faster and ideal processing period than dealing with the entire dataset.

One of the most important issues in the correct use of k-means is the initialization procedure that ultimately determines which part of the solution space will be searched. In this paper we briefly review different initialization procedures, and propose Kohonen's Self-Organizing Maps as the most convenient method, given the proper training parameters. Furthermore, we show that in the final stages of its training procedure the Self-Organizing Map algorithms is rigorously the same as the k-means algorithm. Thus we propose the use of Self-Organizing Maps as possible substitutes for the more classical k-means clustering algorithms.

Two objectives are employed in the process: minimizing the within cluster similarity and maximizing the difference between the clusters: inter-cluster distance (average linkage, centroid linkage, complete linkage and average to centroid linkage) versus intra-cluster distance (total within cluster variation). The proposed approach is iterative in the sense that it basically tries possible partitioning of the dataset for the given range of clusters one by one; the result of the previous partitioning n favors that of the current solution n+1. In order to achieve this, we identified a global k-means operator and we do "what if' analysis in the aspect of the objectives to see the better initialization in case the number of clusters is increased by one. After evaluating all, a feedback mechanism is supplied at the back-end to analyze the partitioning results with different indices. The entire system has been tested with a real world dataset: glass. The reported results demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Classical partitioning clustering methods, such as k-means algorithm, start with a known set of objects, and all features are considered simultaneously when calculating objects' similarity. But there are numerous applications where an object set already clustered with respect to an initial set of attributes is altered by the addition of new features. Consequently, a re-clustering is required. We propose in this paper an incremental, k-means based clustering method, Core Based Incremental Clustering (CBIC), that is capable to re-partition the objects set, when the attribute set increases. The method starts from the partitioning into clusters that was established by applying k-means or CBIC before the attribute set changed. The result is reached more efficiently than running k-means again from the scratch on the feature-extended object set. Experiments proving the method's efficiency are also reported.

Given a set of data items, clustering algorithms group similar items together. Clustering has many applications, such as customer-behavior Analysis, targeted marketing, forensics, and bioinformatics. In this paper, we present the design and analysis of a privacy- preserving k-means clustering algorithm, where only the cluster means at the various steps of the algorithm are revealed to the participating parties. The crucial step in our privacy-preserving k-means is privacy-preserving computation of cluster means. We present two protocols (one based on oblivious polynomial evaluation and the second based on homomorphic encryption) for privacy-preserving computation of cluster means. We have a JAVA implementation of our algorithm. Using our implementation, we have performed a thorough evaluation of our privacy-preserving clustering algorithm on three data sets. Our evaluation demonstrates that privacy-preserving clustering is feasible, i.e., our homomorphic-encryption based algorithm finished clustering a large data set in approximately 66 seconds.

However, the diagnostic sensitivity of hyperkalemia (serum potassium level > 5.0) is from 38% to 54% based on the interpretation of 12-lead ECG reports. In this study, a serial two-staged classifier implanted with K-means algorithm was created to screen hyperkalemia based on feature parameters extracted from 12-lead ECG. The SCP-ECG reports of 56 normal individuals and 41 hyperkalemia patients (serum potassium level > 5.3) were collected in the Emergency Department of Wei-Gong Memorial Hospital-Taiwan from January, 2003 through April, 2005. Each of the 12-lead ECG reports was processed to generate two temporal-spatial graphs representing the signals on the limb leads and on chest leads, respectively. The two integrated T-wave volumes shown on the two graphs were selected as the feature parameters of the first staged classifier in screening hyperkalemia. The second staged classifier, which was composed of feature parameters such as PR interval, QRS duration, and QT interval, was used to correct the misclassification from the first stage. A computer program ECGSIM was also adopted to simulate the ECG waveforms from mild to severe hyperkalemia. Based on the results, the classifier showed the sensitivity of 85% (95% CI= 77% to 97%) and the specificity of 79% (95 % CI=55% to 97%) in classifying the samples. In conclusion, the two-staged classifier developed in this study shows the ability to extensively and efficiently diagnose patients with hyperkalemia from very mild to severe degrees. In addition, the estimated values of T-wave volumes from clinical data were in accordance with the observation of computer simulations, where T volumes were increased with the increased serum potassium level.

The objective of this study is to explore a possible relation between P-wave shape changes and the presence of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) episodes in ECG records. Our working hypothesis is that apnoea-related phenomena (e.g., hypoxia, changes in intra-thoracic pressure) influence the depolarisation dynamics of the atria, and hence lead to detectable shape changes in the surface P-wave. For this purpose, a P-wave shape clustering algorithm is proposed. It uses the k-means method, an unsupervised classifier, coupled with a shape metric, the CISA (Corrected Integral Shape Averaging) distance, to distinguish apnoeic and non-apnoeic epochs. The method was applied to perform two-clustering on P-wave shapes extracted from ECG segments. The results obtained indicate that shape information from the ECG can be used in a classification approach for OSA detection. The study also raises the question of elucidating the mechanisms of how OSA may alter P-wave shape.

DEA - Data Envelopment Analysis is one of these tools and its use is increasing in research and in new developments. The problem is how to improve the quality of DEA analysis when the DNM (decision-making unit) it analyzes is considered efficient, and how to guarantee the analysis if the input and output parameters that contain a lot of zeros? Probably these parameters have not been considered in how to visualize the inputs and outputs in n-dimensional space? This paper proposes combining another tool with DEA based in data mining, CLUSTERING, to evaluate the efficiency analyses made for DEA tools, and visualize groups which have inefficient DMUs, based on the K-Means algorithm, and apply over a telecommunication database that contains an indicator of efficiency of the telephone installation in the Brazilian market.

In e-commerce in particular there are a significant number of metrics which have been tested and used for measuring interesting parameters. In most cases these parameters are in relation with customer habits and customer profitability. Nowadays, many merchants cooperate with banks for authorizing credit card transactions in order to purchase products. Banks are also interested, in measuring the profit and the strength of this cooperation. In this paper we introduce two models with this scope, (a) a merchant clustering model and (b) a bank revenue predictive model. According to the first model, a bank scores and classifies its cooperating merchants using a number of parameters, while in the second model, a bank predicts its revenue from e-commerce transactions.

A popular k-means algorithm groups data by firstly assigning all data points to the closest clusters, then determining the cluster means. The algorithm repeats these two steps until it has converged. We propose a variation called weighted k-means to improve the clustering scalability. To speed up the clustering process, we develop the reservoir-biased sampling as an efficient data reduction technique since it performs a single scan over a data set. Our algorithm has been designed to group data of mixture models. We present an experimental evaluation of the proposed method.

HCI analysts use a number of techniques to build models that are faithful to actual computer use. A key technique is through eye tracking, in which the region of the screen being examined is recorded in order to determine key areas of use. Clustering techniques allow these regions to be grouped to help facilitate usability analysis. Historically, approaches such as the Expectation Maximization (EM) and K-Means algorithm have performed well. Unfortunately, these approaches require the number of clusters k to be known beforehand in many real world situations, this hampers the effectiveness of the analysis of the data. We propose a novel algorithm that is well suited for cluster discovery for HCI data; we do not require the number of clusters to be specified a priori and our approach scales very well for both large datasets and high dimensionality. Experiments have demonstrated that our approach works well for real data from HCI applications.

However, these fundamental methods are poorly applicable in situations where number of clusters is almost unpredictable. Formerly, they were adapted to allow splitting and merging when some defined criterion is met. On the other hand there are also methods based on artificial neural networks concretely on self-organizing maps. One of the interesting ideas in this domain is to allow growing of the net which corresponds to adapted k-means method. In this article we are going to compare both approaches in a view of ability to detect clusters in unknown data.

Parallel LBG is based on the LBG algorithm with the K-mean method and aggressive PNN is a parallelized version of the PNN (pairwise nearest neighbour) algorithm. We measured the speedups and elapsed times of both algorithms on a PC cluster system and find that both algorithms can achieve scalable parallelisms for the case with a large number of training vectors. However, as the number of processors increases, the parallelism of the parallel LBG is degraded because the additional computational cost of the centroid update increase. In addition, it is found that the aggressive PNN is superior to the parallel LBG in terms of the total elapsed time for the case where the quality of compressed images is same.

In order to solve these problems, a new approach called MFC-SFSS based on k-means clustering is proposed. To verify the performance of the proposed method, several excerpts with variable duration were extracted from every other position in a same queried music file. Effectiveness of the system with MFC-SFSS and without MFC-SFSS is compared in terms of the classification results with k-NN decision rule. It is demonstrated that the use of MFC-SFSS significantly improves the system stability of musical genre classification with better accuracy.

The global geometric distortions can be described by a 6-parameters affine transformation. Our scheme is designed for color images, which is combined with error-correcting code, double-channels steganography, feature point extraction, and triangle warping. Two color spaces of RGB images are considered two independent channels, one for synchronization information, and the other for a large amount of hiding data. The synchronization information consists of the coordinates of triangles' centers, cyclic redundancy check bits, and parity check bits of convolutional codes. Global geometric distortions can be estimated successfully by least square method and K-means method. Then a large amount of data with low bit-error rate can be decoded by SOVA algorithm of Turbo coding after the geometric adjustment. We also improve the method for feature point extraction. Simulation results show that our scheme is robust to rotation, scaling, translation, cropping, shearing, and so on.

Usually these data can only be read one time in order This kind of data model is called data stream. Real world applications such as telephone records, financial data transactions, web logs and customer click streams require analysis of the data stream in an efficient way with limited memory space. Clustering has been an important research topic in data mining for long time, but most traditional algorithms [10, 4, 6, 9, 8, 7] are not efficient to perform data stream analysis. Some data stream algorithms have resolved the scalability problem, but they are not suitable for online analysis because of their complex data structures or time-consuming functions [3, 2]. In this paper we propose an efficient incremental clustering algorithm on. data stream model for the K-Means problem. This approach can obtain approximately optimal results online with a small amount of memory space requirement. The empirical results indicate that our algorithm can produce better results from large, high-dimensional data streams than some other data stream algorithms.

Seven statistically significant effect factors were chosen through correlation analysis. Three principal components independently influencing RW ratio were extracted by principal component analysis (PCA). The 79 cities were grouped into six clusters by k-means clustering (KMC) of the factor scores of the cities. Then key local factors were identified and their impacts were quantified by multiple regression analysis (MRA) and they were justified by T-test and F-test. The approach through correlation-PCA-KMC-MRA was proved to be one of scientific ways for identification of key local factors. According to the result, it was suggested that a shorter length of distribution system, a water supply with smaller number of bigger customer meters a and gravitational supply through reservoir would be advantageous from a RW ratio's point of view.

The proposed extraction method detects text regions from the images using two low-level image features and verifies the regions through a high-level text stroke feature. The two level features are combined hierarchically. The low-level features are intensity variation and color variance. And, we use text strokes as a high-level feature using multi-resolution wavelet transforms on local image areas. The stroke feature vector is an input to a SVM (Support Vector Machine) for verification, when needed. The proposed text segmentation method uses color clustering to the extracted text regions. We improved K-means clustering method and it selects K and initial seed values automatically. We tested the proposed methods with various document style images captured by three different cameras. We confirmed that the extraction rates are good enough to be used in real-life applications.

Firstly, it applies edge detection to get four edge maps in horizontal, vertical, up-right, and up-left direction. Secondly, the feature is extracted from four edge maps to represent the texture property of text. Then k-means algorithm is applied to detect the initial text candidates. Finally, the text areas are identified by the empirical rules analysis and refined through project profile analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach could efficiently be used as an automatic text detection system, which is robust for font-size, font-color, background complexity and language.

The key ideas are two ways. One is to adopt a distortion-tolerant shape matching technique. Here, we use an affine-invariant matching technique of global affine transformation (GAT) correlation to absorb linear distortion between grayscale images. The other is to prepare multiple templates for dealing with nonlinear distortion or topologically different shapes. For this purpose K-means clustering is applied to a given limited data in a simple gradient feature space.

The probability distribution of these simple shapes in a given handwriting sample is characteristic for the writer and is computed using a common codebook of graphemes obtained by clustering. In previous studies we used contours to encode the graphemes, in the current paper we explore a complementary shape representation using normalized bilmaps. The most important aim of the current work is to compare three different clustering methods for generating the grapheme codebook: k-means, Kohonen SOM 1D and 2D. Large scale computational experiments show that the proposed method is robust to the underlying shape representation used (whether contours or normalized bitmaps), to the size of codebook used (stable performance for sizes from 10(2) to 2.5 x 10(3)) and to the clustering method used to generate the codebook (essentially the same performance was obtained for all three clustering methods).

It is very important to construct the functional genome and denote the functions of unknown genes. This manuscript describes a gene cluster method based on the most similarity tree (CMST), which is a partition of equivalence groups of equivalence relation with similarity measure. The Gap statistic of similarity measure is introduced to determine the most optimal similarity measure and an optimally self-adaptive gene cluster algorithm based on CMST (OS-CMST) is proposed. The cluster method of CMST can get the global optimal clusters and the experiment results show that CMST outperform traditional cluster methods of K-means and SOM.

In software engineering practice, reliability of a software product is often improved with the aid of software quality models applied prior to deployment for detecting software defects. Software quality models have been used to estimate the fault-proneness of program modules toward facilitating a targeted software quality improvement. Typically, such models are built using a training dataset consisting of software measurements and fault-proneness data of previously developed and similar projects. Practical issues in software development often limits the availability of fault-proneness data for all modules in the training data. The proposed approach addresses the issue of software quality modeling without defect data. It is a constraint-based semi-supervised clustering scheme based on the k-means algorithm. Software measurement data obtained from a NASA software project is used in our study. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and promise of the proposed approach.

One of the simplest clustering approaches is the iterative k-means algorithm. The quality of k-means clustering suffers from being confined to run with fixed k rather than being able to dynamically alter the value of k. Moreover, it would be much more elegant if the user did not have to supply the number of clusters for the algorithm. In this paper we consider recently proposed autonomous versions of the k-means algorithm. We demonstrate some of their shortcomings and put forward solutions for their deficiencies. In particular, we examine the problem of automatically determining a good initial candidate as the number of clusters.

The popular k-means algorithm is firstly fuzzified with addition of entropic terms to the objective function of data partitioning problem. This fuzzy clustering is then kernelized for adapting to the arbitrary shape of clusters. Finally, the Euclidean distance in this kernelized fuzzy clustering is modified to a robust one for avoiding the influence of noisy background data. This robust kernel fuzzy clustering method is shown to outperform every its predecessor: fuzzified k-means, robust fuzzified k-means and kernel fuzzified k-means algorithms.

The proposed method has employed moving average method for detecting edge of tumor after estimating the corresponding center using the aid of medical domain knowledge. In our re-search, after computing distance between center and edge of tumor we get factual and numerical data of tumor to calculate multi-deviation and circularity test. It is useful to construct tumor profiling by splitting up the lesion into 4 divisions with the mean of multi-standard deviation (benign: 13.7, malignancies: 38.32) and 8 divisions with the mean of multi-standard deviation (benign: 3.36, malignancies: 15.29) with equal segments. We used K-means algorithm to make classification between benign and malignance tumor. This technique has been fully validated by using more than 100 ultrasound images of the patients and found to be accurate with 90% degree of confidence. This study will help the physicians and radiologist to improve the efficiency in accurate detection of the image and appropriate diagnosis of the cancer tumor.

By applying the K-means algorithm, distribution of the population in the search space is clustered in each training generation. Inferences of p(x) and p(m) are performed by a fuzzy-based system that fuzzifies the relative sizes of the clusters containing the best and worst chromosomes. The proposed adaptation method is applied to optimize a buck regulator that requires satisfying some static and dynamic requirements. The optimized circuit component values, the regulator's performance, and the convergence rate in the training are favorably compared with the GA's using fixed p(x) and P-m	Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Guangzhou, Peoples R China	Zhang, J (reprint author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Guangzhou, Peoples R China.

With 3D laser scanning, it is now possible to measure rock faces whose access is restricted or rock slopes along highways or railway lines where working conditions are hazardous. The proposed method is less expensive than traditional manual survey and analysis methods. Laser scanning is a relatively new surveying technique that yields a so-called point cloud set of data; every single point represents a point in 3D space of the scanned rock surface. Because the density of the point cloud can be high (on the order of 5 mm to I cm), it allows for an accurate reconstruction of the original rock surface in the form of a 3D interpolated and meshed surface using different interpolation techniques. Through geometric analysis of this 3D mesh and plotting of the facet orientations in a polar plot, it is possible to observe clusters that represent different rock mass discontinuity sets. With fuzzy k-means clustering algorithms, individual discontinuity sets can be outlined automatically, and the mean orientations of these identified sets can be computed. Assuming a Fisher's distribution, the facet outliers can be removed subsequently. Finally, discontinuity set spacings can be calculated as well.

All this information is not useful unless its search is efficient and effective. With large collections parallelization is important because the data volume is enormous. Hence, usually, only one computer is not sufficient to manage all data, and more in a reasonable time. The parallelization also is important because in many situations the document collection is already distributed and its centralization is not a good idea. This is the reason why we present parallel algorithms in information retrieval systems. We propose two parallel clustering algorithms: a-Bisecting K-Means and a-Bisecting Spherical K-Means. Moreover, we have prepared a set of experiments to compare the computation performance of the algorithms. These studies have been accomplished in a cluster of PCs with 20 bi-processor nodes and two different collections.

It is also possible to combine them, obtaining hybrid approaches. This paper describes a hybrid method for selecting relevant features in clustering problems. The proposed approach is based on the combination of the widely known k-means algorithm and a Bayesian filter, which is based on the Markov Blanket concept. Since the number of clusters and the subset of relevant features are usually inter-related, we propose a method that iterates between clustering (assuming that the number of clusters is not known a priori) and filtering. Experiments in a number of datasets show that the proposed approach allows selecting features that provide good partitions.

Neural networks store the knowledge implicit in the data in their weights, but do not provide an easy explanation of this knowledge to the user This is a difficult task due to the spatial (distributed information in the network) and temporal (network states) relations built by the network among the data. One form to present the knowledge stored inside a RNN is using finite state automata, which shows explicitly the relations among the variables and their temporal causality. In this paper we treat the nonlinear dynamical system Inverted Pendulum and controller and compare the performance of the extraction algorithm using two clustering methods: k-means and fuzzy clustering in terms of exactness and knowledge conciseness.

It uses clustering methods to tune the centers of the Gaussian functions used in the hidden layer of a RBF-NN. It also uses particle swarm optimization for centers and spread tuning and the Penrose-Moore pseudo-inverse to adjust the weight's output of the network. Simulations involving this RBF-NN design to identify the chaotic Lorenz' system indicate that the performance of proposed method is better that conventional RBF-NN trained for k-means for multi-step-ahead forecasting.

First, a k-means algorithm was applied with three feature vectors, based on color/gray values, four texture features, and their combination. Second, 18 participants clustered the images using a newly developed card sorting program. The mutual agreement between the participants was 57% and 56% and between the algorithm and the participants it was 47% and 45%, for respectively color and gray-scale texture images. Third, in a benchmark, 30 participants judged the algorithms' clusters with gray-scale textures as more homogeneous then those with colored textures. However, a high interpersonal variability was present for both the color and the gray-scale clusters. So, despite the promising results, it is questionable whether average human texture classification can be mimicked (if it exists at all).

Traditionally single words occurring in the documents are identified to determine the similarities among documents. In this work, we investigate using compound words as features for document clustering. Our experimental results demonstrate that using compound words alone cannot improve the performance of clustering system. Promising results are achieved when the compound words are combined with the original single words to be the features. An evaluation of several basic clustering algorithms is also performed in our work for algorithm selection. Although the bisecting K-means method has been proposed as a good document clustering algorithm by other investigators, our experimental results demonstrated that for small datasets, a traditional hierarchical clustering algorithm still achieves the best performance.

Our new algorithm is motivated by the fact that VLSI interconnect circuits have many similar terminals in terms of their timing and delay metrics due to their closeness in structure or due to mathematic approximation using meshing in finite difference or finite element scheme during the extraction process. By allowing some delay tolerance or variations, we can reduce many similar terminals and keep a small number of representative terminals. After terminal reduction, traditional model order reduction methods can achieve more compact models and improve simulation efficiency. The new method, TERMMERG, is based on the moments of the circuits as the metrics for the timing or delay. It then employs singular value decomposition (SVD) method to determine the optimum number of clusters based on the low-rank approximation. After this the K-means clustering algorithm is used to cluster the moment of the terminals into different clusters. Experimental results on a number of real industry interconnect circuits demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

It incorporates a potential-based clustering scheme with a cluster validity index into a framework that is based on the use of the weighted fuzzy modes. The novelty of the contribution lies in the following properties: (a) the potential-based clustering scheme reduces the dependence of the algorithm on initialization, (b) the weighted fuzzy c-modes provides flexibility in detecting the real data structure, and (c) the cluster validity index determines the appropriate number of clusters. The algorithm is applied to model (classify) cultural data related to a number of painters of the seventeenth century, where its performance is compared to the respective performance of an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm.

Query Size Estimation (QSE) is difficult if the queries are associated with more than one attribute. Here, we propose, and experimentally evaluate, a novel technique that builds on cluster analysis. Empirical results indicate that, in particular, density-based clustering QSE techniques are beneficial for medium and large sized databases where they compare favourably with partitioning clustering QSE ones such as k-means. This is observed especially in the case of noisy and dense datasets.

A number of computer algorithms have been developed for this task. Although these algorithms have demonstrated their usefulness for gene clustering, some basic problems remain. This paper describes our work on extracting functional keywords from MEDLINE for a set of genes that are isolated for further study from microarray experiments based on their differential expression patterns. The sharing of functional keywords among genes is used as a basis for clustering in a new approach called BEA-PARTITION in this paper. Functional keywords associated with genes were extracted from MEDLINE abstracts. We modified the Bond Energy Algorithm (BEA), which is widely accepted in psychology and database design but is virtually unknown in bioinformatics, to cluster genes by functional keyword associations. The results showed that BEA-PARTITION and hierarchical clustering algorithm outperformed k-means clustering and self-organizing map by correctly assigning 25 of 26 genes in a test set of four known gene groups. To evaluate the effectiveness of BEA-PARTITION for clustering genes identified by microarray profiles, 44 yeast genes that are differentially expressed during the cell cycle and have been widely studied in the literature were used as a second test set. Using established measures of cluster quality, the results produced by BEA-PARTITION had higher purity, lower entropy, and higher mutual information than those produced by k-means and self-organizing map. Whereas BEA-PARTITION and the hierarchical clustering produced similar quality of clusters, BEA-PARTITION provides clear cluster boundaries compared to the hierarchical clustering. BEA-PARTITION is simple to implement and provides a powerful approach to clustering genes or to any clustering problem where starting matrices are available from experimental observations.

J	Jin, RM; Yang, G; Agrawal, G				Jin, RM; Yang, G; Agrawal, G			Shared memory parallelization of data mining algorithms: Techniques, programming interface, and performance	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						shared memory parallelization; programming interfaces; association mining; clustering; decision tree construction	ASSOCIATION RULES	With recent technological advances, shared memory parallel machines have become more scalable, and offer large main memories and high bus bandwidths. They are emerging as good platforms for data warehousing and data mining. In this paper, we focus on shared memory parallelization of data mining algorithms. We have developed a series of techniques for parallelization of data mining algorithms, including full replication, full locking, fixed locking, optimized full locking, and cache-sensitive locking. Unlike previous work on shared memory parallelization of specific data mining algorithms, all of our techniques apply to a large number of popular data mining algorithms. In addition, we propose a reduction-object-based interface for specifying a data mining algorithm. We show how our runtime system can apply any of the techniques we have developed starting from a common specification of the algorithm. We have carried out a detailed evaluation of the parallelization techniques and the programming interface. We have experimented with apriori and fp-tree-based association mining, k-means clustering, k-nearest neighbor classifier, and decision tree construction. The main results from our experiments are as follows: 1) Among full replication, optimized full locking, and cache-sensitive locking, there is no clear winner. Each of these three techniques can outperform others depending upon machine and dataset parameters. These three techniques perform significantly better than the other two techniques. 2) Good parallel efficiency is achieved for each of the four algorithms we experimented with, using our techniques and runtime system. 3) The overhead of the interface is within 10 percent in almost all cases. 4) In the case of decision tree construction, combining different techniques turned out to be crucial for achieving high performance.

The data clustering is made using the self-organizing (or Kohonen) map (SOM) and the techniques proposed by Costa & Netto [5] for automatic partition of trained SOM networks and for generating a hierarchy of maps based on the detected data clusters. The proposed clustering method has been applied on a LANDSAT/TM image and its performance was compared with that of K-means algorithm, conventionally used for remotely sensed images.

The methods of empirical and unsupervised classification have been used by many researchers in the delineation of management zones, but these methods are only built upon the information of attributes in every spatial cell, and the spatial relationships and their spatial interaction between cells are not considered. AS a result, there are many isolated cells or patches in the zoned map, this is not advantageous for the operation of the variable-rate application. Based on the traditional K-Means cluster (KM) and the spatial autocorrelation, a new method, Spatial Contiguous K-Means clustering algorithm (SC-KM), was developed in this study. According to the spatial variability of wheat growth under within-field level extracted from ONUS image of the key growth stage, management zones were delineated by using K-M and SC-KM methods. Two evaluation indices were employed to evaluate the zoned results of the above mentioned two methods The results showed that the sum of the weighted variance of the corresponding within-zones based on the two methods appeared no significant difference, and that the SC-KM method could remove lots of isolated cells or patches and improved the continuity of the corresponding management zone map, compared with the K-M method. The zoned result based on the SC-KM method can be used as the variable management unit for precision agriculture and can be used to advise the sampling of subsequent soil or crop.

In this research we show a different use for PCA technique as a tool for data fusion. PCA as a data fusion technique is performed over the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) data, studying dust storms to better serve their identification. The multi-angle viewing capability of MISR is used to enhance our understanding of the Earth's environment that includes climate particularly of atmosphere and of land surfaces. In this research the multi an-le MISR images clearly show a dust storm over the Liaoning region of China as well as parts of northern and western Korea on April 8, 2002. PCA is used to combine the obtained information from the different angle views and frequency hands of MISR datasets. Performing K-means clustering on the original and the assimilated products apple a quantitative measure that is introduced. Upon classifying the first 4 principal components (PCs) having 95% of the information content similar results were obtained as compared to the classification using original datasets.

K-means cluster analysis is employed to calculate the planting structure of main grain crops in Heilongjiang Province. It is indicated that with the climate warming, the paddy planting area has enlarged rapidly, and its northern planting boundary has been extended to 52 degrees N, and been pushed towards the east. The borderline of corn advanced to the north, at the meantime the planting area of wheat has deduced remarkably and its planting, area retreated northward. Thus the adjustment of structure results in the rice has become the most important grain instead of wheat, and the planting structure has been changed from wheat and corn dominate to the corn and rice dominate in the past 20 years, especially in 1990s. All these changes had related to the increasing of accumulative temperature in response to the global warming.

It is well known that land cover conditions in the NOAA AVHRR data are classified into three different classes: sea, land, and cloud. Supervised data of the three classes are automatically sampled from the features of a histogram obtained from multispectral bands. With the supervised data, pure pixels for each class are classified by fuzzy reasoning. Subsequently,, the remaining pixels are classified into three types of mixed pixels (mixels) by using fuzzy reasoning and edge information. The classification results by the proposed method are in considerable agreement with the actual land cover conditions. This study also suggests that the proposed approach provides reasonable results when compared with the maximum likelihood method and k-means clustering.

In this paper, we apply, this new method to remotely-sensed data, and then improve on this method according to the characteristics of remotely, sensed data. For validating this method, we make use of simulation data and remotely sensed data and compare the classification result with the method of K-Means. The result of comparison makes clear that UDS is succinctness and more understandable, and it can not only obtain the classification result of higher accuracy, but also be of the characteristics that it is not necessary, the prior information of class numbers and independent on the structure of data classified. At the same time, it hits advantage over the nonlimitness of high dimension of feature space.

Data streams that are non-stationary demand that they be adaptive in addition to being incremental. By adaptive, we mean that they reflect properties of data from the recent past. We discuss approaches to adaptive stream computations and advocate the use of forgetting-factors where data is associated with a weight that decays with time. We present the weighted k-means clustering algorithm using forgetting factors that does adaptive clustering over data streams. The main advantage of this algorithm is its simplicity and user friendliness. It allows users to dynamically change the number of clusters as well as the decay rates of different clusters depending on their interestingness. Further we show that adaptive multidimensional histograms can be maintained over real-valued data streams using adaptive clusters by treating each cluster as a bucket of the histogram. We observe that the clusters (as well as histograms) adapt well to the changes in the data. Using weighted-count range queries, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our adaptive histograms over non-stationary streams.

Many algorithms have been developed to detect and remove highlight. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective method for detecting and removal of highlight. We first use a window to help to remove the noise and reduce the data amount for analysis. We then apply K-means algorithm in a 5-D vector space to computer diffuse chromaticity. In the case of non-white illuminant, illuminant chromaticity is estimated in the inverse-intensity space, and we use Fuzzy C-mean clustering and linear fitting to get illuminant chromaticity. Finally, we use Specular-to-Diffuse mechanism to separate specular reflection component from image. Experiments show that it is robust and can give good results.

The learning mechanism of the proposed algorithm is obtained by using the defined parameter called pheromone, by which undesired solutions of the K-means algorithm is omitted. The proposed method improves the K-means algorithm by making it less dependent on the initial parameters such as randomly chosen initial cluster centers, hence more stable.

The method employs both clustering and outlier discovery to improve estimation of the centroids of the generative distribution. The proposed algorithm consists of two stages. The first stage consist of purely K-means process, while the second stage iteratively removes the vectors which are far from their cluster centroids. We provide experimental results on three different synthetic datasets and three map images which were corrupted by lossy compression. The results indicate that the proposed method has a lower error on datasets with overlapping clusters than the competing methods.

Existing clustering algorithms, such as K-means, are designed to find clusters but these algorithms can break down if the choice of parameters in the static model is incorrect with respect to the data set being clustered, or if the model is not adequate to capture the characteristics of clusters. Furthermore, most of these algorithms break down when the data consists of clusters that are of diverse shapes, densities and sizes. In this paper, a novel clustering algorithm has been presented that clusters the data set in O(n) time taking 0(n) space and that too without specifying the stopping criteria with respect to data set to be clustered (unlike done in k-means to explicitly specify the value of k). The algorithm first normalizes the data set, and then a proper mesh has to be designed to include the whole data set. Then all the points in a data set are assigned different box numbers and then these boxes are clustered instead of the real points. The algorithm doesn't use any distance measure to cluster points like Euclidean distance. Apart from independent clustering algorithm, it can be used for the upper bound of the "to be clusters" in other algorithms like k-means, isodata etc.	Indian Inst Informat Technol, Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, India	Choudhari, A (reprint author), Indian Inst Informat Technol, Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, India.

Web high-quality pages provide readers proper entries to get more concentrated required information on the web. This paper focuses on topic-independent web high-quality page selection to reduce web information redundancies and clean noise. Different non-content features and their effects on high-quality page selection are studied. Then K-means clustering with these features is performed to separate high-quality pages from common ones. Experiments on 19GB (document size) TREC web data set (.GOV data) have been made. By this proposed approach, less than 50% of web pages are obtained as high-quality ones, covering about 90% key information in the whole set. Information retrieval on this high-quality page set achieves more than 40% improvement, compared with that on the whole data collection.(1)	Tsing Hua Univ, State Key Lab Intelligent Technol & Syst, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China	Wang, CH (reprint author), Tsing Hua Univ, State Key Lab Intelligent Technol & Syst, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.	wangcanhui@tsinghua.org.cn; liuyiqun@tsinghua.org.cn; z-m@tsinghua.edu.cn; msp@tsinghua.edu.cn					Bharat Krishna, 1998, 21 INT ACM SIGIR C R, P104; Davison BD, 2000, P 23 ANN INT ACM SIG, P272, DOI 10.1145/345508.345597; HAWKING D, 2003, NIST SPECIAL PUBLICA; KANUNGO T, 2000, S COMPUTAITONAL GEOM; KRAAIJ W, 2002, 25 ANN INT ACM SIGIR, P27; Likas A., 2003, GLOBAL K MEANS CLUST; LIU YQ, 2004, P AS INF RETR S; LOANO JA, 1999, PATTERN RECOGN, V20, P1027; MONIKA R, 2003, P INT JOINT C ART IN; Upstill T, 2003, ACM T INFORM SYST, V21, P286, DOI 10.1145/858476.858479; ZHANG M, 2003, NOVELTY ROBUST WEB H	11	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743		3-540-29186-5	LECT NOTES COMPUT SC			2005	3689						516	521				6	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BDF93	WOS:000233302700043

However these approaches require large overhead due to heavy computations for both feature selection and cross validation method to minimize generalization errors. In addition selected feature set varies according to detection model so that they are inefficient for modeling lightweight IDS. Therefore this paper proposes a new approach to model lightweight Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on a new feature selection approach named Correlation-based Hybrid Feature Selection (CBHFS) which is able to significantly decrease training and testing times while retaining high detection rates with low false positives rates as well as stable feature selection results. The experimental results on KDD 1999 intrusion detection datasets show the feasibility of our approach to enable one to modeling lightweight IDS.			jspark@hau.ac.kr; khaja@hau.ac.kr; dskim@hau.ac.kr					ALMUALLIM H, 1994, ARTIF INTELL, V69, P279, DOI 10.1016/0004-3702(94)90084-1; Cannady J., 1998, P 1998 NAT INF SYST, P443; Chapelle O, 2002, MACH LEARN, V46, P131, DOI 10.1023/A:1012450327387; CHEBROLU S, 2004, P 2004 S CENTR INF S; Dash M., 2000, P 4 PAC AS C KNOWL D, P98; Duan K, 2003, NEUROCOMPUTING, V51, P41, DOI 10.1016/S0925-2312(02)00601-X; Fayyad U., 1993, P 13 INT JOINT C ART, P1022; FUGATE M, 2002, LECT NOTES COMPUTER, V2388; Hall M.

The proposed algorithm re-organizes dataset into a form of nested binary tree*. Data items are compared at each node with only two nearest means with respect to each dimension and assigned to the one that has the closer mean. The main intuition of our research is as follows: We build the nested binary tree. Then we scan the data in raster order by in-order traversal of the tree. Lastly we compare data item at each node to the only two nearest means to assign the value to the intendant cluster. In this way we are able to save the computational cost significantly by reducing the number of comparisons with means and also by the least use to Euclidian distance formula. Our results showed that our method can perform clustering operation much faster than the classical ones.

The k-means clustering is one of the well-known clustering techniques. At first, many clustering methods must decide the number of clusters. Our method searches a set of hyper-rectangles that satisfies the properties (1) each hyper-rectangle covers some of the samples, and (2) each sample is covered by at least one of the hyper-rectangles. Then, a collection of connected hyper-rectangles is assumed to be a cluster. One of the characteristic features of our method is that it can work if there is no initial value on the number of clusters assumed. We apply the hierarchical clustering method to realize the clustering based on connecting adjacent hyper-rectangles. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by applying a small artificial data and Iris data.

Simulating human motions for ergonomics analyses implies to consider alternative movement techniques. The aim of this paper is to identify alternative movement techniques during the car entering movement. A quantitative index called joint contribution vector (JCV) is used. The JCV is a motion in terms of contributions of individual joint degrees of freedom to the achievement of a task goal. The JCV is computed for 20 subjects. A k-mean clustering analysis and a multidimensional scaling analysis are conducted on the JCVs. The results suggest the existence of two motions clusters. The first group consists of 17 subjects and the second group consists of 3 subjects.

J	Santos, JA; Corte-Real, J; Leite, SM				Santos, JA; Corte-Real, J; Leite, SM			Weather regimes and their connection to the winter rainfall in Portugal	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article						winter precipitation; rainfall regimes; large-scale circulation; Portugal; K-means	NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION PATTERNS; LARGE-SCALE CIRCULATION; PRECIPITATION VARIABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SURFACE-TEMPERATURE; SEASONAL RAINFALL; TEMPORAL PATTERNS; IBERIAN PENINSULA; SOUTHERN EUROPE	Wintertime rainfall over Portugal is strongly coupled with the large-scale atmospheric flow in the Euro-Atlantic sector. A K-means cluster analysis, on the space spanned by a subset of the empirical orthogonal functions of the daily mean sea-level pressure fields, is performed aiming to isolate the weather regimes responsible for the interannual variability of the winter precipitation. Each daily circulation pattern is keyed to a set of five weather regimes (C, W, NAO-, NAO+ and E). The dynamical structure of each regime substantiates the statistical properties of the respective rainfall distribution and validates the clustering technique. The C regime is related to low-pressure systems over the North Atlantic that induce southwesterly and westerly moist winds over the country. The W regime is characterized by westerly disturbed weather associated with low-pressure systems mainly located over northern Europe. The NAO- regime is manifested by weak low-pressure systems near Portugal. The NAO+ regime corresponds to a well-developed Azores high with generally settled and dry weather conditions. Finally, the E regime is related to anomalous strong easterly winds and rather dry conditions. Although the variability in the frequencies of occurrence of the C and NAO- regimes is largely dominant in the interannual variability of the winter rainfall throughout Portugal, the C regime is particularly meaningful over northern Portugal and the NAO- regime acquires higher relevance over southern Portugal. The inclusion of the W regime improves the description of the variability over northern and central Portugal. Dry weather conditions prevail in both the NAO+ and E regimes, with hardly any exceptions. The occurrence of the NAO+ and the NAO- regimes is also strongly coupled with the North Atlantic oscillation. Copyright (C) 2005 Royal Meteorological Society.

Firstly, the ROI are extracted in DWT domain by using the human visual characteristic and K-mean clustering. Secondly, the local energy of wavelet coefficients of ROI is used for the texture feature, the mean values and standard deviations are used for the color feature, and the weight center coordinate of ROI is used for the location feature. Finally, the average similarity between images is computed according to the ROI above features.

The existence of bad data in historical load curve affects the precision of load forecasting result. This paper presents the second order difference method to detect the bad data, eliminate them and evaluate the real data. To decrease the effect of impulse load on the prediction result, weighted least square quadratic fitting is proposed to filter the curve. K-means clustering and support vector machine method are employed to forecast the future load. The proposed method is successfully applied to an actual power system.

The major key color areas are extracted by image segmentation applying Bayesian classifier with k-means starter in CIELAB space and the color similarity is measured by summing lip the inter-cluster color distances. The mutual correlations in DCT components are used to discriminate the spatial frequency features that carry textural details. In addition, a structural feature of image is simply characterized by down sampled color mosaic pattern. A target color image is retrieved by searching the image with the maximum similarity by cross correlations in the multi-dimensional feature vector space. Color similarity, was indispensable to narrow the reliable candidate for almost all the tested images. Although an appropriate combination of spectral or structural features worked effective to retrieve the image with textural similarity, but we have riot any definitive solution to select the frequency region yet. Finally, we report a method for evaluating the performance of our system based on psychophysical experiments using z-score.

Proposed system is applied to preferred color reproduction, scene simulation, industrial design, etc. First, unsupervised image segmentation method in our previous paper is improved by coupling the Bayesian decision rule with K-means classifier as a starter for setting the initial seeds points. Here, we tested new methods for choosing the initial seeds points, such as, finding the higher population density center in color distribution or searching the mountain peaks in color histogram. Secondly we applied this model for automatic segmentation of key color areas in air image. After the segmentation, each segmented color area is projected onto PC (Principal Component) space and the paired segments are selected to transfer or mutually interchange the colors one to another between the corresponding pairs. Finally a color atmosphere in reference scene is transferred into a source scene by matching the PCs through the hue rotation and the variance scaling in PC axes between the corresponding paired segments. The paper introduces the experiments on typical applications to scene color change, scene-referred color correction, or flesh-tint reproduction for facial images.

However, each of these traditional clustering methods has its limitations. In this study, we introduce a new method, hierarchical K-means regulating divisive or agglomerative approach. The hierarchical K-means firstly employs K-means'. algorithm in each cluster to determine K cluster while operating and then employs it on hierarchical clustering technique to shorten merging clusters time while generating a tree-like dendrogram. We apply this method in two original microarray datasets. The result indicates divisive hierarchical K-means is superior to hierarchical clustering on cluster quality and is superior to K-means clustering on computational speed. Our conclusion is that divisive hierarchical K-means establishes a better clustering algorithm satisfying researchers' demand.

Sources are required to have independently fluctuating non-stationary amplitudes, where the latter are defined relative to a moving time frame. Utilizing the local temporal structure of the mixtures, the proposed method estimates the mixing matrix and the sources by repeated use of the singular value decomposition and k-means clustering. Performance is comparable to FastICA [2] on some typical test problems. Unlike the ICA algorithms that are based on higher order statistics, LocalICA is based only on second order statistics. LocalICA thus has the potential for separating mixtures of colored Gaussian sources.

The gene expression data is first normalized and Markov chains (MC) are constructed from the dynamics of the gene expressions, in which the behavior of the genes at each step of the experiment can be taken into account. Based on the correlation of one-step Markov chain transition probabilities, an agglomerative method is employed to group the series that have similar behavior at each point. The proposed MCC clustering method has been applied to four gene expression datasets to obtain a number of clusters. The results show that the MCC method outperforms the commonly used K-means method and produces clusters that are more meaningful in terms of the similarity of the grouped genes. Another advantage of the proposed method over the existing clustering methods is that the knowledge of the group number is not required.

J	Cortina, LM; Wasti, SA				Cortina, LM; Wasti, SA			Profiles in coping: Responses to sexual harassment across persons, organizations, and cultures	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							WOMENS RESPONSES; SOCIAL SUPPORT; POWER; CONSEQUENCES; DETERMINANTS; PERCEPTIONS; WORKPLACE; OUTCOMES; STRESS; GENDER	This study explicates the complexity of sexual harassment coping behavior among 4 diverse samples of working women: (a) working-class Hispanic Americans, (b) working-class Anglo Americans. (c) professional Turks, and (d) professional Anglo Americans. K-means cluster analysis revealed 3 common harassment coping profiles: (a) detached, (b) avoidant negotiating, and (c) support seeking. The authors then tested an integrated framework of coping profile determinants, involving social power, stressor severity, social support, and culture. Analysis of variance, chi-square, and discriminant function results identified significant determinants at each of the 4 levels of this ecological model. These findings underscore the importance of focusing on whole patterns of experience-and considering influences at the level of the individual employee and multiple levels of the surrounding context-when studying how women cope with workplace sexual harassment.

J	Garcia-Escudero, LA; Gordaliza, A				Garcia-Escudero, LA; Gordaliza, A			A proposal for robust curve clustering	JOURNAL OF CLASSIFICATION			English	Article						functional data; clustering; k-means; trimmed k-means; robustness	TRIMMED K-MEANS; FUNCTIONAL DATA	Functional data sets appear in many areas of science. Although each data point may be seen as a large finite-dimensional vector it is preferable to think of them as functions, and many classical multivariate techniques have been generalized for this kind of data. A widely used technique for dealing with functional data is to choose a finite-dimensional basis and find the best projection of each curve onto this basis. Therefore, given a functional basis, an approach for doing curve clustering relies on applying the k-means methodology to the fitted basis coefficients corresponding to all the curves in the data set. Unfortunately, a serious drawback follows from the lack of robustness of k-means. Trimmed k-means clustering (Cuesta-Albertos, Gordaliza, and Matran 1997) provides a robust alternative to the use of k-means and, consequently, it may be successfully used in this functional framework. The proposed approach will be exemplified by considering cubic B-splines bases, but other bases can be applied analogously depending on the application at hand.

For k = 2, 3,..., M - 1 it considers the best-known set of k - 1 centroids previously obtained, adds a new cluster center at each point of X in turn and applies k-means to each set of k centroids so-obtained, keeping the best k-partition found. We show that global k-means cannot be guaranteed to find the optimum partition for any M >= 2 and d >= 1; moreover, the same holds for all M >= 3 if the new cluster center is chosen anywhere in R-d instead of belonging to X. The empirical performance of global k-means is also evaluated by comparing the values it obtains with those obtained for three data sets with N <= 150 which are solved optimally, as well as with values obtained by the recent j-means heuristic and extensions thereof for three larger data sets with N <= 3038.

We have previously developed a new method for quantitative assessment of left ventricular (LV) volumes and ejection fraction (EF) from electrocardiography-gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The aims of this study were to present the methodology, to validate the gated SPECT cardiac quantification (GSCQ) method in phantoms and patients, and to determine normal values of LVEF. Methods and Results. A simple thresholding technique was used to generate binary images from nongated SPECT images. The K-means cluster classification algorithm was used to separate the LV region from non-LV regions on the binary images. A count- and geometry-based algorithm was applied to define endocardial and epicardial boundaries for calculation of LV volumes and LVEF. Overall correlation between GSCQ-quantified volumes and actual phantom volumes was good (r = 0.97 and standard error of estimation (SEE) = 9.99 mL for normal phantoms, r = 0.99 and SEE = 6.97 mL for phantoms with defects). In patient studies, LVEF derived by GSCQ from SPECT and from equilibrium radionuclide angiography also showed good correlation (r = 0.90 and SEE = 6.2%). The lower limit of normal LVEF from 8-frame gated SPECT by use of GSCQ was 45%. Quantification of LVEF by the GSCQ method was highly producible and was not significantly affected by the presence of myocardial perfusion defects or intense gastrointestinal activity. Conclusions. The GSCQ method provides reliable and consistent assessments of LV volumes and EF. This methodology is less affected by intense gastrointestinal activity than other methods.

J	Ahlf, W; Heise, S				Ahlf, W; Heise, S			Sediment toxicity assessment - Rationale for effect classes - Dedicated to Prof. Dr. Ulrich Forstner on his 65th birthday	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS			English	Article						biotests; classification system; hazard assessment; sediment toxicity classes	BIOASSAYS	Background, Aims and Scope. The main challenge in the application of biotests for hazard assessment of sediments is a transparent interpretation, especially if combinations of biotests are applied and an integrated assessment of all results is wanted. For decision making, assigning results of biotesting into different classes that indicate increasing hazards can be a useful tool. In this paper we suggest an approach on how to set up a site-independent classification system for sediment toxicity tests. Results and Discussion. The classification system described emphasizes the following steps: the assessment of test-specific response spans for each applied biotest and the subsequent intern pretation of inhibition values in terms of toxicity, estimation of accuracy and uncertainty of different test systems, and the use of cluster- and k-means analyses in order to identify occurring pattern within a large biotest data base, followed by a ranking. The outcome of the procedure were 5 effect classes with an increasing potential of hazard. Conclusion. The effect classes represent the result of a logical procedure of deduction. The procedure is transparent giving an increased degree of certainty. The site independent ranking of 5 classes could be used for sediment monitoring and facilitate fast interpretation. Recommendation and Perspective. A large database comprising differently contaminated sediments is the precondition for setting up effect classes, because it is essential to know the range of effects and the variability of the test methods. The proposed procedure could then provide the basic rules for designing an expert system.

One popular method of screening breast cancer is ultrasound. However, reading an ultrasound image is not an easy task because it lacks spatial resolution, subject to image distortion, susceptible to noise and is highly operator dependant. Several image processing techniques have been introduced to enhance the detection of diagnostic features. This study proposes modified seed based region growing algorithm to detect the edges and segment the area of solid masses in an ultrasound image without having to specify the location of the seed and the grey level threshold value manually. Automatic seed selection is done by using moving k-means clustering. A performance analysis has been carried out towards 3 different ultrasound images. The results reveal that this algorithm can detect the edges of solid masses and segment it from the rest of the image effectively.

In this paper, a hybrid tabu search based clustering algorithm called KT-Clustering is developed to explore the proper clustering of data sets. Based on the framework of tabu search, KT-Clustering gathers the optimization property of tabu search and the local search capability of K-means algorithm together. Moreover, mutation operation is adopted to establish the neighborhood of KT-Clustering. Its superiority over K-means algorithm, a genetic clustering algorithm and another tabu search based clustering algorithm is extensively demonstrated for experimental data sets.

The diagnostics involves acoustic emission waves enmitted as a result of a sudden release of energy during impacts and detected by the multi-agent network. Several diagnostic techniques identifying the nature and severity of damage at multiple sites are investigated, and the self-organising maps (Kohonen neural networks) are shown to outperform the standard k-means algorithm in both time- and frequency domains.

Since no priori knowledge of system working environment can be assumed. The proposed method can decide an optimal configuration of filter by exploring the filter fusion to unknown illumination conditions. In this paper, we propose to investigate how to preprocess an input face image for the task of robust face recognition, especially in changing illumination environment (bad illumination). We found that the performance of each preprocessing method for compensating illumination is highly affected by working illumination environment. Changing illumination poses a most challenging problem in face recognition. A previous research for illumination compensation has been investigated. The illumination filter includes Retinex filter, end-in contrast stretching and histogram equalization filter. The proposed method has been tested to robust face recognition in varying illumination conditions (our lab, FERET DB). We made in illumination cluster using combined FART and RBF, K-means algorithm. Extensive experiment shows that the proposed system can achieve very encouraging performance in varying illumination environments. We furthermore show how this algorithm can be extended towards face recognition across illumination.

Within categorical data, it provides a collection of (possibly overlapping) bi-clusters, i.e., linked clusters for both objects and attribute-value pairs. We propose a generic framework for bi-clustering which enables to compute a bi-partition from collections of local patterns which capture locally strong associations between objects and properties. To validate this framework, we have studied in details the instance CDK-MEANS. It is a K-MEANS-like clustering on collections of formal concepts, i.e., connected closed sets on both dimensions. It enables to build bi-partitions with a user control on overlapping between bi-clusters. We provide an experimental validation on many benchmark datasets and discuss the interestingness of the computed bi-partitions.

Because of the volume of the data to be analyzed, the amount of computation involved, and the need for rapid or even interactive analysis, data mining applications require the use of parallel machines. We have been developing compiler and runtime support for developing scalable implementations of data mining algorithms. Our work encompasses shared memory parallelization, distributed memory parallelization, and optimizations for processing disk-resident datasets. In this paper, we focus on compiler and runtime support for shared memory parallelization of data mining algorithms. We have developed a set of parallelization techniques that apply across algorithms for a variety of mining tasks. We describe the interface of the middleware where these techniques are implemented. Then, we present compiler techniques for translating data parallel code to the middleware specification. Finally, we present a brief evaluation of our compiler using apriori association mining and k-means clustering.

In this paper, a much simpler construction and proof for this are given with much better constants. There are similar bounds for the training distortion of the empirically optimal vector quantizer with three or more levels. These rates, however, do not hold for a one-level quantizer. Here the two-level quantizer case is clarified, showing that it already shares the behavior of the general case. Given that the minimax bounds are proved using a construction that involves discrete distributions, one suspects that for the class of distributions with uniformly bounded continuous densities, the expected distortion redundancy might decrease as o(1/root n) uniformly. It is shown as well that this is not so, proving that the lower bound for the expected test. distortion remains, true. for these subclasses.

The main contribution here is in the representation change to enable better handling of the data. The idea of the method consists from three major steps: (1) First, we transform a graph into a sparse matrix, where for each vertex in the graph there is one sparse vector in the matrix. Sparse vectors have non-zero components for the vertices that are close to the vertex represented by the vector. (2) Next, we perform hierarchical clustering (eg., hierarchical K-Means) on the set of sparse vectors, resulting in the hierarchy of clusters. (3) In the last step, we map hierarchy of clusters into a two-dimensional space in the way that more similar clusters appear closely on the picture. The effect of the whole procedure is that we assign unique X and Y coordinates to each vertex, in a way those vertices or groups of vertices on several levels of hierarchy that are stronger connected in a graph are place. closer in the picture. The method is particular useful for power distributed graphs. We show applications of the method on real-world examples of visualization of institution collaboration graph and cross-sell recommendation graph.

This paper introduces a novel approach to learn distance functions that maximizes the clustering of objects belonging to the same class. Objects belonging to a data set:are clustered with respect to a given distance function and the local class density information of each cluster is then used by a weight adjustment heuristic to modify the distance function so that the class density is increased in the attribute space. This process of interleaving clustering with distance function modification is repeated until a "good" distance function has been found. We implemented our approach using the k-means clustering algorithm. We evaluated our approach using 7 UCI data sets for a traditional 1-nearest-neighbor (1-NN) classifier and a compressed 1-NN classifier, called NCC, that uses the learnt distance function and cluster centroids instead of all the points of a training set. The experimental results show that attribute weighting leads to statistically significant improvements in prediction accuracy over a traditional 1-NN classifier for 2 of the 7 data sets tested, whereas using NCC significantly improves the accuracy of the 1-NN classifier for 4 of the 7 data sets.

Here we show that this problem can be elegantly and efficiently tackled by meta-clustering the clusters produced in several different runs of the algorithm, especially if "sofy" clustering algorithms (such as Nonnegative Matrix Factorization) are used both at the object- and the meta-level. The essential difference w.r.t. other meta-clustering approaches consists in the fact that our algorithm detects frequently occurring sub-clusters (rather than complete clusters) in the various runs, which allows it to outperform existing algorithms. Additionally, we show how to per-form two-way meta-clustering, i.e. take both object and sample dimensions of clusters simultaneously into account, a feature which is essential e.g. for biclustering gene expression data, but has not been considered before.

This technology has been applied to sample clustering and sample prediction. Because of a large number of genes measured, many of the genes in the original data set are irrelevant to the analysis. Selection of discriminatory genes is critical to the accuracy of clustering and prediction. This paper considers statistical significance testing approach to selecting discriminatory gene sets for multi-class clustering and prediction of experimental samples. A toxicogenomic data set with nine treatments (a control and eight metals, As, Cd, Ni, Cr, Sb, Pb, Cu, and AsV with a total of 55 samples) is used to illustrate a general framework of the approach. Among four selected gene sets, a gene set Omega(1) formed by the intersection of the F-test and the set of the union of one-versus-all t-tests performs the best in terms of clustering as well as prediction. Hierarchical and two modified partition (k-means) methods all show that the set Omega(1) is able to group the 55 samples into seven clusters reasonably well, in which the As and AsV samples are considered as one cluster (the same group) as are the Cd and Cu samples. With respect to prediction, the overall accuracy for the gene set Omega(1) using the nearest neighbors algorithm to predict 55 samples into one of the nine treatments is 85%. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

J	Chang, CY				Chang, CY			Spatiotemporal Hopfield neural cube for diagnosing recurrent nasal papillorna	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Hopfied neural network; spatial information; recurrent nasal papilloma; medical image processing; SHNC	IMAGE SEGMENTATION; INVERTED PAPILLOMA; NETWORK	Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used to detect recurrent nasal tumours. A specifically designed two-layer Hopfield neural network, called the spatiotemporal Hopfield neural cube (SHNC), is presented, to be used for detecting recurrent nasal papilloma. Differing from conventional, two-dimensional Hopfield neural networks, the SHNC extends the one-layer, two-dimensional Hopfield network in the original image plane into a two-layer, three-dimensional (3D) Hopfield network with pixel classification implemented in its third dimension. With extended 3D architecture, the network is able to use each pixel's spatial information in a pixel labelling procedure. Because the SHNC takes pixel spatial information into consideration, the effects of tiny detail or noise are removed. As a result, the drawback of disconnected fractions can be avoided. Furthermore, owing to the incorporation of competitive learning rules to update neuron states, to avoid the problem of having to satisfy strong constraints, the convergence of the network was improved. In addition, a more accurate signal-time curve, the relative intensity change (RIC), was adopted to represent the gadolinium-enhanced MRI temporal information, and the RIC curves of recurrent nasal papilloma were incorporated into the SHNC. The experimental results showed that the SHNC could obtain a more appropriate, precise position of recurrent nasal papilloma than the k-means, principal components analysis (PCA) or Eigenimage-filtering methods. The average sensitivity and specificity of the 26 cases were 0.9998 and 0.9961, respectively. These values demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

For example, colonoscopy is an important screening tool for colorectal cancer. Colonoscopy allows for the inspection of the entire colon and provides the ability to perform a number of therapeutic operations during a single procedure. During a colonoscopic procedure, a tiny video camera at the tip of the endoscope generates a video signal of the internal mucosa of the colon. The video data are displayed on a monitor for real-time analysis by the endoscopist. Other endoscopic procedures include upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, enteroscopy, bronchoscopy, cystoscopy, and laparoscopy. However, a significant number of out-of-focus frames are included in this type of videos since current endoscopes are equipped with a single, wide-angle lens that cannot be focused. The out-of-focus frames do not hold any useful information. To reduce the burdens of the further processes such as computer-aided image processing or human expert's examinations, these frames need to be removed. We call an out-of-focus frame as non-informative frame and an in-focus frame as informative frame. We propose a new technique to classify the video frames into two classes, informative and non-informative frames using a combination of Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Texture Analysis, and K-Means Clustering. The proposed technique can evaluate the frames without any reference image, and does not need any predefined threshold value. Our experimental studies indicate that it achieves over 96% of four different performance metrics (i.e. precision, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy).

Structural features of the glands are extracted and used in a tree-structured (TS) algorithm to classify the images into five Gleason grades of 1 to 5. In this algorithm the image is first segmented to locate the glandular regions using texture features and a K-means clustering algorithm. The glands are then labeled from the glandular regions. In each stage of the proposed TS algorithm, shape and intensity-based features of the glands are extracted and used in a linear classifier to classify the image into two groups. Despite some proposed methods in the literature which use only texture features, this technique uses the features like roundness and shape distribution, which are related to the structure of the glands in each grade and are independent of the magnification. The proposed method is therefore robust to illumination and magnification variations. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we use two datasets. Data set I contains 91 images with similar magnifications and illuminations. Data set 2 contains 199 images with different magnifications and illuminations. Using leave-one-out technique, we achieve 95% and 85% accuracy for dataset 1 and 2, respectively.

An important step in this direction is to develop robust algorithms to quantify gene expression in in-situ hybridization (ISH) data. ISH methodology involves the use of labeled nucleic acid probes that bind to specific mRNA transcripts in tissue sections. The bound probe is detected using colorimetric methods and the resulting stained tissue sections are imaged at high resolution. The goals of the present study are to first identify a staining method that produces maximum signal to noise ratio (SNR), and second to develop a method for gene expression detection for a wide range of ISH images spanning different intensity and expression patterns. A simple k-means based clustering method is used to separate foreground labeling from background and non-expressing tissues in a variety of images stained with different staining/ counter staining techniques. We found NBT/BCIP with no counterstain produces the best signal to background separation. The foreground cluster detected using the k-means algorithm was further modeled using a normal distribution. A novel one sided Mahalanobis distance based metric with majority partial ordered voting method was then developed to generate a fuzzy segmentation of the gene expression in each ISH image. This algorithm is fully automatic and facilitates high throughput analysis of large amount of image data. Using this methodology a cluster of 10 PCs was able to process approximately 10% of the mouse genome (17 TBytes of JPEG2000 lossless compressed images) over a period of 2 weeks.

The K-means algorithm performs this structured initialization and the information theoretic criterion of minimum description length (MDL) is used to estimate the number of clusters. We illustrate the method by a set of functional neuroimages from a motor activation study.

This method combines a recent segmentation approach: the L-level set active contours algorithm with unsupervised clustering using the agglomerative hierarchical k-means algorithm. The active contours algorithm has been recently explored as a powerful tool for image segmentation since it automatically decomposes a given image into 2(L) segment classes by utilizing L level set functions and finding the optimal boundaries of the 2(L) segment classes so that the pixel feature values of each segment are as homogeneous as possible. Unfortunately, the algorithm is often trapped at local minima due to the intrinsic non-convexity of the cost function, especially for noisy data. To overcome this problem, we introduce a multi-stage multi-resolution analysis that optimizes the active contours at successive resolutions of the image data. The resulting segments are then re-clustered by subsequent agglomerative hierarchical k-means clustering that seeks the optimal clusters yielding the minimum within-cluster distance in the feature space. The preliminary studies reported here indicate that this proposed methodology can enhance the accuracy of soft tissue segmentation and provide fully automatic tissue differentiation without any user intervention except for specifying the number of level set functions L.

First, the K-mean clustering algorithm is applied to classify the objects. Then, a speed function based on the clustering results is defined in order to search the rough boundary. Secondly, a speed function of the gradient intensity is constructed to locate the boundary accurately. Due to the lack of deformation information of the boundaries between MR slices, a deformable model is used to reconstruct the shape of the LV: a dynamic equation governing the surface deformation is given; from the slice data, external forces are constructed and elastic forces are provided with mean curvatures of the deformation surface. The level set method is applied to solve the dynamic equation for the LV shape. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm listed in the paper.

An embedded local feature weighting method has been proposed in [1]. In this paper, we present a new method based on the same cost function, but performed through a genetic algorithm. The learning process can be performed through an evolutionary approach or through a cooperavive coevolutionary approach. Moreover, the genetic algorithm can be combined with the original Weighting K-means algorithm in a Lamarckian learning paradigm. We compare hill-climbing optimization versus genetic algorithms, evolutionary versus coevolutionary approaches, and Darwinian versus Lamarckian learning on different datasets. The results seem to show that, on the datasets where the original algorithm is efficient, the proposed methods axe even better.

The vertical forest structure was assessed by percentage cover of seven height. classes and the composition of the different layers was described using plant species, or groups of plant species, easily identifiable in the field. Cluster analysis, in particular K-means statistics, was performed using combinations of vertical structure and compositional data, resulting in ten main natural groups or forest types: 1) Quercus pyrenaica forests; 2) Other deciduous oak forests; 3) Arbutus unedo forests; 4) Cistus shrubs; 5) Cytisus shrubs; 6) Acacia forests; 7) Quercus suber forests; 8) Pinus pinaster forests; 9) Eucalyptus forests; and 10) Other forests. The last four groups were further subdivided according to the vertical structure resulting in twenty final forest types. The geographical distribution of these forests types and the implications for biodiversity and other forest issues are presented and discussed.

Cluster labels are mapped to incrementally accumulated clusters, and a matching criterion based on maximum similarity is used. The ensemble method is investigated with bootstrap re-sampling, where the k-means algorithm is used to generate high granularity clusterings. For combining, group average hierarchical meta-clustering is applied and the Jaccard measure is used for cluster similarity computation. Patterns are assigned to combined meta-clusters based on estimated cluster assignment probabilities. The cluster-based cumulative ensembles are more compact than co-association-based ensembles. Experimental results on artificial and real data show reduction of the error rate across varying ensemble parameters and cluster structures.

In those various methods, this paper pays special attention to tables because tables are commonly used within many documents to make the meanings clear, which are well recognized because web documents use tags for additional information. On the Internet, tables are used for the purpose of the knowledge structuring as well as design of documents. Thus, we are firstly interested in classifying tables into two types: meaningful tables and decorative tables. However, this is not easy because HTML does not separate presentation and structure. This paper proposes a method of extracting meaningful tables using a modified k-means and compares it with other methods. The experiment results show that classifying on web documents is promising.

For instance, summarizing sets of documents that all describe the same event requires first identifying and grouping those documents talking about the same event. Document clustering involves dividing a set of documents into non-overlapping clusters. In this paper, we present two document clustering algorithms: grouping algorithm, and chaining algorithm. We compared them with k-means and the EM algorithms. The evaluation results showed that our two algorithms perform better than the k-means and EM algorithms in different experiments.

The goal is to divide stock market trading rules into several classes so that all the trading rules within the same class lead to similar trading decisions in the same stock market conditions. It is achieved using Kohonen self-organizing maps and the K-means algorithm. Several validity indices are used to validate and assess the clustering. Experiments were carried out on 350 stock market trading rules observed over a period of 1300 time instants.

However, in the modeling process, care is taken not to choose the number of the basis functions and the positions of the centres, the regularization parameter and the smoothing parameter as appropriate according to the model complexity, they often gives poor generalization performance. In this paper, we develop a new model building procedure based on radial basis function networks; positioning the centres with k-means clustering for the conditional distribution Pr(x vertical bar y) and estimating the weights by maximum penalized likelihood with Lasso penalty. We present an information criterion for choosing the regularization and smoothing parameters in the models. The proposed procedure determines the proper number and location of the centres automatically. The simulation result shows that the proposed method performs very well.

This is especially vital for high-assurance software systems where software failures can have severe consequences. To achieve the desired software quality, practitioners utilize software quality models to identify high-risk program modules: e.g., software quality classification models are built using training data consisting of software measurements and fault-proneness data from previous development experiences similar to the project currently under-development. However, various practical issues can limit availability of fault-proneness data for all modules in the training data, leading to the data consisting of many modules with no fault-proneness data, i.e., unlabeled data. To address this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised clustering scheme for software quality analysis with limited fault-proneness data. It is a constraint-based semi-supervised clustering scheme based on the k-means algorithm. The proposed approach is investigated with software measurement data of two NASA software projects, JM1 and KC2. Empirical results validate the promise of our semi-supervised clustering technique for software quality modeling and analysis in the presence of limited defect data. Additionally, the approach provides some valuable insight into the characteristics of certain program modules that remain unlabeled subsequent to our semi-supervised clustering analysis.

The latter is based on calculating a cumulated adjacency matrix that gathers the information regarding membership of objects in clusters for each point of time. The color visualization of this matrix allows the investigation of changes in cluster memberships and possible outliers, i.e. objects that change clusters frequently. Results are presented by visualizing sensitivity matrices generated during the simulation of metabolic network models.

The motifs and scoring matrices derived from such conserved regions provide computational tools that recognize similar patterns in novel sequences, and thus enable the prediction of protein function for genomes. The eBLOCKs database enumerates a cascade of protein blocks with varied conservation levels for each functional domain. A biologically important region is most stringently conserved among a smaller family of highly similar proteins. The same region is often found in a larger group of more remotely related proteins with a reduced stringency. Through enumeration, highly specific signatures can be generated from blocks with more columns and fewer family members, while highly sensitive signatures can be derived from blocks with fewer columns and more members as I a superfamily. By applying PSI-BLAST and a modified K-means clustering algorithm, eBLOCKs automatically groups protein sequences according to different levels of similarity. Multiple sequence alignments are made and trimmed into a series of ungapped blocks. Motifs and position-specific scoring matrices were derived from eBLOCKs and made available for sequence search and annotation. The eBLOCKs database provides a tool for high-throughput genome annotation with maximal specificity and sensitivity.

In this paper we present the use of Region-oriented segmentation for Coin Recognition. We use an improved K-Means Clustering Algorithm, which has the advantage to speed up the automatic determining of the optimal number of classes, to group all the gray-levels into several clusters. With the help of this cluster algorithm a label image of original coin image is obtained. In turn, the features such as area, perimeter, compactness and polar distance are extracted from the label image. The coins presented in the image could be recognized by matching the classifiers stored in the database. Several common segmentation approaches are also presented here in comparing to the region-oriented segmentation.

Since many functionally related genes tend to be co-expressed, by identifying groups of genes with similar expression profiles, the functionalities of unknown genes can be inferred from those of known genes in the same group. In this paper we address a novel clustering approach, called seed-based clustering, where seed genes are first systematically chosen by computational analysis of their expression profiles, and then the clusters are generated by using the seed genes as initial values for k-means clustering. The seed-based clustering method has strong mathematical foundations and requires only a few matrix computations for seed extraction. As a result, it provides stability of clustering results by eliminating randomness in the selection of initial values for cluster generation. Our empirical results reported here indicate that the entire, clustering process can be systematically pursued using seedbased clustering, and that its performance is favorable compared to current approaches.

These approaches are 1) a spiking neural-network model for the partitioning of data into clusters, and 2) a neuron model based on complex-valued weights (CVN). In the former model, the learning process is based on the Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity rule under the Hebbian Learning framework. With temporally encoded inputs, the synaptic efficiencies of the delays between the pre- and post-synaptic spikes can store the information of different data clusters. With the encoding method using Gaussian receptive fields, the model was applied to the remote-sensing data. The result showed that it could provide more useful information than using traditional clustering method such as K-means. The CVN model has proved to be more powerful than traditional neuron models in solving the XOR problem and image processing problems. This paper discusses an implementation of the complex-valued neuron in NRBF neural networks to improve the NRBF structure. The complex-valued weights are used in the supervised learning part of an NRBF neural network. This classifier was tested with satellite multi-spectral image data and results show that this neural network model is more accurate and powerful than the conventional NRBF model.

These holograms have complex-valued pixels and a white noise appearance. Uniform and nonuniform scalar quantisation compression have already been applied to the hologram data with some success. Although each complex-valued pixel can itself be treated as a vector of length two, we extend the analysis using a multidimensional vector quantisation technique based on k-means clustering. This involves an a-by-b blockwise decomposition of the data and mapping it to an ab-dimensional space. Degradation due to lossy compression is measured in the reconstruction domain.

Here k-means neurons are used as substitute for the original data points. These neurons are online adaptable extending the standard k-means clustering algorithm. They are equipped with perceptive fields to identify if a presented data. pattern fits within its area it is responsible for. In order to find clusters within the input data an extension of the E-nearest neighbouring algorithm is used to find connected groups within the set of k-means neurons. Most of the information the clustering algorithm needs are taken directly from the input data. Thus only a small number of parameters have to be adjusted. The clustering abilities of the presented algorithm are shown using data sets from two different kind of applications.

Our strategy exploits the intrinsic properties of local interactions between sites of a Markov Random Field model with the parallel computation ability of a CPU. This paper explains how classical iterative site-wise-update algorithms commonly used to optimize global Markovian cost functions can be efficiently implemented in parallel by fragment shaders driven by a fragment processor. This parallel programming strategy significantly accelerates optimization algorithms such as ICM and simulated annealing. Good acceleration are also achieved for parameter estimation procedures such as K-means and ICE. The experiments reported in this paper have been obtained with a mid-end, affordable graphics card available on the market.

In this study, we propose a salient point based texture representation scheme. It is a two-phase analysis in the multiresolution framework of discrete wavelet transform. In the first phase, each wavelet sub-band (LH or HL or HH) is used to compute multiple texture features, which represents various aspects of texture. These features are converted into binary images, called salient point images (SPIs), via an automatic threshold technique that maximizes inter-block pattern deviation (IBPD) metric. Such operation may facilitate combining multiple features for better segmentation. In the final phase, we have proposed a set of new texture features, namely non-salient point density (NSPD), salient point residual (SPR), saliency and non-saliency product (SNP). These features characterize various aspects of image texture like fineness/coarseness, primitive distribution, internal structures etc. K-means algorithm is used to cluster the generated features for unsupervised segmentation. Experimental results with the standard texture (Brodatz) and natural images demonstrate the robustness of the proposed features compared to the wavelet energy (WE) and local extrema density feature (LED).

Since the quality of MR images always gets affected by intensity in-homogeneities (artifacts or noises), generated due to the non-uniformity of magnetic fields during the acquisition process, thereby making segmentation task more difficult. The outputs of the hidden layer neurons of the FARBF-NN have been modified using a fuzzy membership function to eliminate the effect of noises present in the input image. The proposed method has been tested both on simulated and real patient MR brain images for segmentation and found to be better than the k-means clustering algorithm, the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm, and the RBF neural network that uses k-means clustering algorithm to select the centers of the RBFs in the hidden layer, in most of the cases.

Because of high labour, energy and chemical demands, automatic detection and removal is needed. Two methods for colour based machine vision detection of volunteer potato plants in sugar beet and cereal fields were compared. An Adaptive Neural Network and a combination of K-means clustering/Bayes classifier gave almost the same results. The best result was obtained in detecting volunteer potato plants in sugar beet fields when the classification results were judged at plant level instead of pixel level. Actually these results at plant level are the required input for a plant specific removal system.

One reason for this is the prohibitive costs associated with current data requirements for implementation of SSCM. The objectives of this study were (i) to develop an efficient method for identifying potential site-specific management classes across an entire farm and (ii) to investigate ways of utilising a whole-farm classification for farm management. An example is provided for a 3000 ha dryland grains farm located in north-west NSW, Australia. Geospatial data about soil, crop and landscape attributes that exist for the farm were used. Fuzzy k-means analysis was used to derive potential management classes for three fields.

In this paper an approach for grouping data sets that are indexed in the if, C space is proposed. It is based on the k-means algorithm and grid clustering. The former is the simplest and most commonly used clustering technique. A major problem with this algorithm is that it is sensitive to the selection of the initial partition. The latter is commonly used for grouping data that are indexed in the space. The goal in this paper is to overcome the high sensitivity of the k-means algorithm to the starting conditions by using the available spatial information. A semivariogram-based grid clustering is introduced. It uses the spatial correlation for determining the bin size. Since the bins are constrained to regular blocks while the spatial distribution of objects is not regular, we propose to combine this technique with a conventional k-means algorithm. By using the semivariogram an excellent initialization of the k-means is provided. Experimental results show that the final partition. preserves the spatial distribution of the objects.

Enlightened by the self-organizing behavior of ant society, we assign acceptance rates on the directed edges of a pheromone digraph in Ant-Cluster system. The pheromone on the edges of the digraph is adaptively updated by the ants passing it. Some edges with less pheromone are progressively removed under a list of certain thresholds in the process. Strong connected components of the final digraph are extracted as clusters. The performance of Ant-Cluster is compared with classical K-means clustering algorithm and ACO clustering algorithm LF in terms of clustering quality and efficiency on several real datasets and clustering benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that the Ant-Cluster is able to find clusters faster with better clustering quality and is easier to implement than K-means and LF.

So the application of traditional PCA-based fault detection method can bring many misdiagnoses. A reformative PCA-based fault detection method suitable for power plant process is proposed. First K-mean cluster analysis is used to classify the process data and obtain the data sets under the various stable operating condition. Then the PCM group is established using the classified data sets to describe the entire process. Finally the detecting sample is carried on fuzzy partition during fault detecting and the PCM suitable for current operating condition is dynamically calculated and used for fault detection. The field data is used to contrast the application of traditional method with reformative method in the fault detection of boiler process. The results indicate that the reformative method can adapt the operating condition change, reduce the misdiagnosis and enhance the detection sensitivity.

But the computing complexity is relatively high so that it is not fitted to solve large amount of sample calculation problems. K-means method has high efficiency while it is affected easily by the choice of the center of initial clustering. So to the irregular distributed samples, the clustering effect is usually not good. The paper focuses on the distribution features and complexities of samples in Web page classification and puts forward a classification method ---- to combine the layered clustering and plane partition. Firstly we use the algorithm of layered clustering in a few of samples to generate original clustering centers of sample set. Secondly, K-means method is used to classify the whole samples set. This strategy not only takes full advantage of the high efficiency of the K-means algorithm but also makes good use of the high precision and reliability of layered clustering method. Finally, this paper apply the method of combining the layered clustering and plane partition to solving the problems of text classification and presents some experimental results.

This algorithm can reduce the dimensionality of the text data efficiently, thus it can improve accurate rate and running speed of the clustering algorithm. The results of clustering texts by the FTSC algorithm cannot reflect the overlap of texts' classes. Based on the FTSC algorithm, its improved algorithm-Frequent Term Set-based Hierarchical Clustering algorithm (FTSHC) is given. This algorithm can determine the overlap of texts, classes by the overlap of frequent words sets, and provide an understandable description of the discovered clusters by the frequent terms sets. The experiment results prove that FTSC and FTSHC algorithms are more efficient than K-Means algorithm in the performance of clustering.

To measure the closeness between feature vectors, similarity metrics play a key role and they directly impact the clustering performance. This paper develops a framework of learning pseudo metrics (LPM) for semantic image clustering practice. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) is employed to model the LPM with a set of criteria on evaluating the LPM quality and availability. Using a standard k-Mean clustering technique, a comparative study is carried out to demonstrate the significance of our proposed LPM in semantic image clustering. Experiments show that the LPM-based similarity metric can produce better clustering results in terms of both impurity and robustness.

In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for refining initial clustering centers. In the algorithm we define two new measurements to measure a point's local density and then produce a clustering center with local maximal density for each duster using either of measurements. After refinement, these clustering algorithms which are sensitive to initial clustering centers will converge to a "better" local minimum more efficiently and more rapidly. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is feasible and efficient.

Much of the previous work on clustering focused on numerical data whose inherent geometric properties could be exploited to naturally defined distance functions between data objects. However, in CRM, there are many mixed numerical and categorical, datasets. In this paper, a new clustering algorithm, k-centers, is introduced. It extends the k-means algorithm to mixed numerical and categorical domain by employing a new similarity measure and a new method on updating the centers. The well known credit approval dataset is used to demonstrate the performance.

The algorithm includes three levels: Level-0 agents build solutions, level-1 agents improve solutions and level-2 agents update pheromone matrix. The updated pheromone then provides feedback information for the next iteration of solution construction. Mutation probability and pheromone resistance are the adaptive parameters, which can be adjusted automatically during the evolution progress to solve the contradiction between convergence speed and precocity and stagnation. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more effective compared with the clustering algorithm based on GA and k-means, and the clustering quality and efficiency are promising.

DUET (Degenerate Unmixing Estimation Technique) has previously been shown to achieve excellent source separation in real time in software. The current work is a move towards a hardware realization of DUET that will allow integration of the algorithm into consumer devices. Initial stages involve investigating the performance of DUET when implemented in fixed-point arithmetic and a consideration of algorithmic changes to make DUET more amenable to implementation on a DSP processor. Performance is compared for floating-point and fixed-point implementations. A Weighted K-means clustering algorithm is presented as an alternative to gradient descent methods for peak tracking and demonstrated to achieve excellent performance without adversely affecting computational load. Preliminary performance figures are given for an implementation on a TMS320VC5510 DSK.

This approach combines an incremental genetic algorithm with K-means clustering. The main difference of our approach from the original lies in that we get rid of illegal solutions, which were allowed in the original, during whole evolution process of the genetic algorithm from initialization to its termination. The improvement in our approach is accomplished through changing the way of generating initial population in initialization phase and changing the method of dealing with empty clusters in mutation operation. Thus, the illegal solutions were eliminated from our algorithm and resulting more efficient time performance. Experimental results show that our improved genetic approach is promising.

Clustering analysis is an important approach of data mining. This paper introduces a new concept of Dynamic Data Windows, and then puts forward a new fusion clustering algorithm with Dynamic Data Windows, the idea of k-means algorithm and density-based method. This new fusion clustering algorithm overcomes some disadvantages of traditional methods. Comparing with clustering based on density, integrated clustering analysis algorithm and clustering based on ANN, the new fusion clustering algorithm is more valuable in data mining. This new fusion clustering algorithm was used in Geographic Information System (GIS).

Many clustering methods have been proposed in the last few decades with different backgrounds. An open problem in clustering field is the lack of a benchmark for contrasting all these algorithms as well as other available ones. In this paper, we use the well-known Log Marginal Likelihood (LML) score and classification accuracy as two criteria of comparison. Experiment results on K-Means, Expectation Maximization (EM) and Farthest-First in the t-test show that EM outperforms other two algorithms on most of the benchmark data sets with respect to both criteria. Considering the performance and comprehensibility of EM, it is an ideal model that could be used in many real world applications.

The first method is a pseudo-ranking scheme that helps the decision maker select solutions that reflect his/her preferences. In the second approach we used clustering techniques used in data mining, to group the data by using the k-means algorithm to find clusters of similar solutions, which allows the decision maker to have just k solutions to choose from without using any objective function preference information. Under this second method, from the clustered Pareto optimal set, we attempted to find solutions which are likely to be more relevant to the decision maker, which are solutions where a small improvement in one objective would lead to a large deterioration in at least one other objective. To show how these methods work, the well-known Redundancy Allocation Problem was solved as a multiple objective problem by using the NSGA genetic algorithm to initially find the Pareto optimal solutions, and then, the two proposed methods are applied to prune the Pareto set.

In this paper, we present a multicategory SVMs-based (Support Vector Machines) image categorization system by exclusively using global low-level features. Images are represented by the MPEG-7 SCD (Scalable Color Descriptor) and the modified MPEG-7 EHD (Edge Histogram Descriptor), which are verified by the K-Means algorithm to be effective. The K-Means algorithm is also applied to select training images. Multi-category SVMs using the Gaussian RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernels are further evaluated on the categorization of the image database with general-purpose images from COREL. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed categorization method outperforms the peer approaches in the literature in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. In addition, each test image is labeled by a set of confidence values for each possible category.

In order to develop a coarse classification scheme which is low dependent on domain-specific knowledge, discrete cosine transform (DCT) is employed to extract general and reliable features for vision-oriented applications, such as optical character recognition (OCR). Our coarse classification scheme is based on k-means clustering. On classifying an unknown object, the classes within the clusters that satisfy some thresholds are chosen as candidates. In this way, a large number of improbable candidates can be eliminated at the earlier stage, and only few surviving candidates need to be further examined in the subsequent fine classification process. This scheme can significantly reduce the classification time while maintaining the classification accuracy. Some experimental results are given to show the validity of our approach in the case of recognizing handwritten characters in Chinese paleography.

Partitioning and hierarchical clustering methods are most widely used algorithms. Other investigators proposed to use bisecting K-means method for document clustering and their experimental results have indicated that the bisecting K-means method is the preferred method for document clustering [16]. However, in our research we have found that, whereas the bisecting K-means method has advantages when working with large datasets, a traditional hierarchical clustering algorithm still achieves the best performance for small datasets.

In this paper we present a K-means clustering algorithm based upon particle swarm optimization (PSO K-means) for microarray data clustering. This algorithm discovers clusters in microarray data without prior knowledge of feasible cluster numbers or complex parameter settings, which are required by other clustering methods. PSO K-means is able to bring out the latent structure of microarray data sets. A Significant reduction in within cluster error was obtained using this procedure, without considerable reduction in inter-cluster dissimilarity.

AI tools were used to explore complex space of data that similar datasets show. The technique described aimed to analyse data contained in Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database (WBCD)[1][2][3], results were therefore employed in Intelligent System designing. High dimensions and information redundancy characterise this database. The employment of statistical analysis techniques returned relevant basic information; even though their employment in dataset with more complex information distributions has highlighted important limits. In this paper we describe an intelligent pattern discovery method that uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and other intelligent techniques to explore the space of parameters and to acquire useful knowledge for breast cancer diagnosis. Basic results obtained by ANN's were supported by Data-Mining techniques and Intelligent System validation. Potentialities of similar methods in biomedical databases analysis have been proofed in real world applications with competitive results.

The aim of segmentation is to classify an image into parts that have a strong correlation with objects in order to reflect the actual information collected from the real world. Clustering is a major global approach for segmentation and it relies on partition of images into a set of layers or regions for further analysis. The image segmentation by clustering basically refers to grouping similar data points into different clusters. In this article, an unsupervised clustering technology is proposed for processing large scale satellite images taken from remote celestial sites where none explicit teacher is introduced. As an effective approach, K-means clustering method requires that certain number of clusters for partitioning be specified and its distance metric be defined to quantify relative orientation of objects. Then image processing system forms clusters from input patterns. Diversified large scale image features are investigated using unsupervised methods. In the mean while, to limit computational complexity for the consideration of real time processing, a simple study is conducted where tristimulus values are selected to represent three-layer color space. Simulation results show that this approach is very successful for spatial image processing.

The fuzzy k-mean (FKM) has been applied in soil classification by McBratney and de Gruijter (1992). In this paper, the results of the FKM are compared to soil groups classified by using Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) for investigating the engineering properties of soil. Additionally, the fuzzy similarity of grain-size distribution (FSGSD) is presented to improve the ability of FKM in soil classification. The validity of classification with FKM can be up to 87% and with FSGSD up to 93%. Since one-level FKM cannot identify the different features of soil groups significantly, the nested FKM and nested FSGSD method is also presented to improve the ability of classification in sub-groups. The nested FKM can identify the soil groups when the group number is over four. The comparison on results of the nested FKM and nested FSGSD is also performed, and it is found that the nested FSGSD remain to be superior to nested FKM.

Commonly, the topology of the dataset has to be preserved, implying that unconnected parts of a cluster (so-called holes) have to be avoided. We develop a new Voronoi clustering technique based on the k-means scheme. For this purpose, we construct generalized distance functions th at guarantee topological correctness. The distance functions are given by a custom definition of the unit neighborhood of seed points. Using a region-growing algorithm that is independent of the used distance function and-specific weighting, we arrive at a flexible and general topology-preserving clustering method. We apply our scheme to several both multi-dimensional and scattered data examples from the field of geospatial planning and urban development. However, the domain-independent algorithm can easily be used in many other clustering and classification tasks.

Clustering With Constraints: Feasibility Issues and the k-Means Algorithm	PROCEEDINGS OF THE FIFTH SIAM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING	SIAM Proceedings Series		English	Proceedings Paper	5th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining	APR 21-23, 2005	Newport Beach, CA	SIAM, Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Ctr Appl Sci Comp, Amer Stat Assoc		k-Means clustering; constraints		Recent work has looked at extending the k-Means algorithm to incorporate background information in the form of instance level must-link and cannot-link constraints. We introduce two ways of specifying additional background information in the form of delta and epsilon constraints that operate on all instances but which can be interpreted as conjunctions or disjunctions of instance level constraints and hence are easy to implement. We present complexity results for the feasibility of clustering under each type of constraint individually and several types together. A key finding is that determining whether there is a feasible solution satisfying all constraints is, in general, NP-complete. Thus, an iterative algorithm such as k-Means should not try to find a feasible partitioning at each iteration. This motivates our derivation of a new version of the k-Means algorithm that minimizes the constrained vector quantization error but at each iteration does not attempt to satisfy all constraints. Using standard UCI datasets, we find that using constraints improves accuracy as others have reported, but we also show that our algorithm reduces the number of iterations until convergence. Finally, we illustrate these benefits and our new constraint types on a complex real world object identification problem using the infra-red detector on an Aibo robot.	[Davidson, Ian; Ravi, S.

The reported results are promising. MOKGA gives the optimal number of clusters as a solution set. The achieved clustering results are then analyzed and validated under several cluster validity techniques proposed in the literature. The optimal clusters are ranked for each validity index. The approach is tested by conducting experiments using three well-known data sets. The obtained results for each dataset are compared with those reported in the literature to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

We provide a systematic analysis and extensions of NMF to the symmetric W = HH(T), and the weighted W = HSH(T). We show that (1) W = HH(T) is equivalent to Kernel K-means clustering and the Laplacian-based spectral clustering. (2) X = FG(T) is equivalent to simultaneous clustering of rows and columns of a bipartite graph. Algorithms are given for computing these symmetric NMFs.

During the last few years, fuzzy set theory has been integrated into many association rule mining algorithms. However, one of the problems of these algorithms is. the requirement of the number of clusters and the membership functions a priori: In general, his number is unknown until the problem is solved. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes two algorithms to efficiently generate the number of clusters and the fuzzy membership functions from large databases. One approach is based on the expectation maximization concept and the other is by the combined use of the K-means clustering algorithm and validity index iteration. Using the data sets provided by ERUDIT and easily available from the Internet, this paper illustrates the advantages of the proposed approaches. A comparison of the two proposed approaches is also provided.

The procedure requires merging the clusters that a k-means iteration has made to avoid unsuitable division caused by the division order. By using this additional merging operation, the case of adequate clustering was increased for various types of simulation runs. With no prior information about the number of clusters, our method can get the optimal clustering based on information theory instead of on a heuristic method. The computational complexity of our method is O(N log k) for the sample size N and the number of final clusters, k.

However, one of its drawbacks is the requirement for the number of clusters, K, to be specified before the algorithm is applied. This paper first reviews existing methods for selecting the number of clusters for the algorithm. Factors that affect this selection are then discussed and a new measure to assist the selection is proposed. The paper concludes with an analysis of the results of using the proposed measure to determine the number of clusters for the K-means algorithm for different data sets.

These methods are well studied and well established. However, both categories have some drawbacks related to data dimensionality (for partitional algorithms) and to the bottom-up structure (for hierarchical algorithms). To overcome these limitations, we present a hierarchical clustering algorithm based on a completely different principle, which is the analysis of shared farthest neighbors. The principle of operation and the rationale are illustrated, and experimental results on different data sets are presented.

However both implicitly make the assumption that the inputs to the learning are independent and identically distributed (iid) which facilitates the choice of learning parameters. The probability distribution of iid inputs with a cluster structure is modelled by a static mixture model while in the non-iid case a dynamic mixture model is used. The K-SCM (Symbol String Clustering Map) algorithm is described as a robust means of clustering symbol string data requiring no time varying learning rate and hence does not assume the inputs are iid.

The proposed self-supervised learning method is a combination of unsupervised clustering K-Means Fast Learning Artificial Neural Network (KFLANN) and a typical supervised Backpropagation learning algorithm (BP Network). Complementary benefits of both algorithms motivated the development of the hybrid model. The KFLANN clustering output is used as the target value for BP training, resulting in an efficient self-supervised learning model. Experimental results are comparable with non-hybrid individual algorithm.

To better estimate the true level of morbidity associated with gastrointestinal illness in the community, several countries have conducted population-based studies. Unfortunately, comparing the results of such studies is complicated because the symptom-based case definitions used varies, despite the fact the studies are often aimed at evaluating the same phenomenon. This potential problem, although widely noted in the literature, has not been formally explored. The research presented here demonstrates the impact of using different symptom-based case definitions on the observed epidemiology of acute gastrointestinal illness by applying previously published case definitions to a common, population-based data set and then using clustering (k-means and SOM) to create a dato-driven view of the cases.

Detecting and tracking of such targets is a challenging task. Although Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been used to solve this problem, they need a lot of training time. In order to reduce the training time, we propose Principal Component Analysis as a dimension reduction technique. We used an MLP with LM learning algorithm and a RBF Neural Network (RBFNN) with K-means algorithm to cluster the data. Both the ANNs are used in a Neural Adaptive Line Enhancer (NALE) configuration. Extensive computer simulations showed the combination of PCA and ANNs gives satisfactory results with significant reduction in training time.

In this algorithm, each document as well as each cluster mean is represented as a high-dimensional unit-length vector. However, it has been mainly used in batch mode. That is, each cluster mean vector is updated, only after all document vectors being assigned, as the (normalized) average of all the document vectors assigned to that cluster. This paper investigates an online version of the spherical k-means algorithm based on the well-known Winner-Take-All competitive learning. In this online algorithm, each cluster centroid is incrementally updated given a document. We demonstrate that the online spherical k-means algorithm can achieve significantly better clustering results than the batch version, especially when an annealing-type learning rate schedule is used. We also present heuristics to improve the speed, yet almost without loss of clustering quality.

It utilizes K-Means Fast Learning Artificial Neural Network (KFLANN) subnets and a Canonical Covariance Feature Compression (C2FeCom) process. The embedded individual KFLANN subnet autonomously derives the essential localized network parameters from the input data and in the process, builds a hierarchical network. The C2FcCom feature compression process extracts the independent parameters in compact representations from subnets. The proposed algorithm is experimentally evaluated using benchmark datasets.

Lloyd's method) for k-means clustering. Our upper bounds are polynomial in the number of points, number of clusters, and the spread of the point set. We also present a lower bound, showing that in the worst case the k-means heuristic needs to perform Omega(n) iterations, for It points on the real line and two centers. Surprisingly, the spread of the point set in this construction is polynomial. This is the first construction showing that the k-means heuristic requires more than a polylogarithmic number of iterations. Furthermore, we present two alternative algorithms, with guaranteed performance, which are simple variants of the k-means method.

Our proposed approach is an object-based image indexing. For each block of size 8*8 in DCT domain a feature vector is extracted. Then, feature vectors of all blocks of image using a k-means algorithm is clustered into groups. Each cluster represents a special object of the image. Then we select some clusters that have largest members after clustering. The centroids of the selected clusters are taken as image feature vectors and indexed into the database.

One of the most widely used clustering techniques is the k-means algorithm. Solutions obtained from this technique are dependent on the initialization of cluster centers. In this article we propose a new algorithm to initialize the clusters. The proposed algorithm is based on finding a set of medians extracted from a dimension with maximum variance. The algorithm has been applied to different data sets and good results are obtained.

This approach is applied to unsupervised image classification. The proposed approach automatically determines the "optimum" number of clusters and simultaneously clusters the data set with minimal user interference. The algorithm starts by partitioning the data set into a relatively large number of clusters to reduce the effects of initial conditions. Using binary particle swarm optimization the "best" number of clusters is selected. The centers of the chosen clusters is then refined via the K-means clustering algorithm. The experiments conducted show that the proposed approach generally found the "optimum" number of clusters on the tested images.	[Omran, Mahamed G.

The fundamental data clustering is to group a set of patterns into clusters in such a way that patterns within a valid cluster are more similar to each other than they are to a pattern belonging to a different cluster. Clustering is very important to data mining. The K-Means algorithm, one of the partitional clustering approaches, is an iterative clustering technique that has been applied to many practical clustering problems successfully. However, the K-Means algorithm suffers from several drawbacks. In this paper, we combine an adaptive genetic algorithm and the K-Means method to cluster the given data. Experimental results on some real-life data sets are given to illustrate the utility of the proposed approach.

In the first step the clusters are obtained (aggregation step) and in the second one the concepts or properties for those clusters are generated (characterization step). We consider the conceptual k-means management of mixed, qualitative and quantitative, features is inappropriate. Therefore, in this paper, a new conceptual k-means algorithm using similarity functions is proposed. In the aggregation step we propose to use a different clustering strategy, which allows working in a more natural way with object descriptions in terms of quantitative and qualitative features. In addition, an improvement of the characterization step and a new quality measure for the generated concepts are presented. Some results obtained after applying both, the original and the modified algorithms on different databases are shown. Also, they are compared using the proposed quality measure.

This algorithm has the disadvantage that it depends on the initial conditions, for that reason, the global k-means algorithm was proposed to solve this problem. On the other hand, the k-means algorithm only works with numerical features. This problem is solved by the k-means algorithm with similarity functions that allows working with qualitative and quantitative variables and missing data (mixed and incomplete data). However, this algorithm still depends on the initial conditions. Therefore, in this paper an algorithm to solve the dependency on initial conditions of the k-means algorithm with similarity functions is proposed, our algorithm is tested and compared against k-means algorithm with similarity functions.

However, all the above algorithms assume that each feature of the samples plays an uniform contribution for cluster analysis. To consider the particular contributions of different features, a novel feature weighted fuzzy clustering algorithm is proposed in this paper, in which the ReliefF algorithm is used to assign the weights for every feature. By weighting the features of samples, the above three clustering algorithms can be unified, and better classification results can be also achieved. The experimental results with various real data sets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

In many domains, the data objects are described in terms of a large number of features, like in gene expression experiments, or in samples characterized by spectral information. The Leader and several k-means algorithms are used as fast procedures for attribute set simplification of the information systems presented to the rough sets algorithms. The data submatrices described in terms of these features are then discretized w.r.t the decision attribute according to different rough set based schemes. From them, the reducts and their derived rules are extracted, which are applied to test data in order to evaluate the resulting classification accuracy. An exploration of this approach (using Leukemia gene expression data) was conducted in a series of experiments within a high-throughput distributed-computing environment. They led to subsets of genes with high discrimination power. Good results were obtained With no preprocessing applied to the data.

So it becomes necessary to develop effective clustering techniques to extract the fundamental patterns inherent in the data. In this paper, we propose a novel evolutionary algorithm so called quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm (QEA) for minimum sum-of-squares clustering. We use a new representation form and add an additional mutation operation in QEA. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm has better global search ability and is superior to some conventional clustering algorithms such as k-means and self-organizing maps.

These methods, including fuzzy k-means and expectation maximization, allow an object to be assigned to multi-clusters with different degrees of membership. However the memberships that result from fizzy clustering algorithms are difficult to analyze and visualize, and usually are converted to 0-1 memberships. In this paper, we propose a geometric framework to visualize fuzzy-clustered data. The scheme provides a geometric visualization by grouping the objects with similar cluster membership, and shows clear advantages over existing methods, demonstrating its capabilities for viewing and navigating inter-cluster relationships in a spatial manner.

Clustering algorithms, such as hierarchical clustering, self-organizing maps, k-means and fuzzy k-means, have become important tools for expression analysis of microarray data. However the need of prior knowledge of the number of clusters, k, and the fuzziness parameter b, limits the usage of fuzzy clustering. Few approaches have been proposed for assigning the best possible values for such parameters. In this paper, we use simulated annealing and fuzzy k-means clustering to determine the optimal parameters, namely the number of clusters, k, and the fuzziness parameter b. Our results show that a nearly-optimal pair of k and b can be obtained without exploring the entire search space.

A popular k-means algorithm groups data by firstly assigning all data points to the closest clusters, then determining the cluster means. The algorithm repeats these two steps until it has converged. We propose a variation called weighted k-means to improve the clustering scalability. To speed up the clustering process, we develop the reservoir-biased sampling as an efficient data reduction technique since it performs a single scan over a data set. Our algorithm has been designed to group data of mixture models. We present an experimental evaluation of the proposed method.

This knowledge is critical to many activity-based models, and it aids our understanding of activity/travel behavior. This paper aims to develop a methodology for the clustering of these patterns. There is a large number of well-known clustering algorithms, such as hierarchical clustering, or k-means clustering (which belongs to the class of partitioning algorithm). However, these algorithms cannot be used to cluster categorical data, so they do not suit the problem of clustering of activity patterns well. Several other heuristics have been developed to overcome this problem. The k-medoids algorithm, described in this paper, is a modification of the k-means algorithm with respect to categorical data. However, similar to the k-means algorithm, the k-medoids algorithm can converge to local optima. This paper approaches the inedoids-based formulation of clustering problem using genetic algorithms (GAs), a probabilistic search algorithm that simulates natural evolution. The main objective of this paper is to develop a robust algorithm that suits the problem of clustering of activity patterns and to demonstrate and discuss its properties.

We show that spectral clustering, normalized cuts, kernel K-means and the various normalizations of the associated affinity matrix are particular instances and approximations of this general principle. We propose an efficient algorithm for achieving a completely positive factorization and extend the basic clustering scheme to situations where partial label information is available.

Codebooks are usually constructed by using a method such as k-means to cluster the descriptor vectors of patches sampled either densely ('textons') or sparsely ('bags of features' based on keypoints or salience measures) from a set of training images. This works well for texture analysis in homogeneous images, but the images that arise in natural object recognition tasks have far less uniform statistics. We show that for dense sampling, k-means over-adapts to this, clustering centres almost exclusively around the densest few regions in descriptor space and thus failing to code other informative regions. This gives suboptimal codes that ore no better than using randomly selected centres. We describe a scalable acceptance-radius based clusterer that generates better codebooks and study its performance on several image classification tasks. We also show that dense representations outperform equivalent keypoint based ones on these tasks and that SVM or Mutual Information based feature selection starting from a dense codebook further improves the performance.

In such a database, a query consists of a pair (S, f) where S is a set of rows in the database and f is a function mapping database rows to {0, 1}. The true response is Sigma(r is an element of s)f(DBr), a noisy version of which is released. Results in [3, 4] show that a strong form of privacy can be maintained using a surprisingly small amount of noise, provided the total number of queries is sublinear in the number n of database rows. We call this a sub-linear queries (SuLQ) database. The assumption of sublinearity becomes reasonable as databases grow increasingly large. The SuLQ primitive - query and noisy reply - gives rise to a calculus of noisy computation. After reviewing some results of [4] on multi-attribute SuLQ, we illustrate the power of the SuLQ primitive with three examples [2]: principal component analysis, k means clustering, and learning in the statistical queries learning model.

Multiregime traffic speed-density relationships are more plausible than single-regime models for representing traffic flow over the entire range of density. However, a major difficulty associated with multiregime models is that the breakpoints of regimes are determined in an ad hoc and subjective manner. This paper proposes the use of cluster analysis as a natural tool for the segmentation of speed-density data. After data segmentation, regression analysis can be used to fit each data subset individually. Numerical examples with three real traffic data sets are presented to illustrate such an approach. Using cluster analysis, modelers have the flexibility to specify the number of regimes. It is shown that the K-means algorithm (where K represents the number of clusters) with original (nonstandardized) data works well for this purpose and can be conveniently used in practice.

Previous methods used for handling missing data (e.g., deleting cases with incomplete information, or substituting the missing values with estimated mean scores), though simple to implement, axe problematic because these methods may result in biased data models. Fortunately, recent advances in theoretical and computational statistics have led to more flexible techniques to deal with the missing data problem. In this paper, we present missing data imputation methods based on clustering, one of the most popular techniques in Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD). We combine clustering with soft computing, which tends to be more tolerant of imprecision and uncertainty, and apply fuzzy and rough clustering algorithms to deal with incomplete data. The experiments show that a hybridization of fuzzy set and rough set theories in missing data imputation algorithms leads to the best performance among our four algorithms, i.e., crisp K-means, fuzzy K-means, rough K-means, and rough-fuzzy K-means imputation algorithms.

In the beginning, three methods, such as K-means, CA-Clustering and Blobworld, were used for region generation in this paper. Comparing their results, the retrieval results using Blobworld perform better than the other two. Therefore, Blobworld is chosen to generate regions in the following experiments. After generating a few regions in an image, in this paper, a few heterogeneous features, such as color signature, moments, contrast, anisotropy, edge orientation histogram, edge density, perimeter, area, position, etc. were used for region matching. According to the variations of two or more query regions, the weights to each feature were automatically generated. Furthermore, the individual indexing was built and maintained for each heterogeneous feature, i.e., separated feature indexing. Once the retrieval results from separated feature indexing were obtained, two processes about normalization and combining distances from these heterogeneous features should be completed in order to achieve the final retrieval result. In our experiments, two functions were tested for normalizing heterogeneous distances and four functions for combining the normalized distances into a global measure. The experimental results show that the best result can be obtained by using the one based on norml and meant operations. We used the precision/recall and the average normalized modified retrieval rank (ANMRR) to evaluate the experiments in this paper.

We derive the optimal nonlinear beamforming assisted receiver designed for binary phase shift keying (BPSK) signalling. It is shown that this optimal Bayesian beamformer significantly outperforms the classic linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) beamformer at the expense of an increased complexity. Hence the achievable user capacity of the wireless system invoking the proposed beamformer is substantially enhanced. In particular, when the angular separation between the desired and interfering signals is below a certain threshold, a linear beamformer will fail while a nonlinear beamformer can still perform adequately. Blockadaptive implementation of the optimal Bayesian beamformer can be realized using a Radial Basis Function network based on the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) for classification, and a recursive sample-by-sample adaptation is proposed based on an enhanced k-means clustering aided recursive least squares algorithm.

Several clustering algorithms are addressed using both the hierarchical agglomerative concept and partitional approaches. In the later class of algorithms, we explore: an adaptation of the K-means algorithm to string patterns using the median string as cluster representative; the error-correcting parsing approach by Fu; and the very recent spectral clustering approach. These algorithms are applied using several-dissimilarity measures, namely: minimum code length based measures; dissimilarity based on the concept of reduction in grammatical complexity; and error-correcting parsing. In a first instance, clustering algorithms are applied individually to the image data set, and results are evaluated in terms of the error rate, taking as ground truth known labeling of the data. In a second step, we combine multiple data partitions, that we call a clustering ensemble, using three state-of-the-art clustering combination techniques. Results show that combination methods lead in general to better data partitioning, as compared to ground truth information.

Due to the impact of the factors varying with delivery, the success of project is hard to predict. In addition, those impact factors containing uncertain, vague, and incomplete information increase the predictive difficulty. The objective of this research is to adopt the Evolutionary Fuzzy Neural Inference Model (EFNIM) to develop a dynamic project success prediction model. To achieve the goal, the major factors affecting the project success in the construction time frame were identified. The proposed method can assist project mangers to make proper decisions enforcing the management and control of the influencing factors. This study firstly developed a dynamic project success prediction database based on the research results of the CAPP (Continuous Assessment of Project Performance) system. CAPP system was used to identify the significant factors influencing the project success. Combining the Data Mining technique, 52 historical construction projects were clustered into groups using the K-means method. Cases with higher similarity were categorized within each cluster as training sets for EFNIM. Furthermore, the predictive results before and after clustering were compared to prove that training cases preprocessed through Data Mining treatment can improve the prediction accuracy of the EFNIM.

It enhances the K-Means clustering algorithm [1] so that the number of clusters is determined at run time. The paper uses radar classification problem as an example application. Most of naturally existing processes possess Gaussian distribution because of central limit theorem. This paper assumes that parameters of radars are Gaussian. Chi-Squared test for goodness of fit is used for evaluating the hypothesized distribution from sampled data.

The analysis was performed on retinas in which AP expression was activated by Cre-mediated DNA recombination in a small fraction of cells. Recombination was controlled pharmacologically and, to a first approximation, appears to have occurred randomly. The morphologies of 794 inner retinal neurons have been analyzed by measuring arbor area, stratification level, and neurite branching patterns. When analyzed in this multidimensional parametric space, the cells can be clustered into subgroups by visual inspection and by using the Ward's and K-means algorithms. One application of this cell morphology data set and cluster analysis is as a standard for comparison with the retinas of genetically altered mice. This work illustrates the utility and feasibility of genetically directed marking methods for large-scale surveys of neuronal morphology. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

J	Valenzuela, N; Adams, DC; Bowden, RM; Gauger, AC				Valenzuela, N; Adams, DC; Bowden, RM; Gauger, AC			Geometric morphometric sex estimation for hatchling turtles: A powerful alternative for detecting subtle sexual shape dimorphism	COPEIA			English	Article							CARETTA-CARETTA; MORPHOLOGY	Identifying sex of hatchling turtles is difficult because juveniles are not obviously externally dimorphic, and current techniques to identify sex are often logistically unfeasible for field studies. We demonstrate a widely applicable and inexpensive alternative to detect subtle but significant sexual dimorphism in hatchlings, using landmark-based geometric morphometric methods. With this approach, carapace landmarks were digitized from photographs of each hatchling, and shape variables were generated after variation in size, location and orientation were eliminated. These variables were then analyzed for sexual dimorphism, and used in discriminant function analysis to estimate sex of each hatchling. Using this approach on two species (Chrysemys picta and Podocnemis expansa), we found this method had high accuracy in assigning sex when compared with true sex (98% and 90%, respectively), and cross-validation revealed a correct classification rate of 85%. These correct classification rates were considerably higher than those found on the same species using linear distance measurements as data. We also explored two alternative statistical approaches for assessing sex (K-means clustering and multiple logistic regression) and found that these alternative approaches were accurate only 61% and 78% of the time, respectively, in C picta and 69% and 77% of the time in P expansa. These findings are similar to classification rates found for turtle species using approaches based on linear distance measurements. We also found that the observed sexual dimorphism differed between the two species. In P expansa, males displayed relatively more expansion of the central region of the carapace relative to females, whereas in C picta this pattern was reversed. We conclude that discriminant analysis of morphology quantified using geometric morphometrics provides researchers with a powerful tool to discriminate between male and female hatchling turtles.

In the multi-texture classification, the textural parameters, computed from local or global statistics of the image, are used as the quantitative descriptors to be classified. However, computation of textural parameters from grey-tone values is not relevant for the feature extracted data used in this study. So, textural analysis has to be performed on a binary image. In this paper, we present a method leading to the mapping of the spatial organization, so-called 'macro-texture', of a unique thematic set. The particularity of the proposed method resides in the use of the concept of granulometric analysis of a binary image for defining the macrotexture parameters. The local granulometry density is computed on a window that is centred at each pixel of the binary image. This computation generates grey-tone images that will be classified by using the K-means method. The final map obtained from the classification of the pixels described by macro-textural parameters can be considered as a map of the density of the set under study. The method has been tested and evaluated on Satellite pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data. The data cover the two and regions characterized by different stages of ligneous covers.

J	Wulder, MA; Franklin, SE; White, JC				Wulder, MA; Franklin, SE; White, JC			Sensitivity of hyperclustering and labelling land cover classes to Landsat image acquisition date	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							LARGE AREAS; CLASSIFICATION; CANADA	Seven Landsdt images near Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, representing a range of within-year and between-year dates, were acquired to assess spectral variability and the concomitant impact upon hyperclustering classification results. Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure.

Results from both FCM and HCA clustering produced cluster centers (prototypes) that can be used to identify the physical and chemical processes creating the variations in the water chemistries. There are several advantages to FCM, and it is concluded that FCM, as an exploratory data analysis technique, is potentially useful in establishing hydrochemical facies distribution and may provide a better tool than HCA for clustering large data sets when overlapping or continuous clusters exist.

Using an a-CCH with 287 probes, we examined 14 cases of breast infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDCA) that had previously been classified by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) as either human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 positive (HER2+) or HER2- and analyzed the data by hierarchical, K-means, and principal component analyses. The aim of the study was to identify the genetic abnormalities that are present in breast IDCAs and determine if the global status of 287 cytogenetic locations could be used as a more objective method for breast IDCA classification. Concordance between FISH and a-CGH at the HER2 locus was 78.6% (11/14). In general, a-CGH detected more abnormalities in HER2+ cases. In HER 2+ cases, chromosomes 1, 2,3,7,9, 17, and 20 had more regions that showed statistically significant (P less than or equal to 0.01) changes in DNA copy number. Among all the aberrant cytogenetic locations detected, 20q13, 7p12.3similar top12.1, and 17q23.2similar toq25.3, which contain among others, genes for TNFRSF6B, EGFR, and TKI showed statistically significant gains (P less than or equal to 0.01) in 83, 66.7, and 50% of the HER2+ IDCA cases, respectively. Chromosome location 8q24.12similar toq24.13 was the only region that showed consistent amplification in approximately 50% of the HER2- cases. Unsupervised hierarchical and K-means cluster analyses and principal component analysis using the DNA copy number status of 287 cytogenetic locations or the 177 cytogenctic locations that showed statistically significant differences revealed a cluster consisting of mainly HER2- IDCA cases. Even though this study demonstrates the usefulness of a-CGH in the rapid identification of aberrant DNA regions in tumor samples, we conclude that an array-CGH with more than 287 probes will be needed for a more precise mapping of DNA aberrations at the global level.

This research examined whether school principals exhibit different styles in recruiting beginning teachers. A small group of principals was interviewed and items reflecting their views were then developed and put on cards. The cards were sorted by people familiar with educational vocabulary to enable category setting using Kirkland and Bimmler's GOPA technique. Seventy-one principals then prioritized the items. A k-means algorithm was used to cluster principals with similar responses. Analysis of the clusters suggests that recruiting styles do exist. General compatibility emerged as being most important. This suggests that having schools appoint their own staff may lead to greater diversity between schools and greater conformity within them.

Five clustering methods found in the literature of gene expression analysis are compared: agglomerative hierarchical clustering, CLICK, dynamical clustering, k-means and self-organizing maps. In order to evaluate the methods, a k-fold cross-validation procedure adapted to unsupervised methods is applied. The accuracy of the results is assessed by the comparison of the partitions obtained in these experiments with gene annotation, such as protein function and series classification.

K-Means's clustering of the new vectors with subsequent classification was then possible with the dimension reduction technique Principal Component Analysis applied previously. The new representation scheme was applied to a set of 112 antigens sequences from several parasitic helminths, selected in the National Center for Biotechnology Information and classified into fourth different groups. This bioinformatic tool permitted the establishment of a good correlation with domains that are already well characterized, regardless of the differences between the sequences that were confirmed by the PFAM database. Additionally, sequences were grouped according to their similarity, confirmed by hierarchical clustering using ClustalW.

J	Zhao, WB; Huang, DS; Du, JY; Wang, LM				Zhao, WB; Huang, DS; Du, JY; Wang, LM			Genetic optimization of radial basis probabilistic neural networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						genetic algorithms; radial basis probabilistic neural networks; hidden centers; recursive orthogonal least square algorithm; modified K-means algorithm	FUZZY CONTROLLERS; ALGORITHMS; DESIGN; RECOGNITION	This paper discusses using genetic algorithms (CA) to optimize the structure of radial basis probabilistic neural networks (RBPNN), including how to select hidden centers of the first hidden layer and to determine the controlling parameter of Gaussian kernel functions. In the process of constructing the genetic algorithm, a novel encoding method is proposed for optimizing the RBPNN structure. This encoding method can not only make the selected hidden centers sufficiently reflect the key distribution characteristic in the space of training samples set and reduce the hidden centers number as few as possible, but also simultaneously determine the optimum controlling parameters of Gaussian kernel functions matching the selected hidden centers. Additionally, we also constructively propose a new fitness function so as to make the designed RBPNN as simple as possible in the network structure in the case of not losing the network performance. Finally, we take the two benchmark problems of discriminating two-spiral problem and classifying the iris data, for example, to test and evaluate this designed GA. The experimental results illustrate that our designed CA can significantly reduce the required hidden centers number, compared with the recursive orthogonal least square algorithm (ROLSA) and the modified K-means algorithm (MKA). In particular, by means of statistical experiments it was proved that the optimized RBPNN by our designed GA, have still a better generalization performance with respect to the ones by the ROLSA and the MKA, in spite of the network scale having been greatly reduced. Additionally, our experimental results also demonstrate that our designed CA is also suitable for optimizing the radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN).

From results of a permutation test to detect QTL for marbling, we selected the microsatellite locus ILSTS035 on chromosome 6 for further analysis. K-means clustering analysis applied to five traits and nine DNA markers in ILSTS035 resulted in three cluster groups. Finally we employed the bootstrap test method to calculate confidence intervals using the resampling method to find major DNA markers. We conclude that the major markers of ILSTS035 locus on chromosome 6 of Hanwoo, cattle are markers 235 bp and 266 bp.

Materials and Methods: Tissue classification was performed using a expectation maximization and k-means clustering algorithm utilizing diffusion and T2 measures (diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI], apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC], and T2) combined with uncorrected perfusion measures cerebral blood flow ((CBF) and mean transit time [MTT]), bolus delay-corrected perfusion measures (cCBF and cMTT), and bolus delay-corrected perfusion indices (cCBF and cMTT with bolus delay). Results: The mean similarity index (SI), a kappa-based correlation statistic reflecting the pixel-by-pixel classification agreement between predicted and 30-day T2 lesion volumes, were 0.55 +/- 0.19, 0.61 +/- 0.15 (P < 0.02) and 0.60 +/- 0.17 (P <0.03), respectively. Spearman's correlation coefficients, comparing predicted and final lesion volumes were 0.56 (P < 0.05), 0.70 (P < 0.01), and 0.84 (P < 0.001), respectively. We found a more significant correlation between predicted infarct volumes derived from bolus delay-corrected perfusion measures than from conventional perfusion measures when combined with diffusion measures and compared with final lesion volumes measured on 30-day T2 MRI scans. Conclusion: Bolus delay-corrected perfusion measures enable an improved prediction of infarct evolution and evaluation of the hemodynamic status of neuronal tissue in acute stroke.

Location: Iowa, USA. Methods: 506 0.5 m x 0.5 m quadrats were sampled from 31 fens across a 550 km extent. Presence/absence of all vascular plant taxa, plus the non-vascular genera Sphagnum and Chara, and values for 24 environmental variables were noted. Global Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling and Monte Carlo tests were used to describe compositional variation and identify significant environmental co-variables. Model-based cluster analysis was used to identify the optimal number of groups supported by the data, while k-means clustering was used to assign each quadrat to a group. The number of occurrences (and frequency) of each species within each group was calculated. Two-dimensional 95% Gaussian confidence intervals, ANOVA, correlation coefficient homogeneity tests, log-linear modelling, and Fisher's exact tests were used to document patterns of compositional change. Results: Two stable axes of variation were identified: the first being most closely correlated with soil pH, Mg, Ca, P, S, vegetation height, surface and -10 cm soil temperature, site area, perimeter, perimeter/area ratio, growing season, and air temperature, with the second being most correlated to soil moisture, N, disturbance level, % organic matter, hummock height, N-S coordinate, and precipitation. Individual sites harboured between 20-47% of total compositional variation, with 28% of Axis 1 and 55% of Axis 2 scores being contained within-sites. Five compositional regions were identified that differed in the proportion of calciphile and hydrophile species. Compositional groups differed significantly between geologic types. Conclusions: While the principal axis of variation (corresponding to the rich-poor fen gradient) is present largely between sites, the second axis (corresponding to water level) is largely repeated within sites. Documentation and protection of vegetation patterns and species diversity within Iowa fens will thus require consideration of multiple sites across the landscape.

J	Arnott, JM; Evans, JL; Chiaromonte, F				Arnott, JM; Evans, JL; Chiaromonte, F			Characterization of extratropical transition using cluster analysis	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW			English	Article							WESTERN NORTH PACIFIC; SCALE CIRCULATION VARIABILITY; ATLANTIC TROPICAL CYCLONES; POTENTIAL VORTICITY; SPATIAL PATTERNS; CLIMATE ZONES; STORM AGNES; PART I; TRANSFORMATION; MIDLATITUDE	The extratropical transition (ET) of tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic basin is explored using the framework of the Cyclone Phase Space (CPS). Analyses from the U. S. Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS) and National Centers for Environmental Prediction Aviation Model (AVN) are used to diagnose CPS locations of 19 Atlantic tropical cyclones that underwent ET in the years 1998-2002. A nonhierarchical cluster analysis technique, the k-means method, is employed to determine physically meaningful clusters of cyclone structure in this CPS dataset. The cluster analysis successfully partitions observations into subsets representing distinct cyclone structures. It is also found that, while current operational cyclone classification schemes are successful at defining some storm structures, cluster analysis assists in defining a "gray area" of transitioning tropical cyclones, an area where operational schemes overlap. A mean path through the CPS of tropical cyclones undergoing ET is proposed. This CPS path is explored using a synoptic life cycle developed from NOGAPS-derived clusters. The resulting climatology highlights distinct stages of ET, beginning with a tropical cyclone isolated from midlatitude influences to its north and ending with an extratropical cyclone, deeply embedded in the midlatitude westerlies. Similar cluster solutions, derived using data from both the NOGAPS and AVN models, suggest that the clusters found in this analysis are not model specific and indicate natural stages of the ET process. However, there are differences between the model CPS solutions, suggesting the use of an observational approach to validating cyclone phase and thus to defining ET.

First, each class is divided into several clusters by the k-means algorithm. The optimal discriminant analysis is implemented by multi-modal mapping. Our method utilizes only those training samples on and near the effective decision boundary to generate a between-class scatter matrix, which requires less CPU time than other nonparametric discriminant analysis (NDA) approaches [Fukunaga and Mantock in IEEE Trans PAMI 5(6):671-677, 1983; Bressan and Vitria in Pattern Recognit Lett 24(5):2473-2749, 2003]. In addition, no prior assumptions about class and cluster densities are needed. In order to achieve a high verification performance of confusing handwritten numeral pairs, a hybrid feature extraction scheme is developed, which consists of a set of gradient-based wavelet features and a set of geometric features. Our proposed dimensionality reduction algorithm is used to congregate features, and it outperforms the principal component analysis (PCA) and other NDA approaches. Experiments proved that our proposed method could achieve a high feature compression performance without sacrificing its discriminant ability for classification. As a result, this new method can reduce artificial neural network (ANN) training complexity and make the ANN classifier more reliable.

The traditional two-component MRF model for segmentation requires training data to estimate necessary model parameters and is thus unsuitable for unsupervised segmentation. The new implementation scheme solves this problem by introducing a function-based weighting parameter between the two components. Using this method, the simple MRF model is able to automatically estimate model parameters and produce accurate unsupervised segmentation results. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to segment various types of images (gray scale, color, texture) and achieves an improvement over the traditional method.

J	Brusco, MJ				Brusco, MJ			Clustering binary data in the presence of masking variables	PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS			English	Article							BOUND ALGORITHM; MONTE-CARLO; SELECTION; NUMBER; BRANCH; RECOVERY; MODEL; SETS	A number of important applications require the clustering of binary data sets. Traditional nonhierarchical cluster analysis techniques, such as the popular K-means algorithm, can often be successfully applied to these data sets. However, the presence of masking variables in a data set can impede the ability of the K-means algorithm to recover the true cluster structure. The author presents a heuristic procedure that selects an appropriate subset from among the set of all candidate clustering variables. Specifically, this procedure attempts to select only those variables that contribute to the definition of true cluster structure while eliminating variables that can hide (or mask) that true structure. Experimental testing of the proposed variable-selection procedure reveals that it is extremely successful at accomplishing this goal.

Design: A cross-sectional study. Subjects and methods: A group of 1473 men and women were sampled from 17 general practice lists in the South of Ireland. A total of 1018 attended for screening, with a response rate of 69%. Participants completed a detailed health and lifestyle questionnaire and provided a fasting blood sample for glucose, lipids and homocysteine. Dietary intake was assessed using a standard food-frequency questionnaire adapted for use in the Irish population. The food-frequency questionnaire was a modification of that used in the UK arm of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer study, which was based on that used in the US Nurses' Health Study. Dietary patterns were assessed primarily by K-means cluster analysis, following initial principal components analysis to identify the seeds. Results: Three dietary patterns were identified. These clusters corresponded to a traditional Irish diet, a prudent diet and a diet characterised by high consumption of alcoholic drinks and convenience foods. Cluster 1 (Traditional Diet) had the highest intakes of saturated fat (SFA), monounsaturated fat (MUFA) and percentage of total energy from fat, and the lowest polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) intake and ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat (P:S). Cluster 2 (Prudent Diet) was characterised by significantly higher intakes of fibre, PUFA, P:S ratio and antioxidant vitamins (vitamins C and E), and lower intakes of total fat, MUFA, SFA and cholesterol. Cluster 3 (Alcohol & Convenience Foods) had the highest intakes of alcohol, protein, cholesterol, vitamin B-12, vitamin B-6, folate, iron, phosphorus, selenium and zinc, and the lowest intakes of PUFA, vitamin A and antioxidant vitamins (vitamins C and E). There were significant differences between clusters in gender distribution, smoking status, physical activity, body mass index, waist circumference and serum homocysteine concentrations. Conclusion: In this general population sample, cluster analysis methods yielded two major dietary patterns: prudent and traditional. The prudent dietary pattern is associated with other health-seeking behaviours. Study of dietary patterns will help elucidate links between diet and disease and contribute to the development of healthy eating guidelines for health promotion.

We determined relationships between SOC.. terrain attributes. field scale soil electrical conductivity (EC), soil texture and soil survey map units in a 9 ha coastal plain field (Aquic and Typic Paleudults) historically man, P aged by conventional means. The site was composite sampled for SOC (0-30 cm) within 18.3 X 8.5-m grids (n = 496). and two data sets were created from the original data. Ordinary kriging. co-kriging, regression kriging and multiple regression were used to develop SOC surfaces that were validated with an independent data set (n = 24) using the mean square error (MSE). The SOC was relatively low (26.13 Mg ha(-1)) and only moderately variable (CV = 21%), and showed high spatial dependence. Interpolation techniques produced similar SOC maps but the best predictor was ordinary kriging (MSE = 9.11 Mg-2 ha(-2)) while regression was the worst (MSE = 20.65 Mg-2 ha(-2)). Factor analysis indicated that the first three factors explained 57% of field variability; compound topographic index (CTI), slope, EC and soil textural fractions dominated these components. Elevation, slope, CTI, silt content and EC explained up to 50% of the SOC variability (P less than or equal to 0.01) suggesting that topography and historical erosion played a significant role in SOC distribution. Field subdivision into soil map units or k-mean clusters similarly decreased SOC variance (about 30%). The study suggests that terrain attributes and EC surveys can be used to differentiate zones of variable SOC content. which may be used as bench marks to evaluate field-level impact of management practices on C sequestration.

Fuzzy classification and geostatistical interpolation are useful tools for the simultaneous handling of continuous variation in both attributes and location. The objectives of this study were: (i) to classify data to capture optimally in-field variability and (ii) to delineate contiguous areas for site-specific management. Several soil physical and chemical parameters for a loam soil were measured in the 0- to 15-cm depth of a 50- X 25-m grid at the experimental farm of the University of Agricultural Sciences, Vienna, Austria. Using Variowin and ArcGIS, models were fitted to variograms, and continuous maps of individual attributes were generated by spline smoothing. The coefficient of variation (CV) for soil bulk density (P-b), pH, and silt and clay contents was <15%; for antecedent water content (theta), sand content, electrical conductivity (EC), organic carbon concentration (TC), soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil nitrogen (TN) it was 15 to 35%; and for saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) and matric flux potential (Phi(m)) it was >35%. The nugget:sill ratio showed moderate spatial dependence for silt content, P-b, SOC, K-s, Phi(m), EC, clay content, and TC (from 38% for silt content to 59% for TC) and weak spatial dependence for TN and pH (>75%). The nugget:sill ratio from covariograms showed moderate spatial dependence for K and TC, TC and clay content, Pb and pH, TN and clay content, K-s and Phi(m) and P-b and theta (38 to 62%). Four classes captured total within-field variability optimally. Despite a low level of actual statistical variation in data, contiguous areas of each class were present in the field. The study demonstrated that by careful collection of data, site-specific management zones can be created for soil management within the field.

The primary clustering of gene expression reveals the genotypes that are responsible for the proximity of members within each cluster, while further clustering elucidates the pathological features of the individual members of each cluster. However, since the first clustering process and the second classification step, in which the features are associated with clusters, are performed independently, the initial set of clusters may omit genes that are associated with pathologically meaningful features. Therefore, it is important to devise a way of identifying gene expression clusters that are associated with pathological features. Results: We present the novel technique of 'itemset constrained clustering' (IC-Clustering), which computes the optimal cluster that maximizes the interclass variance of gene expression between groups, which are divided according to the restriction that only divisions that can be expressed using common features are allowed. This constraint automatically labels each cluster with a set of pathological features which characterize that cluster. When applied to liver cancer datasets, IC-Clustering revealed informative gene expression clusters, which could be annotated with various pathological features, such as 'tumor' and 'man', or 'except tumor' and 'normal liver function'. In contrast, the k-means method overlooked these clusters.

The images under consideration were taken by Meteosat in the visible and infrared bands during the month of December 1994. They cover North Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, Europe and the Atlantic Ocean. The visible images are first processed following four directions, namely 0degrees, 45degrees, 90degrees and 135degrees. For each direction, the textural parameters are calculated from the sum and difference histograms of grey levels. To take into account the effect of the texture anisotropy in the classification, the Karhunen-Loeve transformation (KLT) is then used. The minimum number of components representing these parameters is obtained with the slightest loss of information. Finally, after averaging the textural parameters over the four directions, each image of the database is divided into homogeneous classes by using the K-means algorithm. The approach thus described, tested on one of the images of the Brodatz album, shows that the classification ratio is greater than 96%. The segmentation of the Meteosat images is performed using both the textural parameters of visible images and the brightness of infrared images. It is then found that the different ground and cloud types are classified with proper accuracy. The implementation of this method to satellite images advantageously reduces the classification time, which is found to be three times smaller than that required by classical techniques of image processing.

Specifically, we use the SVD to preprocess and sort the data vectors, and then use the k-means algorithm on the modified vectors.

In this study, 12 Raman microspectroscopic mapping experiments are performed on frozen sections of normal bronchial tis-Pseuclocolor Raman images are constructed using principal sue. component analysis and K-means cluster analysis. Subsequent comparison of Raman images with histologic evaluation of stained sections enables the identification of the morphologic origin (e.g., bronchial mucus, epithelium, fibrocollagenous stroma, smooth muscle, glandular tissue, and cartilage) of the spectral features. Raman spectra collected from the basal side of epithelium consistently show higher DNA contributions and lower lipid contributions when compared with superficial epithelium spectra. Spectra of bronchial mucus reveal a strong signal contribution of lipids, predominantly triolein. These spectra are almost identical to the spectra obtained from submucosal which suggests that the bronchial mucus is mainly composed glands, of gland secretions. Different parts of fibrocollagenous tissue are distinguished by differences in spectral contributions from collagen and actin/myosin. Cartilage is identified by spectral contributions of glycosaminoglycans and collagen. As demonstrated here, in situ analysis of the molecular composition of histologic structures by Raman microspectroscopic mapping creates powerful opportunities for increasing our fundamental understanding of tissue organization and function. Moreover, it provides a firm basis for further in vitro and in vivo investigations of the biochemical changes that accompany pathologic transformation of tissue.

J	Smellie, A				Smellie, A			Accelerated K-means clustering in metric spaces	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article							ALGORITHM	The K-means method is a popular technique for clustering data into k-partitions. In the adaptive form of the algorithm. Lloyds method, an iterative procedure alternately assigns cluster membership based on a set of centroids and then redefines the centroids based on the computed cluster membership. The most time-consuming part of this algorithm is the determination of which points being clustered belong to which cluster center. This paper discusses the use of the vantage-point tree as a method of more quickly assigning cluster membership when the points being clustered belong to intrinsically low- and medium-dimensional metric spaces. Results will be discussed from simulated data sets and real-world data in the clustering of molecular databases based upon physicochemical properties. Comparisons will be made to a highly optimized brute-force implementation of Lloyd's method and to other pruning strategies.

As the size of the Internet grows rapidly and the amount of information requests increases exponentially, the use of parallel computing techniques in large scale web document retrieval is unavoidable. We propose a parallel hybrid web document clustering algorithm, which combines the Principal Direction Divisive Partitioning (PDDP) algorithm with the K-means algorithm. Computational experiments were conducted to test the performance of the hybrid algorithm using three real life web document datasets, and the results were compared with that of the parallel PDDP algorithm and the parallel K-means algorithm. The experiments show that the quality of the clustering solutions obtained from the hybrid algorithm is better than that from the parallel PDDP or the parallel K-means. The parallel run time of the hybrid algorithm is similar to and sometimes less than that of the widely used K-means algorithm.

J	Boehm, C; Krebs, F				Boehm, Christian; Krebs, Florian			The k-Nearest Neighbour Join: Turbo Charging the KDD Process	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data mining; Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD); Similarity join; Nearest neighbour; Multimedia database; High-dimensional indexing		The similarity join has become an important database primitive for supporting similarity searches and data mining. A similarity join combines two sets of complex objects such that the result contains all pairs of similar objects. Two types of the similarity join are wellknown, the distance range join, in which the user defines a distance threshold for the join, and the closest pair query or k-distance join, which retrieves the k most similar pairs. In this paper, we propose an important, third similarity join operation called the k-nearest neighbour join, which combines each point of one point set with its k nearest neighbours in the other set. We discover that many standard algorithms of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) such as k-means and k-medoid clustering, nearest neighbour classification, data cleansing, postprocessing of sampling-based data mining, etc. can be implemented on top of the k-nn join operation to achieve performance improvements without affecting the quality of the result of these algorithms. We propose a new algorithm to compute the k-nearest neighbour join using the multipage index (MuX), a specialised index structure for the similarity join. To reduce both CPU and I/O costs, we develop optimal loading and processing strategies.

Several special properties are obtained as a result of the constrained optimization problem of NMF. For facial images, the additive nature of NMF results in a basis of features, such as eyes, noses, and lips. We explore various methods for efficiently computing NMF, placing particular emphasis on the initialization of current algorithms. We propose using Spherical K-Means clustering to produce a structured initialization for NMF. We demonstrate some of the properties that result from this initialization and develop an efficient way of choosing the rank of the low-dimensional NMF representation.

Prevalence of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) differs according to race and gender, yet few studies have systematically investigated risk behavior patterns by subgroup, particularly with nationally representative data. METHODS: A priori considerations and K-means cluster analysis were used to group 13,998 non-Hispanic block and white participants in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, Wave 1, according to self-reported substance use and sexual behavior. Multinomial logit analyses examined racial and gender differences by cluster. RESULTS:Among 16 clusters, the two defined by the lowest risk behaviors (sexual abstinence and little or no substance use) comprised 47% of adolescents, fewer than 79,6 in these groups reported ever having received an STD diagnosis. The next largest cluster-characterized by sexual activity (on average, with one lifetime partner) and infrequent substance use-contained 1596 of participants but nearly one-third of adolescent with STDs. Blacks were more likely than whites to be in this group. Black males also were more likely than white males to be in three small clusters characterized by high-risk sexual behaviors (i.e., having had sex with a male or with at least 14 partners, or for drugs or money). Block females generally were the least likely to be in high-risk behavior clusters but the most likely to report STDs. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents' risk behavior patterns vary by race and gender, and do not necessarily correlate with their STD prevalence. Further investigation of adolescents' partners and sexual networks is needed.

Background: Studies of schizophrenia treatment often oversimplify the array of health outcomes among patients. Our objective was to derive a set of disease states for schizophrenia using the Positive and Negative Symptom Assessment Scale (PANSS) that captured the heterogeneity of symptom responses. Methods: Using data from a 1-year clinical trial that collected PANSS scores and costs on schizophrenic patients (N = 663), we conducted a k-means cluster analyses on PANSS scores for items in five factor domains. Results of the cluster analysis were compared with a conceptual framework of disease states developed by an expert panel. Final disease states were defined by combining our conceptual framework with the empirical results. We tested its utility by examining the influence of disease state on treatment costs and prognosis. Results: Analyses led to an eight-state framework with varying levels of positive, negative, and cognitive impairment. The extent of hostile/aggressive symptoms and mood disorders correlated with severity of disease states. Direct treatment costs for schizophrenia vary significantly across disease states (F = 27.47, df = 7, p<0.0001), and disease state at baseline was among the most important predictors of treatment outcomes. Conclusion: The disease states we describe offer a useful paradigm for understanding the links between symptom profiles and outcomes. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this article we extend that method to multivariate regressions by introducing a new way of performing the slicing. This method applies for any number of response variables and may be particularly useful at the outset of an analysis, before positing a multivariate model. The emphasis is on application; no new asymptotic theory is presented.

The calibration, processing, quality control, and archival methodology for handheld sun photometers are described here, along with their deployment statistics. Data processing has been standardized for all instruments by using identical calibration methods, ancillary data, and processing software. Statistical analysis reveals a dataset influenced by its temporal and geographic distribution, while multimodal histograms for aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and Angstrom exponent reveal varied aerosol populations. A K-means unsupervised classification technique is used to separate these populations. This separation is validated by showing individual classes are more likely to be log-normally (for AOTs) or normally (for Angstrom exponents) distributed than the dataset as a whole. Properties for each class are presented, along with the characteristics of each class by regional oceanic basin. Results also compare favorably with maritime aerosols measured by land-based AERONET Cimels in island sites, while providing data coverage in previously sparsely sampled regions. Aerosol models employed by SeaWiFS (Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor) also compare favorably with these ground based measurements. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

With the help of clustering algorithms such as K-means, hierarchical clustering, SOM, etc, genes are partitioned into groups based on the similarity between their expression profiles. In this way, functionally related genes are identified. As the amount of laboratory data in molecular biology grows exponentially each year due to advanced technologies such as Microarray, new efficient and effective methods for clustering must be developed to process this growing amount of biological data. Results: In this paper, we propose a new clustering algorithm, Incremental Genetic K-means Algorithm (IGKA). IGKA is an extension to our previously proposed clustering algorithm, the Fast Genetic K-means Algorithm (FGKA). IGKA outperforms FGKA when the mutation probability is small. The main idea of IGKA is to calculate the objective value Total Within-Cluster Variation (TWCV) and to cluster centroids incrementally whenever the mutation probability is small. IGKA inherits the salient feature of FGKA of always converging to the global optimum. C program is freely available at http://database.cs.wayne.edu/proj/FGKA/index.htm. Conclusions: Our experiments indicate that, while the IGKA algorithm has a convergence pattern similar to FGKA, it has a better time performance when the mutation probability decreases to some point. Finally, we used IGKA to cluster a yeast dataset and found that it increased the enrichment of genes of similar function within the cluster.

J	Kawarabayashi, K				Kawarabayashi, K			Rooted minor problems in highly connected graphs	DISCRETE MATHEMATICS			English	Article						rooted minor; connectivity		The purpose of this note is to give a connectivity condition for a graph to have a rooted complete bipartite minor. Here, a rooted complete bipartite graph minor K-a,K-k means that for any distinct k vertices v(1),...v(k), there are connected subgraphs H-1,..., H-a, K-l,..., K-k such that each of K-i contains v(i) and is adjacent to all H-l,..., H-a. Roughly, our results say that if G is large enough, then the linear connectivity on the function of k guarantees the existence of a rooted K-a,(k)-minor (for any a), and in general, the connectivity condition on the existence of a rooted K-a,(k) -minor is "almost" the same as the average degree which forces the existence of a Ka,k-minor.

The k-means clustering and least mean square algorithms are used to update the RBF network to the underlying speech condition. The inputs for RBF are code excited linear prediction coder parameters, which are stable under background noise. The RBF network output is compared to a threshold to determine the nature of the period (voice or silence). Experimental results show that the proposed VAD algorithm achieves better performance than G.729 Annex B at any noise level.

J	De Smet, Y; Guzman, LM				De Smet, Y; Guzman, LM			Towards multicriteria clustering: An extension of the k-means algorithm	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						multiple criteria analysis; clustering; preference modeling; k-means algorithm		The research within the multicriteria classification field is mainly focused on the assignment of actions to pre-defined classes. Nevertheless the building of multicriteria categories remains a theoretical question still not studied in detail. To tackle this problem, we propose an extension of the well-known k-means algorithm to the multicriteria framework. This extension relies on the definition of a multicriteria distance based on the preference structure defined by the decision maker. Thus, two alternatives will be similar if they are preferred, indifferent and incomparable to more or less the same actions. Armed with this multicriteria distance, we will be able to partition the set of alternatives into classes that are meaningful from a multicriteria perspective. Finally, the examples of the country risk problem and the diagnosis of firms will be treated to illustrate the applicability of this method. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The changes in mRNA level were measured during differentiation day 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and 15. Out of 10,368 genes analyzed, 259 genes were up-regulated or down-regulated by 2-fold or more at least at one time-point during differentiation, and were classified into six clusters based on their expression patterns by K-means clustering. Clusters characterized by gradual increase have large numbers of genes involved in transport and cell adhesion; those which showed gradual decrease have much of genes in nucleic acid metabolism, cell cycle, transcription factor, and RNA processing. In situ hybridization (ISH) validated microarray data and it also showed that Fox M1, cyclin D2, and CDK4 were highly expressed in CNS germinal zones and ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/ phosphodiesterase 2 (Enpp2) was highly expressed in choroid plexus where stem/progenitor cells are possibly located. Together, this clustering analysis of expression patterns of functionally classified genes may give insight into understanding of CNS development and mechanisms of NSCs proliferation and differentiation.

J	Ogston, E; Van Steen, M; Brazier, F				Ogston, E; Van Steen, M; Brazier, F			Group formation among decentralized autonomous agents	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st European Workshop on Multi-Agent Systems (EUMAS 2003)	DEC, 2003	Oxford, ENGLAND		St Catherins Coll, Oxford Univ			This paper examines a method of clustering within a fully decentralized multi-agent system. Our goal is to group agents with similar objectives or data, as is done in traditional clustering. However, we add the additional constraint that agents must remain in place on a network, instead of first being collected into a centralized database. To do this, we connect agents in a random overlay network and have them search in a peer-to-peer fashion for other similar agents. We thus aim to tackle the basic clustering problem on an Internet scale, and create a method by which agents themselves can be grouped, forming coalitions. In order to investigate the feasibility of this decentralized approach, this paper presents simulation experiments that look into the quality of the clusters discovered. First, the clusters found by the agent method are compared to those created by k-means clustering for two-dimensional spatial data points. Results show that the decentralized agent method produces a better clustering than the centralized k-means algorithm, placing 95% to 99% of points correctly. A further experiment explores how agents can be used to cluster a straightforward text document set, demonstrating that agents can discover clusters and keywords that are reasonable estimates of those identified by the central word vector space approach.

J	Shim, JM; Park, SU				Shim, JM; Park, SU			Acidic loadings in South Korean ecosystems by long-range transport and local emissions	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						critical load; exceedance; long-range transport contribution; South Korean ecosystem; sulfur and nitrogen deposition modeling	WET DEPOSITION; DRY DEPOSITION; SULFUR; NITROGEN; MODEL	Exceedances of sulfur and nitrogen critical loads in South Korean ecosystems caused by long-range transport and local emissions of sulfur and nitrogen have been estimated using the maximum critical load of sulfur and the critical load of nutrient nitrogen. The long-term-averaged deposition of sulfur and nitrogen is estimated with a simplified chemical model and the K-mean clustering technique. The three consecutive days of gridded daily mean National Center for Environmental Protection (NCEP) reanalyzed 850 hPa geopotential height fields with and without precipitation on the last day over South Korea are used for clustering of synoptic patterns for the period of 1994-1998. Two emission conditions are simulated for each cluster to estimate long-term averaged depositions of sulfur and nitrogen by long-range transport and local emissions over South Korea. One condition takes all emissions within the simulated domain into account as a base case and the other condition excludes all South Korean emissions but includes all of the other emissions, as a control case. The results of the present study indicate that the contribution of long-range transport to the annual total deposition over South Korea is found to be about 40% (530 eq ha(-1) yr(-1)) for sulfur and 49% (650 eq ha(-1) yr(-1)) for nitrogen, of which 55% for sulfur and 58% for nitrogen are contributed by wet deposition. This suggests the importance of wet deposition through the transformed acidic precursors for long-range transport to South Korea's total deposition of sulfur and nitrogen. The estimated exceedance for South Korean ecosystems indicates that the current estimate of total sulfur deposition affects about 42% of the South Korean ecosystems adversely, of which 14% is attributed to South Korean source only and the rest 28% is attributed to long-range transport together with South Korean source. Long-range transport of sulfur itself does not exceed the maximum critical load of sulfur. On the other hand, the current estimate of total nitrogen deposition is found to affect all South Korean ecosystems adversely. About 65% and 15% of the Korean ecosystems are; respectively, found to be affected adversely by South Korean nitrogen emissions and by long-range transport, suggesting that the reduction of nitrogen deposition from both South Korean sources and long-range transport is a prerequisite to ensure South Korean ecosystem sustainability.

J	Bowman, FD; Patel, R; Lu, CX				Bowman, FD; Patel, R; Lu, CX			Methods for detecting functional classifications in neuroimaging data	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						cluster analysis; hierarchical clustering; F-score; stopping rules; PET	FMRI TIME-SERIES; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; IMAGES; NUMBER	Data-driven statistical methods are useful for examining the spatial organization of human brain function. Cluster analysis is one approach that aims to identify spatial classifications of temporal brain activity profiles. Numerous clustering algorithms are available, and no one method is optimal for all areas of application because an algorithm's performance depends on specific characteristics of the data. K-means and fuzzy clustering are popular for neuroimaging analyses, and select hierarchical procedures also appear in the literature. It is unclear which clustering methods perform best for neuroimaging data. We conduct a simulation study, based on PET neuroimaging data, to evaluate the performances of several clustering algorithms, including a new procedure that builds on the kth nearest neighbor method. We also examine three stopping rules that assist in determining the optimal number of clusters. Five hierarchical clustering algorithms perform best in our study, some of which are new to neuroimaging analyses, with Ward's and the beta-flexible methods exhibiting the strongest performances. Furthermore, Ward's and the beta-flexible methods yield the best performances for noisy data, and the popular K-means and fuzzy clustering procedures also perform reasonably well. The stopping rules also exhibit good performances for the top five clustering algorithms, and the pseudo-T-2 and pseudo-F stopping rules are superior for noisy data. Based on our simulations for both noisy and unscaled PET neuroimaging data, we recommend the combined use of the pseudo-F or pseudo-T-2 stopping rule along with either Ward's or the beta-flexible clustering algorithm.

J	Zhao, HM; Ram, S				Zhao, HM; Ram, S			Clustering schema elements for semantic integration of heterogeneous data sources	JOURNAL OF DATABASE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						attribute correspondence; cluster analysis; heterogeneous database integration; interschema relationship identification; schema correspondence; self-organizing map	DATABASES	Interschema relationship identification (IRI), that is, determining the relationships among schema elements in heterogeneous data sources, is an important step in integrating the data sources. This article proposes a cluster analysis based approach to semi-automating the IRI process, which is typically very time-consuming and requires extensive human interaction. The authors apply multiple clustering techniques, including K-means, hierarchical clustering, and self-organizing map (SOM) neural network, to identify similar schema elements from heterogeneous data sources, based on a combination of features such as naming similarity, document similarity, schema specification, data patterns, and usage patterns. An SOM prototype the authors have developed provides users with a visualization tool for display of clustering results as well as for incremental evaluation of candidate similar elements.

J	Steele, RG; Dreyer, ML; Phipps, S				Steele, RG; Dreyer, ML; Phipps, S			Patterns of maternal distress among children with cancer and their association with child emotional and somatic distress	JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						pediatric cancer; maternal distress; treatment-related distress; cluster analyses	CHRONICALLY ILL CHILDREN; NEWLY-DIAGNOSED CHILDREN; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS; PEDIATRIC CANCER; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMATOLOGY; PSYCHOLOGICAL ADJUSTMENT; SOCIAL SUPPORT; PARENTS; MOTHERS; PREDICTORS	Objective To identify patterns of distress among mothers of children with cancer over the initial 6 months of treatment and to examine these patterns as predictors of child somatic and emotional distress.Method Data were gathered regarding maternal perceived stress and affective distress from mothers of children (N = 65, mean age = 8.3 years) with cancer at 2 to 5 weeks postdiagnosis, then at 12 to 14 weeks and 22 to 24 weeks. Mothers and nurses provided indexes of child somatic and emotional distress at these assessments.Results Hierarchical and k-means cluster analyses revealed four distinct patterns of maternal distress: high, moderate, declining, and low. The high maternal distress group reported higher child emotional distress at all three points but higher child somatic distress only at the final assessment. Maternal distress group was unrelated to nurse-reported child distress.Conclusions The identification of four empirically derived patterns of maternal distress may explain some of the variance in the literature regarding parental distress vis-a-vis pediatric cancer treatment and may have relevance to intervention efforts. Differences in the relations between maternal distress groups and mother- and nurse-reported child distress underscore the importance of collecting child distress data from multiple sources.

A loss function which is the sum of losses for each endpoint problem is assumed. Procedures including the single-step, step-down, and step-up are considered. Two types of monotonicity of procedures are defined. In addition, a compelling property, namely monotonicity of the risk function is also studied for each procedure. Some further results relating monotone procedures to a complete class, to Bayes procedures and likelihood procedures are presented. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the level of generalization is usually poor and very dependent on the quality of the training data because some of the training patterns can be redundant or irrelevant. In this paper, we present a learning method that automatically selects the training patterns more appropriate to the new sample to be approximated. This training method follows a lazy learning strategy, in the sense that it builds approximations centered around the novel sample. The proposed method has been applied to three different domains: an artificial regression problem and two time series prediction problems. Results have been compared to standard training method using the complete training data set and the new method shows better generalization abilities.

Therefore, its application is limited to relatively small datasets. This paper presents a scalable version of the K-means algorithm that employs a buffering technique. The new algorithm, Two-Phase K-means, can robustly find a good solution in only one iteration.

J	Schneider, A; Roberts, AE				Schneider, A; Roberts, AE			Classification and the relations of meaning	QUALITY & QUANTITY			English	Article							GENERALITY	This paper intends to demonstrate the parallels between a qualitative methodology, component analysis, which is predominantly used in cognitive anthropology and linguistics, and the quantitative explorative method-cluster analysis. Social identities and their related structural categories serve as examples of the method. In the methodology and logic involved in the categorization of meaning, abstraction is the key difference between connotative and structural meaning. Abstraction and the identification of higher order categories in cluster analysis are compatible with the extraction of structural meaning from the semantic differential. ratings of the affective meanings of identities. The dichotomy of exclusion and inclusion is the most relevant relation for the qualitative analysis of meaning and can be mathematically operationalized by Euclidean squared distance in k-means cluster analysis.

To study further brain disease that results from HIV-1 infection, we commenced analysis of changes in gene expression in brain ( 2, 3). We analyzed RNA purified from Frontal Cortex of 5 HIV-1 infected and 4 HIV-1 negative control subjects RNA was amplified and Affymetrix technology was used to analyze gene expression using the 12,585 gene Affymetrix Human Genome U95A chip. The expressed genes showed highly significant Pearson's correlations with each other within the two groups. Expression intensities were transferred to Microsoft Excel and Spotfire was used to analyze the results. Twenty-group K-means cluster analysis was done for HIV+ and HIV- subjects. Genes that were expressed in the same cluster numbers in the two groups were removed from further analysis. Analysis of Gene expression in the top 13 HIV+ clusters showed expression in the 40 gene categories designated in our prior studies. Genes from several categories occurred in more than one K-means cluster. Genes identified in these lists included several genes that have been previously studied: MBP, Myelin-PLP, NMDA receptor, MAG, astrocytic protein, Notch 3, APP, Senescence, proteasome, Ferritin, signaling, cell cycle, iNOS, Chemokine, splicing, synapse, protein tags, and ribosomal proteins. The first ( primary significant) axis of both Principal Component Analyses ordered the genes in the same patient groups as the K-means cluster analysis for the respective patient groups. PCA was thus not more informative than K-Means cluster analysis. Ratios of HIV+ to HIV-intensities were calculated for all the averaged gene expression intensities. The ratio range was 0.14 to 9.26. The genes at the extremes ( ad extrema) did not correspond to the gene order by K-means clustering ( or PCA). The genes in the top 13 K-means clusters showed low-level changes by expression ratio. Genes ad extrema by ratio were in clusters with very large memberships. Mann-Whitney analysis confirmed expression ratio results. Several inferences result from our preliminary study. First, study design will be different in future studies involving additional replicates. Second, ratios inform us of the extent of changes in gene expression quantitatively. Third, Cluster methodology provides us with more subtle information, how bunches ( clusters) of genes behave in terms of their centroids (attractors). Fourth, genes that change extensively by ratio tend to be in the larger k-Means clusters.

J	Shigei, N; Miyajima, H; Maeda, M				Shigei, N; Miyajima, H; Maeda, M			Numerical evaluation of incremental Vector Quantization using stochastic relaxation	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article						vector quantization; stochastic relaxation; incremental learning; K-means; neural-gas	NEURAL NETWORKS; ALGORITHM; DESIGN	Learning algorithms for Vector Quantization (VQ) are categorized into two types: batch learning and incremental learning. Incremental learning is more useful than batch learning, because, unlike batch learning, incremental learning can be performed either on-line or off-line. In this paper, we develop effective incremental learning methods by using Stochastic Relaxation (SR) techniques, which have been developed for batch learning. It has been shown that, for batch learning, the SR techniques can provide good global optimization without greatly increasing the computational cost. We empirically investigates the effective implementation of SR for incremental learning. Specifically, we consider five types of SR methods: ISRL ISR2, ISR3, WSR1 and WSR2. ISRs and WSRs add noise input and weight vectors, respectively. The difference among them is when the perturbed input or weight vectors are used in learning. These SR methods are applied to three types of incremental learning: K-means, Neural-Gas (NG) and Kohonen's Self-Organizing Mapping (SOM). We evaluate comprehensively these combinations in terms of accuracy and computation time. Our simulation results show that K-means with ISR3 is the most comprehensively effective among these combinations and is superior to the conventional NG method known as an excellent method.

J	Trask, PC; Griffith, KA				Trask, PC; Griffith, KA			The identification of empirically derived cancer patient subgroups using psychosocial variables	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC RESEARCH			English	Article						cancer; cluster analysis; distress; quality of life	CHRONIC PAIN PATIENTS; LOW-BACK-PAIN; BREAST-CANCER; MALIGNANT-MELANOMA; DEPRESSION; GENDER; INDIVIDUALS; PERSPECTIVE; ADJUSTMENT; DIAGNOSIS	Objective: To determine if there are subgroups of cancer patients who differ on coping, psychological, and quality of life (QOL) measures, and to determine if these subgroups have a different course of distress and health following a cancer diagnosis. Methods: Three hundred fifty-one individuals presenting to a multidisciplinary melanoma clinic completed a baseline questionnaire packet containing the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), the Medical Outcomes Survey Short-Form 36 (SF-36), Ways of Coping (WOC), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), an informed consent form, and a demographic questionnaire. Participants subsequently completed measures at 2, 5, and 9 months after completion of their baseline assessment. A k-means cluster analysis was conducted using the subscales of the STAI, SF-36, and WOC. Results: Four distinct clusters, psychologically unhealthy, physically unhealthy, combined psychologically and physically unhealthy, and healthy, were identified. These clusters differed on the General Severity Index (GSI) of the BSI and the General Health scale of the SF-36 at each of the four assessment points. The course of distress and general health was distinct for each cluster during the study, with combined and psychologically unhealthy clusters having greater levels of distress and combined and physically unhealthy clusters having poorer overall health. Conclusions: The findings from this study provide support for distinct subgroups of patients presenting with a diagnosis of cancer whose level of distress and general health vary greatly following a cancer diagnosis. Clinical interventions tailored to the level of psychological or physical impairment as determined by the cluster may result in better outcomes following cancer treatment. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Our simulation results indicate that the proposed novel clustering method (called ant colony optimization with different favor algorithm) performs better than the fast self-organizing map (SOM) combines K-means approach (FSOM+K-means) and genetic K-means algorithm (GKA). In addition, in all the cases we studied, our method produces much smaller errors than both the FSOM+K-means approach and GKA. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In spite of its popularity and ability to deal with large volumes of data quickly and efficiently, K-means has its drawbacks, such as its inability to provide good solution quality and robustness. In this paper, an extended study of the K-means algorithm is carried out. We propose a new clustering algorithm that integrates the concepts of hierarchical approaches and the K-means algorithm to yield improved performance in terms of solution quality and robustness. This proposed algorithm and score function are introduced and thoroughly discussed. Comparison studies with the K-means algorithm and three popular K-means initialization methods using five well-known test data sets are also presented. Finally, a business application involving segmenting credit card users demonstrates the algorithm's capability.

To identify genes regulated by flagellin perception signaling in cultured rice cells, gene expression patterns were analyzed with rice cDNA microarrays, including 3,353 independent rice cDNA clones. In all, 131 genes were differentially expressed between incompatible and compatible interactions. K-means clustering showed that 94 genes were upregulated and 32 genes were downregulated during incompatible interactions, whereas only 5 genes were upregulated during compatible interactions. Among the 126 genes that were up- or downregulated during incompatible interactions, expression of 46 genes was decreased when cultured rice cells were inoculated with a flagellin-deficient incompatible strain (Deltafla1141-2), indicating that approximately 37% of the 126 genes were directly controlled by flagellin perception. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis using flagellins purified from incompatible or compatible strains was performed to confirm flagellin-regulated expression of candidate genes selected by microarray analysis. Results showed that induction of some genes involved in the immune response is regulated not only by the flagellin perception pathway, but also by another recognition molecule-perception pathway.

We examined the effects of CFTR gene correction on the gene expression profile of a CF bronchial epithelial cell line (IB3-1) and determined which CF-related gene expression changes could be reversed by IL-10 expression. We performed microarray experiments to monitor the gene expression profile of three cell lines over a time course of exposure to Pseudomonas. At baseline, we identified 843 genes with statistically different levels of expression in CFTR-corrected (S9) cells compared to the IB3-1 line or the IL-10-expressing line. K-means clustering and functional group analysis revealed a primary up-regulation of ubiquitination enzymes and TNF pathway components and a primary down-regulation of protease inhibitors and protein glycosylation enzymes in CF. Key gene expression changes were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Massive reprogramming of gene expression occurred 3 h after Pseudomonas exposure. Changes specific to CF included exaggerated activation of cytokines, blunted activation of anti-proteases, and repression of protein glycosylation enzymes. In conclusion, the CFTR genotype changes the expression of multiple genes at baseline and in response to bacterial challenge, and only a subset of these changes is secondary to IL-10 deficiency.

The optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) response of previously irradiated samples was excited with light of 470 nm at room temperature. The OSL decay curves were measured and found them to be a function of the dose exposure. The remaining thermoluminescence (TL) glow curve after optical stimulation indicates the existence of main charge carriers trapped in traps located at 323-523 K, meaning that the OSL emission appears to originate from charge trapped mainly at those traps related to the low temperature TL glow peaks. The results indicate that CVD diamond films perform well as OSL dosimeter for ionizing radiation. (C) 2004 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transverse fast gradient-echo cine MR images of the hypopharynx were obtained at 1.5 T in 31 children with OSA (eight girls, 23 boys; mean age, 11.3 years) and 21 children free of airway symptoms who underwent MR imaging for other clinical indications (11 girls, 10 boys; mean age, 3.5 years). Volume segmentation with a k-means clustering algorithm was applied to transverse cine MR images to quantify airway volumes at each time. Airway wall motion for each child was described with standard deviation and range. Coefficient of variance and normalized range, which are independent of airway size, were used to compare groups (Kruskal-Wallis test). RESULTS: Plots of airway volume over time demonstrated large fluctuations during respiration in children with OSA and minimal fluctuations in controls; findings were consistent with airway distention and airway collapse in OSA. Average airway transverse volume was larger in the group with OSA than in the control group (OSA group, 2.52 mL; control group, 0.936 mL; P <.001). Mean standard deviation (OSA group, 0.840 mL; control group, 0.17 mL; P <.001) and mean range of airway cross section (OSA group, 3.552 mL; control group, 0.864 mL; P < .001) were larger in the group with OSA. Coefficient of variance (OSA group, 0.32; control group, 0.17; P <.001) and normalized range (OSA group, 1.42; control group, 0.96; P <.001) indicate statistically significant difference in airway dynamics in children with OSA. CONCLUSION: Volume segmentation of transverse cine MR images of the hypopharynx aids in quantification of increased airway wall motion in children with OSA. Transverse MR imaging demonstrates both airway distention and collapse in children with OSA. (C) RSNA, 2004.

J	Schneider, A				Schneider, A			The ideal type of authority in the United States and Germany	SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES			English	Article							IDENTITY; CULTURE	Using affect control theory, an ideal type of authority is developed from the literature identifying three dimensions of meaning. This ideal type is then used to compare U.S. and German subjects. Because their power is legitimated by cultural rules, authorities are positively evaluated despite their ability to coerce. Because it is understood, authorities need not engage in expressive action to demonstrate their power. The affective meaning of role identities reflects their structural meaning, such as authority. Role identities, rated on three-dimensional semantic differential scales of affective meaning, are classified using a K-means clustering algorithm to empirically generate clusters of structural meaning. The cluster discussed here corresponds to the ideal typical authority category of potent, positively evaluated, and not expressive role identities. In the two studies reported here involving more than 1,700 U.S. and German subjects, I find a high degree of cross-cultural agreement on what is classified as authority. However, U.S. and German youth differ significantly in confirming the ideal type of authority. German youth dislike the power potential of authorities more than their U.S. counterparts do.

Two series of compounds, one containing anti-inflammatory and the other containing nonanti-inflammatory compounds were processed by a k-means cluster analysis in order to design the training and prediction sets. A linear classification function to discriminate the anti-inflammatory from the inactive compounds was developed. The model correctly and clearly classified 88% of active and 91% of inactive compounds in the training set. More specifically, the model showed a good global classification of 90%, that is, (399 cases out of 441). While in the prediction set, they showed an overall predictability of 88% and 84% for active and inactive compounds, being the global percentage of good classification of 85%. Furthermore this paper describes a fragment analysis in order to determine the contribution of several fragments towards anti-inflammatory property, also the present of halogens in the selected fragments were analyzed. It seems that the present TOPS-MODE based QSAR is the first alternate general 'in silico' technique to experimentation in anti-inflammatory discovery. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Schliep, A; Steinhoff, C; Schonhuth, A				Schliep, Alexander; Steinhoff, Christine; Schoenhuth, Alexander			Robust inference of groups in gene expression time-courses using mixtures of HMMs	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article								Motivation: Genetic regulation of cellular processes is frequently investigated using large-scale gene expression experiments to observe changes in expression over time. This temporal data poses a challenge to classical distance-based clustering methods due to its horizontal dependencies along the time-axis. We propose to use hidden Markov models (HMMs) to explicitly model these time-dependencies. The HMMs are used in a mixture approach that we show to be superior over clustering. Furthermore, mixtures are a more realistic model of the biological reality, as an unambiguous partitioning of genes into clusters of unique functional assignment is impossible. Use of the mixture increases robustness with respect to noise and allows an inference of groups at varying level of assignment ambiguity. A simple approach, partially supervised learning, allows to benefit from prior biological knowledge during the training. Our method allows simultaneous analysis of cyclic and non-cyclic genes and copes well with noise and missing values. Results: We demonstrate biological relevance by detection of phase-specific groupings in HeLa time-course data. A benchmark using simulated data, derived using assumptions independent of those in our method, shows very favorable results compared to the baseline supplied by k-means and two prior approaches implementing model-based clustering. The results stress the benefits of incorporating prior knowledge, whenever available.

K-means clustering, for the major DNA marker mining of BM4311 microsatellite loci in Hanwoo chromosome 6, has been tried and five traits are divided by three cluster groups. Then, the three cluster groups are classified according to six DNA markers. Finally, bootstrap test method to calculate confidence intervals, using resampling method, has been adapted in order to find major DNA markers. It could be concluded that the major markers of BM4311 locus in Hanwoo chromosome 6 were DNA marker 100 and 95 bp.

The 5' flanking sequences of ORFs identified in four archaea, Sulfolobus solfataricus, Pyrobaculum aerophilum, Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, and Pyrococcus abyssi, were clustered using the model. Three regular patterns of clusters were identified for most ORFs. One showed genes with only a ribosome-binding site; another showed genes with a transcriptional regulatory region located at a constant location with respect to the start codon. A third pattern combined the previous two. Both P. aerophilum and Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 exhibited clusters of genes that lacked any regular pattern. Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 also presented regular features not seen in the other organisms. This group of archaea seems to use a combination of eubacterial and eukaryotic regulatory features as well as some unique to individual species. Our results suggest that interactive clustering may be used to examine the divergence of the gene regulatory machinery in archaea and to identify the presence of archaea-specific gene regulation patterns.

J	Schmidt, J; Hewitt, A				Schmidt, J; Hewitt, A			Fuzzy land element classification from DTMs based on geometry and terrain position	GEODERMA			English	Article						terrain classification; land elements; soil-landscape modelling; digital elevation models; fuzzy sets; GIS	SOIL SURVEY; K-MEANS; MODELS	Land elements have been used as basic landform descriptors in many science disciplines, including soil mapping, vegetation mapping, and landscape ecology. We describe an approach in terrain classification, with the objective of deriving a method for classifying land elements from DTMs based on their fundamental characteristics. The methodology for modelling land elements is implemented as a two-step process: first, form elements are classified based on local geometry, and second, land elements are derived by evaluating the form elements in their landscape context. Form elements are derived by fuzzy classification of slope and curvature at a specified global scale (window size), The form elements are reclassified according to their geomorphometric context using a higher scale terrain position index. The resulting land elements are evaluated with respect to their predictive value for modelling soil properties. It is shown that scaling geomorphometric properties is important for applying them to predict soil properties and to model landform units. The presented model, based on scaled geomorphometric properties and geomorphometric context, using a limited number of model parameters, is capable of modelling fundamental land elements that can be utilized in soil-landscape modelling and in other applications in land resource management.

This article introduces an efficient disk-based implementation of K-means. The proposed algorithm is designed to work inside a relational database management system. It can cluster large data sets having very high dimensionality. In general, it only requires three scans over the data set. It is optimized to perform heavy disk I/O and its memory requirements are low. Its parameters are easy to set. An extensive experimental section evaluates quality of results and performance. The proposed algorithm is compared against the Standard K-means algorithm as well as the Scalable K-means algorithm.

A gender-specific typology in context of victim and offender related violence	JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENCE			English	Article						weapon-carrying; bullying; violence; gender differences; cluster analysis; Switzerland	HEALTH-RISK BEHAVIORS; UNITED-STATES; SUBSTANCE USE; STUDENTS; ADOLESCENTS; ASSOCIATION; PREDICTORS; FREQUENCY; ILLINOIS; YOUNG	After reviewing prevalence rates, this work tries to identify gender specific groups in which weapon-carrying occurs in the context of victim and offender related violent behaviours. k-Means cluster and logistic regression analyses were calculated, based on a cross-sectional survey of a national representative sample of 1549 15-year-olds as part of the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) international collaborative study. The victims and offenders of violence concern mainly female bullies and physically violent boys. In the male victim-offender group, 17% had already taken a weapon to school. Another male group emerged in which 95% had already taken a weapon to school. Members of this group revealed an elevated level of acting violently but a low level of being the victim. Among the minority girls who were offenders and victims of physical violence, everyone has already taken a weapon to school. Based on these results, homogenous risk groups can be targeted for violence prevention. (C) 2101 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents, Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Khan, SS; Ahmad, A				Khan, SS; Ahmad, A			Cluster center initialization algorithm for K-means clustering	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						K-means clustering; initial cluster centers; cost function; density based multiscale data condensation		Performance of iterative clustering algorithms which converges to numerous local minima depend highly on initial cluster centers. Generally initial cluster centers are selected randomly. In this paper we propose an algorithm to compute initial cluster centers for K-means clustering. This algorithm is based on two observations that some of the patterns are very similar to each other and that is why they have same cluster membership irrespective to the choice of initial cluster centers. Also, an individual attribute may provide some information about initial cluster center. The initial cluster centers computed using this methodology are found to be very close to the desired cluster centers, for iterative clustering algorithms. This procedure is applicable to clustering algorithms for continuous data. We demonstrate the application of proposed algorithm to K-means clustering algorithm. The experimental results show improved and consistent solutions using the proposed algorithm. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Forero, MG; Sroubek, F; Cristobal, G				Forero, MG; Sroubek, F; Cristobal, G			Identification of tuberculosis bacteria based on shape and color	REAL-TIME IMAGING			English	Article						tuberculosis; fluorescence microscopy; clustering; feature extraction; k-means; color; autofocus	MOMENT INVARIANTS; IMAGE-ANALYSIS	Tuberculosis and other mycobacteriosis are serious illnesses which control is based on early diagnosis. A technique commonly used consists of analyzing sputum images for detecting bacilli. However, the analysis of sputum is time consuming and requires highly trained personnel to avoid high errors. Image-processing techniques provide a good toot for improving the manual screening of samples. In this paper, a new autofocus algorithm and a new bacilli detection technique is presented with the aim to attain a high specificity rate and reduce the time consumed to analyze such sputum samples. This technique is based on the combined use of some invariant shape features together with a simple thresholding operation on the chromatic channels. Some feature descriptors have been extracted from bacilli shape using an edited dataset of samples.

Methods The ratio between human population and owned animal (dogs and cats) population was calculated in the municipality of Taboao da Serra, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. This municipality was divided into two distinct social and economic homogeneous areas through k-mean algorithm, allowing for comparison between the ratios of the two homogeneous areas. Results A 5.14 ratio was calculated for human and dog populations and a 30.57 ratio for human and feline populations. A significant difference was not observed when comparing the ratios for human and animal populations of the two homogeneous areas. Conclusions An estimate of owned dog and eat populations based on the human population is the better choice for assessing the animal population instead of an animal census because it can be easily implemented.

J	Duan, FH; Zhang, HP				Duan, FH; Zhang, HP			Correcting the loss of cell-cycle synchrony in clustering analysis of microarray data using weights	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							GENES	Motivation: Due to the existence of the loss of synchrony in cell-cycle data sets, standard clustering methods (e.g. k-means), which group open reading frames (ORFs) based on similar expression levels, are deficient unless the temporal pattern of the expression levels of the ORFs is taken into account. Methods: We propose to improve the performance of the k-means method by assigning a decreasing weight on its variable level and evaluating the 'weighted k-means' on a yeast cell-cycle data set. Protein complexes from a public website are used as biological benchmarks. To compare the k-means clusters with the structures of the protein complexes, we measure the agreement between these two ways of clustering via the adjusted Rand index. Results: Our results show the time-decreasing weight function-exp[-(1/2)(t(2)/C-2)-]which we assign to the variable level of k-means, generally increases the agreement between protein complexes and k-means clusters when C is near the length of two cell cycles.

J	Oshio, H; Hoshino, N; Ito, T; Nakano, M				Oshio, H; Hoshino, N; Ito, T; Nakano, M			Single-molecule magnets of ferrous cubes: Structurally controlled magnetic anisotropy	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							HIGH-SPIN MOLECULES; CARBOXYLATE COMPLEXES; CUBANE COMPLEXES; IRON CLUSTER; SUSCEPTIBILITY; RELAXATION; MANGANESE; BEHAVIOR; COBALT	Tetranuclear Fe-II cubic complexes were synthesized with Schiff base ligands bridging the Fell centers. X-ray structural analyses of six ferrous cubes, [Fe-4(sap)(4)(MeOH)(4)].2H(2)O (1), [Fe-4(5-Br-sap)(4)(MeOH)(4)] (2), [Fe-4(3-MeO-sap)(4)(MeOH)(4)].2MeOH (3), [Fe-4(sae)(4)(MeOH)(4)] (4), [Fe-4(5-Br-sae)(4)(MeOH)(4)]. MeOH (5), and [Fe-4(3,5-Cl-2-sae)(4)(MeOH)(4)] (6) (R-sap and R-sae were prepared by condensation of salicylaldehyde derivatives with aminopropyl alcohol and aminoethyl alcohol, respectively) were performed, and their magnetic properties were studied. In 1-6, the alkoxo groups of the Schiff base ligands bridge four Fe-II ions in a mu(3)-mode forming [Fe4O4] cubic cores. The Fell ions in the cubes have tetragonally elongated octahedral coordination geometries, and the equatorial coordination bond lengths in 4-6 are shorter than those in 1-3. Dc magnetic susceptibility measurements for 1-6 revealed that intramolecular ferromagnetic interactions are operative to lead an S = 8 spin ground state. Analyses of the magnetization data at 1.8 K gave the axial zero-field splitting parameters (D) of +0.81, +0.80, +1.15, -0.64, -0.66, and -0.67 cm(-1) for 1-6, respectively. Ac magnetic susceptibility measurements for 4-6 showed both frequency dependent in- and out-of-phase signals, while 1-3 did not show out-of-phase signals down to 1.8 K, meaning 4-6 are single-molecule magnets (SMMs). The energy barriers to flip the spin between up- and down-spin were estimated to 28.4, 30.5, and 26.2 K, respectively, for 4-6. The bridging ligands R-sap(2-) in 1-3 and R-sae(2-) in 4-6 form six- and five-membered chelate rings, respectively, which cause different steric strain and Jahn-Teller distortions at Fe-II centers. The sign of the D value was discussed by using angular overlap model (AOM) calculations for irons with different coordination geometry.

J	Han, KS; Champeaux, JL; Roujean, JL				Han, KS; Champeaux, JL; Roujean, JL			A land cover classification product over France at 1 km resolution using SPOT4/VEGETATION data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						land cover; France; SPOT4/VEGETATION	AVHRR DATA; SURFACE; MODEL; REFLECTANCES; ATMOSPHERE	The present study focuses on the development of a new land cover classification product over France at I km resolution. It is based on data sets from the Earth observing system SPOT4/VEGETATION. The satellite measurements are aimed at supporting regional efforts to set up global mosaics on new land cover products. They have been acquired in the frame of the Global Land Cover 2000 project. The instrument design relies on advanced technology, which leads to an improved radiometric and geometric resolution data. Such characteristics allow taking full benefit of the daily repetitiveness of the VEGETATION wide field-of-view sensor without the drawback of a variable pixel size on the image edge. Several physical processing steps are successively operated to the images on a per-pixel basis to remove detector blindness, to filter cloud contamination, and finally to correct both atmospheric and surface anisotropy effects. A new thematic map using the K-means clustering method has been built. First, the results of the satellite-based land cover classification has been successfully compared with the Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) database which serves as a reference to appraise the reliability of the study. Then, it has been inter-compared with land cover products derived from MODIS and AVHRR sensors. For this, an aggregative scheme particularly focused on major land units (forest, grassland, cropland) adopted in order to yield a whole mapping at the same geographic projection and space resolution. The discrepancies between maps enhance the quality of the proposed product, thanks to the use of advanced data processing and a more appropriate method. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Christodoulou, J; Malmendal, A; Harper, JF; Chazin, WJ				Christodoulou, J; Malmendal, A; Harper, JF; Chazin, WJ			Evidence for differing roles for each lobe of the calmodulin-like domain in a calcium-dependent protein kinase	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SMALL-ANGLE SCATTERING; INTRAMOLECULAR BINDING; PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM; CIRCULAR-DICHROISM; TARGET RECOGNITION; REGULATORY DOMAIN; NMR-SPECTROSCOPY; CA2+ BINDING; ACTIVATION; PEPTIDE	Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are structurally unique Ser/Thr kinases found in plants and certain protozoa. They are distinguished by a calmodulin-like regulatory apparatus (calmodulin-like domain (CaM-LD)) that is joined via a junction (J) region to the C-terminal end of the kinase catalytic domain. Like CaM, the CaM-LD is composed of two globular EF structural domains (N-lobe,C-lobe), each containing a pair of Ca2+ binding sites. Spectroscopic analysis shows that the CaM-LD is comprised of helical elements, but the isolated CaM-LD does not form a conformationally homogeneous tertiary structure in the absence of Ca2+. The addition of substoichiometric amounts of Ca2+ is sufficient to stabilize the C-terminal lobe in a construct containing J and CaM-LD (JC) but not in the CaM-LD alone. Moreover, as J is titrated into Ca2+-saturated CaM-LD, interactions are stronger with the C-lobe than the N-lobe of the CaM-LD. Measurements of Ca2+ affinity for JC reveal two cooperatively interacting high affinity binding sites (K-d,(mean) = 5.6 nM at 20 mM KCl) in the C-lobe and two weaker sites in the N-lobe (K-d,K-mean = 110 nM at 20 mM KCl). The corresponding Ca2+ binding constants in the isolated CaM-LD are lower by more than 2 orders of magnitude, which indicates that the J region has an essential role in stabilizing the structure of the CDPK regulatory apparatus. The large differential affinity between the two domains together with previous studies on a plasmodium CDPK (Zhao, Y., Pokutta, S., Maurer, P., Lindt, M., Franklin, R. M., and Kappes, B. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 3714-3721) suggests a model whereby even at normally low cytosolic levels of Ca2+, the C-lobe interacts with the junction, but the kinase remains in an autoinhibited state. Activation then occurs when Ca2+ levels rise to fill the two weaker affinity binding sites in the N-lobe, thereby triggering a conformational change that leads to release of the autoinhibitory region.

The method proposed is based on the use of a genetic algorithm to select those variables important to make the presence of groups in data clear. The procedure has been implemented to be used with k-means and using the cluster silhouettes as fitness function for the genetic algorithm. The main problem that can appear when applying the method to real data is the fact that, in general, we do not know a priori what the real cluster structure is (number and composition of the groups). The work explores the evolution of the silhouette values computed from the clusters built by using k-means when non-informative variables are added to the original data set in both a literature data set as well as some simulated data in higher dimension. The procedure has also been applied to real data sets. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Cao, WM				Cao, WM			The application of Direction basis function neural networks to the prediction of chaotic time series	CHINESE JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Direction basis function; neural networks; chaotic time series		In this paper we have examined the ability of Direction basis function networks (DBFN) to predict the output of a chaotic time series generated from a model of a physical system. DBFNs are known to be universal approximators, and chaotic systems are known to exhibit "random" behavior. Therefore the challenge is to apply the DBFN to the prediction of the output of a chaotic system, which we have chosen here to be the Mackey-Glass delay differential equation. The DBFN has been trained with off-line supervised learning using a Recursive Least Squares optimization for obtaining weights. Key issues which are addressed are the estimation of the order of the system and dependence of prediction error on various factors such as placement of DBF centers, selection of perceptive widths, and number of training samples. Included in this study is an implementation of Moody and Darken's K Means Clustering approach to optimally place DBF centers and a heuristic nearest neighbor method for determining perceptive widths.

J	Martinez, AM; Mittrapiyanuruk, P; Kak, AC				Martinez, AM; Mittrapiyanuruk, P; Kak, AC			On combining graph-partitioning with non-parametric clustering for image segmentation	COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING			English	Article							RATIO-CUT; PERCEPTUAL ORGANIZATION; EIGENVECTORS; ALGORITHM	The goal of this communication is to suggest an alternative implementation of the k-way Ncut approach for image segmentation. We believe that our implementation alleviates a problem associated with the Ncut algorithm for some types of images: its tendency to partition regions that are nearly uniform with respect to the segmentation parameter. Previous implementations have used the k-means algorithm to cluster the data in the eigenspace of the affinity matrix. In the k-means based implementations, the number of clusters is estimated by minimizing a function that represents the quality of the results produced by each possible value of k. Our proposed approach uses the clustering algorithm of Koontz and Fukunaga in which k is automatically selected as clusters are formed (in a single iteration). We show comparison results obtained with the two different approaches to non-parametric clustering. The Ncut generated oversegmentations are further suppressed by a grouping stage-also Ncut based-in our implementation. The affinity matrix for the grouping stage uses similarity based on the mean values of the segments. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In particular, automatic segmentation of necrotic femoral head is of importance for various corresponding clinical tasks including visualization, quantitative assessment, early diagnosis and adequate management of patients suffering from avascular necrosis of the femoral head (ANFH). Early diagnosis and treatment of ANFH is crucial since the disease occurs in relatively young individuals with an average age of 20-50, and since treatment options for more advanced disease are frequently unsuccessful. The present paper describes several new techniques and software for automatic segmentation of necrotic femoral head based on clinically obtained multi-slice T1-weighted MR data. In vivo MR data sets of 50 actual patients are used in the study. An automatic method built up to manage the segmentation task according to image intensity of bone tissues, shape of the femoral head, and other characters. The processing scheme consisted of the following five steps. (1) Rough segmentation of nonnecrotic lesions of the femur by applying a 3D gray morphological operation and a 3D region growing technique. (2) Fitting a 3D ellipse to the femoral head by a new approach utilizing the constraint of the shape of the femur, and employing a principle component analysis and a simulated annealing technique. (3) Estimating the femoral neck location, and also femoral head axis by integrating anatomical information of the femur and boundary of estimated 3D ellipse. (4) Removal of non-bony tissues around the femoral neck and femoral head ligament by utilizing the estimated femoral neck axis.

J	Shin, HW; Sohn, SY				Shin, HW; Sohn, SY			Segmentation of stock trading customers according to potential value	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						customer relationship management; customer segmentation; K-means clustering; self-organizing map; fuzzy K-means	MAPS	In this article, we use three clustering methods (K-means, self-organizing map, and fuzzy K-means) to find properly graded stock market brokerage commission rates based on the 3-month long total trades of two different transaction modes (representative assisted and online trading system). Stock traders for both modes are classified in terms of the amount of the total trade as well as the amount of trade of each transaction mode, respectively. Results of our empirical analysis indicate that fuzzy K-means cluster analysis is the most robust approach for segmentation of customers of both transaction modes. We then propose a decision tree based rule to classify three groups of customers and suggest different brokerage commission rates of 0.4, 0.45, and 0.5% for representative assisted mode and 0.06, 0.1, and 0.18% for online trading system, respectively.

The refined VQ-based image compression method further lossless encodes the compression data which is generated by the traditional VQ-based image compression method into a set of compression codes. The index image generated by the refined method is a contracted image of the compressed image, which can be used as the preview of the compressed image on image management. Although the PSNRs of the reconstructed images that are decoded by the refined VQ-based image compression method and the traditional VQ-based image compression method are the same, the refined VQ-based image compression method provides a better storage efficiency.

J	Weber, KR; Acton, ST				Weber, KR; Acton, ST			On connected filters in color image processing	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING			English	Article								A standard approach to extending gray-scale filters to color is the use of gray-scale filters on each of the red, green, and blue bands separately. This RGB component method, when applied to connected filters, causes the introduction of new colors into the image, which could lead to incorrect classification or analysis. We develop a method of applying connected filters to color images using rotation in the hue band of the hue-saturation-value (HSV) color space. The rotation shifts the discontinuity in hue such that the distance to the nearest k-means cluster mean is maximized and the histogram value is simultaneously minimized. When applied to the sample image set, the error from the RGB component approach is of the order of 10 times greater than that of our hue rotation approach. Additionally, our approach yields qualitatively improved images, with fewer new colors introduced than the RGB component method. (C) 2004 SPIE and IST.

J	Lingras, P; West, C				Lingras, P; West, C			Interval set clustering of web users with rough K-means	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						clustering; interval sets; K-means algorithm; rough sets; unsupervised learning; web mining	CLASSIFICATION	Data collection and analysis in web mining faces certain unique challenges. Due to a variety of reasons inherent in web browsing and web logging, the likelihood of bad or incomplete data is higher than conventional applications. The analytical techniques in web mining need to accommodate such data. Fuzzy and rough sets provide the ability to deal with incomplete and approximate information. Fuzzy set theory has been shown to be useful in three important aspects of web and data mining, namely clustering, association, and sequential analysis. There is increasing interest in research on clustering based on rough set theory. Clustering is an important part of web mining that involves finding natural groupings of web resources or web users. Researchers have pointed out some important differences between clustering in conventional applications and clustering in web mining. For example, the clusters and associations in web mining do not necessarily have crisp boundaries. As a result, researchers have studied the possibility of using fuzzy sets in web mining clustering applications. Recent attempts have used genetic algorithms based on rough set theory for clustering. However, the genetic algorithms based clustering may not be able to handle the large amount of data typical in a web mining application. This paper proposes a variation of the K-means clustering algorithm based on properties of rough sets. The proposed algorithm represents clusters as interval or rough sets. The paper also describes the design of an experiment including data collection and the clustering process. The experiment is used to create interval set representations of clusters of web visitors.

J	Anstey, RL; Pachut, JF				Anstey, RL; Pachut, JF			Cladistic and phenetic recognition of species in the Ordovician bryozoan genus Peronopora	JOURNAL OF PALEONTOLOGY			English	Article							PALEOZOIC STENOLAEMATE BRYOZOANS; QUANTITATIVE GENETICS; PHENOTYPIC EVOLUTION; NICHOLSON-COLLECTION; PHYLOGENY; HETEROCHRONY; SYSTEMATICS; ORGANISMS; ASTOGENY; DIATOMS	We compare cladistic, phenetic, stratophenetic, and typological methods of recognizing species within a single well-sampled. long-lived Ordovician bryozoan genus, Peronopora Nicholson, 1881. A consensus of 11 methods recognizes 14 species within Peronopora, each of which has both cladistic and phenetic support, and support by at least four different methods. Comparison of methods was based on: 1) the number of species recognized; 2) the degree of splitting of consensus groups, 3) consistency in determining first and last appearance datums, and stratigraphic ranges; 4) consistency in the number of specimens assigned to species; 5) stability in recognizing geographic distributions; and 6) correlations with character heritability. The five methods most closely approaching consensus were: 1) Ward clustering on Euclidean distance; 2) K-means splitting; 3) Ward clustering on correlation coefficients; 4) cladistic parsimony: and 5) cladistic parsimony plus iterative discriminant analysis. The three methods farthest from consensus were: 1) stratophenetics: 2) average linkage on Euclidean distance; and 3) conventional typology. Cladistic parsimony is the only method that can recognize all 14 consensus clusters. We argue that the overall advantages of parsimony analysis outweigh the merits of the various phenetic approaches in recognizing paleontological species. We also argue that given sufficient allochrony in sampling, cladistic structure is detectable both within and among species. Recognizing species based on fixed character states would require at least 72 species in our material. The crown groups of Pachut and Anstey (2002) are herein recognized as monophyletic species in the sense of Mishler and Theriot (2000), one of which we designate as a new species, P. browni. Six of our eight nonmonophyletic stem groups are recognized in this paper as metaspecies in the sense of Donoghue (1985) and Gauthier et al. (1988). Two of our stem groups are phenetically indistinguishable from phyletically contiguous crown groups, and we attribute the failure of parsimony analysis to recognize the monophyly of these groups to homoplasy.

J	Drineas, P; Frieze, A; Kannan, R; Vempala, S; Vinay, V				Drineas, P; Frieze, A; Kannan, R; Vempala, S; Vinay, V			Clustering large graphs via the Singular Value Decomposition	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						Singular Value Decomposition; randomized algorithms; k-means clustering	APPROXIMATION	We consider the problem of partitioning a set of m points in the n-dimensional Euclidean space into k clusters ( usually m and n are variable, while k is fixed), so as to minimize the sum of squared distances between each point and its cluster center. This formulation is usually the objective of the k-means clustering algorithm (Kanungo et al. ( 2000)). We prove that this problem in NP-hard even for k = 2, and we consider a continuous relaxation of this discrete problem: find the k-dimensional subspace V that minimizes the sum of squared distances to V of the m points. This relaxation can be solved by computing the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the m x n matrix A that represents the m points; this solution can be used to get a 2-approximation algorithm for the original problem. We then argue that in fact the relaxation provides a generalized clustering which is useful in its own right. Finally, we show that the SVD of a random submatrix-chosen according to a suitable probability distribution of a given matrix provides an approximation to the SVD of the whole matrix, thus yielding a very fast randomized algorithm. We expect this algorithm to be the main contribution of this paper, since it can be applied to problems of very large size which typically arise in modern applications.

J	Mettu, RR; Plaxton, CG				Mettu, RR; Plaxton, CG			Optimal time bounds for approximate clustering	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th Annual Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence	AUG, 2002	Edmonton, CANADA			k-means; k-median; unsupervised clustering; approximation algorithms; discrete location theory		Clustering is a fundamental problem in unsupervised learning, and has been studied widely both as a problem of learning mixture models and as an optimization problem. In this paper, we study clustering with respect to the k-median objective function, a natural formulation of clustering in which we attempt to minimize the average distance to cluster centers. One of the main contributions of this paper is a simple but powerful sampling technique that we call successive sampling that could be of independent interest. We show that our sampling procedure can rapidly identify a small set of points (of size just O(k log n/k)) that summarize the input points for the purpose of clustering. Using successive sampling, we develop an algorithm for the k-median problem that runs in O(nk) time for a wide range of values of k and is guaranteed, with high probability, to return a solution with cost at most a constant factor times optimal. We also establish a lower bound of Omega(nk) on any randomized constant-factor approximation algorithm for the k-median problem that succeeds with even a negligible (say 1/100) probability. The best previous upper bound for the problem was (O) over tilde (nk), where the (O) over tilde -notation hides polylogarithmic factors in n and k. The best previous lower bound of Omega(nk) applied only to deterministic k-median algorithms. While we focus our presentation on the k-median objective, all our upper bounds are valid for the k-means objective as well. In this context our algorithm compares favorably to the widely used k-means heuristic, which requires O( nk) time for just one iteration and provides no useful approximation guarantees.

J	Jain, BJ; Wysotzki, F				Jain, BJ; Wysotzki, F			Central clustering of attributed graphs	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						attributed graphs; graph matching; K-means clustering; weighted maximum clique; Hopfield networks; winner-takes-all networks	PATTERN-RECOGNITION; NEURAL-NETWORK; STRUCTURED DATA; SEARCH; ARCHITECTURE; ALGORITHMS; RELAXATION; DISTANCE	Partitioning a data set of attributed graphs into clusters arises in different application areas of structural pattern recognition and computer vision. Despite its importance, graph clustering is currently an underdeveloped research area in machine learning due to the lack of theoretical analysis and the high computational cost of measuring structural proximities. To address the first issue, we introduce the concept of metric graph spaces that enables central (or center-based) clustering algorithms to be applied to the domain of attributed graphs. The key idea is to embed attributed graphs into Euclidean space without loss of structural information. In addressing the second issue of computational complexity, we propose a neural network solution of the K-means algorithm for structures (KMS). As a distinguishing feature to improve the computational time, the proposed algorithm classifies the data graphs according to the principle of elimination of competition where the input graph is assigned to the winning model of the competition. In experiments we investigate the behavior and performance of the neural KMS algorithm.

Most of these popular validity measures do not work well for clusters with different densities and/or sizes. They usually have a tendency of ignoring clusters with low densities. In this paper, we propose a new validity measure that can deal with this situation. In addition, we also propose a modified K-means algorithm that can assign more cluster centres to areas with low densities of data than the conventional K-means algorithm does. First, several artificial data sets are used to test the performance of the proposed measure. Then the proposed measure and the modified K-means algorithm are applied to reduce the edge degradation in vector quantisation of image compression.

J	Pham, DT; Dimov, SS; Nguyen, CD				Pham, DT; Dimov, SS; Nguyen, CD			An incremental K-means algorithm	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						clustering; K-means method; incremental clustering	MEANS CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM; VECTOR QUANTIZATION; INITIALIZATION	Data clustering is an important data exploration technique with many applications in engineering, including parts family formation in group technology and segmentation in image processing. One of the most popular data clustering methods is K-means clustering because of its simplicity and computational efficiency. The main problem with this clustering method is its tendency to converge at a local minimum. In this paper, the cause of this problem is explained and an existing solution involving a cluster centre jumping operation is examined. The jumping technique alleviates the problem with local minima by enabling cluster centres to move in such a radical way as to reduce the overall cluster distortion. However, the method is very sensitive to errors in estimating distortion. A clustering scheme that is also based on distortion reduction through cluster centre movement but is not so sensitive to inaccuracies in distortion estimation is proposed in this paper. The scheme, which is an incremental version of the K-means algorithm, involves adding cluster centres one by one as clusters are being formed. The paper presents test results to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

It is designed for detecting inherent group structures with arbitrary shape clusters among multidimensional measurement data without any a priori information. The algorithm is named after its clustering mechanism of converging data points to their corresponding nearest local maxima of the data's density estimate along the ascending gradient direction. Two simulated data sets and two real data sets are employed to validate the performance of the method. A comparison between the clustering results obtained from the proposed algorithm and the K-means cluster analysis shows that the NLMSA possesses quite satisfactory performance. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

ClONO2 was retrieved by constrained nonlinear least squares fit from MIPAS measurements with a vertical resolution of 3.3-3.8 km and an estimated accuracy of 6-11% in the lower stratosphere (18-27 km). During the end of September 2002 an unusual major stratospheric warming affected the polar vortex. At the 475 K potential temperature level, ClONO2 showed a pronounced collar structure with high mixing ratios at the vortex edge and values of 0.5-0.6 ppbv in the inner region from 8 to 17 September. During the following 8 days, mean inner vortex ClONO2 increased by 0.8 ppbv accompanied by a decrease of ClO. Thus from 18 to 25 September the conversion into ClONO2 was a major pathway for chlorine deactivation at 475 K. After 25 September, ClONO2 decreased because of conversion into HCl. The onset of chlorine deactivation at 475 K is consistent with the latest polar stratospheric clouds detected by MIPAS on 18 September. At 625 K, mean inner vortex ClONO2 mixing ratios decreased from 2 to 1.35 ppbv from 8 September to 13 October. This evolution was interrupted by temporary chlorine activation from 12 to 16 September when values of 1.55 ppbv were reached. Comparison with previous measurements and model results of 1992 show similar chlorine partitioning at 475 K before the major warming in 2002. However, there is indication that in 2002 the evolution of chlorine deactivation at 475 K was characterized by a faster and more pronounced increase of ClONO2 compared with 1992.

While all loci in nine populations were polymorphic with up to six alleles at the ALB and TF loci: the Namchi population showed monomorphism at the CA II locus and Muturu at the ALB, CA II, and HBB loci. There was a clear distinction between Bos indicus and Bos taurus breeds at the ALB locus with ALB(B) predominating in indicine and ALB(A) predominating in taurine breeds. CA IIS, GC(A), and HBBA were the most commonly occurring alleles in all populations. Two variants not described before were demonstrated by PAG-IEF at the ALB locus and named ALB(J) and ALB(K). Mean effective number of alleles as measure of intrabreed diversity was higher in zebu populations (2.040-2.288) as compared to taurine breeds (1.349-1.836). Significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium occurred in some populations at the HBB and TF loci. More haplotypes of ALB/GC occurred in the zebu than taurine breeds. ALB(A)GC(A) predominated in the taurine populations and ALB(B)GC(A) in the indicine populations. Influence of zebu genes on the Namchi and N'Dama taurine breeds was detected at the ALB, CA II, HBB, and TF loci, and estimated at 61.5% and 5.7%, respectively. The high resolution of PAG-IEF in screening for polymorphisms within diversity studies was demonstrated.

No exact polynomial-time algorithms are known for this problem. Although asymptotically efficient approximation algorithms exist, these algorithms are not practical due to the very high constant factors involved. There are many heuristics that are used in practice, but we know of no bounds on their performance. We consider the question of whether there exists a simple and practical approximation algorithm for k-means clustering. We present a local improvement heuristic based on swapping centers in and out. We prove that this yields a (9 + epsilon)-approximation algorithm. We present an example showing that any approach based on performing a fixed number of swaps achieves an approximation factor of at least (9 - epsilon) in all sufficiently high dimensions. Thus, our approximation factor is almost tight for algorithms based on performing a fixed number of swaps. To establish the practical value of the heuristic, we present an empirical study that shows that, when combined with Lloyd's algorithm, this heuristic performs quite well in practice.

This paper describes a robust procedure to obtain a guidance directrix. The procedure includes row segmentation by K-means clustering algorithm, row detection by a moment algorithm, and guidance line selection by a cost function. Auxiliary information, such as the known crop row spacing, is used to aid in the development of the guidance directrix. Two image data sets, one taken from a soybean field and the other taken from a corn field, were used to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed image processing procedure. The average RMS offset error from 30 soybean images was 1.0 cm with an average cost of 4.99. In contrast, the average RMS offset error from 15 corn images was 2.4 cm with an average cost of 7.27. The proposed image processing procedure was implemented on a vision-based guidance tractor. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To evaluate the dysregulation of apoptosis and the MAPK pathway in hepatocarcinogenesis, we investigated the expression profiles of the genes involved in apoptosis and MAPK pathway in cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. A total of 94 tissue specimens (61 cirrhosis and 33 hepatocellular carcinoma) obtained from 67 patients were analyzed by microarray, quantitative PCR and Western blot experiments. Of 71 apoptosis-associated genes, c-raf-1 and S6 were up-regulated in 42.9% and 32.1% of 28 cirrhosis tissues, respectively, and both genes were well correlated in a five-cluster K-means analysis. For c-raf-1 and down stream genes in the MAPK pathway, c-raf-1, MEK, and MAPK were up-regulated in 40%, 80%, and 86.7% of 45 cirrhosis specimens, respectively, and in 50%, 63.6%, and 59.1% of 22 hepatocellular carcinoma specimens, respectively. Western blot analysis showed that activated Raf-1 was over-expressed in 91.2% (52/57) of cirrhosis and in 100% (30/30) of hepatocellular carcinoma. The expression level of Raf-1 in 14 of 26 paired samples (53.8%) was significantly higher in hepatocellular carcinoma than in cirrhosis (16.2 +/- 20.3-fold, P < 0.05). These results suggest that the activation of Raf-1 plays an important role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The proposed algorithm consists of three stages: initial segmentation of the first frame using color, motion, and position information, based on a variant of the K-Means-with-connectivity-constraint algorithm; a temporal tracking algorithm, using a Bayes classifier and rule-based processing to reassign changed pixels to existing regions and to efficiently handle the introduction of new regions; and a trajectory-based region merging procedure that employs the long-term trajectory of regions, rather than the motion at the frame level, so as to group them to objects with different motion. As shown by experimental evaluation, this scheme can efficiently segment video sequences with fast moving or newly appearing objects. A comparison with other methods shows segmentation results corresponding more accurately to the real objects appearing on the image sequence.

The proposed color image segmentation algorithm performs the segmentation in the combined intensity-texture-position feature space in order to produce connected regions that correspond to the real-life objects shown in the image. A preprocessing stage of conditional image filtering and a modified K-Means-with-connectivity-constraint pixel classification algorithm are used to allow for seamless integration of the different pixel features. Unsupervised operation of the segmentation algorithm is enabled by means of an initial clustering procedure. The large-format image segmentation scheme employs the aforementioned segmentation algorithm, providing an elegant framework for the fast segmentation of relatively large images. In this framework, the segmentation algorithm is applied to reduced versions of the original images, in order to speed-up the completion of the segmentation, resulting in a coarse-grained segmentation mask. The final fine-grained segmentation mask is produced with partial reclassification of the pixels of the original image to the already formed regions, using a Bayes classifier. As shown by experimental evaluation, this novel scheme provides fast segmentation with high perceptual segmentation quality.

The recorded databases in the rolling process contain hundreds of features, and new methods are needed to reveal the novel and useful information. In the present study, the data from a hot strip rolling process were analysed in order to identify the rolling conditions in which some common defects, such as too thin or too narrow strip, do and do not occur. At the beginning, the dataset was reduced from its original size of over 200 features to 17% by using basic statistical analysis and linear correlation. After this, self-organising maps, parallel coordinates display, and k means clustering were used to find out the conditional probabilities of the common defect types. As a result, the method presented here revealed the rolling conditions for the four common defect types, i.e. coiling temperature close to the limits, too thin strip, too narrow strip, and torn tail end. Most important, the knowledge gained can be used to reduce the number of these defects.

These analyses generated a high amount of data which could not be processed without a further step using a chemometric approach. Thus, a heuristic methodology was developed, relying on the application of pattern recognition methods, such as Principal Components Analysis, hierarchical classification and the k-means method generally used in chemometry. In order to avoid subjective selection and reduction of data, a signal treatment relying on the alignment and the segmentation of pyrograms was performed before to the statistical analysis. The gathering of test-samples analysed several times validated this methodology. The main chemometric results provided a typology of sludges which consisted in a classification in different groups, and allowed to display the characteristic peaks of each group. This chemometric analysis gathered a group of sludges with an average chemical composition characterizing stable organic material and pointed out the atypical chemical composition of several sewage sludges. These results demonstrated the efficiency of Py-GC/AED associated to chemometric methods for the global characterization of the insoluble organic fraction of sewage sludges. It could be possible to apply, with further calibration, to the monitoring of sludge composition during its treatment. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Moyano, PC; Zuniga, RN				Moyano, PC; Zuniga, RN			Enthalpy-entropy compensation for browning of potato strips during deep-fat frying	JOURNAL OF FOOD ENGINEERING			English	Article						enthalpy; entropy; browning; frying; potato	MAILLARD REACTION; WATER SORPTION; ACRYLAMIDE; TEMPERATURE; ISOTHERMS; KINETICS; TISSUE; MODELS; PULP; SKIN	By applying the transition state theory, enthalpy-entropy compensation was studied for browning kinetic data obtained during deep-fat frying of both impregnated and control potato strips (Solanum tuberosum L., Desiree variety). The main objective was to study an eventual change in the browning mechanism during frying, and the effect on it of solutes impregnation (corn syrup DE 42 and NaCl). Two alternative approaches were used in order to obtain the isokinetic temperature: enthalpy/entropy relationship and frequency factor/activation energy relationship. Values of 333.1 and 335.9 K were found respectively. Both values are significantly lower than the harmonic mean temperature which was found to be 397.0 K, meaning that the mechanism of reaction is entropy controlled. A statistical analysis carried out for the data of enthalpy of activation against the entropy of activation showed that only one mechanism is present for browning during frying and that the impregnation of the strips with the studied solutes had no effect on the reaction mechanism.

It is usual to display parametric images derived from the measured pulses. In this work, classification was achieved by applying multispectral clustering techniques to sets of parametric images. It was hypothesised that adequate information for clustering was carried in a small number of parametric images, providing these were weighted by complementary physical properties. Materials prepared for histopathological examination were chosen because their condition remained stable during long imaging periods and because their dehydrated state led to greater penetration of the radiation. Two specimens were examined in this pilot study, one of basal cell carcinoma and one of melanoma. Unsupervised ISODATA classification using three selected parametric terahertz pulsed images was compared qualitatively with k-means classification using the shape of the whole time series, and with conventional stained microscope slides. There was good qualitative agreement between the classifications. Classifications were consistent with the morphological appearances expected, but further work is required to determine if tumour discrimination is possible. The results have implications for the future development of the technique as the need for only a small number of features could lead to considerably reduced acquisition times. (C) 2004 IPEM.

However, the main problem associated with data analysis is the discrimination between the different acoustic emission sources. The objective of the cluster analysis is to separate a set of data into several classes that reflect the internal structure of the data. Indeed, cluster analysis is an important tool for investigating and interpreting data. In this paper we use two kinds of classifiers: a supervised classifier and also an unsupervised one (Kohonen's map). We combine two techniques: the k-means algorithm and the k nearest neighbours. Glass/polyester model specimens were used for the validation of the proposed methodology. We worked on polyester resin and glass/polyester unidirectional specimens, subjected to tensile loading within different configurations, awaiting preferential damage modes in the material. Moreover, single fibre composites have been tested to produce fibre breakage acoustic emission events under conditions closely approximating those encountered in a real composite.

J	Mahani, AS; Carlsson, AE; Wessel, R				Mahani, AS; Carlsson, AE; Wessel, R			Mixing two sets of noisy measurements changes the N-dependence of resolution to a fourth-root power law	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND GENERAL			English	Article							NORMAL MIXTURE-MODELS; NUMBER; COMPONENTS; CLUSTERS; DISTRIBUTIONS	If noise is uncorrelated during repeated measurements of the same physical variable, averaging these measurements improves the accuracy of estimating the variable. When two values of a variable are measured separately, the smallest separation of these two values that can be discriminated with a certain reliability (resolution) is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of measurements employed. However, if measurements for these two values are mixed together, they need to be clustered before being averaged. Distinguishing mixed clusters with small separations can be thought of as a problem of deciding the number of components in a finite mixture model. Using the likelihood ratio, the second-moment estimator, and the k-means clustering methods, we will show that a similarly defined resolution for the mixed scenario is, approximately, inversely proportional to the fourth-root of the number of measurements. The observed fourth-root law is explained in terms of some more intuitive properties of the problem. We also conclude that, assuming that the fourth-root law is universal, the methods reported here are near-optimal.

The clustering algorithms used are hierarchical, crisp (neural gas, self-organizing maps, hard competitive learning, k-means, maximin-distance, CLARA) and fuzzy (c-means, fuzzy competitive learning). To compare these methods we use two performance measures, namely the correlation coefficient and the weighted Jaccard coefficient (wJC). Both performance coefficients (PCs) clearly show that the neural gas and the k-means algorithm perform significantly better than all the other methods using our setup. For the hierarchical methods the ward linkage algorithm performs best under our simulation design. In conclusion, the neural gas method seems to be the best choice for fMRI cluster analysis, given its correct classification of activated pixels (true positives (TPs)) whilst minimizing the misclassification of inactivated pixels (false positives (FPs)), and in the stability of the results achieved.

Our predictive model allows the selection of an optimal target point where expected profit from direct mailing is maximized. Our approach also produces models that are easier to interpret by using a smaller number of predictive features. Through sensitivity analysis, we also show that our chosen model significantly outperforms the baseline algorithms in terms of hit rate and expected net profit on key target points.

Empirical experiments compare the cluster validity and the learning efficiency of ART-C 2A with those of ART 2A, as well as three closely related clustering methods, namely online K-Means, batch K-Means, and SOM, in a quantitative manner. Besides retaining the online cluster creation capability of ART 2A, ART-C 2A gives the alternative clustering solution, which allows a direct control on the number of output clusters generated by the self-organizing process.

J	Yang, HT; Chen, SC; Tsai, WN				Yang, HT; Chen, SC; Tsai, WN			Classification of direct load control curves for performance evaluation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS			English	Article						Davies-Bouldin index; direct load control (DLC); nonlinear principal component analysis; periodic analysis; self-organizing maps	NEURAL-NETWORKS	In evaluating the performance of direct load control (DLC) programs, an essential task is to classify the DLC curves into either the one complying with the program or not. This paper presents an efficient approach to clustering the DLC curves through a structure of self-organizing maps (SOM). Aiming at selecting significant features of DLC curves, methods of nonlinear principal component analysis (NLPCA) and periodic analysis are proposed for feature extraction. The dual multilayer neural networks (DMNN) model is employed in the proposed NLPCA method. In the periodic analysis method, the periodic characteristics of the DLC curves are investigated. In the SOM, Davies-Bouldin (DB) indexes and a k-means algorithm decide the best number of clusters to be classified. Through the proposed methods, the DLC curves are thus divided into the two categories by the SOM: DLC complying and DLC noncomplying loads.

Simulated property prediction experiments with the Starlist file of logP values demonstrate that use of the fuzzy k-means method can, in some cases, yield results that are superior to those obtained with the conventional k-means method and with Ward's clustering method. Clustering of several small sets of agrochemical compounds demonstrate the ability of the fuzzy k-means method to highlight multicluster membership and to identify outlier compounds, although the former can be difficult to interpret in some cases.

In this study, a novel multispectral (MS) MRI analysis method is presented to quantify changes in bone lesion volume (DeltaBLV) in the hands of RA patients. Image registration and MS analysis were employed to identify MS tissue class transitions between two serial MRI exams. DeltaBLV was determined from MS class transitions between two time points. The following three classifiers were investigated: (a) multivariate Gaussian (MVG), (b) k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and (c) K-means (KM). Unlike supervised classifiers (MVG, k-NN). KM. an unsupervised classifier, does not require labeled training data, resulting in potentially greater clinical utility. All MS estimates of DeltaBLV were linearly correlated (r(p)) with manual estimates. KM and k-NN estimates also exhibited a significant rank-order correlation (r(s)) with manual estimates. For KM, t(p) = 0.94 p < 0.0001, r(s) = 0.76 p = 0.002; for k-NN, r(p) = 0.86 p = 0.0001, r(s) = 0.69 p = 0.009: and for MVG, r(p) = 0.84 p = 0.0003, r(s) = 0.49 p = 0.09. Temporal classification rates were as follows: for KM, 90.1%; for MVG, 89.5%: and for k-NN, 86.7%. KM snatched the performance of k-NN, offering strong potential for use in multicenter clinical trials. This study demonstrates that MS tissue class transitions provide a quantitative measure of DeltaBLV. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Meanwhile, current machine-leaming algorithms need labeled data for training first, so they are computational expensive and sometimes misled by artificial data. In this paper, a new detection algorithm, the Intrusion Detection Based on Genetic Clustering (IDBGC) algorithm, is proposed. It can automatically establish clusters and detect intruders by labeling normal and abnormal groups. Computer simulations show that this algorithm is effective for intrusion detection.

J	Hoar, MR; Palutikof, JP; Thorne, MC				Hoar, MR; Palutikof, JP; Thorne, MC			Model intercomparison for the present day, the mid-Holocene, and the Last Glacial Maximum over western Europe	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES			English	Article						model intercomparison; paleoclimate; Last Glacial Maximum; mid-Holocene; global circulation models	GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; OXYGEN-ISOTOPE STAGE-3; SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURES; NORTHERN AFRICA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; YOUNGER DRYAS; COUPLED MODEL; GCM SIMULATION; PROJECT PMIP; OCEAN	The focus of this paper is an evaluation of the performance over western Europe of an ensemble of General Circulation Models (GCMs) used to simulate climates at the present-day, the mid-Holocene and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Experiments are considered from the Palaeoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project (PMIP), and from more recent sensitivity studies for the same time slices. Surface air temperature and precipitation are compared between models, and with observed and proxy data sets, using evaluation measures such as correlation coefficients and root mean squared errors. Hierarchical and k-means cluster analysis are used to quantitatively assess relative model performance. Comparisons are made for western Europe for a gridded domain between 38N13W (south west corner) and 65N30E (north east corner), and for four transects within this domain. Inter-experiment comparisons reveal that the ranges of results from the sensitivity studies are within those of the PMIP models. There is no month-to-month or time slice-to-time slice consistency in the clustering patterns produced, although one clear characteristic is that experiments performed with models from the same institution tend to cluster. Inter-model agreement at past time slices is considerably reduced when we consider differences from the present-day rather than absolute values, and this is particularly the case for mid-Holocene temperature, when the insolation forcing only represents a small departure from modern values. Statistical comparisons of the models with observed and proxy data sets demonstrate a lack of consistency in model performance between months, transects and time slices.

J	Holden, NM; Brereton, AJ				Holden, NM; Brereton, AJ			Definition of agroclimatic regions in Ireland using hydro-thermal and crop yield data	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY			English	Article						agroclimate; k-means clustering; climograph; Ireland	CLIMATE-CHANGE; CLASSIFICATION; IMPACT	When compared to the agronomic aspects of agriculture the contribution of climate is poorly integrated into the body of scientific knowledge in Ireland. It is known that specific crops grow well in specific regions and that success of a crop can be related to climate factors. The aim of this paper was to derive agroclimatic regions of Ireland using hydro-thermal climate (as expressed by climographs using mean monthly rainfall and temperature) in conjunction with a statistical clustering technique (k-means clustering) to relate crop yield, estimated using mathematical simulation models for grass, barley, maize, potato and soybean to hydro-thermal climate data. A dataset, on a 10 km x 10 km grid, consisting of monthly radiation, rainfall, maximum temperature and minimum temperature was used to drive crop simulation models to predict average yields, for each grid square. Results showed that the crops simulated were sensitive to either available water or length of growing season. As there are few objective measures of the ideal number of clusters to use in order to create agroclimatic regions, clusterings to 3, 4 and 7 regions were evaluated against known properties of the Irish climate and crop responses. A seven cluster agroclimate region map was thought to be a good basis for describing Ireland's agroclimates and was compared with climate data for the national synoptic station network. Results suggested a reasonably good correspondence between clusters and their associated synoptic observation stations. Some anomalies were observed. The resulting agroclimatic map could be used for extrapolation of empirical research findings, for agri-environmental experimental design and as a framework for assessment of the impact of climate change on Irish agriculture.

In this paper, we propose the boost-clustering algorithm which constitutes a novel clustering methodology that exploits the general principles of boosting in order to provide a consistent partitioning of a dataset. The boost-clustering algorithm is a multi-clustering method. At each boosting iteration, a new training set is created using weighted random sampling from the original dataset and a simple clustering algorithm (e.g. k-means) is applied to provide a new data partitioning. The final clustering solution is produced by aggregating the multiple clustering results through weighted voting. Experiments on both artificial and real-world data sets indicate that boost-clustering provides solutions of improved quality. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Total RNA was extracted from the mandibles of 1- and 6-day-old rats. Radiolabeled probes were then synthesised and used to probe the DNA arrays. Of the 1176 genes examined, 306 were detectable, and the latter were analyzed by bioinformatics algorithms. K-means clustering grouped 72 genes into Up, 56 genes into Down and 178 genes into NO change. A large number of genes related to cell receptors (by ligands) were grouped into the Down cluster. Gene array technology appears to be a useful tool for studying the complex process of mandibular development. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Typically, clusters generated by an unsupervised algorithm, such as the K-means, are merged and labelled using a combination of manual and automated methods. Topographic shadows found in areas of high relief, particularly in areas with low sun angles, increase the complexity of land cover classification, as a single land cover class may have very different spectral responses in shadowed and nonshadowed areas of the image. Methods to increase classification accuracies in areas with severe topographic shadows are required for Canadian large area land cover mapping projects. In a standard supervised classification, increases in land cover map classification accuracy have been obtained by including topographic attributes as inputs to the classification algorithm. In this study we investigate the potential of such data as a means to increase the accuracy of an unsupervised land cover classification in a high-relief area in central British Columbia, Canada. Separate datasets were used in cluster labelling and accuracy assessment. Four classification trials were completed: (i) using a standard approach without the addition of topographic attributes, (ii) using elevation data as an additional input to (i), (iii) prestratifying the image into shadow and nonshadow areas prior to clustering, and (h) combining the methods used in (ii) and (iii). The latter provided the highest level of overall attribute accuracy at 80.1%, with a 95% confidence interval of 73.6%-88.6%. This is an improvement over the standard approach, which produced an overall attribute accuracy of 68.7%, with a 95% confidence interval of 59.8%-77.6%. We concluded that the prestratification of an image into areas of shadow and nonshadow prior to clustering in conjunction with the use of elevation data as an input to the clustering process is a practical method to increase classification accuracy in areas of high relief where topographic shadow is problematic.

Even though the pattern of aberrations is nonrandom, no specific primary or secondary karyotypic abnormalities have been identified. One explanation for the still-rudimentary understanding of the cytogenetic evolution in HNSCC could be the pronounced karyotypic complexity seen in these tumors. In an attempt to overcome this difficulty, we have applied several statistical methods such as hierarchical cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling, and k-means clustering, which allow the identification and interpretation of karyotypic pathways, as well as establishing a temporal order of chromosomal imbalances on 241 published and 70 previously unpublished HNSCC karyotypes. From the analysis of the distribution of the number of imbalances per tumor we suggest that the carcinomas evolve through three phases representing different stages of chromosomal instability. Two major cytogenetic pathways, one dominated by gains and another by losses, were identified by means of principal component analysis. These were initiated by +7 and by any of the aberrations 1p-, 3p-, or 7q-, respectively. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Web server access logs contain substantial data about user access patterns. Properly exploited, the logs can reveal useful information about each user's interests in a site; but restructuring a site's structure to individual user interests increases the computation at the server to an impractical degree. One way to solve this problem is to group users on the basis of their Web interests and then organize the site's structure according to the needs of different groups. Two main difficulties inhibit this approach: the essentially infinite diversity of user interests and the change in these interests with time. We have developed a clustering algorithm that groups users according to their Web access patterns.(1) The algorithm is based on the ART1 version(2,3) of adaptive resonance tbeory.(4) ART1 offers an unsupervised clustering approach that adapts to changes in users' access patterns over time without losing earlier information. It applies specifically to binary vectors. In our ART1-based algorithm, a prototype vector represents each user cluster by generalizing the URLs most frequently accessed by all cluster members. We have compared our algorithm's performance with the traditional k-means clustering algorithm. Results showed that the ART1-based technique performed better in terms of intracluster distances. We also applied the technique in a prefetching scheme that predicts future user requests. its prediction accuracy was as high as 97.78 percent.

Male (n = 106) and female (n = 174) exercisers were administered an exercise version of the Task and Ego Orientation in Sport Questionnaire (Duda & Nicholls, 1992) and an instrument measuring coping and task self-efficacy. The results of a K-means cluster analysis on the questionnaire scores resulted in a 5-cluster solution that maximized between-group differences and minimized within-group differences. A MANOVA indicated that the different cluster groups could be distinguished by their coping and task self-efficacy. More specifically, exercisers with high levels of task orientation, regardless of their corresponding levels of ego orientation, were characterized by having higher levels of self-efficacy than exercisers with low levels of task orientation combined with low to high levels of ego orientation.

The relaxation process was examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and electrical resistmetry. Then, the resistivity of bulk glass was exactly estimated from the resistance and the geometry of the sample. Although the DSC absorption peak appeared just after glass transition became larger with the progress of the relaxation. the growth was terminated after annealing for 6 x 10(3) s at 566 K or 6 x 10(2) s at 573 K, meaning that the free volume content reached a constant value and a fully relaxed state was attained. The corresponding change was also seen in the room temperature residual resistivity rho(300) during relaxing at 566 K. Then, the rho(300) increased with time for initial 6 x 10(3) s and was constant during further 6 x 10(4) s.

J	Zhang, JS; Hirose, K				Zhang, JS; Hirose, K			Tone nucleus modeling for Chinese lexical tone recognition	SPEECH COMMUNICATION			English	Article						tone recognition; underlying-target; articulatory transition; tone-nucleus	CONTINUOUS MANDARINE SPEECH; LARGE VOCABULARY; INFORMATION; ALIGNMENT; LANGUAGE	This paper presents a new scheme to deal with variations in fundamental frequency (F0) contours for lexical tone recognition in continuous Chinese speech. We divide F0 contour of a syllable into tone nucleus and adjacent articulatory transitions. We only use acoustic features of the tone nucleus for tone recognition. Tone nucleus of a syllable is assumed to be the target F0 of the associated lexical tone, and usually conforms more likely to the standard tone pattern than the articulatory transitions. A tone nucleus can be detected from a syllable F0 contour by a two-step algorithm. First, the syllable F0 contour is segmented into several linear F0 loci that serve as candidates for the tone-nucleus using segmental K-means segmentation algorithm. Then, tone nucleus is chosen from a set of candidates by a predictor based on linear discriminant analysis. Speaker dependent tone recognition experiments using tonal HMMs showed our new approach achieved an improvement of up to 6% for tone recognition rate compared with a conventional one. This indicates not only that tone-nucleus keeps important discriminant information for the lexical tones, but also that our tone-nucleus based tone recognition algorithm works properly.

A typical statistical clustering method is the k-means method, but it often fails because of the lack of flexibility. An alternative fast and reliable method is therefore desirable. Results: This paper proposes a model-based clustering method using a normal mixture model and a well-conceived penalized likelihood. The proposed method can judge unclear genotypings to be re-examined and also work well even when the number of clusters is unknown. Some results are illustrated and then satisfactory genotypings are shown. Even when the conventional maximum likelihood method and the typical k-means clustering method failed, the proposed method succeeded.

Using spectra from a colorectal adenocarcinoma section, we show how IR images can be assembled by agglomerative hierarchical (AH) clustering (Ward's technique), fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering, and k-means (KM) clustering. We discuss practical problems of IR imaging on tissues such as the influence of spectral quality and data pretreatment on image quality. Furthermore, the applicability of cluster algorithms to the spatially resolved microspectroscopic data and the degree of correlation between distinct cluster images and histopathology are compared. The use of any of the clustering algorithms dramatically increased the information content of the IR images, as compared to univariate methods of IR imaging (functional group mapping). Among the cluster imaging methods, AH clustering (Ward's algorithm) proved to be the best method in terms of tissue structure differentiation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Method K-means cluster and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed based on a cross-sectional national representative sample of 3861 8th and 9th graders in Switzerland (mean age 15.3; SD = 0.88). Results Although RSODs in general appear to be more violent, social RSODs tend to be more violent than solitary RSODs. Although RSODs reveal a lower life solitary RSODs satisfaction generally and tend to have more depressive moods, are even less satisfied and more depressive. In addition, the latter tend to have lower self-esteem and are more often victims of bullying. Conclusions RSODs are not a homogeneous group of adolescents and preventive efforts, such as competence-enhancing and social resistance programmes, should be applied in accordance with the constellation of associated problems: solitary RSODs appear to be socially inhibited, depressive and often victims of bullying, whereas social RSODs appear to be socially accepted but are prone to be violent offenders.

We examined how 140 African American and Latino adolescents coped with neighborhood danger in low, medium, and high crime neighborhoods throughout Chicago. Participants reported using a range of coping strategies (measured via a modified version of the Ways of Coping Scale; R. S. Lazarus & S. Folkman, 1984). In low and medium crime rate areas, using confrontive strategies was significantly correlated with increased exposure to violence, and no strategies were associated with perceptions of safety. Coping strategies were associated with perceived safety to a substantial degree only in high crime neighborhoods, and none were associated with exposure to violence. A k means cluster analysis identified groups that differed in coping profiles and varied in rates of exposure to violence. Moderating effects of gender, ethnicity, and neighborhood were found for both person level and variable level analyses.

J	Amara, R; Marcos, S				Amara, R; Marcos, S			Improving parallel EKF-based nonlinear channel equalization using unscented transformation	ANNALES DES TELECOMMUNICATIONS-ANNALS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS			French	Article						equalization; non linear channel; Bayes method; non linear filtering; cluster analysis; Kalman filtering	DIGITAL-COMMUNICATIONS CHANNEL; RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS; FILTERS	The paper presents anew review of parallel Kalman filtering for nonlinear channel equalization. A Network of Extended Kalman Filters (NEKF) has already been suggested for this purpose. This equalizer gives recursively a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation of a sequence of transmitted symbols according to a state formulation of a digital communication scheme. It is essentially based on two mechanisms: the approximation of the non Gaussian a posteriori probability density function (pdf) of the symbol sequence by a Weighted Gaussian Sum (WGS); and the local linearization of the nonlinear channel function for each branch of the network. Since the linearization, bearing on scattered symbol states, is one of the major limitations of the NEKF, a new Kalman filtering approach, the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) suggested by Julier and Uhlman is considered in this paper for an interesting adaptation to the equalization context. The UKF algorithm is based on the equations of a Kalman filter, as the optimal linear minimum variance estimator, and on determining conditional expectations based on a kind of deterministic Monte-Carlo simulations. The new equalizer referred to as the Network of UKF (NUKF), thus combines density approximation by a WGS and the Unscented Transformation (UT) principle to circumvent the linearization brought within each EKF and is shown to perforin better than the NEKF based equalizer for severe nonlinear channels. Also, an adaptive version of the NUKF is developed using the k-means clustering algorithm for noise-free channel output identification, since the NUKF-based algorithm does not require the knowledge of the channel nonlinearity model.

This study identifies regions in the circumpolar Arctic that have experienced similar changes in the seasonal cycle of temperature and precipitation over recent decades. Data from Arctic and northern nations have been compiled to form a new data set of over 1200 circumpolar Arctic climate stations. Changes in the seasonal cycle between two decades (1976-85 and 1986-95) are examined for the 247 temperature and 555 precipitation stations that meet specific completeness criteria. Inter-decadal shifts are analyzed using 11-day averages of daily mean temperature and 5-day averages of total daily precipitation. Examined at time-steps finer than annual or monthly means, climatic variations in the region are not consistent either through the seasons or across space. Some areas have demonstrated recent increases in temperature or precipitation, while others have displayed decreases in these elements. Many areas reveal climatic shifts in specific periods of the year that contrast markedly with the trends observed in other periods and other places.

J	Qin, F				Qin, F			Restoration of single-channel currents using the segmental k-means method based on hidden Markov modeling	BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; PATCH-CLAMP DATA; MISSED EVENTS; ALGORITHM; RECORDINGS; PARAMETERS; KINETICS; JUMPS	Patch-clamp recording provides an unprecedented means for study of detailed kinetics of ion channels at the single molecule level. Analysis of the recordings often begins with idealization of noisy recordings into continuous dwell-time sequences. Success of an analysis is contingent on accuracy of the idealization. I present here a statistical procedure based on hidden Markov modeling and k-means segmentation. The approach assumes a Markov scheme involving discrete conformational transitions for the kinetics of the channel and a white background noise for contamination of the observations. The idealization is sought to maximize a posteriori probability of the state sequence corresponding to the samples. The approach constitutes two fundamental steps. First, given a model, the Viterbi algorithm is applied to determine the most likely state sequence. With the resultant idealization, the model parameters are then empirically refined. The transition probabilities are calculated from the state sequences, and the current amplitudes and noise variances are determined from the ensemble means and variances of those samples belonging to the same conductance classes. The two steps are iterated until the likelihood is maximized. In practice, the algorithm converges rapidly, taking only a few iterations. Because the noise is taken into explicit account, it allows for a low signal/noise ratio, and consequently a relatively high bandwidth. The approach is applicable to data containing subconductance levels or multiple channels and permits state-dependent noises. Examples are given to elucidate its performance and practical applicability.

However, k-MEANS has several disadvantages derived from its statistical simplicity. We propose an algorithm that remains very efficient, generally applicable, multidimensional but is more robust to noise and outliers. We achieve this by using medians rather than means as estimators for the centers of clusters. Comparison with k-MEANS, EXPECTATION MAXIMIZATION and GIBBS sampling demonstrates the advantages of our algorithm.

Furthermore, acoustic emission (AE) activity was monitored during the tensile testing. Tensile tests were performed for all three types of coated systems at four different temperatures (300, 500, 700 and 900 degreesC). The AE data were analysed by means of a standardized k-means algorithm with respect to nine parameters ( such as amplitude, number of counts, duration, rise time, energy, etc.). In conjunction with in situ video imaging of the specimen surface and postmortem microstructural analysis of the samples, the classification of AE data has provided a means for damage identification and performance assessment of the substrate-coating material systems.

J	Hengl, T; Walvoort, DJJ; Brown, A; Rossiter, DG				Hengl, T; Walvoort, DJJ; Brown, A; Rossiter, DG			A double continuous approach to visualization and analysis of categorical maps	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article							FUZZY; CLASSIFICATION	A method to visualize multiple membership maps, called 'Colour mixture' (CM) is described and compared with alternative techniques: defuzzification and Pixel mixture. Six landform parameters were used to derive the landform classes using supervised fuzzy k-means classification. The continuous categorical map is derived by GIS calculations with colours, where colour values are considered to represent the taxonomic space spanned by the attribute variables. Coordinates of the nine class centres (landform facets) were first transformed from multivariate to two-dimensional attribute space using factor analysis, and then projected on the Hue Saturation Intensity (HSI) colourwheel. The taxonomic value was coded with the Hue and confusion with Saturation. To improve visual impression, saturation was replaced with whiteness. Classes that were closer in attribute space were merged into similar generic colours. The CM technique limits the derived mixed-colour map to seven generic hues independently of the total number of classes, which provides a basis for automated generalization. The confusion index derived from the mixed-colour map was used to derive primary boundaries and to locate areas of higher taxonomic confusion.

Two series of compounds, one containing antibacterial and the other containing non-antibacterial compounds, were processed by a k-means cluster analysis in order to design training and predicting series. All clusters had a p-level < 0.005. Afterward, a linear classification function has been derived toward discrimination between antibacterial and non-antibacterial compounds. The model correctly classifies 94% of active and 86% of inactive compounds in the training series. More specifically, the model showed a global good classification of 91%, i.e., 263 cases out of 289. In predicting series, the model has shown overall predictabilities of 91 and 83% for active and inactive compounds, respectively. Thereby, the model has a global percentage of good classification of 89%. The TOPS-MODE approach, also, similarly compares with respect to one of the most useful models for antimicrobials selection reported to date.

Our objectives were to identify systematic multivariate patterns of perceptions using cluster analysis, and to investigate associations among the clusters, psychosocial characteristics and medication nonadherence. Methods: Demographic, clinical and psychosocial data on 200 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) were collected prior to the index office visit and health perceptions were collected afterwards. Cluster analysis using a k-means method was used to identify subgroups of patients based on their responses to the Patient-physician Discordance Scales (PPDS), an instrument that assesses perceptions of health status and of the clinical visit. Results: We identified five different patient groups: a "healthy, not distressed, good communication, low expectation for medication/testing" group; a "healthy, relatively distressed, good communication, high expectation for medication, low expectation for testing" group; a "symptomatic, distressed, good communication, high expectation for medication/testing" group; a "healthy, not distressed, good communication, high expectation for medication/testing" group; and a "relatively healthy, relatively distressed, poor communication, low expectation for medication/testing" group. After adjustment for age, sex, language, form of IBD, and disease activity, statistically significant between-clusters differences were found in psychological distress, social support satisfaction and medication nonadherence. Conclusions: Distinct patterns of patients' health perceptions correlated with psychological health and adherence to treatment. This categorization may be used to help identify patients at higher risks for ineffective communication and nonadherence to medication. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Kondrashov, D; Ide, K; Ghil, M				Kondrashov, D; Ide, K; Ghil, M			Weather regimes and preferred transition paths in a three-level quasigeostrophic model	JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES			English	Article							LOW-FREQUENCY VARIABILITY; NORTHERN-HEMISPHERE WINTER; DRIVEN OCEAN CIRCULATION; LOW-DIMENSIONAL PROBLEM; MULTIPLE FLOW REGIMES; SHALLOW-WATER MODELS; PERSISTENT ANOMALIES; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS	Multiple flow regimes are reexamined in a global, three-level, quasigeostrophic (QG3) model with realistic topography in spherical geometry. This QG3 model, using a T21 triangular truncation in the horizontal, has a fairly realistic climatology for Northern Hemisphere winter and exhibits multiple regimes that resemble those found in atmospheric observations. Four regimes are robust to changes in the classification method, k-means versus mixture modeling, and its parameters. These regimes correspond roughly to opposite phases of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), respectively. The Markov chain representation of regime transitions is refined here by finding the preferred transition paths in a three-dimensional (3D) subspace of the model's phase space. Preferred transitions occur from the positive phase of the NAO (NAO(+)) to that of the AO (AO(+)), from AO(+) to NAO(-), and from NAO(-) to NAO(+), but not directly between opposite phases of the AO. The angular probability density function (PDF) of the regime exits that correspond to these preferred transitions have one or, sometimes, two fairly sharp maxima. These angular PDF maxima are, in most cases, not aligned with the line segments between regime centroids in phase space and might point to heteroclinic or homoclinic connections between unstable equilibria in the model's phase space. Preferred transitions paths are also determined for a stochastically forced Lorenz system to help explain this striking feature of the QG3 model. The episodic description of the model's low-frequency variability via the Markov chain of multiple regimes is complemented by an oscillatory description. Multichannel singular-spectrum analysis is applied to the trajectory in the same 3D subspace. Two statistically significant oscillations are found and have periods of 19 and 37 days, respectively. Both oscillations have four composites that include NAO(+), AO(+), and NAO(-), in this order. The fourth composite occurs between AO(+) and NAO(-); it resembles the Pacific-North American pattern, which is not captured by the model's episodic description. The two oscillations have similar spatial patterns, and are weakly phased locked. They have certain features in common with the westward-propagating Branstator-Kushnir wave, as well as with the standing oscillation that arises from the oscillatory topographic instability of Ghil and associates.

To address this issue, a novel approach has been developed that combines MR diffusion imaging with multispectral (MS) analysis to quantify tumor tissue populations. K-means (KM) clustering of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), T-2, and proton density (M-o) was employed to estimate the volumes of viable tumor tissue, necrosis, and neighboring subcutaneous adipose tissue in a human colorectal tumor xenograft mouse model. In a second set of experiments, the temporal evolution of the MS tissue classes in response to therapeutic intervention Apo2L/TRAIL and CPT-11 was observed. The multiple parameters played complementary roles in identifying the various tissues. The ADC was the dominant parameter for identifying regions of necrosis, whereas T-2 identified two necrotic subpopulations, and M-o contributed to the differentiation of viable tumor from subcutaneous adipose tissue. MS viable tumor estimates (mean volume = 275 +/- 147 mm(3)) were highly correlated (r = 0.81, P < 0.01) with histological estimates (1117 +/- 51 mm). In the treatment study, MS viable tumor volume (at day 10) was 77 +/- 67 mm(3) for the Apo2L/TRAIL+CPT-11 group, and was significantly reduced relative to the control group (292 +/- 127 mm(3), p < 0.01). This method shows promise as a means of detecting an early therapeutic response in vivo. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

J	Rosenberg, D; Handler, A; Furner, S				Rosenberg, D; Handler, A; Furner, S			A new method for classifying patterns of prenatal care utilization using cluster analysis	MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH JOURNAL			English	Article						prenatal care; cluster analysis; methods; measurement	LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; UTILIZATION INDEX; ADEQUACY	Objectives: The objectives of this study were: to 1) define patterns of prenatal care utilization using cluster analysis, 2) describe two alternative cluster solutions and compare these groupings to the Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization Index (APNCU), 3) compare the cluster solutions and the APNCU with respect to maternal age and prematurity, and 4) discuss advantages and disadvantages of using cluster analysis to study prenatal care. Methods: The study sample included 3544 women in the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey for whom complete prenatal care visit data were available. Clustering was carried out in two stages, first employing nearest centroid sorting (the k means method), a nonhierarchical approach, and then using Ward's Minimum Variance Method, a hierarchical clustering technique. Results: Patterns of prenatal care defined by cluster analysis varied by timing of the first visit, total number of visits, and the rate of accumulation of visits, but this variation was different compared to that seen for the APNCU. While the cluster solutions and the APNCU identified a similar normative pattern of care, other patterns identified were quite different. In particular, the six-cluster solution differentiated among women who entered care at similar times, but accumulated visits at differing rates and experienced differing rates of preterm delivery. Conclusion: Cluster analysis is a new tool for studying prenatal care. Further studies are needed to refine the method and test whether the alternative perspective it provides will lead to new findings concerning the relationship of prenatal care and birth outcomes.

J	Roy, S; Chang, EC				Roy, S; Chang, EC			Watermarking with retrieval systems	MULTIMEDIA SYSTEMS			English	Article						multimedia retrieval systems; multimedia security; watermarking; nearest-neighbor search; k-mean	IMAGE RETRIEVAL; SEARCH-TREES; MULTIMEDIA; DATABASES	We are interested in the problem of associating messages with multimedia content for the purpose of identifying them. This problem can be addressed by a watermarking system that embeds the associated messages into the multimedia content (also called Work). A drawback of watermarking is that the content will be distorted during embedding. On the other hand, if we assume that the database is available, the problem can be addressed by a retrieval system. Although no undesirable distortion is introduced when a retrieval system is used, the overhead of searching in large databases is fundamentally difficult (also known as the dimensionality curse). In this paper we present a novel framework that strikes a trade-off between watermarking and retrieval systems. Our framework avoids the dimensionality curse by introducing small distortions (watermark) into the multimedia content. From another perspective, the framework improves the watermarking performance, marked by significant reduction in distortion, by introducing searching ability in the message detection stage. To prove the concept, we give an algorithm based on the proposed notion of "active clustering".

J	Pakhira, MK; Bandyopadhyay, S; Maulik, U				Pakhira, MK; Bandyopadhyay, S; Maulik, U			Validity index for crisp and fuzzy clusters	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						clustering; expectation maximization algorithm; fuzzy c-means algorithm; k-means algorithm; unsupervised classification; validity index		In this article, a cluster validity index and its fuzzification is described, which can provide a measure of goodness of clustering on different partitions of a data set. The maximum value of this index, called the PBM-index, across the hierarchy provides the best partitioning. The index is defined as a product of three factors, maximization of which ensures the formation of a small number of compact clusters with large separation between at least two clusters. We have used both the k-means and the expectation maximization algorithms as underlying crisp clustering techniques. For fuzzy clustering, we have utilized the well-known fuzzy c-means algorithm. Results demonstrating the superiority of the PBM-index in appropriately determining the number of clusters, as compared to three other well-known measures, the Davies-Bouldin index, Dunn's index and the Xie-Beni index, are provided for several artificial and real-life data sets.

The process of localization is carried out in two steps: deriving a smaller expectation window for each landmark using a trained neuro-fuzzy system (NFS) then applying a template-matching algorithm to pin point the exact location of the landmark. Four points are located on each image using edge detection. The four points are used to extract more features such as distances, shifts and rotation angles of the skull. Limited numbers of representative groups that will be used for training are selected based on k-means clustering. The most effective features are selected based on a Fisher discriminant for each feature set. Using fuzzy linguistics if-then rules, membership degree is assigned to each of the selected features and fed to the FNS. The FNS is trained, utilizing gradient descent, to learn the relation between the sizes, rotations and translations of landmarks and their locations. The data for training is obtained manually from one image from each cluster. Images whose features are located closer to the center of their cluster are used for extracting data for the training set. The expected locations on target images can then be predicted using the trained FNS. For each landmark a parametric template space is constructed from a set of templates extracted from several images based on the clarity of the landmark in that image. The template is matched to the search windows to find the exact location of the landmark. Decomposition of landmark shapes is used to desensitize the algorithm to size differences. The system is trained to locate 20 landmarks on a database of 565 images. Preliminary results show a recognition rate of more than 90%. (C) 2003 Pattern Recognition Society.

The performance of the method has been compared with those obtained through parametric algorithms, as K-means and deterministic annealing, and supervised multi-layer perceptron. While supervised neural networks need a training phase, performed by means of data tagged by the genetic test, and the parametric methods require a prior choice of the number of classes to find, the chaotic map clustering gives a natural evidence of the pathological class, without any training or supervision, thus providing a new efficient methodology for the recognition of patterns affected by the Huntington's disease.

We analyzed the gene expression profile in the mouse hippocampus during 24 h of reperfusion, after 20 min of transient forebrain ischemia, using a high-density oligonucleotide DNA array. Using statistical filtration (Welch's ANOVA and Welch's t-test), we identified 25 genes with a more than 3.0-fold higher or lower level of expression on average, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05, in at least one ischemia-reperfusion group than in the sham, group. Using unsupervised clustering methods (hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering algorithms), we identified four types of gene expression pattern that may be associated with the response of cell populations in the hippocampus to an ischemic insult in this mouse model. Functional classification of the 25 genes demonstrated alterations of expression of several kinds of biological pathways, regulating transcription (Bhlhb2, Jun, c-fos, Egr1, Egr2, Fosb, Junb, Ifrd1, Neurod6), the cell cycle (c-fos, Fosb, Jun, Junb, Dusp1), stress response (Dusp1, Dnajb1, Dnaja4), chaperone activity (Dnajb1, Dnaja4) and cell death (Ptgs2, Gadd45g, Tdag51), in the mouse hippocampus by 24 h of reperfusion. Using hierarchical clustering analysis, we also found that the same 25 genes clearly discriminated between the sham group and the ischemia-reperfusion groups. The alteration of expression of 25 genes identified in this study suggests the involvement of these genes in the transcriptional response of cell populations in the mouse hippocampus after transient forebrain ischemia.

MicroCore provides a flexible and extensible environment for the interpretation of functional genomics data through visualization. The first version of the application (downloadable from the MicroCore website: http://www.uci.ac.uk/oncology/MicroCore/microcore.htm), implements two programs - PIMs (protein interaction maps) and MicroExpress and is soon to be followed by an extended version which will also feature a fuzzy k-means clustering application and a Java-based R plug-in for microarray analysis. PIMs and MicroExpress provide a simple yet powerful way of graphically relating large quantities of expression data from multiple experiments to cellular pathways and biological processes in a statistically meaningful way.

The placement strategy minimizes the dynamic range of the channel, and thus reduces the peak transmit power needed by a wireless handset. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with that of an exhaustive search, as well as with that of a simplex algorithm. Simulation results show that the two-phase hybrid algorithm, although suboptimal, outperforms the simplex algorithm with only a modest increase in computation time. It has the added advantage of being quite insensitive to the seed solution.

Subjects: We studied patients hospitalized 30 to 364 days with refractory schizophrenia at 15 Veterans Affairs medical centers. Study Design. We conducted a randomized clinical trial comparing clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic, and haloperidol, a conventional antipsychotic. Methods: Health status instruments measuring disease-related symptoms and drug side effects were administered in face-to-face interviews at baseline, 6 weeks, and quarterly follow-up intervals for I year. Cost data were derived from Veterans Affairs records supplemented by interviews. K-means clustering was used to identify a small number of health states for each instrument. Markov modeling was used to estimate long-term outcomes. Results: Multivariate models with 7 and 6 states, respectively, were required to describe patterns of psychiatric symptoms and side effects (movement disorders). Clozapine increased the proportion of clients in states characterized by mild psychiatric symptoms and decreased the proportion with severe positive symptoms but showed no long-term benefit for negative symptoms. Clozapine dramatically increased the proportion of patients with no movement side effects and decreased incidences of mild akathisia. Effects on extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia were far less pronounced and slower to develop. Markov modeling confirms the consistency of these findings. Conclusions: Analyzing complex disease data using multivariate health state models allows a richer understanding of trial effects and projection of long-term outcomes. Although clozapine generates substantially fewer side effects than haloperidol, its impact on psychiatric aspects of schizophrenia is less robust and primarily involves positive symptoms.

Traditionally, this is achieved with arterial blood sampling. We propose a noninvasive alternative via the use of a blood vessel time-activity curve (TAC) extracted directly from dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) scans by cluster analysis. Five healthy subjects were injected with the 5HT(2A)-receptor ligand [F-18]-altanserin and blood samples were subsequently taken from the radial artery and cubital vein. Eight regions-of-interest (ROI) TACs were extracted from the PET data set. Hierarchical K-means cluster analysis was performed on the PET time series to extract a cerebral vasculature ROI The number of clusters was varied from K = 1 to 10 for the second of the two-stage method. Determination of the correct number of clusters was performed by the 'within-variance' measure and by 3D visual inspection of the homogeneity of the determined clusters. The cluster determined input curve was then used in Logan plot analysis and compared with the arterial and venous blood samples, and additionally with one of the currently used alternatives to arterial blood sampling the Simplified Reference Tissue Model (SRTM) and Logan analysis with cerebellar TAC as an input. There was a good agreement (P < 0.05) between the values of Distribution Volume (DV) obtained from the K-means-clustered input function and those from the arterial blood samples. This work acts as a proof-of-principle that the use of cluster analysis on a PET data set could obviate the requirement for arterial cannulation when determining the input function for kinetic modelling of ligand binding, and that this may be a superior approach as compared to the other noninvasive alternatives.

J	Bo, TH; Dysvik, J; Jonassen, I				Bo, TH; Dysvik, J; Jonassen, I			LSimpute: accurate estimation of missing values in microarray data with least squares methods	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							GENE-EXPRESSION; PATTERNS; CANCER	Microarray experiments generate data sets with information on the expression levels of thousands of genes in a set of biological samples. Unfortunately, such experiments often produce multiple missing expression values, normally due to various experimental problems. As many algorithms for gene expression analysis require a complete data matrix as input, the missing values have to be estimated in order to analyze the available data. Alternatively, genes and arrays can be removed until no missing values remain. However, for genes or arrays with only a small number of missing values, it is desirable to impute those values. For the subsequent analysis to be as informative as possible, it is essential that the estimates for the missing gene expression values are accurate. A small amount of badly estimated missing values in the data might be enough for clustering methods, such as hierachical clustering or K-means clustering, to produce misleading results. Thus, accurate methods for missing value estimation are needed. We present novel methods for estimation of missing values in microarray data sets that are based on the least squares principle, and that utilize correlations between both genes and arrays. For this set of methods, we use the common reference name LSimpute. We compare the estimation accuracy of our methods with the widely used KNNimpute on three complete data matrices from public data sets by randomly knocking out data (labeling as missing). From these tests, we conclude that our LSimpute methods produce estimates that consistently are more accurate than those obtained using KNNimpute. Additionally, we examine a more classic approach to missing value estimation based on expectation maximization (EM). We refer to our EM implementations as EMimpute, and the estimate errors using the EMimpute methods are compared with those our novel methods produce. The results indicate that on average, the estimates from our best performing LSimpute method are at least as accurate as those from the best EMimpute algorithm.

A multivariate statistical technique, known as k-means cluster analysis, is used to correlate and integrate information contained in velocity and attenuation tomograms. Cluster analysis allows us to identify objectively the major common trends in the tomographic data and thus to "reduce'' the information to a limited number of characteristic parameter combinations. The application of this procedure to two synthetic data sets indicates that it is a powerful tool for converting the complex relationships between the tomographically derived velocity and attenuation structures into a lithologically and hydrologically meaningful zonation of the probed region. In addition, these synthetic examples allow us to evaluate the reliability of further petrophysical parameter estimates. We find that although absolute values of the tomographically inferred petrophysical parameters often differ significantly from the actual parameters, the clustering approach enables us to reliably identify the major trends in the petrophysical properties. Finally, we have applied the approach to a cross-hole georadar data set collected in a well-studied alluvial aquifer. A comparison of the clustered tomographic section with well-log data demonstrates that our approach delineates the hydrostratigraphic zonation.

In the previous papers, we reported an unsupervised image segmentation method based on Bayesian classifier and applied it to object-to-object color transformation. Although Bayesian decision rule is a robust tool to classify the objects statistically with the minimum error in average, it needs to preset some appropriate class centers before starting the classifier. The location of initial seed points much influences the segmentation accuracy. This paper discusses a better way to set the initial seeds and reports the Bayesian discriminator works better when coupled with k-means classifier for correcting the location of seed points. In addition, the paper introduces a new application of proposed model into scene color interchanges between segmented objects.

In. this paper we introduce a k-means algorithm that is based on the data stream paradigm. The so-called partial/merge k-means algorithm is implemented as a set of data stream operators which are adaptable to available computing resources such as volatile memory and processing power The partial data stream operator consumes as much data as can befit into RAM, and performs a weighted k-means on the data subset. Subsequently, the weighted partial results are merged by a second data stream operator All operators can be cloned, and parallelized. In our analytical and experimental performance evaluation, we demonstrate that the partial/merge k-means can outperform a one-step algorithm by a large margin with regard to overall computation time and clustering quality with increasing data density per grid cell.

In this research, images containing either ice and water or multiple ice classes are segmented. This paper proposes to use the image intensity to discriminate ice from water and to use texture features to separate different ice types. In order to seamlessly combine spatial relationship information in an ice image with various image features, a novel Bayesian segmentation approach is developed. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to segment both types of sea ice images and achieves an improvement over the standard MRF (Markov random field) based method, the finite Gamma mixture model and the K-means clustering method.

A generic methodology for 3D point set analysis in which planar structures play an important role is defined. It consists mainly of a specific K-means algorithm which is able to process different shapes in cluster. At the same time, within geometric and topologic considerations, a set of application-driven heuristics is designed. This helps to find out the right number of structures in point sets in order to give a good visualization and representation of a large scale environment without a priori models. Our aim is to propose a simple and generic frame for 3D scene understanding. Tests were realised on different types of environment data: natural and man-made. This research project has been realized with EADS (French Air Space Society). Keywords: Fuzzy clustering, 3D reconstruction and scene analysis, range image segmentation, environment modeling, stereovision.

Clustering techniques, however, help bridge this apparent gap. In this paper, we analyze data collected from a deployed network and use clustering techniques to characterize patterns of individual users' behavior. A network traffic prediction approach is then developed based on user clusters. We analyze three months of continuous network log data from the E-Comm network, an operational trunked radio system. After extracting traffic data from the raw data logs, we identify user clusters by employing the AutoClass tool and the K-means algorithm. Based on the identified user clusters, we use the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model to forecast the network traffic by aggregating the predicted traffic of each user cluster. The predicted network traffic shows good agreement with the collected traffic data.

In order to analyze these population data a statistical classification technique known as cluster analysis (CA) is applied. The usefulness of CA in this case resides in solving the categorization problem with basic information that is often used in land planning and zonification of the urban space. With the objective of obtaining a classification of zones that reflects the interrelation of their variables, several clustering options are considered, with number of clusters going from 8 to 70, all of them created by the k-means procedure. Lastly, the results are presented along with maps.

Tissue classification is formulated as an estimation problem based on an imaging model. Prior models are used within the estimation problem to compensate for noise and intensity inhomogeneity artifacts. From this framework, approaches based on K-means clustering, clustering via the expectation-maximization algorithm, and fuzzy clustering can be derived. The performance of the different types of approaches are evaluated using both simulated and real neuroimaging data.

The model is based on the determination of the dominant paths between the transmitter and the receiver, diffraction at the coner and wave-guiding effect. The field strength is predicted with adaptive neuro - fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), trained with measurements. The advantage of the ANFIS with hybrid least squares and gradient descent algorithms is fast convergence compared with original neural network. The K-means algorithm for selection of training patterns is also used. Comparison of our predicted results to measurements indicate that improvements in accuracy over conventional empirical model are achieved.

The method firstly applies Gabor transforms with different scales and orientations to the image. Secondly conduct an unsupervised classification of the obtained Gabor features in the way of K-means. At last a set of features based on the classification information are extracted to present the content of the image. Compared with traditional method of Gabor filters, our approach introduces the correlation of the similar textures, omits the effect of unimportant pixels with sparse distribution. Experimental results approve that the novel method do achieve a promotion performance in remote sensing imagery retrieval.

The system comprises of two key modules: human detection and posture classification. In the module of human detection, human blobs are extracted by the technique of background subtraction. An adaptive background model is employed to characterize the dynamics and complexity of outdoor scenes based on the Mixture of Gaussians. In order to formulate the variations of human postures, Pseudo 2D Hidden Markov Models (P2DHMM) is employed for representing and recognizing human postures based on its '2-D elastic matching, property. It is trained to differentiate human postures and tolerate the variations of the same human posture using Embedded Viterbi and Segmental K means algorithms. In the classification of human postures, observation sequence is extracted from current image frame. The probabilities of observation sequence corresponding to each P2DHMM model are computed by Doubly Embedded Viterbi optimization, and human blob is classified as the human posture with the highest likelihood.

Its ability to simultaneously monitor expression changes of thousands of genes has acquired its popularity but, at the same time, posed many challenging statistical and computational problems. Gene clustering problem is one of them. The purpose of gene clustering is to search for groups of genes with similar expression patterns, which likely have related biological functions or interactions. In this paper, popular gene clustering methods, including hierarchical clustering, K-means, self-organizing maps, CLICK, model-based clustering and tight clustering, are introduced and compared with simulated data and. a real data. The result shows the superior ability of tight clustering to deal with complex structure of microarray data. All the other methods encounter difficult problems of either scattered genes, local optimization or estimation of number of clusters. Tight clustering, on the other hand, provides an alternative to avoid these difficulties and systematically produce a sequence of tight clusters.

In this paper, we present a new clustering algorithm from an information-theoretic point of view. First, we propose the minimum entropy (measured on a posteriori probabilities) criterion, which is the conditional entropy of clusters given the observations. Fano's inequality indicates that it could be a good criterion for clustering. We generalize the criterion by replacing Shannon's entropy with Havrda-Charvat's structural a-entropy. Interestingly, the minimum entropy criterion based on structural a-entropy is equal to the probability error of the nearest neighbor method when alpha = 2. This is another evidence that the proposed criterion is good for clustering. With a nonparametric approach for estimating a posteriori probabilities, an efficient iterative algorithm is then established to minimize the entropy. The experimental results show that the clustering algorithm performs significantly better than k-means/medians, hierarrhical clustering, SOM, and EM in terms of adjusted Rand index. Particularly, our algorithm performs very well even when the correct number of clusters is unknown. In addition, most clustering algorithms produce poor partitions in presence of outliers while our method can correctly reveal the structure of data and effectively identify outliers simultaneously.

The system employs a hybrid radial basis function (HRBF) network in order to classify cancer data into several classes. The HRBF network is trained using the moving k-means clustering algorithm to position the network's centre and the Given least square (GLS) algorithm to estimate the network's weights. Two cancer data, i.e. cervical cancer and breast cancer, are used as case studies. For cervical cancer, the system classifies the data into three classes, i.e. normal, low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). The system produces 98.00% accuracy. While for breast cancer, the system classifies the data into benign and malignant data. The system produces 98.57% accuracy. The result illustrates the promising capabilities of the system for assisting cervical and breast cancer detection.

B	Naud, A			ieee	Naud, A			Visualization of high-dimensional data using an association of multidimensional scaling to clustering	2004 IEEE CONFERENCE ON CYBERNETICS AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Conference on Cybernetics and Intelligent Systems	DEC 01-03, 2004	Singapore, SINGAPORE	IEEE			COMPONENT ANALYSIS; NEURAL NETWORKS; PROJECTION	A common task in data mining is the visualization of multivariate objects on scatterplots, allowing human observers to perceive subtle inter-relations in the dataset such as outliers, groupings or other regularities. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is a well known Exploratory Data Analysis family of techniques that produce one display on which inter-object similarity relationships are preserved. The algorithm scales with the square of the number of visualized data, which limits its application to small datasets. In order to alleviate this limitation, we associate MDS with three different clustering models, namely the Learning Vector Quantization, the k-means and the dendrograins. We propose to perform dimensionality reduction on a reduced set of cluster centers, to which the data are added using a relative MDS mapping. Our experiments show that this approach allows to obtain displays of large datasets with fairly good visualization properties, when compared with the display obtained by a direct mapping of the whole dataset.

This paper presents our statistically robust method to segment and locate tone nuclei in continuous speech. The method includes: an iterative segmental K-means segmentation of the tonal F0 contours, which is further aided with T-Test based segment almalgamation. And a linear discriminant function based tone nucleus discriminator, whose features are selected by the sequential feature selection method. The developed system achieved 97.5% tone nuclei correct rate on a speaker dependent task. The tone recognizer based on the detected tone nuclei improved tone recognition rate by more than 6% than the baseline ones using the full tonal syllable features.

It manifests itself as a blurred patch within a textured region. Previously, we proposed a constrained texture synthesis post-processing algorithm [8] to regenerate the texture the blurred patch using surrounding texture of the same kind. However, a human operator must manually identify the blurred target, and a valid source region from its surroundings. In this work, we present an effort to automate this process. Specifically, we developed an efficient modified k-means algorithm method to segment and identify potentially blurred patches; and a content-based region selection method to choose the candidate source region. Preliminary experiment results indicate that our algorithm produces results consistent with that produced by a human operator.

In contrast, recently proposed K-Harmonic Means (KHM) algorithm is more robust to the randomness of the initialization. However, KHM works best when the dimensionality of the data (N) is small (usually less than 8). Because the dimensionality of features that are used for many clustering problems in image/video and speech processing is large, the benefits of KHM cannot be exploited. Based upon this observation, this paper proposes a novel method to employ KHM for high-dimensional data so as to realize initialization-independent clustering. The proposed method employs efficient spectral clustering techniques whereby the affinity matrix of the data is decomposed into its eigenvectors and k (total number of clusters) eigenvectors corresponding to the k largest eigenvalues are retained. That is, we represent N-D data by k-D transformed data when k < N and propose to employ KHM over this k-D transformed data. The assumption of k < N indeed encompasses a large number of significant video processing and computer vision problems where the use of KHM was not beneficial before. We demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed algorithm for face clustering in the domains where the number of persons (k) is not large, such as anchorperson grouping, video-based speaker clustering in videoconferencing, and identity-based tracking in small office environments.

A data-aided feedforward symbol timing recovery method is also developed, based on polynomial interpolation and maximum likelihood estimation theory. It can be implemented rapidly and efficiently; therefore, it is suitable for burst mode receivers. A performance criterion of this method has also been derived. We also give some numerical examples to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods.

The PBMEC uses a set of prototypes to represent each digit along with an L-v-norm of distances as the decoding scheme. Optimization of the system is based on the Minimum Classification Error (MCE) criterion. In this paper, we introduce a new clustering criterion adapted to the PBMEC structure that minimizes an L-v-norm-based distortion measure. The new clustering algorithm can generate a smaller number of prototypes than the standard k-means with no loss in accuracy. It is also shown that the PBMEC trained with the MCE can achieve over 42% improvement from the baseline k-means process and requires only 28Kb storage to match the performance of a 1.46MB-sized k-NN classifier.

In this paper, we investigate the content-based retrieval of MP3 songs based on the interface of query by singing. In our method, the MDCT spectral coefficients were directly used to represent the tonic characteristic of a short-term sound. This spectral profile is used for detailed matching between two audio segments. Perceptual features were also computed from MDCT coefficients for audio classification. Two pre-stages based on SVM and k-means classifications were used to remove incorrect (or noisy) segment candidates and speed up following matching process. On the other hand, the schemes of exponential key-scaling and time-warping techniques were developed to overcome key difference and tempo variation between different singers. Experiments show that the retrieving probability of our design can achieve up to 76% among the top 5 out of a total of 114 excerpts in the database.

In this paper, we focus on the methodology of extraction of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) from experimental data to describe the time fluctuations of received power in a mobile satellite service (MSS) context. The method developed in this paper is based on a MCMC (Monte Carlo Markov Chain) training phase associated with a k-means classification. Its complexity is reduced when compared to traditional MCMC method. Contrary to existing detection methods, nearly no prior are necessary and it enables an accurate estimation of the HMM parameters and the possibility to detect the evolution of the channel sequentially. Furthermore, a sequential method, based on estimated HMM parameters, is presented and enables to follow the on-line variation of the state sequence.

In this paper we propose an algorithm to cluster large-scale data sets without clustering all the data at a time. Data is randomly divided into almost equal size disjoint subsets. We then cluster each subset using the hard-k means or fuzzy k-means algorithm. The centroids of subsets form an ensemble. A centroid correspondence algorithm transitively solves the correspondence problem among the ensemble of centroids. The centroids are combined to form a global set of centroids. Experimental results show that most of the time the pattern of clusters generated by our algorithm is similar to the pattern of clusters generated by clustering all the data at a time. We have shown that the disputed examples between the clusters generated by our algorithm and clustering all the data at a time lay on the spatial border of clusters.

By tuning the bandwidth of MSA, video representation from the coarse level to the fine level can be achieved. This representation form provides a flexible scheme for content-based video analysis such as summarization, classification, and retrieval. Compared with the conventional k-means or fuzzy c-means algorithms, our method can adjust the resolution of representation in a more straight/forward way, and is more robust since it does not need to initialize the cluster centers.

This paper describes a new method applied to very large still image databases that combines two data mining techniques: clustering and association rules mining in order to better organize image collections and to improve the performance of queries. The objective of our work is to exploit association rules discovered by mining global MPEG-7 features data and to adapt the query processing. In our experiment, we use five MPEG-7 features to describe several thousands of still images. For each feature, we initially determine several clusters of images by using a K-mean algorithm. Then, we generate association rules between different clusters of features and exploit these rules to rewrite the query and to optimize the query-by-content processing.

This method employs a learning process for determining both the number and location of prototypes. The possible techniques used in this process for adjusting the location of prolotypes include the K-means (KM) algorithm and the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm [2]. When the prototype classification method is applied, the SVM method can be used to process top-rank candidates obtained in the prototype learning or matching process. We apply this hybrid method to the recognition of handwritten numerals and Chinese characters. Experiment results show that this hybrid method saves great amount of training and testing time when the number of character types is large, and achieves comparable accuracy rates to those achieved by using SVM solely. Our results also show that the proposed method performs better than the nearest neighbor (NN) classification method These outcomes suggest that the proposed method can serve as an effective solution for large-scale multiclass classification.

When the boundary between clusters is ill defined, which yields situations where the same data object belongs to more than one class, the notion of fuzzy clustering becomes relevant. In this course, each datum belongs to a given class with some membership grade, between 0 and 1. The most prominent fuzzy clustering algorithm is the fuzzy c-means introduced by Bezdek, a fuzzification of k-means or ISODATA algorithm. On the other hand, several research issites have been risen regarding both the objective function to be minimized and the optimization constraints, which help to identify proper cluster shape. This paper addresses the issue where the data objects consist of Gaussian distributions. The approach advocated in this case is to use a probabilistic distance structure based on BHATTACHARYYA distance in standard fuzzy c-means algorithm. This leads to a modified FCM, with a probabilistic distance structure. The performances of the proposed algorithm are evaluated through some academic examples and the superiority of the modified FCM was clearly laid bare.

Since the task of identifying the global optimization is NP-hard, the study of the initialization method towards a sub-optimization is of great value. This paper reviews the various cluster initialization methods in the literature by categorizing them into three major families, namely random sampling methods, distance optimization methods, and density estimation methods. In addition, using a set of quantitative measures, we assess their performance on a number of synthetic and real-life data sets. Our controlled benchmark identifies two distance optimization methods, namely SCS and KKZ, as complements of the K-Means learning characteristics towards a better cluster separation in the output solution.

This paper proposes a cluster-based learning methodology to reduce training time and the memory size for SVM. By using k-means based clustering technique, training data at boundary of each cluster were selected for SVM learning. We also applied this technique to text-independent speaker identification problems. Without deteriorating recognition performance, the training data and time can be reduced up to 75% and 87.5% respectively.

Here k-means neurons are used as substitude for the original data points. These neurons are online adaptable extending the standard k-means clustering algorithm. They are equipped with perceptive fields to identify if a presented data pattern fits within its area it is responsible for. In order to find clusters within the input data an extension of the epsilon-nearest neighbouring algorithm is used to find connected groups within the set of k-means neurons. Most of the information the clustering algorithm needs are taken directly from the input data. Thus only a small number of parameters have to be adjusted. The clustering abilities of the presented algorithm are shown using data sets from two different kind of applications.

First, it is shown that storage capacities for k = 1, 2 and 3 dimensional cases are 0.059N, 0.023((N)(2)) and 0.014 ((N)(3)) from the prediction using the transition properties, respectively, where N is the number of neurons and ((N)(k)) means the combination of k from N. And it is shown that higher order models are superior in the pattern selection ability to the conventional one. Further, it is shown that higher order differential correlation models have high robustness compared to the conventional correlation models.

In this paper, we compare the newly developed K-Means Hierarchical (KMH) clustering algorithm to the SOM. We also introduce a new initialization scheme for the K-means that improves codebook placement and, propose a novel visualization scheme that combines the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) in an arrangement that ensures reliability of the visualization unlike the SOM. A practical application of the algorithm is demonstrated on a challenging Bioinformatics problem.

The time series signals of the same source of fire in every repetition data are highly correlated and each source of fire has a unique pattern of time series data. Therefore, the error back propagation (BP) method can classify the tested smell with 99.6% of correct classification by using only a single training data from each source of fire. The results of the k-means algorithms can be achieved 98.3% of correct classification which also show the high ability of the EN to detect the early stage of fire from various sources accurately.

Among the many approaches available in the literature, the one proposed here combines a clustering genetic algorithm with K-means to automatically select the number and location of basis functions to be used in the RBF network. Preliminary simulation results suggest that the proposed hybrid algorithm can be successfully applied to classification problems, leading to parsimonious solutions, with competitive classification rates, when compared with other approaches from the RBF literature.

Many methods have been proposed to cluster video shots into scenes by using conventional k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering methods. However, "noise" shots analysis has not been fully investigated and incorporated in the clustering procedure. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian mixture model based clustering method incorporating noise analysis. The proposed method can identify noise shots and predict the scene types of new coming shots with satisfactory results.

Quantitative evaluation plays a crucial role in measuring the segmentation algorithm's performance. Due to the lack of "ground truth" available for evaluating segmentation of clinical images, automated segmentation results are usually compared with manual delineation of structures which is, however, subjective, and is difficult to perform. Alternatively, segmentation of co-registered anatomical images such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used as the ground truth to the PET segmentation. However, this is limited to PET studies which have corresponding MRI. In this study, we introduce a framework for the objective and quantitative evaluation of functional PET study segmentation without the need for manual delineation or registration to anatomical images of the patient. The segmentation results are anatomically standardized to a functional brain atlas, where the segmentation of the corresponding MRI reference atlas image is used as the ground truth. We illustrate our evaluation framework by comparing the performance of two pixel-classification techniques based on k-means and fuzzy c-means cluster analysis, applied to clinical dynamic human brain PET studies. The experimental results show that the proposed evaluation framework is able to provide objective measures for segmentation comparison and performance.

The algorithms are based on K-means clustering and hill-climbing, and each are scalable in the degree of decentralization. In the underwater formulation of the CTO problem, K-means is not sensitive to the degree of decentralization, while the hill-climber is sensitive. Unlike in previous work, K-means outperformed hill-climbing across all environmental parameters.

This information can be obtained through load characterization consisting of measurement and analysis of several load profiles aiming to find the typical profile that reflects consumer's behavior served by a certain utility or even the profiles of the consumers served by a specific substation. In this work, six techniques were used to perform clustering and classification of bus load profile in utilities substations: K-means, four variations of Self Organizing Maps and Fuzzy C-means. Many simulations with different parameters were used to improve clustering performance. Merit indexes of clustering performance (intra-cluster and inter-cluster) were used to compare these techniques. These indexes were not sufficient to guarantee satisfactory results but indicate reasonable performance. The combination of all techniques helps decision maker to understand results and increase the possibility to extract from data implicit information and potentially useful.

Our research is motivated by the strict regulation of the transmit power of UWB devices, as imposed by U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC). To comply with FCC power regulations and to maximize network capacity, we propose a heuristic clustering algorithm to form clusters that have the minimum total power emission subject to constraints on radio range and multiple access capacity. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than a random selection algorithm in terms of power emission under all circumstances. Furthermore, the performance of the SOC algorithm can approach that of the k-means algorithm when an appropriate upper limit on the number of nodes in a cluster is imposed.

We define a video scenelet as a short consecutive samples of frames of a video sequence. The approach makes use of a typical k-means clustering algorithm to group the scenelets. Based on the clustering result, hypothesis testing can be performed to identify the shot boundaries at each level with different cluster number. Combined with a cluster validity analysis to decide a suitable number of clusters, promising result can be obtained for shot boundary detection.

The current challenge is to create a behavioral system for the virtual agents so that they behave as realistic as possible. Such a system should provide the agents with the most typical features of human intelligence: perception, recognition, memory, learning, reasoning, etc. Among the large number of different techniques to solve this problem, those based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) seem to be especially suitable for this purpose. In this paper, we apply several Artificial Intelligence techniques (such as neural networks, expert systems, fuzzy logic, K-means) to create a sophisticated behavioral system that allows the agents to take intelligent decisions by themselves. The paper describes the behavioral system, its main components and how these AI techniques have been effectively incorporated into the system. In order to show the good performance of our approach, an illustrative example will also be carefully analyzed.

The number of their records are so huge that we have to seek how to classify them when we want to extract useful information from them. Many computer-intensive data analysis methods have been developed. Some of them, however, are not focused on execution for huge datasets. In short, they tend to waste much time. We have studied making typical data analysis methods in parallel and sought for parallel oriented data analysis, using PC cluster. It gives us enough computing power, but to utilize it, we have to solve the problem, "How can we adapt well-known statistical methods into PC cluster?" In this study, we focus on one of the well-known non-hierarchical clustering method k-means and report how to implement it into parallel environment properly. We have already reported k-means parallel execution in PVM environment, however, another PC cluster library MPI is more popular and suitable for k-means. Through numerical examples, we show its effectiveness and offer some viewpoints for parallel oriented statistical analysis.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether the postural control of normal subjects is influenced by a medium dose of alcohol. 51 young volunteers without known vestibular diseases examined four 40-seconds trials on a fixed surface. Trials were completed under two conditions: eyes closed / opened and before / 40 minutes after consumption of 32 grams of alcohol. The relatively complex time series of the measured center-of-pressure, (COP) were analyzed with several methods of spectral analysis, but no clear visible differences depending on the conditions were found, because of large interindividual differences. Estimated spectral power densities of these time series were used as neural network input data. We compare the performance of five types of different classification methods: Learning Vector Quantization, Support Vector Machines, Self-Organizing Maps, Growing Cell Structures and k-Means and show that the first two network types performed best. Validation investigations show that mean test errors of 4.2 +/- 2.2% are obtainable. Results suggest that changes in postural control under the influence of alcohol can be better quantified by autoregressive spectral estimation and by using band averaging over the whole frequency axes. Posturography analyzed by neural networks is a sensitive method for detection of small influences on the postural control system.

Another problem is that these systems give recommendations based on profiles match between only two users. The collaborative filtering techniques using data accumulated from users' mouse clicks contain inaccurately rated information. Therefore user preferences cannot be automatically regarded as accurate data, so users within the matrix in collaborative filtering system need to be optimized by using entropy. The proposed method is capable of optimizing collaborative users, in which users are grouped according to the vector space model and the K-means algorithm to solve the sparsity problem. To extract features of documents, the proposed method uses the association word mining method with essential word in content based filtering to solve the problem of disambiguation and the multidimensional problem. After grouping, the typical preference can be extracted by assigning typical user preferences in the form of weights. This method reduces the inaccuracy of recommendations based on preferences that unproven users rate. In addition, it saves the time for retrieving a similar user within a group. It thus enables dynamic recommendations.

Concepts (words) are represented as a vector whereby the dimensions are other words. As the words are represented as dimensional objects, clustering techniques can be applied to compute word clusters. Conventional clustering algorithms, e.g., the K-means method, however, normally produce crisp clusters, i.e., an object is assigned to only one cluster. This is sometimes not desirable. Therefore, a fuzzy membership function can be applied to the K-Means clustering, which models the degree of an object belonging to certain cluster. This paper introduces a fuzzy k-means clustering algorithm and how it is used to word clustering on the high dimensional semantic space constructed by a cognitively motivated semantic space model, namely Hyperspace Analogue to Language. A case study demonstrates the method is promising.

In contrast to previous works, this paper focuses on two practical issues of the system dependency problem on different input query patterns (or portions) and input query lengths which causes serious uncertainty of the system performance. In order to solve these problems, a new approach called multi-feature clustering (MFC) based on k-means clustering is proposed. To verify the performance of the proposed method, several excerpts with variable duration were extracted from every other position in a queried music file. Effectiveness of the system with MFC and without MFC is compared in terms of the classification and retrieval accuracy. It is demonstrated that the use of MFC significantly improves the system stability of musical genre classification and retrieval performance with higher accuracy rate.

The algorithm works by lever-aging off the multi-resolution property of wavelets. The dilemma of choosing the initial centers is mitigated by initializing the centers at each approximation level, using the final centers returned by the coarser representations. In addition to casting the clustering algorithms as anytime algorithms, this approach has two other very desirable properties. By working at lower dimensionalities we can efficiently avoid local minima. Therefore, the quality of the clustering is usually better than the batch algorithm. In addition, even if the algorithm is run to completion, our approach is much faster than its batch counterpart. We explain, and empirically demonstrate these surprising and desirable properties with comprehensive experiments on several publicly available real data sets. We further demonstrate that our approach can be generalized to a framework of much broader range of algorithms or data mining problems.

Clustering algorithms in general need the number of clusters as a priori, and this is mostly hard to estimate, even by domain experts. In this paper, we use Niched Pareto k-means Genetic Algorithm (GA) for clustering m-RNA data. After running the multi-objective GA, we get the pareto-optimal front that gives alternatives for the optimal number of clusters as a solution set. We analyze the clustering results under two cluster validity techniques commonly cited in the literature, namely DB index and SD index. This gives an idea about ranking the optimal numbers of clusters for each validity index. We tested the proposed clustering approach by conducting experiments using three data sets, namely figure2data, cancer (NC160) and Leukaemia data. The obtained results are promising; they demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used statistical technique for dimension reduction. Here we prove that principal components are the continuous solutions to the discrete cluster membership indicators for K-means clustering, with a clear simplex cluster strcuture. Our results prove that PCA-based dimension reductions are particularlly effective for for K-means clustering. New lower bounds for K-means objective function are derived, which is the total variance minus the eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix.

This method first classifies the sound of the target and query videos into voices and background sounds and extracts feature vectors by focusing on the sound sources. The feature vectors are then clustered by K-means algorithm and the cluster ID, which we call sign, is assigned to the feature vectors in the corresponding cluster, consequently representing a video segment as a sign sequence. Finally, the video scenes are retrieved by sign sequences matching using Dynamic Programming. The experimental results show this method is potentially useful for scene retrieval.

In this paper, an alternative robust solution, based on the spatial median, is proposed and compared also to the k-medoids method (Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1990). Some simulation studies in the context of classification problems show that, when outlying data are present, the solution we propose improves the network performance and allows to define a more parsimonious network.

An overcomplete basis matrix is estimated by using the K-means method. We have proved that for the estimated overcomplete basis matrix, the sparse solution (coefficient matrix) with minimum l(1)-norm is unique with probability of one, which can be obtained using a linear programming algorithm. The comparisons of the l(1)-norm solution and the l(0)-norm solution are also presented, which can be used in recoverability analysis of blind source separation (BSS). Next, we apply the sparse rnatrix factorization approach to BSS in the overcomplete case. Generally, if the sources are not sufficiently sparse, we perform blind separation in the time-frequency domain after preprocessing the observed data using the wavelet packets transformation. Third, an EEG experimental data analysis example is presented to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed approach and demonstrate its performance. Two almost independent components obtained by the sparse representation method are selected for phase synchronization analysis, and their periods of significant phase synchronization are found which are related to tasks. Finally, concluding remarks review the approach and state areas that require further study.

In this paper we present an improved algorithm for learning k while clustering. The G-means algorithm is based on a statistical test for the hypothesis that a subset of data follows a Gaussian distribution. G-means runs k-means with increasing k in a hierarchical fashion until the test accepts the hypothesis that the data assigned to each k-means center are Gaussian. Two key advantages are that the hypothesis test does not limit the covariance of the data and does not compute a full covariance matrix. Additionally, G-means only requires one intuitive parameter, the standard statistical significance level a. We present results from experiments showing that the algorithm works well, and better than a recent method based on the BIC penalty for model complexity. In these experiments, we show that the BIC is ineffective as a scoring function, since it does not penalize strongly enough the model's complexity.

If we cluster the identities of data points to preserve information about their location, the set of optimal solutions is massively degenerate. But if we treat the equations that define the optimal solution as an iterative algorithm, then a set of "smooth" initial conditions selects solutions with the desired geometrical properties. In addition to conceptual unification, we argue that this approach can be more efficient and robust than classic algorithms.

The Cobweb algorithm is modified to produce a balanced tree with subclusters at the leaves, and then K-means is applied to the resulting subclusters. The resulting method, Scalable Cobweb, is then compared to a single pass K-means algorithm and standard K-means. The evaluation looks at error as measured by the sum of squared error and vulnerability to the order in which data points are processed.

In a nutshell, the K-Means clustering algorithm is applied in the complete dataset (without missing values) before the imputation process by nearest-neighbors takes place. Then, the achieved cluster centroids are employed as training instances for the nearest-neighbor method. The proposed method is more efficient than the traditional nearest-neighbor method, and simulations performed in three benchmark datasets also indicate that it provides suitable imputations, both in terms of prediction and classification tasks.

In previous papers, it was shown that the KFLANN was capable of fast and accurate assimilation of data [12]. However, it was still an unsolved issue to determine the suitable values for delta and mu in [12]. This paper continues to follows-up by introducing Genetic Algorithms as a possible solution for searching through the parameter space to effectively and efficiently extract suitable values to delta and mu. It is also able to determine significant factors that help achieve accurate clustering. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the hybrid GA-KFLANN ability using available test data.

A factor and cluster analysis of a patient sample	ALIMENTARY PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS; ROME-II; DISTINCT UPPER; QUESTIONNAIRE; PREVALENCE; MANAGEMENT; POPULATION; COMMUNITY; DISEASE; PAIN	Aim: To determine how clusters (groups) of patients with respect to symptoms compare with a clinical diagnosis in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and non-ulcer dyspepsia. Methods: All patients who attended a gastroenterology practice at Nepean Hospital were included in the study. All patients received the previously validated Bowel Disease Questionnaire, and were independently assessed by the gastroenterologist. Factor analysis and a k-means cluster analysis were completed. Results: The study population comprised 897 patients [320 males (36%) and 577 females (64%)]. Factor analysis identified nine symptom factors: (1) diarrhoea; (2) constipation; (3) dysmotility; (4) dyspepsia/reflux; (5) nausea/vomiting; (6) bowel; (7) meal-related pain; (8) weight loss; and (9) abdominal pain. A k-means cluster analysis identified seven distinct subject groups, which included an undifferentiated group: (1) diarrhoea; (2) meal-related pain; (3) abdominal pain; (4) faecal indicators; (5) nausea/vomiting/weight loss; and (6) constipation. The majority of irritable bowel syndrome patients fitted into two cluster groups [diarrhoea (25%) and constipation (20%)], whereas those with non-ulcer dyspepsia predominantly fitted into the undifferentiated cluster (34%) and the nausea/vomiting cluster (18%). Conclusion: This study supports the concept of symptom subgroups, including the subdivision of patients into diarrhoea- and constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.

Method: A cognitive-mapping approach was used to specify intervention performance objectives and a tailoring strategy. Results: MDS and hierarchical cluster analysis indicated that FV perceptions are organized into 6 clusters arrayed along 3 dimensions. In combination with 3 general family-functioning measures, 11 perceptions explained approximately 18% of the variance in parent FVI. K-means cluster analysis revealed 4 types of families. Conclusion: Cognitive mapping provides a systematic approach for including qualitative data in the design of tailored interventions.

J	Sokal, RR; Oden, NL; Rosenberg, MS; Thomson, BA				Sokal, RR; Oden, NL; Rosenberg, MS; Thomson, BA			A new protocol for evaluating putative causes for multiple variables in a spatial setting, illustrated by its application to European cancer rates	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN BIOLOGY			English	Article							SYNTHETIC MAPS; MANTEL TEST; AUTOCORRELATION; FREQUENCIES; REGRESSION; DISTANCES; GENETICS	We introduce a statistical protocol for analyzing spatially varying data, including putative explanatory variables. The procedures comprise preliminary spatial autocorrelation analysis (from an earlier study), path analysis, clustering of the resulting set of path diagrams, ordination of these diagrams, and confirmatory tests against extrinsic information. To illustrate the application of these methods, we present incidence and mortality rates of 31 organ- and sex-specific cancers in Europe; these rates vary markedly with geography and type of cancer. Additionally, we investigated three factors (ethnohistory, genetics, and geography) putatively affecting these rates. The five variables were correlated separately for the 31 cancers over European reporting stations. We analyzed the correlations by path analysis, k-means clustering, and nonmetric multidimensional scaling; coefficients of the 31 path diagrams modeling the correlations vary substantially. To simplify interpretation, we grouped the diagrams into five clusters, for which we describe the differential effects of the three putative causes on incidence and mortality. When scaled, the path coefficients intergrade without marked gaps between clusters. Ethnic differences make for differences in cancer rates, even when the populations tested are ancient and complex mixtures. Path analysis usefully decomposes a structural model involving effects and putative causes, and estimates the magnitude of the model's components. Smooth intergradation. of the path coefficients suggests the putative causes are the results of multiple forces. Despite this continuity of the path diagrams of the 31 cancers, clustering offers a useful segmentation of the continuum. Etiological and other extrinsic information on the cancers map significantly into the five clusters, demonstrating their epidemiological relevance. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The computational load is also reduced as compared to a single stage algorithm. The algorithm has two stages. At the first stage of the algorithm, the self-organizing map was used to obtain a large number of prototype clusters. At the second stage, these prototype clusters were further clustered with the K-means clustering algorithm to obtain the final clusters. A clustering validity checking method, Davies-Bouldin validity checking index, was used in the second stage of the algorithm to estimate the optimal number of clusters in the data set.

The idea is to combine a number of learning systems that have been trained in the same task. However, since all the members of the ensemble are operating at the same time, large amounts of memory and long execution times are needed, limiting its practical application. This paper presents a new method ( called local averaging) in the context of nearest neighbor (NN) classifiers that generates a classifier from the ensemble with the same complexity as the individual members. Once a collection of prototypes is generated from different learning sessions using a Kohonen's LVQ algorithm, a single set of prototypes is computed by applying a cluster algorithm ( such as K-means) to this collection. Local averaging can be viewed either as a technique to reduce the variance of the prototypes or as the result of averaging a series of particular bootstrap replicates. Experimental results using several classification problems confirm the utility of the method and show that local averaging can compute a single classifier that achieves a similar ( or even better) accuracy than ensembles generated with voting.

In general, GAs are believed to be effective on NP-complete global optimization problems and they can provide good sub-optimal solutions in reasonable time. Thus, we believe that a clustering technique with GA can provide a way of finding the relevant clusters. This paper applies GA-based K-means clustering to the real-world online shopping market segmentation case for personalized recommender systems. In this study, we compare the results of GA-based K-means to those of traditional K-means algorithm and self-organizing maps. The result shows that GA-based K-means clustering may improve segmentation performance in comparison to other typical clustering algorithms.

The effective use of modem software engineering principles, system environments, and development approaches is demonstrated. Straightforward yet powerful document characterization strategies are illustrated, helpful visualization for effective knowledge transfer is shown, and current user interface methodologies are applied. A specific success of note is the collaboration of disparately skilled specialists to deliver a flexible integrated prototype in a rapid manner that meets user acceptance and performance goals. The domain chosen for the demonstration is breast cancer, using a corpus of abstracts from publications obtained online from Medline. The terms in the abstracts are extracted by word stemming and a stop list, and are encoded in vectors. A TF-IDF technique is implemented to calculate similarity scores between a set of documents and a query. Polysemy and synonyms are explicitly addressed. Groups of related and useful documents are identified using interactive visual displays such as a spiral graph that represents of the overall similarity of documents. K-means clustering of the similarities among a document set is used to display a 3-D relationship map. User identities are established and updated by observing the patterns of terms used in their queries, and from login site locations. Explicit considerations of changing user category profiles, site stakeholders, information modeling, and networked technologies are pointed out.

The classical k-modes algorithm is a partial solution to such problems. This work presents a parallel implementation of the k-modes algorithm based on the message passing model. The proposed algorithm exploits the inherent data-parallelism in the k-means style algorithm. Tested with the amino acid data sets on a maximum of 8 nodes the algorithm has demonstrated a very good relative speedup and scaleup in the size of the data set.

Within vineyard variation in yield over several vintages	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF GRAPE AND WINE RESEARCH			English	Article						precision viticulture; zonal management; spatial variation; yield monitor	PRECISION AGRICULTURE; CROP MANAGEMENT	Spatial variability in winegrape yield was studied over several vintages in blocks planted to Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Ruby Cabernet in the Coonawarra, Clare Valley and Sunraysia regions of Australia using new yield monitoring technology, a differentially corrected global positioning system (CPS), a geographical information system and some simple methods of spatial analysis. In any given year, yield was highly variable and typically of the order of 10 fold (i.e. 2 to 20 t/ha). However, through the use of k-means clustering and a method based on assessment of the probability of achieving yield targets relative to the mean annual block yield, temporal stability in the patterns of yield variation was demonstrated, even though there were substantial year to year differences in mean annual yield in these blocks. The methods used to demonstrate temporal stability in the patterns of yield variation also promote identification of zones of characteristic performance within variable vineyard blocks. Of significance in this work was the finding that, whilst k-means clustering is the more statistically robust of the two methods used, the ability to incorporate expert knowledge into the yield target method enhances the ability of the manager to accommodate the effects of abnormal events (e.g. an unusually cold flowering period) in the zone identification process. Targeted harvesting of different zones, followed by comparison between commercial lots of wine, provided indication that wine characteristics vary from zone to zone. However, the ranking of wine scores for the various zones changed between seasons. Our results have important implications for the adoption of Precision Viticulture. In particular, they support the introduction of a system of zonal vineyard management. Thus, rather than being managed uniformly, individual blocks can be split into zones in which the management of both inputs to, and outputs from the production system can be applied differentially.

The fractal dimension could be used to quantify the texture information. Several methods including box-counting, fractal Brownian motion, and iterative function system etc. can be used to estimate fractal dimension. In this study, the differences of gray value of neighboring pixels are used to estimate the fractal dimension of an ultrasound image of breast lesion by, using the fractal Brownian motion. Further, a computer-aided diagnosis system based on the fractal analysis is proposed to classify the breast lesions into two classes benign and malignant. In order to improve the classification performances, the ultrasound image are pre-processed by using morphology operations and histogram equalization. Finally, k-means classification method is used to classify benign tumors from malignant ones. Experimental results will exhibit and evaluate the accuracy rate of the proposed method.

A huge body of time-course gene expression data has been and will continuously be produced by microarray experiments. Such gene expression data contains important information and has been proven useful in medical diagnosis, treatment, and drug design. The challenge now is how to analyze such data to obtain the inherent information. Cluster analysis has played an important role in analyzing time-course gene expression data. However, most clustering techniques do not take into consideration the inherent time dependence (dynamics) of time-course gene expression patterns. Accounting for the inherent dynamics of such data in cluster analysis should lead to higher quality clustering. This paper presents a model-based clustering method for time-course gene expression data. The presented method uses Markov chain models (MCMs) to account for the inherent dynamics of time-course gene expression patterns and assumes that expression patterns in the same cluster were generated by the same MCM. For the given number of clusters, the presented method computes cluster models using an EM algorithm and an assignment of genes to these models that maximizes their posterior probabilities. Further, this study employs the average adjusted Rand index (AARI) to evaluate the quality of clustering. The improved performance of the presented method is demonstrated by comparing to the k-means method on a publicly available dataset.

Although more reliable methods are available, hierarchical algorithms are still frequently employed. We clustered several data sets and quantitatively compared the performance of an agglomerative hierarchical approach using the average-linkage method with two partitioning procedures, k-means and fuzzy c-means. Investigation of the results revealed the superiority of the partitioning algorithms: the compactness of the clusters was markedly increased and the arrangement of the profiles into clusters more closely resembled biological categories. Therefore, we encourage analysts to critically scrutinize the results obtained by clustering.

Spectra were collected in transmission mode with high spatial resolution by the use of a HgCdTe focal plane array detector imaging system. While univariate imaging techniques such as chemical mapping often give unsatisfactory classification results, unsupervised multivariate data analysis techniques such as agglomerative hierarchical clustering, fuzzy C-means, or k-means clustering confirmed standard histopathological techniques and turned out to be helpful to identify and to discriminate tissues structures. The use of any of the clustering algorithms dramatically increased the information content of the IR images, as compared to chemical mapping. Among the cluster imaging methods, agglomerative hierarchical clustering (Ward's algorithm) turned out to be the best method in terms of tissue structure differentiation.

Instead of having fixed p(x) and p(m), this paper presents the use of fuzzy logic to adaptively tune p(x) and p(m) for optimization of power electronic circuits throughout the process. By applying the K-means algorithm, distribution of the population in the search space is clustered in each training generation. Inferences of p(x) and p(m) are performed by a fuzzy-based system that fuzzifies the relative sizes of the clusters containing the best and worst chromosomes. The proposed adaptation method is applied to optimize a buck regulator that requires satisfying some static and dynamic requirements. The optimized circuit component values, the regulator's performance, and the convergence rate in the training are favorably compared with the GA's using fixed p(x) and p(m).

The key is the optimisation of a Support Vector type functional. The representatives are constructed such that they sit at positions of high density in the set of spectra. At the same time they are constructed to be as orthogonal as possible. The representatives are expressible as a linear combination of data samples with positive coefficients. Therefore, they are positive and physically realisable. We show the differences of these representatives to representatives found with well-known methods like principal component analysis and k-means clustering.

Each ant in the algorithm is associated with a partition, which is modified by the principles of the heuristic; that is, by the random selection of an element, and the assignment of another element which is chosen according to a probability that depends on the pheromone trail (related to the overall criterion: the maximization of the between-classes variance), and a local criterion (the distance between objects). The pheromone trail is reinforced for those objects that belong to the same class. We present some preliminary results, compared to results of other techniques, such as simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, tabu search, and k-means. Our results are as good as the best of the above methods.	Univ Costa Rica, San Jose, Costa Rica	Trejos, J (reprint author), Univ Costa Rica, San Jose, Costa Rica.						Bock H.

However, there are still some special cases in which the GMDD algorithm is difficult to converge or can not gain a valid Gaussian component. In this article, a k-means method for Gaussian mixture density modeling and decomposition is studied. Then based on the GMDD algorithm and k-means method, a new algorithm, called k-GMDD algorithm is proposed. It solves the problems of GMDD caused by the symmetry excellent, and consequently makes the applications of GMDD algorithm more extensive.

However, the representations from unsupervised learning are not always optimal in discriminating capability. In this paper, a novel algorithm is introduced to conduct discriminant analysis in term of the embedded manifold structure. We propose a novel clustering algorithm, called Intra-Cluster Balanced K-Means (ICBKM), which ensures that there are balanced samples for the classes in a cluster; and the local discriminative features for all clusters are simultaneously calculated by following the global Fisher criterion. Compared to the traditional linear/kemel discriminant analysis algorithms, ours has the following characteristics: 1) it is approximately a locally linear yet globally nonlinear discriminant analyzer; 2) it can be considered a special Kemel-DA with geometry-adaptive-kernel, in contrast to traditional KDA whose kernel is independent to the samples; and 3) its computation and memory cost are reduced a great deal compared to traditional KDA, especially for the cases with large number of samples. It does not need to store the original samples for computing the low dimensional representation for new data. The evaluation on toy problem shows that it is effective in deriving discriminative representations for the problem with nonlinear classification hyperplane. When applied to the face recognition problem, it is shown that, compared with LDA and traditional KDA on YALE and PIE databases, the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms LDA and Mixture LDA, has better accuracy than Kemel-DA with Gaussian Kernel.

Four scale-invariant, distance transforrn-based features are presented for characterizing the spacing between adjacent vertebrae. K-means and self-organizing map clustering techniques are applied to estimate the degree of disc space narrowing using a four grade (0-3) scoring system, where 0 and 3 represent normal spacing and significant narrowing, respectively. For a data set of 294 vertebrae interfaces, experimental results yield average correct grade assignment of greater than 82.10% for each of the four grades using a one grade window around the correct grade.

The Fukuyama-Sugeno and Xie-Beni validity indices are widely considered to be the best and the Kwon index is good in certain situations. Our previous modification improved the Xie-Beni validity in certain cases but not in others. We test these and other validities on some 2-dimensional simple data first, so we can observe performance, and then we test them on the iris data. We do not put fuzzy values in the validity measures because they depend on the fuzzy algorithm and its parameters and can be misleading. We use our Gaussian fuzzy algorithm after an initial clustering by our enhanced k-means algorithm.

By simultaneously viewing the multiple-labeled specimens in different color channels, M-FISH imaging facilitates the detection of subtle chromosomal aberrations. This color karyotyping technique largely depends on the accurate pixel classification. We propose a Fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering based approach for this problem. The 24 classes of chromosomes form different cluster centers and a pixel is assigned to each individual cluster according to its nearest distance to the center. The FCM has the advantage of locating the clusters more accurately by assuming a membership degree from 0 to 1. The classification was tested on an M-FISH database, demonstrating improved accuracy over other approaches such as the k-Means based clustering. We also discuss image normalization issues such as background subtraction, multi-spectral channel image registration and dimension reduction, which can lead to improved accuracy of pixel classification.

By applying a clustering procedure, an analyst looks for a description about how data is structured in its dimension space. Then, the structure is explored in order to figure out interesting groups that can, eventually, be associated to classes. Since the late 90s, a significant effort has been undertaken to address the clustering approach for data mining. However, the contributions have focused mainly on algorithm optimization. An important aspect of the clustering process, namely, the use of prior knowledge to constrain the clusters definition, has rarely been contemplated. According to Hanson [1], "clustering of objects or events without a context, goal, or some information concerning the function of the derived clusters is not likely to be useful for real-world problems." Actually, clustering is neither a blind nor a strongly driven process. The most recent reference we could find related to the use of prior knowledge in clustering was Bejar et al. [2], who uses production rules based on expert experiments to constrain the process. In this paper we propose a meta-schema that takes into account the burden of prior knowledge, specifically the cohesion of variables in a domain theory, to constrain the way clusters are defined. The proposal is implemented through the introduction of specific changes to the K-Means algorithm, and the subsequent results are compared with the standard version of the same algorithm.

The visual resource is very useful in the knowledge discovery process once it enables an easier and faster understanding of the data distribution. This work deals with the development of a tool that supports data exploration through visualization, clustering and classification methods. The tool is called Starcluster and it was implemented using Microsoft Excel and the Visual Basic programming language. Starcluster allows users to visualize and to manipulate multidimensional data using the new technique Star Coordinates. Star Coordinates is a coordinate transformation that enables the plotting of multidimensional data in 2D space. Each variable is represented by an axis and a point represents each multidimensional data element. By changing the size and angle of the axes, it is possible to integrate and separate dimensions, analyze correlations of multiple dimensions, view clusters, trends and outliers in the distribution of data. Starcluster also provides a k-means clustering method and principal components analysis to complement the data understanding task. This paper presents the main features of Starcluster and an application example.

For the realization of a new service policy, this paper analyzes the level of contribution vis-a-vis the clients' service and profits through the cluster analysis of clients' data applying the K-Means Method. Clients were grouped into 4 clusters according to the contribution level in terms of profits. In addition, to evaluate the efficiency of CRFS within the Client/Server environment, the acceptance rate per class was determined. The results of the experiment showed that the application of CRFS led to the growth of the acceptance rate of clients belonging to the cluster as well as the significant increase in the profits of the company.

The method is based on the serialization of a k-means algorithm that is applied sequentially by using a sliding window over the image. During the window's displacement, the algorithm reuses information from the clusters computed in the previous window and automatically adjusts them in order to adapt the classifier to any new local variation of the colors. To improve the results, we propose to define several different clusters in the color feature space for each logical class. We also reintroduce the user into the initialization step to define the number of classes and the different samples for each class. This method has been tested successfully on ancient color manuscripts, video images and multiple natural and non-natural images having heavy defects and showing illumination variation and transparency. The proposed algorithm is generic enough to be applied on a large variety of images for different purposes such as color image segmentation as well as binarization.

We show how traditional clustering and classification methods, which usually operate on vector representations of data, can be extended to work with graph-based data. Specifically, we give graph-theoretic extensions of the k-Nearest Neighbors classification algorithm and the k-means clustering algorithm that process graphs, and show how the retention of structural information can lead to improved performance over the case of the vector model approach. We introduce several different types of web document representations that utilize graphs and compare their performance for clustering and classification.

Results are compared to those obtained using k-means, one-dimensional self-organising maps, and average-link agglomerative clustering. The impressive capacity of ant-based clustering to automatically identify the number of clusters in the data is additionally underlined by comparing its performance to that of the Gap statistic.

A magnitude property is defined according to research purposes, and data sets are clustered around each local maximum of the magnitude property. By properly defining a magnitude property, this method can overcome many difficulties in microarray data clustering such as reduced projection in similarities, noises, and arbitrary gene distribution. To critically evaluate the performance of this clustering method in comparison with other methods, we designed three model data sets with known cluster distributions and applied the LMC method as well as the hierarchic clustering method, the K-mean clustering method, and the self-organized map method to these model data sets. The results show that the LMC method produces the most accurate clustering results. As an example of application, we applied the method to cluster the leukemia samples reported in the microarray study of Golub et al. (1999).

J	Powell, M; Barrientos, A				Powell, M; Barrientos, A			Welfare regimes and the welfare mix	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL RESEARCH			English	Article							SOCIAL-POLICY; 3 WORLDS; STATE; DECOMMODIFICATION; WORKFARE	We present a different approach to appraising welfare regimes, stressing different dimensions, variables and techniques to those used by Esping-Andersen in his path-breaking work entitled The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism. First, instead of focusing on social rights, we construct an alternative path to identifying welfare regimes starting from the welfare mix. Second, we incorporate active labour market policies ( ALMP) as a key variable of the welfare mix. Third, we use hierarchical and k-means cluster analysis to identify welfare regimes in the data. Fourth, we compare regimes over time. Nevertheless, despite these different approaches, we conclude, like Esping-Andersen, that there are three clusters or worlds of welfare capitalism. We also find that the clustering of welfare regimes was sharper in the mid-1990s as compared to the mid-1980s, but that comparing welfare regimes in the 1980s with the 1990s indicates strong path-dependence. Faced with high and persistent levels of unemployment in the 1990s, OECD countries have adopted policies, including ALMP, which reinforce their welfare mix.

We present a method where local and global features are extracted. As a global feature, we extract the colour histogram. As local features, we extract prominent regions from the image using a k-means variant and a labeling algorithm. For each region, colour and spatial locations are extracted. Because these algorithms are computationally intensive, a hardware implementation is presented that accelerates the processing of the images. The proposed design is well suited for implementation on an FPGA. The device can be used as an add-on to a Personal Computer (PC).
