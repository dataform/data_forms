Given the assumption that the input is an eye window containing a single eye, the proposed method detects the iris by unsupervised K-means clustering on the feature spaces of compensated red and green color channels. The iris circle is then refined using the gradient information and circular Hough transform. For the sclera detection, the r-g and r-b are utilized as they show the discriminant feature of sclera regardless of light condition and iris color. The sclera is then extended to fit the eyelids by a region growing scheme. Experiments on a collection of eye images extracted from FERET facial database and our self-collected images show a promising performance toward the low illumination and iris color variety.

This paper first introduces an online Expectation Maximization algorithm which is developed from the basic batch edition to update the mixture models in real time. Then a spherical K-means clustering method is used to provide more accurate direction for the update of Gaussian Mixture Models after a deep study of RGB space features under illumination changes. Foreground detection is carried out using a statistical framework and RGB pixel intensity judgments. The results show the proposed algorithm outcompete several classic methods in efficiency, accuracy, and robustness to perturbations from illumination changes, on a sampling of problems.

Human Face Detection Using Color Spaces and Region Property Measures	11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL, AUTOMATION, ROBOTICS AND VISION (ICARCV 2010)			English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision (ICARCV 2010)	DEC 07-10, 2010	Singapore, SINGAPORE			Color space; HillClimbing segmentation; K-Means clustering; Fusion; Region property measure	SKIN-COLOR; IMAGES	Face detection is the first step in automated face recognition and the important cue to detect the human face is skin color. This proposed paper consists of two steps, the first step is to detect the more skinned region by the fusion of RGB, YCbCr skin color region and CIEL*a*b skin labeled image using HillClimbing segmentation with K-Means clustering. This step helps to simplify and improves the detection of human faces, since nonskin regions are eliminated. The second step is to locate the faces in a fused image by Region property measures. The proposed method has been tested on various real images and its performance is found to be quite satisfactory.

Introducing the concept of a vocabulary tree, an improved algorithm for large-scale image retrieval was realized. The vocabulary tree is a data structure based on visual words for indexing images. Each leaf node of the tree is from visual word computed by the K-means clustering algorithm. The query time of system dose not increase linearly as the database size grows. The method can improve the retrieval efficiency and meet two of the major requirements: adaptability and scalability.

SUPPORT VECTOR ONE-CLASS CLASSIFICATION FOR MULTIPLE-DISTRIBUTION DATA	18TH EUROPEAN SIGNAL PROCESSING CONFERENCE (EUSIPCO-2010)	European Signal Processing Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	18th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)	AUG 23-27, 2010	Aalborg, DENMARK	Aalborg Univ, European Assoc Signal, Speech, & Image Proc			MACHINES	One-class support vector algorithms such as One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) and Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) often perform poorly with multi-distributed data. Because in the one-class classification context, only the target class is well represented, the classification problem is ill-posed and the task is more a class description or a class density estimation problem. To deal with multi-distributed data, we propose in this paper the Multi-Cluster One-Class Support Vector Machine (MCOS) algorithm, which first clusters the data and then applies a one-class support vector algorithm on each cluster separately. A test sample is then classified by using the corresponding local description. K-means clustering and a dendogram based clustering methods are tested and classification results are presented for synthetic and real world data by using the MCOS. Experiments show that in many cases, MCOS outperforms the OCSVM algorithm.

Conventional learning-based super-resolution requires a huge size of dictionary for reliable performance, which brings about a tremendous memory cost as well as a burdensome matching computation. In order to overcome this problem, the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the size of the trained dictionary by properly clustering similar patches at the learning phase. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides superior visual quality to the conventional algorithms, while needing much less computational complexity.

This method is evaluated on an isolated digit database, TIDIGIT in three noisy environments (car, bottle and cafe noise types taken from the DRCD Sound Effects Library). Discrete Hidden Markov Models are used for the recognition and the observation vectors are quantized with the K-means algorithm using a Hamming distance. It is found that a recognition rate as high as 92% for clean speech is achievable using Ideal Binary Masks (IBM) where we assume prior target and noise information is available. We propose that using a Target Binary Mask (TBM), where only prior target information is needed, performs as good as using IBMs. We also propose a TBM estimation method based on target sound estimation using non-negative sparse coding (NNSC). The recognition results for TBMs with and without the estimation method for noisy conditions are evaluated and compared with those of using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC).

How to interpreter the given SAR images provides an import clue to study the characteristics of the imaged areas. However, the image interpretations for SAR images are difficult because of the effects of speckle signals shown in the images. In order to solve the problem, several algorithms have been proposed. The processed results show the proposed algorithms still have their own limits on reducing the effect of speckle signals. In this paper, the multilayer level set approach is employed to have the SAR images be grouped into several sub-regions such that the segmented regions are homogeneous. Based on this minimization of the energy, the multilayer level set method implicitly presents the regional boundaries as several nested level lines. By increasing iterations and preselected level values, these lines evolve close to the level boundaries based on the energy minimization. This method provides numerical stability and quick convergence. In order to implement the multilayer level set approach, several level values need to be established firstly. Those level values are determined with calculating the average values from the classified groups with applying K-means method. Based on the four-color theory, the multilayer level set method is able to generate an optimal piecewise continuous approximation for the SAR image such that each approximation sub-region is homogeneous. From the processed results, the multilayer level set approach can efficiently reduce the effect of the speckle signals, and quickly segment SAR images for further image interpretation.

In this paper, we focus on GIS-based scheduling applications using GPS tracking devices and spatial database for the actual vehicle routing problems. Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is the one of important problems in the research fields of transportation. Here, we use two spatial tools, "PhotoTrackr" and "ArcGIS", which record and analyze trajectories of vehicle and moving objects. Firstly, we compare the actual recorded routes and optimal routes, and discuss the characteristics of routes determined by the day-care center. Next, we consider the problem of "Multi-Agents Scheduling and Routing Problem with Time Windows and Visiting Activities". We present our algorithm of k-means clustering under the constraints of visiting sequence.

However, this is a very difficult problem, due to the "curse of dimensionality" and the inherently sparse data. Algorithm IMSND is one of the latest initialization methods that are based on the idea of sharing neighborhood density. Concerning the accuracy and the input parameters of IMSND, an optimized algorithm is presented, which employs a new density measure with distance weight coefficient to improve the search accuracy. Experimental results on real world datasets show that our algorithm outperforms other algorithms, including IMSND.

A set of experimental equipment for X-ray coherent scatter imaging was set up with X-ray digital flat detector and medical diagnostic X-ray source. According to this equipment, the scatter images obtained are made of some circles with the same center. It is vital to calculate the energy template to classify the different samples. It is difficult to separate them using the traditional threshold method due to noise and overlapped shadow. In this paper, the image was transformed a binary image by using K-Means algorithm and Mathematical Morphology Methods. The effective region was extracted from the binary image inside the orthogonal energy projection space, then to calculate the centroid of rings. Consequently the curve of the energy distribution was built. The experiment results show that our method is reasonable and feasible. The technique will have wide foreground of application.

The multimodal interface includes a biometric analysis module that analyzes and recognizes human biometric signal patterns. The biometric multimodal interface can recognize a user's emotion and concentration status by analyzing ECG(electrocardiogram) and EEG(electroencephalogram) patterns. The electroencephalogram analysis system utilizes 5 basic signal values to predict the concentration status of the user: MID_BETA, THETA, ALPHA, DELTA, and GAMMA signal. To recognize the user's electrocardiogram signal patterns, K-means-based EM algorithm was applied. In emotion recognition, the neural emotion showed the highest accuracy, and three emotions were in a range of 55.8 to 75.1% accuracy. Stress recognition showed a high performance result of 83.2% accuracy.

It will generate a lot of redundant data by using the GPS terminal to collect transit site data, due to differences in the location of the same name site and the existing GPS system deviation. Therefore an improved K-means clustering algorithm was proposed, which was applied into clustering analysis of transit data with the same site name but different location. Experimental results show that the algorithm is effective and clustering results accord with the actual situation.

We want to build a text classifier with only a set P of labeled positive documents from one class (called positive class) and a set U of a large number of unlabeled documents from both positive class and other diverse classes (called negative class). This kind of semi-supervised text classification is called positive and unlabeled learning (PU-Learning). Although there are some effective methods for PU-Learning, they do not perform very well when the labeled positive documents are very few. In this paper, we propose a refined method to do the PU-Learning with the known technique combining Rocchio and K-means algorithm. Considering the set P may be very small (<= 5%), not only we extract more reliable negative documents from U but also enlarge the size of P with extracting some most reliable positive documents from U. Our experimental results show that the refined method can perform better when the set P is very small.

To reduce the dependence on the initial center and to locate the types of new data rapidly, an algorithm applicable for text data is proposed. In this algorithm, document density is considered as parameter. Documents are divided into blocks first. After that every divided block is clustered separately. Experiment shows that this algorithm not only makes higher quality for clustering, but also does well in the new increasing data.

In this algorithm, we first use a Kolmogorov-Smirnov testing method to split multiple channel impulse responses into individual segments, each containing the observations of a wide-sense stationary channel. Then, the path estimates returned by the Space-Alternating Generalized Expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm are grouped into clusters by using a modified K-means iterative method based on multipath component distance (MCD). The dispersion dimensions considered for path grouping include delay, azimuth and elevation of arrival, as well as azimuth and elevation of departure. Different from the conventional clustering algorithms that rely on heuristic settings for weighting the MCD in dispersion dimensions, we cluster the paths in a specific sequence to different dimensions, which is predefined to reflect the priorities of the dimensions for the usage of the CDL models. The performance of the proposed clustering algorithm is compared with the conventional clustering algorithm by using measurement data in three indoor scenarios.

In regard to these problems, a new clustering method was discussed along with two parameters introduced assessing clustering effect. The new approach addressed these problems by adopting different methods. It deleted dimension traps by using learning rate for autonomous learning. The application of Distance Seeking based on Consistency and DB Index identified initially its center and the number of clustering units. Average of DB Index and DB quadratic mean deviation of DB Index assessed clustering effect. The findings tested the typical UCI Machine Learning Data Set and Data Set of high-dimensional industrial authenticity. The findings prove the efficiency of the new approach in a broad scale.

During validation tests for this procedure, it was found that 60% of the measurements had errors by factors inherent to the clinical setting, indicating that some kind of automatic error detection should be incorporated to potentially avoid the loss of measurements. This paper presents an algorithm developed to detect errors due to bad connection, bad location or bad contact of the electrode probe. A labeled database with 20,908 sets of 92 spectral measurements each, obtained from critically ill patients was used as training/testing data. To reduce the dimensionality, the database was resized by dividing the spectral range into four bands, and then by computing mean and standard deviation in magnitude, phase, resistance and reactance for each band and measurement. Initial exploration into the data space was performed by k-means clustering, establishing the number of classes. Sequential Forward Selection was performed to determine best features from the reduced data set. Finally, Support Vector Machine classifiers were designed in a one-vs-rest hierarchical scheme to classify the quality of the spectra. Each classifier gave a hit rate greater than 95% and an area under the relative operating characteristic curve of 0.99. In a validation run with cardiac surgery and intensive care unit patient spectra, the error rates were 2.3% and 8.4% respectively.

Automatic Tip Selection for Microtubule Dynamics Quantification	2010 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	32nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC 10)	AUG 30-SEP 04, 2010	Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)				Microtubule (MT) dynamics quantification includes modeling of elongation, rapid shortening, and pauses. It indicates the effect of the cancer treatment drug paclitaxel because the drug causes MTs to bundle, which will in turn inhibit successful mitosis of cancerous cells. Thus, automatic MT dynamics analysis has been researched intensely because it allows for faster evaluation of potential cancer treatments and better understanding of drug effects on a cell. However, most current literatures still use manual initialization. In this work, we propose an automatic initialization algorithm that selects isolated and active tips for tracking. We use a Gaussian match filter to enhance the MT structures, and a novel technique called Pixel Nucleus Analysis (PNA) for isolated MT tip detection. To find dynamic tips, we applied a masked FFT in the temporal domain followed by K-means clustering. To evaluate the selected tips, we used a low level tip linking algorithm, and show the results of applying the algorithm to a model image and five MCF-7 breast cancer cell line images captured using fluorescent confocal microscopy. Finally, we compare tip selection criteria with existing automatic selection algorithms. We conclude that the proposed analysis is an effective technique based on three criteria which include outer region selection, separation, and MT dynamics.

The respiratory sound signals were recorded simultaneously with Polysomnography (PSG) data during sleep from 20 patients (10 simple snorers and 10 OSA patients). The sound signals were recorded by two tracheal and ambient microphones. The potential snoring episodes were identified using Vertical Box (V-Box) algorithm. The normalized 500Hz sub-band energy features of each episode were calculated. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to a 10-dimensional feature space to reduce it to a new 2-dimensional feature space. An unsupervised K-means clustering algorithm was then deployed to label the sound episodes as either snore or no-snore class. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated using manual annotation of the sound signals. The overall accuracy of the system was found to be 98.2% for the tracheal recordings and 95.5% for the sounds recorded by the ambient microphone.

Standard approaches such as level set segmentation and active contours work well for fluorescent images where cells appear as round shape, but become less effective when optical artifacts such as halo exist in bright-field images. In this paper, we present a robust segmentation method which combines the spectral and k-means clustering techniques to locate cells in bright-field images. This approach models an image as a matrix graph and segment different regions of the image by computing the appropriate eigenvectors of the matrix graph and using the k-means algorithm. We illustrate the effectiveness of the method by segmentation results of C2C12 (muscle) cells in bright-field images.

Inter-Greedy technique for fusion of different carotid segmentation boundaries leading to high-performance IMT measurement	2010 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	32nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC 10)	AUG 30-SEP 04, 2010	Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)			ALGORITHM	User-based estimation of intima-media thickness (IMT) of carotid arteries leads to subjectivity in its decision support systems, while being used as a cardiovascular risk marker. During automated computer-based decision support, we had developed segmentation strategies that follow three main courses of our contributions: (a) signal processing approach combined with snakes and fuzzy K-means (CULEXsa), (b) integrated approach based on seed and line detection followed by probability based connectivity and classification (CALEXsa), and (c) morphological approach with watershed transform and fitting (WS). We have extended this fusion concept by taking merits of these multiple boundaries, so called, Inter-Greedy (IG) approach. Starting from the technique with the overall least system error (the snake-based one), we iteratively swapped the vertices of the lumen-intima/media-adventitia (LI/MA) profiles until we minimized its overall distance with respect to ground truth. The fusion boundary was the IG boundary. The mean error of Inter-Greedy technique (evaluated on 200 images) yielded 0.32 +/- 0.44 pixel (20.0 +/- 27.5 mu m) for the LI boundary (a 33.3% +/- 5.6% improvement over initial best performing technique) and 0.21 +/- 0.34 pixel (13.1 +/- 21.3 mu m) for MA boundary (a 32.3% +/- 6.7% improvement). IMT measurement error for Greedy method was 0.74 +/- 0.75 pixel (46.3 +/- 46.9 mu m), a 43.5% +/- 2.4% improvement.

These transformed putative spikes are averaged and this average is used as a matched filter to find portions of signals that are likely to contain a spike. A collection of vectors containing the correlation coefficients between putative spikes and the matched filters is then clustered using K-Means. Centroids of the resulting clusters contain enough information to sort spikes recorded by all tetrode channels simultaneously. On-line sorting is achieved by measuring euclidean distance between putative new spikes and the cluster centroids.	[De Benedetti, E.; Lew, S. E.; Zanutto, B.

In this model, epileptic activity is generated by delivering penicillin focally to the cortex. The drug induces interictal electroencephalographic (EEG) spikes which evolve in time and may later change to ictal discharges. This paper proposes a method for automatic classification of these interictal epileptic spikes using iterative K-means clustering. The method is shown to be able to detect different spike waveforms and describe their characteristic occurrence in time during penicillin-induced focal epilepsy. The study offers potential for future research by providing a method to objectively and quantitatively analyze the time sequence of interictal epileptic activity.

In the traditional k-means clustering method, the error of modeling multi-model is always ignored or even not considered in the clustering process. So, this unsupervised clustering method has large modeling error. In the new modeling method, the initial clusters are firstly obtained by the k-means clustering, then the data of clusters are reclassified considering the modeling errors of the multi-model, at last the new precise model parameters are obtained. The paper has given the analysis of the rationality of the method. In the end of the paper, the simulation results of the wastewater treatment process show that the supervised multi-model modeling method can improve the modeling precision and predictive performance.

Firstly, license plates are located by HSI color space and texture features. Secondly, it achieved the position of license plates more exactly with the K-means clustering. Furthermore, plate centroid was calculated by image threshold, morphology and connected component labeling algorithm. Because there is hardly distortion for plate centroid in the image sequence, which can be used for calculating the centroid trajectory between the first image frame and the following image frames, and characterizing the vehicle's movement pattern. In order to utilize the hard disk space which is used for saving the image sequence efficiently, improved track detection method was proposed. Through experiments, trajectories of vehicles can be reflected. And it provided the basis for follow-up study.

This algorithm extracts the robust and distinct feature difference between targets by means of MDS, and optimizes the feature distance by combining with kernel function. A modified K-means classifier is utilized to cluster the extracted features without knowing the prior information of class number. Experiment results on real sonar detecting data indicate that the classifying probability increases by 13.4% compared with PCA, and the probability and robustness of underwater target classification are improved effectively.

In the single frame method, the US is segmented by k-means fuzzy clustering algorithm. Then a series points are extracted based on geometric features. Thirdly, the feature points are selected according to our new cluster method. Then curve fitting is applied by feature points. Finally CCA is recognized in US imaging. According to the experiment on 7402 frames of 104 US videos from different persons, 95.66% accuracy rate is achieved. Based on multi-frame algorithm, it integrates the first algorithm for present frame and a buffer strategy for previous frame information. 98.97% accuracy rate is higher than the single frame method. Our novel technique outperforms the current technique proposed in other papers. The recognition CCA is totally automatic in our database by our proposed methods. Those proposed automatic methods are suitable for real-time recognition of the CCA.

Nevertheless, while this concept has been investigated and deployed in a number of forms, enabling it from the parallel I/O software stack has been largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose and evaluate an active storage system that allows data analysis, mining, and statistical operations to be executed from within a parallel I/O interface. In our proposed scheme, common analysis kernels are embedded in parallel file systems. We expose the semantics of these kernels to parallel file systems through an enhanced runtime interface so that execution of embedded kernels is possible on the server. In order to allow complete server-side operations without file format or layout manipulation, our scheme adjusts the file I/O buffer to the computational unit boundary on the fly. Our scheme also uses server-side collective communication primitives for reduction and aggregation using interserver communication. We have implemented a prototype of our active storage system and demonstrate its benefits using four data analysis benchmarks. Our experimental results show that our proposed system improves the overall performance of all four benchmarks by 50.9% on average and that the compute-intensive portion of the k-means clustering kernel can be improved by 58.4% through GPU offloading when executed with a larger computational load. We also show that our scheme consistently outperforms the traditional storage model with a wide variety of input dataset sizes, number of nodes, and computational loads.

Clustering has taken its roots from algorithms like k-means and k-medoids. However conventional k-medoids clustering algorithm suffers from many limitations. Firstly, it needs to have prior knowledge about the number of cluster parameter k. Secondly, it also initially needs to make random selection of k representative objects and if these initial k medoids are not selected properly then natural cluster may not be obtained. Thirdly, it is also sensitive to the order of input dataset. First limitation was removed by using cluster validity index. Aiming at the second and third limitations of conventional k-medoids, we have proposed an improved k-medoids algorithm. In this work instead of random selection of initial k objects as medoids we have proposed a new technique for the initial representative object selection. The approach is based on density of objects. We find out set of objects which are densely populated and choose medoids from each of this obtained set. These k data objects selected as initial medoids are further used in clustering process. The validity of the proposed algorithm has been proved using iris and diet structure dataset to find the natural clusters in this datasets.

These results generally make heavy use of the generative model and particular properties of the distributions. In this paper, we show that a simple clustering algorithm works without assuming any generative (probabilistic) model. Our only assumption is what we call a "proximity condition": the projection of any data point onto the line joining its cluster center to any other cluster center is Omega(k) standard deviations closer to its own center than the other center. Here the notion of standard deviations is based on the spectral norm of the matrix whose rows represent the difference between a point and the mean of the cluster to which it belongs. We show that in the generative models studied, our proximity condition is satisfied and so we are able to derive most known results for generative models as corollaries of our main result. We also prove some new results for generative models - e.g., we can cluster all but a small fraction of points only assuming a bound on the variance. Our algorithm relies on the well known k-means algorithm, and along the way, we prove a result of independent interest - that the k-means algorithm converges to the "true centers" even in the presence of spurious points provided the initial (estimated) centers are close enough to the corresponding actual centers and all but a small fraction of the points satisfy the proximity condition. Finally, we present a new technique for boosting the ratio of inter-center separation to standard deviation. This allows us to prove results for learning certain mixture of distributions under weaker separation conditions.

For the k-means problem, Ostrovsky et al. [18] show that if the optimal (k - 1)-means clustering of the input is more expensive than the optimal k-means clustering by a factor of 1/epsilon(2), then one can achieve a (1 + f(epsilon))-approximation to the k-means optimal in time polynomial in n and k by using a variant of Lloyd's algorithm. In this work we substantially improve this approximation guarantee. We show that given only the condition that the (k - 1)-means optimal is more expensive than the k-means optimal by a factor 1 + alpha for some constant alpha > 0, we can obtain a PTAS. In particular, under this assumption, for any epsilon > 0 we achieve a (1 + epsilon)-approximation to the k-means optimal in time polynomial in n and k, and exponential in 1/epsilon and 1/alpha. We thus decouple the strength of the assumption from the quality of the approximation ratio. We also give a PTAS for the k-median problem in finite metrics under the analogous assumption as well. For k-means, we in addition give a randomized algorithm with improved running time of n(O(1))(k log n)(poly(1/epsilon,) (1/alpha)). Our technique also obtains a PTAS under the assumption of Balcan et al. [4] that all (1 + alpha) approximations are delta-close to a desired target clustering, in the case that all target clusters have size greater than delta n and alpha > 0 is constant. Note that the motivation of Balcan et al. [4] is that for many clustering problems, the objective function is only a proxy for the true goal of getting close to the target. From this perspective, our improvement is that for k-means in Euclidean spaces we reduce the distance of the clustering found to the target from O(delta) to delta when all target clusters are large, and for k-median we improve the "largeness" condition needed in [4] to get exactly delta-close from O(delta n) to delta n. Our results are based on a new notion of clustering stability.

The secondary users are only allowed to use a licensed spectrum in the absence of its rightful owner. Thus, the ability to accurately sense the presence of the rightful owners is highly essential. In this paper, a novel cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) approach to efficiently sense a wideband spectrum is introduced. This paper addresses two specific issues in CSS. The first issue is on dynamic detection of primary user's bands. A dynamic band clustering (DBC) algorithm that uses K-means clustering technique is proposed in this paper. The proposed algorithm reduces the number of erroneous narrow sub-bands resulting from spurious noise. This in turn minimizes the number of sub-bands to be detected and hence the overall sensing time. The second issue is on combining the local decisions made by different secondary users. A novel dynamic weighting decision fusion algorithm is also proposed in this paper. Based on extensive simulation studies, the proposed fusion algorithm is shown to be superior to conventional decision fusion techniques.	[Nguyen Duy Duong; Madhukumar, A.

An average minimum access distance criterion is given for RRU location optimization. By minimizing the average distance between users and RRU, the optimal RRU distribution can be obtained when users are located uniformly in the cell. Taking into account the fact that user distribution will not be completely uniform in a practical environment, the k-means clustering algorithm is used to get the optimized RRU deployment in a practical user distribution. Simulation results show that the uplink transmission power can be greatly reduced with the RRU optimized location design in both the uniform and non-uniform user distribution.

We introduce the Integral Linear Classifier (ILC), that can readily obtain the classification score for any image sub-window with only 6 additions and 1 product by fusing the accumulation and classification steps in a single operation. In order to design a method as efficient as possible, our building blocks are carefully selected from the quickest in the state of the art. More precisely, we evaluate the performance of three popular local descriptors, that can be very efficiently computed using integral images, and two fast quantization methods: the Hierarchical K-Means, and the Extremely Randomized Forest. Finally, we explore the utility of adding spatial bins to the Bag of Features histograms and that of cascade classifiers to improve the obtained segmentation. Our method is compared to the state of the art in the difficult Graz-02 and PASCAL 2007 Segmentation Challenge datasets.

Related methods involving learning of patterns of activity rely on trajectories obtained from object detection and tracking systems, which are unreliable in complex scenes of crowded motion. We propose a mixture model representation of salient patterns of optical flow, and present an algorithm for learning these patterns from dense optical flow in a hierarchical, unsupervised fashion. Using low level cues of noisy optical flow, K-means is employed to initialize a Gaussian mixture model for temporally segmented clips of video. The components of this mixture are then filtered and instances of motion patterns are computed using a simple motion model, by linking components across space and time. Motion patterns are then initialized and membership of instances in different motion patterns is established by using KL divergence between mixture distributions of pattern instances. Finally, a pixel level representation of motion patterns is proposed by deriving conditional expectation of optical flow. Results of extensive experiments are presented for multiple surveillance sequences containing numerous patterns involving both pedestrian and vehicular traffic.

Most of previous approaches generate dictionaries by unsupervised clustering techniques, e.g. k-means. However, the features obtained by such kind of dictionaries may not be optimal for image classification. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model for supervised dictionary learning (SDLM) which seamlessly combines an unsupervised model (a Gaussian Mixture Model) and a supervised model (a logistic regression model) in a probabilistic frame-work. In the model, image category information directly affects the generation of a dictionary. A dictionary obtained by this approach is a trade-off between minimization of distortions of clusters and maximization of discriminative power of image-wise representations, i.e. histogram representations of images. We further extend the model to incorporate spatial information during the dictionary learning process in a spatial pyramid matching like manner. We extensively evaluated the two models on various benchmark dataset and obtained promising results.

After the generation of these LMSs computed on one individual by tracking Histograms of Oriented Gradient (HOG) [2] descriptor, we learn a codebook of video-words (i.e. clusters of LMSs) using k-means algorithm on a learning gesture video database. Then the video-words are compacted to a codebook of code-words by the Maximization of Mutual Information (MMI) algorithm. At the final step, we compare the LMSs generated for a new gesture w.r.t. the learned codebook via the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm and a novel voting strategy. Our main contribution is the handling of the N to N mapping between code-words and gesture labels with the proposed voting strategy. Experiments have been carried out on two public gesture databases: KTH [16] and IXMAS [19]. Results show that the proposed method outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods.

Instead of searching for the set of centroid that best fit the data, as in k-means type of approaches that model the data as distributions around discrete points, we optimize for a set of dictionaries, one for each cluster, for which the signals are best reconstructed in a sparse coding manner. Thereby, we are modeling the data as a union of learned low dimensional subspaces, and data points associated to subspaces spanned by just a few atoms of the same learned dictionary are clustered together. An incoherence promoting term encourages dictionaries associated to different classes to be as independent as possible, while still allowing for different classes to share features. This term directly acts on the dictionaries, thereby being applicable both in the supervised and unsupervised settings. Using learned dictionaries for classification and clustering makes this method robust and well suited to handle large datasets. The proposed framework uses a novel measurement for the quality of the sparse representation, inspired by the robustness of the l(1) regularization term in sparse coding. In the case of unsupervised classification and/or clustering, a new initialization based on combining sparse coding with spectral clustering is proposed. This initialization clusters the dictionary atoms, and therefore is based on solving a low dimensional eigen-decomposition problem, being applicable to large datasets. We first illustrate the proposed framework with examples on standard image and speech datasets in the supervised classification setting, obtaining results comparable to the state-of-the-art with this simple approach. We then present experiments for fully unsupervised clustering on extended standard datasets and texture images, obtaining excellent performance.

It makes a robot to respond naturally to human user's call. In the ordinary situations, there always exist multiple sound sources including user's call. Since localized outputs from each source are mixed in distribution, clustering is an important issue in the multi-source sound localization. In this work, we propose a new k-means clustering algorithm for unknown number of clusters, which is the competitive k-means. We compared its performance to the adaptive k-means++ algorithm and verified its effectiveness. Finally, we applied it to our sound source localization for multi-source sound localization and achieved satisfying results.

In our project a new IS system (LAGUNTXO) which adds user affective information oriented to people with intellectual disabilities has been developed. The system integrates a Human Emotion Analysis System (HEAS) which attempts to solve critical situations for this community as block stages. In the development of the HEAS one of the critical issues was to create appropriated databases to train the system due to the difficulty to simulate pre-block stages in laboratory specifically in the case of people with disabilities. A film and real sequences based emotion elicitation database was created. The elicitation material was categorized with features based on discrete emotions and dimensional terms (pleasant, unpleasant). In this work we present the Automatic Evaluation of Emotion Elicitation databases based on Machine Learning classifiers and un-supervised K-means clustering which provides new approaches of emotional answers finally validated by the specialist.

The algorithm can use any cluster validity function as fitness function. Cluster validity is used as a criterion for cross-over operations. The cluster assignment for each point is accompanied by a temperature and points with low confidence are preferentially mutated. We present results applying this genetic algorithm to several UCI machine learning data sets and using several objective cluster validity functions for optimization. It is shown that given an appropriate criterion function, the algorithm is able to converge on good cluster partitions within few generations. Our main contributions are: 1. to present a genetic algorithm that is fast and able to converge on meaningful clusters for real-world data sets, 2. to define and compare several cluster validity criteria.

The algorithm defines the number of clusters automatically. The Memetic Algorithm provides a combined global and local strategy for a search in the solution space and the Niching methods to promote diversity in the population and prevent the population from converging too quickly (based on restricted competition replacement and restrictive mating). The Memetic Algorithm uses the K-means algorithm to find the optimum value in a local search space. Bayesian Information Criterion is used as a fitness function, while FP-Growth is used to reduce the high dimensionality in the vocabulary. This resulting algorithm, called WDC-NMA, was tested with data sets based on Reuters-21578 and DMOZ, obtaining promising results (better precision results than a Singular Value Decomposition algorithm). Also, it was also then initially evaluated by a group of users.

J	Feltell, D; Bai, L			IEEE	Feltell, David; Bai, Li			3D level set image segmentation refined by intelligent agent swarm.	2010 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION (CEC)	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation		English	Proceedings Paper	2010 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence	JUL 18-23, 2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Int Neural Network Soc, Evolut Program Soc, IET			ALGORITHMS; MODELS	The level set method of surface representation and deformation has found many applications in image processing, especially with regard to segmentation. Naive numerical solutions have long since given way to much more efficient narrow band methods, where updates to the scalar field are performed only within a number of layers either side of the surface. This paper presents our implementation of automated segmentation via the sparse field narrow band approach. We use k-means clustering of regularly sampled points to provide initialisation of seed locations and mean voxel values, removing the need for manual seed and parameter selection. We demonstrate this method by segmenting grey matter and white matter from a simulated T1 MRI scan. Anisotropy can easily cause this and other segmentation methods to misclassify voxels, however. Often it is clear in a 3D view of the resulting surface which regions require refinement. With available extensions to the sparse field and rendering algorithms we can now efficiently perform purely localised modifications and re-rendering of the surface. These extensions, plus properties inherent in the level set method, allow us to easily situate swarms of agents on the surface, intelligently inhabiting and modifying the zero-level set. By a simple weighting of movement direction, we can direct the swarm to any user-specified point on the surface in order to affect repairs and refinement.

J	Kattan, A; Poli, R			IEEE	Kattan, Ahmed; Poli, Riccardo			Evolutionary Synthesis of Lossless Compression Algorithms with GP-zip3	2010 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION (CEC)	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation		English	Proceedings Paper	2010 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence	JUL 18-23, 2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Int Neural Network Soc, Evolut Program Soc, IET				Here we propose GP-zip3, a system which uses Genetic Programming to find optimal ways to combine standard compression algorithms for the purpose of compressing files and archives. GP-zip3 evolves programs with multiple components. One component analyses statistical features extracted from the raw data to be compressed (seen as a sequence of 8-bit integers) to divide the data into blocks. These blocks are then projected onto a two-dimensional Euclidean space via two further (evolved) program components. K-means clustering is applied to group similar data blocks. Each cluster is then labelled with the optimal compression algorithm for its member blocks. Once a program that achieves good compression is evolved, it can be used on unseen data without the requirement for any further evolution. GP-zip3 is similar to its predecessor, GP-zip2. Both systems outperform a variety of standard compression algorithms and are faster than other evolutionary compression techniques. However, GP-zip2 was still substantially slower than off-the-shelf algorithms. GP-zip3 alleviates this problem by using a novel fitness evaluation strategy. More specifically, GP-zip3 evolves and then uses decision trees to predict the performance of GP individuals without requiring them to be used to compress the training data. As shown in a variety of experiments, this speeds up evolution in GP-zip3 considerably over GP-zip2 while achieving similar compression results, thereby significantly broadening the scope of application of the approach.

In QICW, antibody is proliferated and divided into a set of subpopulation groups. Antibodies in a subpopulation group are represented by multi-state gene quantum bits. In the antibody's updating, the quantum mutation operator is applied to accelerate convergence. The quantum recombination realizes the information communication between the subpopulation groups so as to avoid premature convergences. In this paper, the segmentation problem is viewed as a combinatorial optimization problem, the original image is partitioned into small blocks by watershed algorithm, and the quantum-inspired immune clonal algorithm is used to search the optimal clustering centre, and make the sequence of maximum affinity function as clustering result, and finally obtain the segmentation result. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for texture image and SAR image segmentation, compared with the genetic clustering algorithm based on watershed (W-GAC), and the k-means algorithm based on watershed (W-KM).

The quality of the recovered data vector depends on a good codebook. Mean/residual vector quantization (M/RVQ) has been shown to be efficient in the encoding time and it only needs a little storage. In this paper, Clonal Selection Algorithm for Image Compression (CSAIC) is proposed. In CSAIC, Based on M/RVQ algorithm, an improved clonal selection algorithm is used to cluster the data of compressed images in order to obtain the optimal codebook. The proposed method has been extensively compared with Linde-Buzo-Gray(LBG), Self-Organizing Mapping (SOM) and Modified K-means(Mod-KM) over a test suit of seven natural images. The experimental results show that CSAIC outperforms other three algorithms in terms of image compression performance.

Real-coded encoding of the cluster centres is used for this purpose. Here assignments of points to different clusters are made based on the Euclidean distance. The proposed method is applied on several simulated T1-weighted, T2-weighted and proton density for normal and MS lesion magnetic resonance brain images. Superiority of the proposed method over genetic algorithm based crisp clustering, simulated annealing based crisp clustering, K-means and average linkage are demonstrated quantitatively.

They are, however, all much slower. In this paper, we present an efficient method to speed up the performance of particle swarm optimization (PSO), called Fuzzy Pattern Reduction Enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization (FPREPSO). The proposed method first uses PSO to search for the global solutions. Then, it relies on pattern reduction to eliminate computations that are essentially redundant in the convergence process of PSO. And finally, it employs a set of fuzzy inference rules to decrease the chance of eliminating patterns that should not be eliminated. To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, we compare it with GLA and GLA-based algorithms such as standard GLA, pattern reduction enhanced GLA, genetic k-means algorithm (GKA), and PSO. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can cut the computation time down by 51.07% up to 81.77% compared to PSO and GKA.

As a partitional clustering algorithm, k-prototype (KP) algorithm is a well-known one for mixed type data. However, it is sensitive to initialization and converges to local optimum easily. Global searching ability is one of the most important advantages of evolutionary algorithm (EA), so an EA framework is introduced to help KP overcome its flaws. In this study, KP is applied as a local search strategy, and runs under the control of the EA framework. Experiments on synthetic and real-life datasets show that EKP is more robust and generates much better results than KP for mixed type data.

The PSO algorithm is an evolutionary computation technique whose main characteristics include low computational complexity, ability to escape from local optima, and small number of input parameters dependence, when compared to other evolutionary algorithms, e. g. genetic algorithms (GA). In the PSO-Cls algorithm, swarm intelligence is combined with K-means clustering, in order to achieve high convergence rates. On the other hand, DSNS consists of normal network traffic behavior profiles, generated by the application of Baseline for Automatic Backbone Management (BLGBA) model in SNMP historical network data set. The proposed approach identifies and classifies data clusters from DSNS and real traffic, using swarm intelligence. Anomalous behaviors can be easily identified by comparing real traffic and cluster centroids. Tests were performed in the network of State University of Londrina and the obtained detection and false alarm rates are promising.	[Lima, Moises F.; Sampaio, Lucas D.

This paper focuses on two key areas. It first introduces the "power" performance measure to model and manage the QoS requirements for wireless nodes with time critical applications as a function of the traffic level. It then presents a modified k-means clustering algorithm to organize nodes in the mixed network. This paper describes the analytical foundation and provides extensive simulation results to prove that the "power" performance measure is an excellent tool for significantly enhancing the QoS performance of the mixed network and maintaining that performance level under severe operating conditions. The paper concludes by showing that the enhanced clustering scheme can be extended by using additional distance measures such that the mixed network is organized and jointly optimized for QoS, spectrum, or interference management.

This paper introduces a new approach for the prediction of network failure and performance degradation using Joint Clustering and Association Analysis approach (JCAA). JCAA differs from existing prediction techniques in terms of exploiting the clustering and association analysis techniques in order to improve the quality of prediction. The role of clustering is to classify the input data into groups of k-means clusters, while the association analysis technique discovers the causal relationships between the groups. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system is truly effective in enhancing the quality of prediction.

A new segmentation technique based on a color watershed using an adaptive combination of color and texture information is proposed. This information is represented by two morphological gradients, a classical color gradient and a texture gradient based on co-occurrence matrices. The segmented images are then used as input for a k-means classifier in order to determine the percentage of visible sky in fish-eye images.

In this task the timbral information has been widely used, however many musical moods are characterized not only by timbral information but also by musical scale and temporal features such as rhythm patterns and bass-line patterns. In particular, modern music pieces mostly have certain fixed rhythm and bass-line patterns, and these patterns can characterize the impression of songs. We have proposed the extraction of rhythm and bass-line patterns, and these unit pattern analysis are combined with statistical feature extraction for mood classification. Experimental results show that the automatically calculated unit pattern information can be used to effectively classify musical mood.

One of the most important goals of WCE is the early detection of colorectal polyps. In this paper an unsupervised method for the detection of polyps in WCE videos is presented. Our method involves watershed segmentation with a novel initial marker selection method based on Gabor texture features and K-means clustering. Geometric information from the resulting segments is extracted to identify polyp candidates. Initial experiments indicate that the proposed method can detect polyps with 100% sensitivity and over 81% specificity.

A feature vector for each pixel is extracted using the multiresolution representation of the difference image which is computed from the multitemporal satellite images of the same scene acquired at different time instances. A metric for automatically estimating the number of resolution levels used in multiresolution analysis is proposed. The dimensionality of each feature vector is reduced using principal component analysis (PCA). The feature vectors are then classified into "changed" and "unchanged" classes using k-means clustering with k = 2 to achieve a change detection map. Results are shown on real data and comparisons with the state-of-the-art techniques on advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) images are provided.

However, it is not scalable to massive datasets due to its high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a method of approximating the sequence kernel that is shown to be computationally very efficient. More specifically, we formulate the problem of approximating the sequence kernel as the problem of obtaining a pre-image in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The effectiveness of the proposed approximation is demonstrated in text-independent speaker identification experiments with 10 male speakers-our approach provides significant reduction in computation time with limited performance degradation. Based on the proposed method, we develop a real-time kernel-based speaker identification system using Virtual Studio Technology (VST).			makoto.05@engalumni.colostate.edu					Mariethoz J, 2007, PATTERN RECOGN, V40, P2315, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2007.01.011; Rabiner L.R., 1993, FUNDAMENTALS SPEECH; Scholkopf B., 2002, LEARNING KERNELS; TANABE K, 2001, 143 I STAT MATH; Tranter S.E., 2006, IEEE T AUDIO SPEECH, V14; YAMADA M, 2009, SIGNAL PROC IN PRESS	6	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1520-6149		978-1-4244-4296-6	INT CONF ACOUST SPEE			2010							1626	1629		10.1109/ICASSP.2010.5495542		4	Acoustics; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Acoustics; Computer Science; Engineering	BTJ55	WOS:000287096001153

A distributed low-complexity clustering algorithm is developed that requires one-hop communications among neighboring nodes only, without local data exchanges. The algorithm alternates iterations over the variables of a consensus-based version of the global clustering problem. Using stability theory for time-varying and time-invariant systems, the distributed clustering algorithm is shown to be bounded-input bounded-output stable with an output arbitrarily close to a fixed point of the algorithm. For distributed hard K-means clustering, convergence to a local minimum of the centralized problem is guaranteed. Numerical examples confirm the merits of the algorithm and its stability analysis.

A new learning approach based on projections onto multi-dimensional ellipsoids (POME) is introduced, which is applicable to unsupervised clustering, semi-supervised clustering and classification in high-dimensional noisy data. Unlike the traditional learning techniques, where local information is used for data analysis, the proposed POME-based scheme incorporates a priori information of the data distribution. Experimental results in unsupervised clustering demonstrate the superiority of the proposed POME-based scheme to some well-known clustering algorithms, including the k-means and the hierarchical agglomerative clustering. We also illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed POME-based scheme in semi-supervised learning by simulation.

Instead of searching for the set of centroid that best fit the data, as in k-means type of approaches that model the data as distributions around discrete points, we optimize for a set of dictionaries, one for each cluster, for which the signals are best reconstructed in a sparse coding manner. Thereby, we are modeling the data as the of union of learned low dimensional subspaces, and data points associated to subspaces spanned by just a few atoms of the same learned dictionary are clustered together. Using learned dictionaries makes this method robust and well suited to handle large datasets. The proposed clustering algorithm uses a novel measurement for the quality of the sparse representation, inspired by the robustness of the l(1) regularization term in sparse coding. We first illustrate this measurement with examples on standard image and speech datasets in the supervised classification setting, showing with a simple approach its discriminative power and obtaining results comparable to the state-of-the-art. We then conclude with experiments for fully unsupervised clustering on extended standard datasets and texture images, obtaining excellent performance.

The RD-based localization is a kind of nonlinear optimization problem and generally it has no closed-form solution. Through auxiliary function approach, we derive iterative update rules without any tuning parameters, which just consists of 1) averaging source-sensor distances, 2) averaging the source positions estimated by updating source-sensor distance on each sensor with the source-direction fixed. Due to the resemblance of the iterative averaging to k-means clustering, we call it r-means localization. The convergence of the algorithm is guaranteed. The acceleration of the convergence is also investigated.

The paper presents a new Bayesian method which sequentially processes the observed data points by forming candidate sequences of labels assigning data points to mixture components. Using conjugate priors, we derive analytically a recursive formula for the computation of the probability of each label sequence. The practical implementation of this algorithm keeps only a predefined number of the highest ranked label sequences with the ranking based on posterior probabilities. We show by numerical simulations that the proposed technique consistently outperforms both the k-means and the EM algorithm.

This paper investigates two aspects of this information. The first is automatic detection of non-native speakers and their native language on relatively large data sets. We present several experiments which show how our system outperforms the best published results on both the Fisher database and the foreign-accented English (FAE) database for detecting non-native speakers and their native language respectively. Such performance is achieved by using an SVM-based classifier with ASR-based features integrated with a novel universal background model (UBM) obtained by clustering the Gaussian components of an ASR acoustic model. The second aspect of this work is to utilize the detected speaker characteristics within a speaker recognition system to improve its performance.

A ubiquitous network refers to a network environment, which enables anytime and anywhere access, by possibly any given device or by any user. In a ubiquitous network, applications require many types of information such as temperature and so forth. A great deal of attention has been paid to aggregate this information in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). A WSN consists of tiny nodes comprising sensing and communication devices. The information sensed by each node is relayed via other nodes in the WSN to the destination node called the "sink". One of the most significant challenges pertaining to any WSN is to reduce the energy consumption of its nodes, which run on scarce battery resources. An effective scheme to reduce this energy consumption is to exploit the sink node's mobility, which however presents new challenges to the sink node's routing and information aggregation. In this paper, we propose a new routing and data aggregation scheme based on clustering. Simulation results demonstrate that our scheme can provide better energy efficient data aggregation as compared to the KAT (K-means And Traveling salesman path) mobility.

This paper discusses the possibility of using a flow-based communication pattern per host as a metric to identify anomalies. The key idea underlining our method is that scanning worm-infected hosts reveal the intrinsic characteristics of host's communication pattern and such patterns are distinguishable from those of other hosts. In particular, we found that scanning of worm-infected hosts that generated a lot of flows revealed the intrinsic communication pattern and the pattern could be classified from those of other hosts by k-means clustering. We also found that our flow-based metric could isolate the anomalies that have little influence upon the volumetric information of traffic and flow as "lines", which is remarkable in that the hosts that caused the hidden anomalies were mined out.

Although noise rejection mechanisms such as noise fuzzy clustering or graded possibilistic noise rejection make it possible to remove the influence of noisy samples, they also create problems in applying conventional validity measures designed for fuzzy clustering with probabilistic constraints. In this paper, a PCA-guided validation approach is developed, in which a rotated optimal cluster indicator is derived in a fuzzy PCA-guided manner, considering responsibility weights for c-means clustering. The deviation between a current solution and the optimal solution is estimated through procrustean transformation. Several experimental results demonstrate that the proposed validation approach works well for selecting both the optimal initialization and the cluster number.

We present a way to assess one important aspect of print quality, namely the distortion of halftone dots printed colour pictures are made of. The problem is formulated as assessing the distortion of circles detected in microscale images of halftone dot areas. In this paper several known circle detection techniques are explored in terms of accuracy and robustness. We also present a new circle detection technique based on the fuzzy Hough transform (FHT) extended with k-means clustering for detecting positions of accumulator peaks and with an optional fine-tuning step implemented through unsupervised learning. Prior knowledge about the approximate positions and radii of the circles is utilized in the algorithm. Compared to FHT the proposed technique is shown to increase the estimation accuracy of the position and size of detected circles. The techniques are investigated using synthetic and natural images.

The algorithm automatically finds the optimal number of cluster and self organizes the clusters based on inter/intra-cluster distances and cluster's performance evaluation. The self-organizing fuzzy k-means is applied in 3D line identification from point clouds. We use the point clouds provided by Stereo camera and 2D images. The 3D point clouds of each line is clustered by clustering algorithm, then we perform eigen-analysis on clusters and estimate the final 3D lines; the 3D lines can be cut off into several segments. In addition, to increase the accuracy of detection, the error evaluation is invoked to analyze the error of the 3D candidate lines. Our algorithm was evaluated on the real test scenes, which content noisy point clouds, and shows the high performance and robust results.

For example in customer segmentation we may be faced with the situation that a certain customer not necessarily belongs to just one segment, i.e. his/her class assignment is uncertain. Several cluster algorithms have been proposed that employ uncertainty modeling in different ways. The most frequently used techniques are probability theory, fuzzy logic, and recently rough sets. If uncertainty modeling is already important in static clustering this becomes even more important in dynamic clustering where several elements of the respective cluster can change over time. Changes produce uncertainty and that is where uncertainty modeling in dynamic clustering comes into play. In this paper we present briefly two cluster algorithms that employ soft computing approaches and provide a comparison regarding their capabilities to capture uncertainties in dynamic environments.

The QRS complex is the most important and distinguishable component in the ECG because of its spiked nature and high amplitude. Automatic detection and delineation of the QRS complex in ECG is of extreme importance for computer aided diagnosis of cardiac disorder. Therefore, the accurate detection of this component is crucial to the performance of subsequent machine learning algorithms for cardiac disease classification. The aim of the present work is to detect the QRS wave from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Initially the baseline drift has been removed from the signal followed by the decomposition using continuous wavelet transform. Modulus maxima approach proposed by Mallat has been used to compute the Lipschitz exponent of the components. By using the property of R peak, having highest and prominent amplitude and Lipschitz exponents, we have applied the K means clustering technique to classify QRS complex. In order to evaluate the algorithm, the analysis has been done on MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database.

Recently, several new texture classification approaches by modeling texture images as distributions over a set of textons have been proposed. These textons are learned as the cluster centers in the image patch feature space using the K-means clustering algorithm. However, the Euclidian distance based the K-means clustering process may not be able to well characterize the intrinsic feature space of texture textons, which if often embedded into a low dimensional manifold. Inspired by the great success of l(1)-norm minimization based sparse representation (SR), in this paper we propose a novel texture classification method via patch-based sparse texton learning. Specifically, the dictionary of textons is learned by applying SR to image patches in the training dataset. The SR coefficients of the test images over the dictionary are used to construct the histograms for texture classification. Experimental results on benchmark database validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The images are modeled as weighted graphs whose nodes correspond to super pixels; and normalized cuts are utilized to obtain final segmentation. Utilizing super pixels provides an efficient and compact representation; the graph complexity decreases by hundreds in terms of node number. Connected K-means with convexity constraint is the key tool for the proposed super pixel extraction. Once the pixels are grouped into super pixels, iterative bi-partitioning of the weighted graph, as introduced in normalized cuts, is performed to obtain segmentation map. Supported by various experiments, the proposed two stage segmentation scheme can be considered to be one of the most efficient graph based segmentation algorithms providing high quality results.

A procedure called seam processing, which is computationally efficient, is employed to search for horizontal and vertical seams that contain edge information. By transforming the spatial coordinates based on the seam detection results, the edge information can be added to the feature vectors, which are the inputs of K-Means algorithm. The experiments show that the proposed method can achieve edge-adaptive segmentation results, which can not be obtained using traditional methods based on K-Means clustering.

However, its performance is often sensitive to the codebook size that is usually predefined. Moreover, the codebook generated by unsupervised methods, e. g., K-means, often suffers from the problem of ambiguity and weak efficiency. In other words, the visual codebook contains a lot of noisy and/or ambiguous words. In this paper, we propose a novel method to address these issues by constructing a compact but effective visual codebook using sparse reconstruction. Given a large codebook generated by K-means, we reformulate it in a sparse manner, and learn the weight of each word in the original visual codebook. Since the weights are sparse, they naturally introduce a new compact codebook. We apply this compact codebook to action recognition tasks and verify it on the widely used Weizmann action database. The experimental results show clearly the benefits of the proposed solution.

Several approaches have been developed for codebook construction, the most popular method is to cluster a set of image features (e.g. SIFT) by k-means. In this paper, we propose a two-step procedure which incorporates label information into the clustering process by efficiently generating a large and informative vocabulary using class-wise k-means and reducing its size by agglomerative information bottleneck (AIB). We introduce an extension of the AIB procedure for multi-label problems and show that this two-step approach improves the classification results while reducing computation time compared to the vanilla k-means. We analyse the reasons for the performance gain on the PASCAL VOC 2007 data set.

Few literatures can be found to provide the information of this kind of signal in such circumstances. In this paper, a blind spreading sequence set estimation algorithm for the M-ary DSSS signals is proposed. This method exploits the signal structure and the cross-correlation properties between the spreading sequences. Firstly, the received signal samples are divided into a set of vectors. Secondly, using a correlation-based iteration, one of the spreading sequences is recovered. And, the vectors corresponding to this sequence are removed from the signal vector set. Thirdly, by repeating the above procedure, a set of estimates are obtained. Finally, false answers are removed by checking the estimates with the original signal samples, then, the spreading sequence set is recovered. This method is capable of providing good estimates when the signal-to-noise ratio is greater than -1dB. Besides, the proposed method is much faster and more robust than the existing K-means clustering dispreading method. Simulation results verify the capabilities of the proposed method.

In the method proposed, each candidate is ranked with a double criterion: first, informativeness of the candidate is assessed using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) real valued decision function. Then, diverse sampling is ensured by considering the relative position of the candidate in the SVM feature space. Such position is evaluated by using partitioning of the feature space via nonlinear clustering. Among all candidates belonging to the same cluster, the winner is the pixel minimizing the weighted combination of the distances from both the SVM hyperplane and the cluster center. This way, the proposed approach provides a way to i) account for and minimize the redundancy of the sampled pixels and ii) maximize the speed of convergence to an optimal classification accuracy. In order to discover clusters and to evaluate the distance between the cluster center and the samples, the kernel k-means algorithm is used in a hierarchical way. By its kernel nature, the algorithm partitions data in the SVM induced space, thus ensuring coherent diversity with respect to the linear model therein. The reliability of the proposed heuristic is evaluated on a QuickBird VHR image of the city of Zurich, Switzerland.

Such a scheme will fail for nonlinear structures in the feature space, unless the classification algorithm has the capacity to describe cluster shapes in sufficient generality. Existing polarimetric SAR classification methods are faced by this exact problem: typically they initialize clusters in the Cloude-Pottier parameter space [1], further optimizing them in the coherency matrix space [2, 3]. Methods using K-means [2] or agglomeration [3] require clusters that are spherical, or compact and well separated, respectively. In the Cloude-Pottier space, these requirements are not met, so initialization in the Cloude-Pottier space cannot be consistent with optimization by K-means or agglomeration. This paper sets out to address this problem, by implementing a new data-driven clustering approach, for arbitrarily shaped clusters. It is applied to quad-polarisation data, demonstrating the new methodology's potential for forest land-cover type discrimination.

To classify the tree type is very important for the forest maintenance. With the advent of high spatial resolution remote sensing sensors, our ability has greatly increased for tree type identification. Considering the amount of data in need of processing and the high computational costs required by image processing algorithms, conventional computing environments are simply impractical. Therefore, it is necessary to develop techniques and models for efficiently processing large volume of remote sensing images. In this study, a cluster computing environment was adopted to speed up the computation time. The test image was first partitioned into hundreds of manageable sub-images. Scheduled by the head node, the sub-images were then distributed to compute nodes for processing. A distributed K-mean clustering algorithm with undetermined number of class was applied to each compute node. A promising result was obtained. Compared to the field investigations, tree types of the test site were properly identified. In addition, great improvement in computation time was obtained. The distributed K-mean clustering algorithm implemented on our cluster computing environment performed much faster than stand-alone alternatives. By adding more compute nodes to our cluster computing environment, further improvement in computation time is expected.	[Fan, K. T.; Tzeng, Y. C.; Lin, Y. F.; Su, Y.

In a clinical environment, the delineation of brain structures is still often performed manually by human experts. In this study, we concentrate on automatic segmentation of the striatal brain structures (caudate, posterior and anterior putamen and ventral striatum) from the binding potential (BPND) images derived based on [C-11]-raclopride studies. Previously, a method for the automatic segmentation of the striatal structures was proposed for the ECAT high resolution research tomograph (HRRT, CTI PET Systems, Knoxville, TN, USA) BPND images. The method is based on clustering the affinity matrix (containing the features as intensity values, spatial connectivity and distance) of the striatum which is extracted by using a deformable surface model. In clustering, the method uses weighted kernel k-means algorithm. In this study, we evaluate the segmentation method with a test-retest dataset. We studied the segmentation differences between the analytical (3D-RP) and iterative (3D-OPOSEM) reconstructions of the ECAT HRRT data. In addition to visual comparisons, for different reconstruction methods, normalized absolute differences (NAD) between the segmented regions of test-retest BPND images were calculated. We observed that NAD values were within acceptable limits in most cases. However, the ventral striatum segmentation failed to some extent. Furthermore, it is obvious that robustness of this kind of brain structure extraction methods should be tested with various reconstruction methods.

For effective citizen relationship management, it is important to identify the needs of different citizen groups and to provide respective services for each group accordingly. In this way, the application of data mining tools would be very useful to understand citizen's needs. In this paper, focusing on the CiRM concept, we apply a data mining framework on the database of Tehran municipality. This framework consists of clustering and the association rule to improve citizen satisfaction. The main objective is to find the factors those affect the rate of satisfaction. Firstly, we use the K-means algorithm to cluster the subjects that cause citizens complaint. Every data point is identified in terms of the following features: the frequency, the number of days that at least one complaint occurred and the interval time between the first and the latest time of each subject during a season. Secondly, the association rule is used to identify the factors that affect the rate of satisfaction in the cluster of subjects that occur regularly during the season and have a high number of complaints. The results of the research are very useful to build a strategy recommendation system in order to improve the rate of citizens' satisfaction. This study could be notable as one of the first studies on using data mining tools in CiRM.

Clustering is the classification of a data set into subsets (clusters), so that the data in each subset (ideally) share some common trait - often proximity according to some defined distance measure. It can enable users to find the relevant documents more easily and also help users to form an understanding of the different facets of the query that have been provided for web search engine. A popular technique for clustering is based on K-means such that the data is partitioned into K clusters. In this method, the groups are identified by a set of points that are called the cluster centers. The data points belong to the cluster whose center is closest. Existing algorithms for k-means clustering are slow and do not scale to large number of data points and converge to different local minima based on the initializations. A fast greedy k-means algorithm can attack both these drawbacks, but it is a limitation when the algorithm is used for large number of data points, So we introduce an efficient method to compute the distortion for this algorithm. The experiment results show that the fast greedy algorithm is superior to other method and can help users to find the relevant documents more easily than by relevance ranking.

However it is a greedy algorithm, which is sensitive to the choice of cluster center and is much easier to result in local optimization, while genetic algorithms (GA) have the characteristics of being self-adaptive for global optimization. Combining these two kinds of algorithms can improve the result of clustering. However, poor individuals can not be excluded well in existing combing algorithms. This paper presents a hybrid clustering algorithm (IHGK) which uses gene factor (OF) to control poor individuals in the crossover and mutation operation to make sure they are not included in the next generation. Experimental results show that IHGK can effectively improve the clustering effect. Thus; the algorithm of this paper is an effective method.

Our scheme then uses K Means Algorithm on the obtained Linear Predictive Coding Coefficients to form a Vector Quantized codebook. Recognition of a spoken Hindi word is carried out by first calculating its Discrete Wavelet Transform Coefficients, followed by Linear Predictive Coding Coefficient calculation of these Discrete Wavelet Transform Coefficients, and then deciding in favor of the Hindi word whose corresponding centroid (in the Vector Quantized codebook) gives a minimum squared Euclidean distance error with respect to the word under test.

But even the most sophisticated investigators often rely on one-dimensional representations of the image in terms of its scanlines. Such vector representations are convenient because of the mathematical tractability of one-dimensional time-series. However, they fail to take into account the spatial correlations between the pixels, which is crucial in tumor detection and classification in breast images. In this paper, we propose a CAD system for tumor detection and classification (cancerous v.s. benign) in ultrasound breast images based on a two-dimensional Auto-Regressive-Moving-Average (ARMA) model of the breast image. First, we show, using the Wold decomposition theorem, that ultrasound breast images can be accurately modeled by two-dimensional ARMA random fields. As in the 1D case, the 2D ARMA parameter estimation problem is much more difficult than its 2D AR counterpart, due to the non-linearity in estimating the 2D moving average (MA) parameters. We propose to estimate the 2D ARMA parameters using a two-stage Yule-Walker Least-Squares algorithm. The estimated parameters are then used as the basis for statistical inference and biophysical interpretation of the breast image. We evaluate the performance of the 2D ARMA vector features in real ultrasound images using a k-means classifier. Our results suggest that the proposed CAD system based on a two-dimensional ARMA model leads to parameters that can accurately segment the ultrasound breast image into three regions: healthy tissue, benign tumor, and cancerous tumor. Moreover, the specificity and sensitivity of the proposed two-dimensional CAD system is superior to its one-dimensional homologue.

A clustering ensemble is a paradigm that seeks to best combine the outputs of several clustering algorithms with a decision fusion function to achieve a more accurate and stable final output. Our ensemble is constructed with our proposed clustering algorithm as a core modelling method that is used to generate a series of clustering results with different conditions for a given dataset. Then, a decision aggregation mechanism such as voting is employed to find a combined partition of the different clusters. The voting mechanism considered only experimental results that produce intra-similarity value higher than the average intra-similarity value for a particular interval. The aim of this procedure is to find a clustering result that minimizes the number of disagreements between different clustering results. Our ensemble method has been tested on 11 benchmark datasets and compared with some individual methods including TwoStep, k-means, squeezer, k-prototype and some ensemble based methods including k-ANMI, ccdByEnsemble, SIPR, and SICM. The experimental results showed its strengths over the compared clustering algorithms.

In this paper we present is an extension of kernel k-means clustering algorithm for symbolic interval data. To evaluate this method, experiments with synthetic and real interval data sets were performed and we have been compared our method with a dynamic clustering algorithm with adaptive distance. The evaluation is based on an external cluster validity index (corrected Rand index) and the overall error rate of classification (OERC).

Neural Network-based Taxonomic Clustering for Metagenomics	2010 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS IJCNN 2010	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2010)	2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE				Metagenomic studies inherently involve sampling genetic information from an environment potentially containing thousands of distinctly different microbial organisms. This genetic information is sequenced producing many short fragments (<500 base pair (bp)); each is tentatively a small representative of the DNA coding structure. Any of the fragments may belong to any of the organisms in the sample, but the relationship is unknown a priori. Furthermore, most of these organisms have not been identified and correspondingly are not represented in any of the publicly available search databases. Our goal is to be able to predict the taxonomic classification of an organism based on the fragments obtained from an environmental sample that may include many (some previously unidentified) organisms. To elucidate the diversity and composition of the sample, we first use a supervised naive Bayes classifier to score the fragments of known genomes, followed by an unsupervised clustering to group fragments from similar organisms together. We are then free to analyze each cluster separately. This is challenging since we are not interested in similar sequences, but sequences that come from similar genomes, which are known to vary widely intra-genomically. Our dataset comprises of an extremely challenging scenario involving clustering fragments at the phyla level, where none of the phyla have been previously seen or identified. We present two variations of our proposed approach, one based on ART and K-means. We show that ART can cluster 500bp fragments from 17 novel phyla at an overall isolation/grouping that is 10% better than K-means and nearly 7 times over chance.

Statistical and intelligent systems techniques were employed to process the data collected by an EN. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-Means clustering and Fuzzy C-Mean (FCM) clustering were applied to visualise any clusters within the dataset. Furthermore, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) based Artificial Neural Network (ANNs) were used to learn to classify and hence categorise the datasets. Using the RBF, MLP and LVQ techniques we achieved 94, 96 and 98% classification accuracy for the healthy, powdery mildew (Oidium lycopersicum) and spider mite infected plants respectively. From these results it is evident that EN is capable of discriminating between the healthy and artificially infected tomato plants and hence may be deployed as a potential early disease detection tool for tomato crops in commercial greenhouses.

Identifying fiber bundles with regularised k-means clustering applied to the grid-based data	2010 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS IJCNN 2010	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2010)	2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE			STABILITY; TRACTS	Brain segmentation represents a very complex and challenging problem. Fiber pathways connecting the same functional regions of the brain form a natural anatomical group (bundle). Fiber bundling is a typical clustering problem. Note that the fiber bundles in the human brain take various sizes and shapes. The measure used to define the spatial proximity between curves is of fundamental importance for clustering. It is not easy (first of all in terms of the computational time) to compare different fibers directly taking into account that they have different lengths and structures. As a solution to this problem, we propose to consider intermediate key-sets with several very important 3D-points. Depending on the proximity to one particular set we can make a conclusion whether or not two different curves are similar. Our method was tested successfully during the International 2009 Pittsburgh Brain Connectivity IEEE ICDM Competition, where we achieved the top score in Challenge 1 (our score was 50.49% higher compared to the second highest score). Also, we were placed second in Challenge 2.

We present a concise review of community structure finding (CSF) algorithms and applications. We apply a CSF algorithm and various other algorithms on three different microarray data sets. We calculate modularity and C-rand indices as an indication of the quality of each clustering of the three data sets. We compare the performance of the CSF algorithm with the performance of three other algorithms: hierarchical clustering (HC) algorithm, K-means, dynamic tree cut (DTC) algorithm and Naive Bayes Clustering (NBC) using both C-rand and modularity values. We report that the CSF algorithm detects clusters resulting in high modularity; however the CSF does not result in clusters with high C-rand values compared to the other methods.

(ii) A novel random forest clustering algorithm is used for generating clusters and it has several obvious advantages over the commonly used k-means algorithm in practice. These resultant health typologies will help local authorities to understand and design customized health interventions for the population. A Birmingham map illustrating the distribution of all health typologies is produced.

We give an automatic approach, which can determine the number of groups using silhouette coefficient and the sum of the squared error, and can cluster the data patterns using the particle swarm optimization and K-means. In our approach, a new particle representation is given too, which consists of two parts, one is the actual cluster center coordinates, and the other is specific symbols. The experiment conducted shows that the proposed approach can generally find the optimum number of clusters, and can cluster the data patterns effectively.

The proposed approach adapts classifier parameters to different parts of input images using the concept of reference neighborhood. Three variants of AFCAs, namely K-means-clustering AFCA, Entropy-based AFCA, and Statistical AFCA, were developed. Experiments were conducted both on synthetic images and on real fingerprint images to compare these AFCAs and Canny edge detection. The presented results show that Statistical AFCA is the best performer with latent images.	[Rochac, Juan F.

Seed-based K-Means is the integration of a small set of labeled data (called seeds) to the K-Means algorithm to improve its performances and overcome its sensitivity to initial centers. These centers are, most of the time, generated at random or they are assumed to be available for each cluster. This paper introduces a new efficient algorithm for active seeds selection which relies on a Min-Max approach that favors the coverage of the whole dataset. Experiments conducted on artificial and real datasets show that, using our active seeds selection algorithm, each cluster contains at least one seed after a very small number of queries and thus helps reducing the number of iterations until convergence which is crucial in many KDD applications.

In this paper, we show that this problem can be formalized as a classical optimization task from operations research, in ways that accommodate different requirements for multiple users, different query sensitivities to load shedding, and different penalty functions. Standard non-linear programming algorithms are adequate for non-critical situations, but for severe overloads, we propose a more efficient algorithm that runs in linear time, without compromising optimality. Our approach is applicable to a large class of queries including traditional SQL aggregates, statistical aggregates (e. g., quantiles), and data mining functions, such as k-means, naive Bayesian classifiers, decision trees, and frequent pattern discovery (where we can even specify a different error bound for each pattern). In fact, we show that these aggregate queries are special instances of a broader class of functions, that we call reciprocal-error aggregates, for which the proposed methods apply with full generality. Finally, we propose a novel architecture for supporting load shedding in an extensible system, where users can write arbitrary User Defined Aggregates (UDA), and thus confirm our analytical findings with several experiments executed on an actual DSMS.

The NSS-AKmeans can identify high density areas and determine initial cluster centers from these areas with a neighbor sharing selection method. To select initial cluster centers, we propose an agglomeration energy (AE) factor for representing global density relationship of objects, and a Neighbors Sharing Factor (NSF) for estimating local neighbor sharing relationship of objects. Then we use the Agglomerative Fuzzy k-means clustering algorithm to further merge these initial centers to obtain the preferred number of clusters and generate better clustering results. Experimental results on various data sets have shown that the NSS-AKmeans was very effective in automatically identifying the true cluster number as well as producing accurate clustering results.

The first one was single tree modeling. Regional-Maximum and K-means algorithm were used to isolate one single tree and its data points, and a SuperQuadric surface was fit as the silhouette of the tree's canopy. Then a geometric tree model was obtained with L-studio software. The second application was 3D vegetation visualization using DCM (Digital Canopy Model) to control the location of every single tree. DCM was calculated by subtracting DTM (Digital Terrain Model) form DSM (Digital Surface Model). DCM was a direct reflection of above-ground vegetation height, so it was used to determine whether a coniferous tree, deciduous tree or grass should be planted inside the DTM triangles.

But there are also some defects. The initial clustering number must be predetermined in k-means clustering algorithm, and the choice of the initial center has randomness too. To the shortcoming of appointing the initial center at random in k-means clustering algorithm, this paper proposes a new method of k-means algorithm with refined initial center point based on data sample distribution. Experiment reveals that the clustering results produced by this algorithm are more stable and have high quality.

When those mechanisms exist concurrently or in a series, multiple sources are visible and accessible, and there is likely to be a form of interdependency While heterogeneous bidder behavior has been studied in some literature, the focus is mainly on individual auction level and the underlying dynamics regarding the interdependency among the auctions in the market has not been explained. We use two-phased approach First, we classify user strategy using k-means clustering. Then we characterize the transition pattern of heterogeneous clusters using dynamic systems framework Long-term behavior of the system is effectively and efficiently predicted using system parameters. Our model can serve as a decision support framework for optimal market design.

This specie grows spontaneously in some microclimates, namely in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula. The aim of this study is to find inorganic and molecular markers that allow to characterize the wild A. ponderosa strains collected from different geographical locations in the Iberian Peninsula. Molecular approach using the microsatellite primer M13-PCR allowed to distinguish the mushrooms at specie level and to differentiate the A. ponderosa strains according to their location. Data mining tools were used in order to correlate inorganic and molecular results. A. ponderosa strains showed different inorganic composition according to their habitat. It was developed a segmentation model based on the molecular analysis, which allow relating the clusters obtained with the geographical site of sampling. There were also developed explanatory models of the segmentation, using decision trees, by following two different strategies. One of them based on the bands of DNA and, the other one, based on the mineral composition. The results show that it may be possible to relate the molecular and inorganic data. The present findings are wide potential application and both health and economical benefits arise from this study.

The aim of this work is to obtain a computer vision system that enables an automatic recognition of six hazelnut cultivars with fruits of different shapes and sizes. To achieve this objective, an algorithm for tuning the segmentation between the hazelnut shell and crown was developed. Important morphological features that allow the correct identification of the cultivar present in an image were obtained from the segmentation process.

A new method, based on Time-Delay Embedding and modularity, is proposed to construct network from nonlinear time series. Through detecting the community structure of the resulting network using the community-detection algorithm based on K-means clustering, useful and interesting results are found which can be used to identify three inclined oil-water flow patterns. In this paper, from a new perspective, we not only introduce complex network theory to the study of oil-water two-phase flow, but also demonstrate that complex network may be a powerful tool for exploring nonlinear time series in practice.

Regression-based methods using ultrasonographic parameters are generally used in clinic and provide relatively acceptable estimate of fetal weight. Besides, peculiar body figure and macrosomia cause the misjudgment. This study proposed a cluster-based artificial neural network model to improve the accuracy of fetal weight estimation through ultrasonographic parameters. Principal component analysis is adopted to reduce the effects of co-linearity between body figure features. K-means method is used for fetal sizes classification. A cluster based artificial neural network model is proposed for fetal weight estimation. The performance between the proposed model and the regression formula was compared and examined with Friedman test. The results show that the proposed cluster-based ANN model outperformed those of previous models. The results of this study may contribute to a better decision-making over the choices of birth deliveries options, consequently to reduce the possibilities of maternal-fetal morbidity and mortality.

Given a finite set P of size n, our goal is to find a set C of size k such that the sum of errors D(P, C) = Sigma(p is an element of P) min(c is an element of C) {D(p, c)} is minimized. The main result in this article can be stated as follows: There exists a (1 + epsilon)-approximation algorithm for the k-median problem with respect to D, if the I-median problem can be approximated within a factor of (1 + epsilon) by taking a random sample of constant size and solving the I-median problem on the sample exactly. This algorithm requires time n2(O(mklog(mk/epsilon))), where m is a constant that depends only on epsilon and D. Using this characterization, we obtain the first linear time (1 + epsilon)-approximation algorithms for the k-median problem in an arbitrary metric space with bounded doubling dimension, for the Kullback-Leibler divergence (relative entropy), for the Itakura-Saito divergence, for Mahalanobis distances, and for some special cases of Bregman divergences. Moreover, we obtain previously known results for the Euclidean k-median problem and the Euclidean k-means problem in a simplified manner. Our results are based on a new analysis of an algorithm of Kumar et al. [2004].

As an alternative to the classical speciation mechanism originally implemented, k-means clustering provides a more realistic method for modeling speciation that, among other things, allows for the recreation of the species tree of life. This discussion introduces the k-means speciation, presents the improvements it provides, and compares the new mechanism versus the traditional method of speciation.			aspinal@uwindsor.ca; rgras@uwindsor.ca					Adami C., 1994, ARTIF LIFE, P377; Coyne JA, 2004, SPECIATION; DEVAURS D, 2010, SIMUL MODEL PRACT TH, P100; Fisher RA, 1943, J ANIM ECOL, V12, P42, DOI 10.2307/1411; GRAS R, 2010, ARTIF LIFE, P423; Holland J H, 1995, HIDDEN ORDER ADAPTAT; HRABER PT, 1995, ARTIF LIFE, P165; KOSKO B, 1986, INT J MAN MACH STUD, V24, P65, DOI 10.1016/S0020-7373(86)80040-2; SLATKIN M, 2007, EVOLUTION, V54, P1606	9	4	4	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743		978-3-642-15469-0	LECT NOTES COMPUT SC			2010	6335						318	329				12	Computer Science, Information Systems; Mathematics, Applied	Computer Science; Mathematics	BSL35	WOS:000284854200033

Hierarchical clustering is generally considered as an efficient and scalable way to facilitate the management and operation of such large-scale networks and minimize the total energy consumption for prolonged lifetime. Judicious selection of cluster heads for data integration and communication is critical to the success of applications based on hierarchical sensor networks organized as layered clusters. We investigate the problem of selecting nodes in a pre-deployed sensor network to be the cluster heads to minimize the total energy needed for data gathering. We rigorously derive an analytical formula to optimize the number of cluster heads in sensor networks under uniform node distribution, and propose a Distance-based Crowdedness Clustering algorithm to determine the cluster heads in sensor networks under general node distribution. The results from an extensive set of experiments on a large number of simulated sensor networks illustrate the performance superiority of the proposed solution over the clustering schemes based on k-means algorithm.

Accepted and rejected songs are gathered to extract the user's preferences. To compare acoustic characteristics of music files, profiles are introduced. These are based on result lists. Each result list is created by a classifier and sorted accordingly to the similarity of the given seed song. To detect important characteristics, the accepted and rejected songs are clustered with k-means. A score for each candidate song is specified by the distance to the mean values of the obtained clusters. The songs are proposed by creating a playlist, which is sorted by the score. Songs accepted by the listener are used to query the CBMR system for new songs and thus extract additional profiles. It is shown that incorporating relevance feedback can significantly improve the quality of music recommendation.

More precisely, an innovative, mobile museum guide system is presented, which enables camera phones to recognize paintings in art galleries. After careful examination, the algorithms Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) were found most promising for tins goal. Consequently, both have been integrated in a fully implemented prototype system and their performance has been thoroughly evaluated under realistic conditions. In order to speed up the matching process for finding the corresponding sample in the feature database, an approximation to Nearest Neighbor Search was investigated. The k-means based clustering approach was found to significantly improve the computational time.

The main contribution resides in the integration of three computational blocks: 1) local polynomial approximation algorithm which finds locally-adapted neighborhood of each pixel; 2) color texture analysis which describes each pixel by a vector of numerical attributes that reflect this pixel local neighborhood characteristcs; and 3) cluster analysis (k-means) for grouping pixels into homgeneous regions based on their color information. The proposed approach leads to a robust segmentation procedure which produces fine segments well matched to the image contents.

A correct assignment of each player to the relative team is a preliminary task that together with player detection and tracking algorithms can strongly affect any high level semantic analysis. Supervised approaches for object classification, require the construction of ad hoc models before the processing and also a manual selection of different player patches belonging to the team classes. The idea of this paper is to collect the players patches coming from six different cameras, and after a pre-Processing step based on CBTF (Cumulative Brightness Transfer Function) studying and comparing different unsupervised method for classification. The pre-processing step based on CBTF has been implemented in order to mitigate difference in appearance between images acquired by different cameras. We tested three different unsupervised classification algorithms (MBSAS - a sequential clustering algorithm; BCLS - a competitive one; and k-means - a hard-clustering algorithm) on the transformed patches. Results obtained by comparing different set of features with different classifiers are proposed. Experimental results have been carried out on different real matches of the Italian Serie A.

We propose the use of the discernibility initial seed computation (ISC) for RKM. Our proposed algorithm aims to improve the performance and to avoid the problem of an empty cluster which affects the numerical stability since there are data constellations where |Ck| = 0 in RKM algorithm. For verification, our proposed algorithm was tested using 8 UCI datasets and validated using the David Bouldin Index. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm of the discernibility initial seed computation of RKM was appropriate to avoid the empty cluster and capable of improving the performance of RKM.

Supervised classification is a machine learning procedure for deducing a function from training data; unsupervised classification is a kind of classification which no training sample is available and subdivision of the feature space is achieved by identifying natural groupings present in the images values. As a branch of swarm intelligence, ant colony optimization algorithm has self-organization, adaptation, positive feedback and other intelligent advantages. In this paper, ant colony optimization algorithm is tentatively introduced into unsupervised classification of remote sensing images. A series of experiments are performed with remote sensing data. Comparing with the K-mean and the ISODATA clustering algorithm, the experiment result proves that artificial ant colony optimization algorithm provides a more effective approach to remote sensing images classification.

In order to perform these tasks, we need to scale-up the algorithms used to deal with millions data points in hundred of thousand dimensions. We present k-means (used in the quantization step) and SVM (used in the classification step) algorithms extended to deal with very large datasets. These new incremental and parallel algorithms can be used on various distributed architectures, like multi-thread computer, cluster or GPU (graphics processing units). The efficiency of the approach is shown with the categorization of the 3D-Dataset from Savarese and Fei-Fei containing about 6700 images of 3D objects from 10 different classes. The obtained incremental and parallel SVM algorithm is several orders of magnitude faster than usual ones (like lib-SVM, SVM-perf or CB-SVM) and the incremental and parallel k-means is at least one order of magnitude faster than usual implementations.

One method to solve this is over-sampling approach by PCA regression. However, PCA regression may not generate good churn samples if a dataset is nonlinear discriminant. We employed Genetic K-means Algorithm to cluster a dataset to find locally optimum small dataset to overcome the problem.

In this paper a step segmentation method for algebraic models is proposed. The mesh normals and curvedness of every vertex are estimated as a shape descriptor. In the first segmentation fourteen directions are chosen initially, and a k-means algorithm according to the normal vectors is used, then the surface is divided to form patches by a region-growing scheme, as well as some sharp edges or flat areas are detected. In order to identify algebraic surface, curvedness of a patch is set as the criterion by which the surface merged into near constant curvedness region. Especially a novel mean shift algorithm is adopted in this method, that a powerful technique for clustering in image process, and is extended to normal filtering while preserving the features to increase robustness of the method. Experimental evaluations using scan data or noise data demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

The method conducted in k-means form under the framework of diffusion maps and coarse-grained random walk is implemented for graph partitioning, dimensionality reduction and data set parameterization. In this paper we extend this framework to a probabilistic setting, in which each node has a certain probability of belonging to a certain community. The algorithm (FDM) for such a fuzzy network partition is presented and tested, which can be considered as an extension of the fuzzy c-means algorithm in statistics to network partitioning. Application to three representative examples is discussed.

In order to examine the huge size of data set in stream model generated by sensor network, it will be analyzed different sensor's output signal, topology of sensors network, number of sensor parameters and number of acquisition data. In our wind energy monitoring, sensor node monitors six attributes: speed, direction, temperature, pressure, humidity, and battery voltage. Every attribute value is set as four measures: average, instantaneous, minimum, and maximum. This paper presents several data mining techniques applied on the wireless sensor network's data considered: Nave Bayes, k-nearest neighbor, decision trees, IF-THEN rules, and neural networks. Before classification, the data was clustered in order to be labeled. A similarity based algorithm, k-means, was selected in the clustering process for its simplicity and efficiency. A conclusion that decision trees are a suitable method to classify the large amount of data considered is made finally according to the mining result and its reasonable explanation.

Recognizing of this line is important because it allows computing its 3D coordinates using the projection matrix of the endoscopic cameras. In this paper we present a method to track an ultrasound probe in successive endoscopic images without relying on any external tracking system. The probe is tracked using a spatio-temporal technique based on optical flow and clustering algorithm. Firstly, we compute the optical flow using the Horn-Schunck algorithm. Secondly, a feature space using the optical flow magnitude and luminance is defined. Thirdly, feature space is partitioned in two regions using the k-means clustering algorithm. After this, we calculate the axis line of the ultrasound probe using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) over segmented region. Finally, a motion restriction is defined over consecutive frames in order to avoid tracking errors. We have used endoscopic images from brain phantoms to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we compare our methodology against ground truth and a based color particle filter, and our results show that it is robust and accurate.

Euclidean distance is a commonly used distance measure in many methods due to simplicity of implementation. However the properties of problem domain are important thing, this selection must be done carefully. For example, most problems use data vectors with real-valued and nominal feature values. Euclidian distance produces reasonable results for real data, whereas it can not be said for nominal data. Hence in this study the new distance measure has been proposed for calculating distance between data vectors with nominal feature value.

Many algorithms proposed so far, especially the group of methods in the k-means formulation, can lead to a high degree of efficiency and accuracy. Here we test three k-means methods, based on optimal prediction, diffusion distance and dissimilarity index, respectively, on two artificial networks, including the widely known ad hoc network with same community size and a recently introduced LFR benchmark graphs with heterogeneous distributions of degree and community size. All of them display an excellent performance, with the additional advantage of low computational complexity, which enables the analysis of large systems. Moreover, successful applications to several real world networks confirm the capability of the methods.

However, the vector space model based distance, such as cosine-like distance, will get a low precision and recall when the corpus contains many related topics. In this paper, we propose a new distance measure method: the Topic Model (TM) induced distance. Assuming that the distribution of word is different in each topic, the documents can be treated as a sample of the mixture of k topic models, which can be estimated using expectation maximization (EM). A biased initiation method is proposed in this paper for topic decomposition using ETA, which will generate a converged matrix for the generation of TM induced distance. The collections of web news are clustered into classes using this TM distance. A series of experiments are described on a corpus containing 5033 web news from 30 topics. K-means clustering is processed on test set with different topic numbers. A comparison of clustering result using the TM induced distance and the traditional cosine-like distance are given. The experiment results show that the proposed topic decomposition method using biased initiation is effective than the topic decomposition using random values. The TM induced distance will generate more topical groups than the VS model based cosine-like distance. In the web news collections containing related topics, the TM induced distance can achieve a better precision and recall.

Clustering is either carried out on the raw data or on functional data. In functional data analysis a curve is fit to each observation in order to account for time dependency. As gene expression over time is biologically a continuous process it can be represented by a continuous function. The different curve shapes found in a dataset can have important interpretations and characteristic patterns can be found by clustering the estimated regression coefficients. In this simulation study on artificial data the well-known K-Means algorithm as well as the quality-based cluster algorithm QT-Clust are applied to both the raw data as well as functional data. The performance of the different methods is evaluated when different types of noise are added to the data. All cluster algorithms used are implemented in R.

It aims at improving robustness and quality of clustering scheme, particularly in scenarios where either randomization or sampling is the part of the clustering algorithm. In this paper, we address the problem of instability and non robustness in K-means clusterings. These problems arise naturally because of random seed selection by the algorithm, order sensitivity of the algorithm and presence of noise and outliers in data. We propose a cluster ensemble method based on Discriminant Analysis to obtain robust clustering using K-means clusterer. The proposed algorithm operates in three phases. The first phase is preparatory in which multiple clustering schemes generated and the cluster correspondence is obtained. The second phase uses discriminant analysis and constructs a label matrix. In the final stage, consensus partition is generated and noise, if any, is segregated. Experimental analysis using standard public data sets provides strong empirical evidence of the high quality of resultant clustering scheme.

A personalized digital video broadcasting terrestrial (DVB-T) digital TV program recommendation system is ideal for providing TV program suggestions based on statistics results obtained from analyzing large-scale data. The frequency and duration of the programs that users have watched are collected and weighted by data mining techniques. A large dataset produces results that best represent a viewer's preferences of TV programs in a specific area. To process such a massive amount viewer preference data, the bottleneck of scalability and computing power must be removed. In this paper, an architecture for a TV program recommendation system based on cloud computing and a map-reduce framework, the map-reduce version of k-means and the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm, is introduced and applied. The proposed architecture provides a scalable and powerful backend to support the demand of large-scale data processing for a program recommendation system.

Our formulation resembles that of the K-means clustering model, but with a shared-neighbor similarity measure instead of the Euclidean distance. Unlike K-means and most other clustering heuristics that can only work with real-valued data and distance measures taken from specific families, GlobalRSC has the advantage that it can work with any distance measure, and any data representation. We also discuss various techniques for boosting the scalability of GlobalRSC.

We address the problem of integrative clustering of data with mixed type attributes. Most existing solutions suffer from one or both of the following drawbacks: Either they require input parameters which are difficult to estimate, or/and they do not adequately support mixed type attributes. Our technique INTEGRATE is a novel clustering approach that truly integrates the information provided by heterogeneous numerical and categorical attributes. Originating from information theory, the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle allows a unified view on numerical and categorical information and thus naturally balances the influence of both sources of information in clustering. Moreover, supported by the MDL principle, parameter-free clustering can be performed which enhances the usability of INTEGRATE on real world data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of INTEGRATE in exploiting numerical and categorical information for clustering. As an efficient iterative algorithm INTEGRATE is scalable to large data sets.

For such datasets, the traditional matrix model is no longer appropriate and may fail to capture relationships between features or fail to discover the underlying concepts that features represent. These datasets are better modeled using tensors, which are high-order generalizations of matrices. However, naive tensor algorithms suffer from poor efficiency and may fail to consider spatiotemporal neighborhood relationships in analysis. To surmount these difficulties, we propose TWave, a wavelet and tensor-based methodology for automatic summarization, classification, concept discovery, clustering, and compression of complex datasets. We also derive TWaveCluster, a novel high-order clustering approach based on WaveCluster, and compare our approach against WaveCluster and k-means. The efficiency of our method is competitive with WaveCluster and significantly outperforms k-means. TWave consistently outperformed competitors in both speed and accuracy on a 9.3 GB medical imaging dataset. Our results suggest that a combined wavelet and tensor approach such as TWave may be successfully employed in the analysis of complex high-order datasets.

Extremely high dimensional feature, space seriously degrades the efficiency and the effectiveness of video retrieval. In this paper, we exploit; the characteristics of document relevance and propose a statistical approach to learn an effective sub feature space from a multimedia document collection. This involves four steps: (1) density based feature term extraction, (2) factor analysis, (3) bi-clustering and (4) communality based component selection. Discrete feature terms are a set of feature clusters which smooth feature distribution in order to enhance the discrimination power; factor analysis tries to depict correlation between different feature dimensions in a loading matrix; hi-clustering groups both components and factors in the factor loading matrix and selects feature components from each bi-cluster according to the communality. We have conducted extensive comparative video retrieval experiments on the TRECVid 2006 collection. Significant performance improvements are shown over the baseline, PGA based K-mean clustering.

The architecture of the network is fully reflective of the structure encountered in the training data which are granulated with the aid of clustering techniques. More specifically, the output space is granulated with use of K-means clustering while the information granules in the multidimensional input space are formed by using a so-called context-based Fuzzy C-means which takes into account the structure being already formed in the output space. The GA-based design procedure being applied to each receptive fields of GRBFNN leads to the selection of preferred receptive fields with specific local characteristics (such as the number of context, the number of clusters for each context, and the input variables bar each context) available within the GRBFNN.

Because of the lower magnetic field (0.5T), the contrast of Open-MR images is very low. In this paper, we address the problem of liver segmentation from low-contrast Open-MR images. The proposed segmentation method consists of two steps. In the first step, we use K-means clustering and a priori knowledge to find and identify liver and non-liver index pixels, which are used as "object" and "background" seeds, respectively, for graph-cut. In the second step, a graph-cut based method is used to segment the liver from the low-contrast Open MR images. The main contribution of this paper is that the object (liver) and background (non-liver) seeds (regions) in every low-contrast slice of the volume can be obtained automatically by K-means clustering without user interaction.

In this paper, a new validity index for network partition is proposed, which is motivated by the construction of Xie-Beni index in Euclidean space. The simulated annealing strategy is used to minimize this extended validity index, associating with a dissimilarity-index-based k-means iterative procedure, under the framework of a random walker Markovian dynamics on the network. The proposed algorithm(SAEVI) can efficiently and automatically identify the community structure of the network and determine an appropriate number of communities without any prior knowledge about the community structure during the cooling process. The computational results on several artificial and real-world networks confirm the capability of the algorithm.

Genes which exhibit similar patterns are often functionally related. In this paper a novel bicluster detection method is proposed. It makes use of one of the existing traditional clustering algorithms such as K-means as an intermediate tool to do data clustering with the submatrices created from the original data matrix. Especially, in order to save the memory storage requirement, reduce the useless clustering processing and accelerate the bicluster detection speed, a clustering and verification combined algorithm is applied. The former helps to find out the row numbers where possible biclusters lie in, while the latter efficiently speed up the detection processing. Based on a characteristic of bicluster, the biclusters are detected one by one. At the end of the paper experiment with the simulated data are presented.

In this paper, we study hierarchical clustering of volumetric samples based on the similarity of their correlation relation. Samples are selected from a time-varying multivariate climate data set according to knowledge provided by the domain experts. We present three different hierarchical clustering methods based on quality threshold, k-means, and random walks, to investigate the correlation relation with varying levels of detail. In conjunction with qualitative clustering results integrated with volume rendering, we leverage parallel coordinates to show quantitative correlation information for a complete visualization. We also evaluate the three hierarchical clustering methods in terms of quality and performance.

Fuzzy Document Clustering Approach using Word Net Lexical Categories	ADVANCES TECHNIQUES IN COMPUTING SCIENCES AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Systems, Computing Sciences and Software Engineering	2008	Bridgeport, CT					Text mining refers generally to the process of extracting interesting information and knowledge from unstructured text. This area is growing rapidly mainly because of the strong need for analysing the huge and large amount of textual data that reside on internal file systems and the Web. Text document clustering provides an effective navigation mechanism to organize this large amount of data by grouping their documents into a small number of meaningful classes. In this paper we proposed a fuzzy text document clustering approach using Word Net lexical categories and Fuzzy c-Means algorithm. Some experiments are performed to compare efficiency of the proposed approach with the recently reported approaches. Experimental results show that Fuzzy clustering leads to great performance results. Fuzzy c-means algorithm overcomes other classical clustering algorithms like k-means and bisecting k-means in both clustering quality and running time efficiency.

We analyze existing pruning algorithms and experimentally show that there exists a new bottleneck in the performance due to the overhead while pruning candidate clusters for assignment of each uncertain object in each iteration. We further show that by considering squared Euclidean distance, UK-means (without pruning techniques) is reduced to K-means and performs much faster than pruning algorithms, however, with some discrepancies in the clustering results due to the different distance functions used. Thus, we propose Approximate UK-means to heuristically identify objects of boundary cases and re-assign them to better clusters. Our experimental results show that on average the execution time of Approximate UK-means is only 25% more than K-means and our approach reduces the discrepancies of K-means' clustering results by more than 70% at most.

For example, the number of clusters hidden in many datasets is usually not known a priori. This is an issue because many traditional clustering methods require such information as input. This paper examines a practical stochastic clustering method (PSCM) that has the ability to find clusters in datasets without requiring users to specify the centroids or the number of clusters. By comparing with traditional methods (k-means, self-organising map and hierarchical clustering methods), the performance of PSCM is found to be robust against overlapping clusters and clusters with uneven sizes. The proposed method also scales well with datasets having varying number of clusters and dimensions. Finally, our experimental results on real-world data confirm that the proposed method performs competitively against the traditional clustering methods in terms of clustering accuracy and efficiency.

Given a Bregman divergence D(phi) and a finite set P subset of R(d) of size n, our goal is to find a set C of size k such that the sum of errors cost(P, C) = Sigma(p epsilon P) min(c epsilon C) D(phi)(p, c) is minimized. The Bregman k-median problem plays an important role in many applications, e.g., information theory, statistics, text classification, and speech processing. We study a generalization of the kmeans(++) seeding of Arthur and Vassilvitskii (SODA '07). We prove for an almost arbitrary Bregman divergence that if the input set consists of k well separated clusters, then with probability 2(-O(k)) this seeding step alone finds an O(1)-approximate solution. Thereby, we generalize an earlier result of Ostrovsky et al. (FOGS '06) from the case of the Euclidean k-means problem to the Bregman k-median problem. Additionally, this result leads to a constant factor approximation algorithm for the Bregman k-median problem using at most 2(O(k))n arithmetic operations; including evaluations of Bregrnan divergence D(phi).

Recently, a unified view of co-clustering algorithms, called Bregman co-clustering (BCC), provides a general framework that even contains several existing co-clustering algorithms, thus we expect to have more applications of this framework to varied data types. However, the amount of data collected from real-life application domains easily grows too big to fit in the main memory of a single processor machine. Accordingly, enhancing the scalability of BCC can be a critical challenge in practice. To address this and eventually enhance its potential for rapid deployment to wider applications with larger data, we parallelize all the twelve co-clustering algorithms in the BCC framework using message passing interface (MPI). In addition, we validate their scalability on eleven synthetic datasets as well as one real-life dataset, where we demonstrate their speedup performance in terms of varied parameter settings.

Mostly in EEG signal preprocessing - it was used for artefacts removal (mostly blink artefacts). Our work aimed at ECG infarction data. We tried to find differences between components of normal and infarction data, based on features calculated from these components. Feature set was then passed to k-means clustering algorithm and resulting clusters were observed and analysed.

It concentrates on the clustering techniques inspired by various ant colonies and other nature concepts. The paper evaluates the use of the following nature inspired methods: Ant Colony inspired Clustering, Ant Colony inspired method for Decision Tree generation, Radial Basis Function Neural Networks with different learning algorithms and compare them to classical approaches, such as k-means and hierarchical clustering. The methods have been evaluated using the annotated MIT-BIH database. Use of the Dynamic Time Warping measure improved Sensitivity about 0.7 % and Specificity about 0.9 % when compared to classical feature extraction. The best-performing method is the agglomerative hierarchical clustering (Se=94.3, Sp=74.1), however it is practically unusable as it is memory and computational demanding. Acceptable results (complexity vs. error) have been obtained by the Ant-Colony inspired method for Decision tree generation (Se=93.1, Sp=72.8).

During development, bone undergoes changes in its composition and structure. In this study we apply three different cluster analysis algorithms [K-means (KM), fuzzy C-means (FCM) and hierarchical clustering (HCA)], and discriminant analysis (DA) on infrared spectroscopic data from developing cortical bone with the aim of comparing their ability to correctly classify the samples into different age groups. Cortical bone samples from the mid-diaphysis of the humerus of New Zealand white rabbits from three different maturation stages (newborn (NB), immature (11 days-1 month old), mature (3-6 months old)) were used. Three clusters were obtained by KM, FCM and HCA methods on different spectral regions (amide I, phosphate and carbonate). The newborn samples were well separated (71-100% correct classifications) from the other age groups by all bone components. The mature samples (3-6 months old) were well separated (100%) from those of other age groups by the carbonate spectral region, while by the phosphate and amide I regions some samples were assigned to another group (43-71% correct classifications). The greatest variance in the results for all algorithms was observed in the amide I region. In general, FCM clustering performed better than the other methods, and the overall error was lower. The discriminate analysis results showed that by combining the clustering results from all three spectral regions, the ability to predict the correct age group for all samples increased (from 29-86% to 77-91%). This study is the first to compare several clustering methods on infrared spectra of bone. Fuzzy C-means clustering performed best, and its ability to study the degree of memberships of samples to each cluster might be beneficial in future studies of medical diagnostics.

Imaging live cells grown on a three dimensional collagen matrix using Raman microspectroscopy	ANALYST			English	Article							BREAST EPITHELIAL-CELLS; SINGLE LIVING CELLS; IN-VITRO; MICRO-SPECTROSCOPY; CANCER BIOLOGY; CULTURE; KERATINOCYTES; ASSOCIATION; SUPPRESSION; DOXORUBICIN	Three dimensional collagen gels have been used as matrices for the imaging of live cells by Raman spectroscopy. The study is conducted on a human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) and a spontaneously immortalized human epithelial keratinocyte (HaCaT) cell line. The lateral resolution of the system has been estimated to be <1.5 mu m making it possible to access the subcellular organization. Using K-means clustering analysis, it is shown that the different subcellular compartments of individual cells can be indentified and differentiated. The biochemical specificity of the information contained in the Raman spectra allows the visualization of differences in the molecular signature of the different sub-cellular structures. Furthermore, to enhance the chemical information obtained from the spectra, principal component analysis has been employed, allowing the identification of spectral windows with a high variability. The comparison between the loadings calculated and spectra from pure biochemical compounds enables the correlation of the variations observed with the molecular content of the different cellular compartments.

METHODS: A 3-part postal questionnaire was sent to 206 physician anesthesiologists working in the state of Goias, in Central Western Brazil. Part I consisted of 4 questions describing respondents' characteristics: gender, time elapsed since completion of the residency program, and experience in providing sedation and general anesthesia for dental treatment. In Part 2, respondents were asked to give their opinions on 11 statements about sedation performed by dentists. Possible responses ranged from total disagreement to total agreement (minimum score = 11 and maximum score = 55). Part 3 was a section for general comments. Data were analyzed by k-means clusters, chi(2), and Student's t-test. RESULTS: The response rate was 53.8% (111 questionnaires). Most anesthesiologists (85.6%) had rarely or never provided sedation or general anesthesia for dental treatment, and 92.8% disagreed with the statement that dentists can administer moderate sedation in the dental office. Two clusters representing more favorable (n = 21) or less favorable (n = 90) opinions were established. Anesthesiologists in the "less favorable" group had more experience with dental sedation (P = 0.006) and dental general anesthesia (P = 0.008) than those in the "more favorable" group. Gender and time elapsed since residency completion did not significantly affect anesthesiologists' opinions. CONCLUSIONS: Many anesthesiologists in Central Western Brazil do not sedate dental patients and are not confident that dentists are able to do it. Dental sedation is an issue that still needs to be clarified in this region; the respective roles of physicians and dentists need to be determined to benefit the population.

J	Niknam, T; Amiri, B				Niknam, Taher; Amiri, Babak			An efficient hybrid approach based on PSO, ACO and k-means for cluster analysis	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Ant colony optimization (ACO); Data clustering; Hybrid evolutionary optimization algorithm; k-means clustering; Fuzzy adaptive particle swarm optimization (FAPSO)	ALGORITHM; PERFORMANCE	Clustering is a popular data analysis and data mining technique. A popular technique for clustering is based on k-means such that the data is partitioned into K clusters. However, the k-means algorithm highly depends on the initial state and converges to local optimum solution. This paper presents a new hybrid evolutionary algorithm to solve nonlinear partitional clustering problem. The proposed hybrid evolutionary algorithm is the combination of FAPSO ( fuzzy adaptive particle swarm optimization), ACO ( ant colony optimization) and k-means algorithms, called FAPSO-ACO-K, which can find better cluster partition. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through several benchmark data sets. The simulation results show that the performance of the proposed algorithm is better than other algorithms such as PSO, ACO, simulated annealing ( SA), combination of PSO and SA (PSO-SA), combination of ACO and SA (ACO-SA), combination of PSO and ACO (PSO-ACO), genetic algorithm (GA), Tabu search (TS), honey bee mating optimization (HBMO) and k-means for partitional clustering problem.

However, robustness analysis research has shown that conventional memory-based recommender systems are very susceptible to malicious profile-injection attacks. A number of attack models have been proposed and studied and recent work has suggested that model-based CF algorithms have greater robustness against these attacks. In this paper, we argue that the robustness observed in model-based algorithms is due to the fact that the proposed attacks have not targeted the specific vulnerabilities of these algorithms. We discuss how effective attacks targeting factor analysis CF algorithm and k-means CF algorithm that employ profile modeling can be designed. It transpires that the attack profiles employed in these attacks, exhibit better performance than the traditional attacks.

However, solutions obtained by it are strongly dependent on initialization of cluster centers. In the paper a novel genetic algorithm, called GAKMI (Genetic Algorithm for the K-Means Initialization), for the selection of initial cluster centers is proposed. Contrary to most of the approaches described in the literature, which encode coordinates of cluster centers directly in a chromosome, our method uses binary encoding. In this encoding bits set to one select elements of the learning set as initial cluster centers. Since in our approach not every binary chromosome encodes a feasible solution, we propose two repair algorithms to convert infeasible chromosomes into feasible ones. GAKMI was tested on three datasets, using varying number of clusters. The experimental results are encouraging.

Because of the high spatial and temporal dimensions of the video data, dimensionality reduction becomes imperative before performing Euclidean distance based clustering. In this paper, we present non-adaptive dimensionality reduction approaches using random projections on the video data. Assuming the data to be a realization from a mixture of Gaussian distributions allows for further reduction in dimensionality using random projections. The performance and computational complexity of the K-means and the K-hyperline clustering algorithms are evaluated with the reduced dimensional data. Results show that random projections with an assumption of Gaussian mixtures provides the smallest number of dimensions, which leads to very low computational complexity in clustering.

We propose an efficient color descriptor to complement the information obtained by a typical gradient-based local descriptor. Results show that color proves to be a useful cue to increase the segmentation accuracy, specially in large homogeneous regions. Then, we extend the Hierarchical K-Means codebook using the recently proposed Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors method. Finally, we show that the BoF method can be easily parallelized since it is applied locally, thus the time necessary to process an image is further reduced. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in the standard PASCAL 2007 Segmentation Challenge object segmentation dataset.

By this approach we have identified groups of users with a similar activity on e-learning platform and were able to observe their performance. The experiments presented in this paper were performed on the real data coming from Moodle platform. Comparing to the other research in this filed, that focus on the analysis of students, we investigated teachers' behaviour. We have proposed a smoothing model in the form of a dynamic system, that was used to transform the logged events into time series of activities. These series were later used to cluster teachers' performance and to divide them into three groups: active, moderate and passive users.

Through up to 10 000 protein spots may appear in inevitably noisy gel thus 2DE gel image comparison and analysis protocols usually involve the work of experts. In this paper we demonstrate how the problem of automation of 2DE gel image matching can be gradually solved by the use of artificial neural networks. We report on the development of feature set, built from various distance measures, selected and grounded by the application of self-organizing feature map and confirmed by expert decisions. We suggest and experimentally confirm the use of k-means clustering for the pre-classification of 2DE gel image into segments of interest that about twice speed-up the comparison procedure. We develop original Multilayer Perceptron based classifier for 2DE gel image matching that employs the selected feature set. By experimentation with the synthetic, semi-synthetic and natural 2DE images we show its superiority against the single distance metric based classifiers.

In this paper, we propose a novel method to locate scene text by combining color uniformity and high edge density together. We perform structural analysis of text strings which contain several characters in alignment. First, we calculate the edge image and then repaint the corresponding edge pixels in the original image by using a non-dominant color. Second, color reduction is performed by color histogram and K-means algorithms to segment the repainted image into color layers. Third, we perform edge detection and label the boundaries of both text characters and unexpected noises in each color layer. Each centroid is assigned a degree which is the number of overlap in the same position among color layers. Fourth, text line fitting among centroids with high degree is performed to cascade the character boundaries which belong to the same text string. The detected text string is presented by a rectangle region covering all character boundaries in its text line. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is able to locate text strings with arbitrary orientations. The performance of our algorithm is comparable with the state-of-art algorithms.

Cluster analysis of midlatitude oceanic cloud regimes: mean properties and temperature sensitivity	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							TROPICAL WESTERN PACIFIC; SURFACE OBSERVATIONS; NORTH PACIFIC; CLIMATE; MODEL; FEEDBACKS; ISCCP; VALIDATION; DEPENDENCE; WEATHER	Clouds play an important role in the climate system by reducing the amount of shortwave radiation reaching the surface and the amount of longwave radiation escaping to space. Accurate simulation of clouds in computer models remains elusive, however, pointing to a lack of understanding of the connection between large-scale dynamics and cloud properties. This study uses a k-means clustering algorithm to group 21 years of satellite cloud data over midlatitude oceans into seven clusters, and demonstrates that the cloud clusters are associated with distinct large-scale dynamical conditions. Three clusters correspond to low-level cloud regimes with different cloud fraction and cumuliform or stratiform characteristics, but all occur under large-scale descent and a relatively dry free troposphere. Three clusters correspond to vertically extensive cloud regimes with tops in the middle or upper troposphere, and they differ according to the strength of large-scale ascent and enhancement of tropospheric temperature and humidity. The final cluster is associated with a lower troposphere that is dry and an upper troposphere that is moist and experiencing weak ascent and horizontal moist advection. Since the present balance of reflection of shortwave and absorption of longwave radiation by clouds could change as the atmosphere warms from increasing anthropogenic greenhouse gases, we must also better understand how increasing temperature modifies cloud and radiative properties. We therefore undertake an observational analysis of how midlatitude oceanic clouds change with temperature when dynamical processes are held constant (i.e., partial derivative with respect to temperature). For each of the seven cloud regimes, we examine the difference in cloud and radiative properties between warm and cold subsets. To avoid misinterpreting a cloud response to large-scale dynamical forcing as a cloud response to temperature, we require horizontal and vertical temperature advection in the warm and cold subsets to have near-median values in three layers of the troposphere. Across all of the seven clusters, we find that cloud fraction is smaller and cloud optical thickness is mostly larger for the warm subset. Cloud-top pressure is higher for the three low-level cloud regimes and lower for the cirrus regime. The net upwelling radiation flux at the top of the atmosphere is larger for the warm subset in every cluster except cirrus, and larger when averaged over all clusters. This implies that the direct response of midlatitude oceanic clouds to increasing temperature acts as a negative feedback on the climate system. Note that the cloud response to atmospheric dynamical changes produced by global warming, which we do not consider in this study, may differ, and the total cloud feedback may be positive.	[Gordon, N.

Measuring and monitoring soil carbon is complex because carbon pools cycle and rates of carbon sequestration vary across the landscape due to climate, soil type, and management practices. A new methodology has been developed and applied to make an assessment of the distribution of total, organic, and inorganic carbon at a grains research and grazing property in northern New South Wales at a high spatial resolution. In this study, baseline soil carbon maps were created using fine resolution, geo-referenced, proximal sensor data. Coupled with a digital elevation model and secondary terrain attributes, all of the data layers were combined by k-means clustering to develop a stratified random soil sampling scheme for the survey area. Soil samples taken at 0.15-m increments to a depth of 1m were scanned with a mid-infrared spectrometer, which was calibrated using a proportion of the samples that were analysed in a laboratory for total carbon and inorganic carbon content. This combination of new methodologies and technologies has the potential to provide large volumes of reliable, fine resolution and timely data required to make baseline assessments, mapping, monitoring, and verification possible. This method has the potential to make soil carbon management and trading at the farm-scale possible by quantifying the carbon stock to a depth of 1m and at a high spatial resolution.

Based on an effective clustering algorithm called Affinity Propagation (AP) and a new defined similarity measure, we present a method for detecting activated brain regions. In the proposed method, autocovariance function values and the Euclidean distance metric of time series are firstly calculated and combined into a new similarity measure, then the AP algorithm with the measure is carried out on all time series of data, and at last regions with which their cross-correlation coefficients are greater than a threshold are taken as activations. Without setting the number of clusters in advance, our method is especially appropriate for the analysis of fMRI data collected with a periodic experimental paradigm. The validity of the proposed method is illustrated by experiments on a simulated dataset and a benchmark dataset.

The reference set ought to satisfy two conditions: a) the alternatives of the reference set should be familiar to the Decision Maker (DM) so as to express his/her preferences from a known situation; and b) the selected alternatives have to be representative of the total set, so that all the different points of view of the decision space to be taken into consideration. This paper presents a clustering technique that is embedded in the Multicriteria Decision Aid Systems MINORA and MIIDAS, which incorporates threshold of dissimilarity in order to support DMs or Decision Analysts (DAs) to select a representative reference set. This technique is compared with the most familiar multivariate data analysis clustering methods, such as k-means and hierarchical. Also, the technique is illustrated through a real world case study.

To come up with successful CRM strategies, various analyses are drawn on significant amount of data stored in massive databases about customers' characteristics and their buying behaviors. The aim of this study is to perform customer segmentation and profiling analysis for a company operating in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) market in Turkey by using data mining techniques so as to form a base for effective CRM activities focusing on its valuable customers which will result in increasing long term profitability and customer satisfaction. First, factor analysis is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the customer dataset. This set not only includes the traditional monetary, frequency and recency (RFM) variables but also contains other variables as suggested in the recent marketing literature. Segmentation is carried out by the nonhierarchical k-means clustering algorithm. Finally, customer profiles are obtained based on primarily variables that are not included in the k-means algorithm.

Analysis by GC (RI) and GC/MS allowed the identification of 54 essential oil components. The main compounds were beta-thujone and alpha-thujone, followed by 1,8-cineole, camphor, chrysanthenone, transsabinyl acetate, trans-pinocarveol, and borneol. Chemometric analysis (k-means clustering and PCA) led to the partitioning into three groups. The composition of two thirds of the samples was dominated by alpha-thujone or beta-thujone. Therefore, it could be expected that wild plants of A. herba-alba randomly harvested in the area of Kirchaou and transplanted by local farmers for the cultivation in arid zones of Southern Tunisia produce an essential oil belonging to the alpha-thujone/beta-thujone chemotype and containing also 1,8-cineole, camphor, and trans-sabinyl acetate at appreciable amounts.

Simple statistical approach for computing land cover types and potential natural vegetation	CLIMATE RESEARCH			English	Article						Land cover; Potential vegetation; Landuse change; Climate change; K-means clustering; Impacts	GEIGER CLIMATE CLASSIFICATION; GLOBAL VEGETATION; WORLD MAP; MODEL	The main objective of this study was to show the potential of a simple and computationally inexpensive statistical method for the computation of land cover types (LCTs) and potential natural vegetation (PNV), which can be easily adapted to any LCT scheme used by climate models. We propose a diagnostic model (Vegetation Reconstruction by Diagnostic Equilibrium, VERDE), which is based on the cluster analysis of high-resolution datasets of observed LCT distribution and of climate variables. We discuss the reliability of this statistical approach and show that VERDE can be applied for reconstructing PNV distribution in areas such as Europe, India, and China where original vegetation has been replaced by crops and urban areas. According to VERDE, the dominant PNV consists of broadleaf deciduous trees in Central Europe, mixed savanna and grassland in Eastern Europe at mid-latitudes, and evergreen needle trees in Russia. Large areas of India are covered by savanna, and of China by grassland, mixed forest, and evergreen broadleaf trees. VERDE was applied to 5 climate model scenarios (produced by HadCM3, GFDL-CM2.0, IPSL-CM4, CSIRO-MK3, and CNRM-CM3) to identify changes in potential vegetation at a global scale that would be induced by the projected climate change at the end of the 21st century. In the Northern Hemisphere, our results showed an increase in barren soils (deserts) in the areas from the tropics to the mid-latitudes, a northward shift of various types of forest, and a reduction in snow- or ice-covered land and in areas occupied by shrubs and bushes (tundra) at high latitudes. Changes were smaller in the Southern Hemisphere and suggest increases in savanna in South America and shrublands in Australia.

In this paper, we apply the discrete shock graph-based skeleton features to classify shapes into predefined groups, using a k-means clustering algorithm. The graph edit cost obtained by transforming database image graph into the respected query graph, will be used as distance function for the k-means clustering. To verify the performance of the suggested algorithm, we tested it on MPEG-7 dataset and our algorithm shows excellent performance for shape classification.

Because the choice of the suitable distance measure is a key issue for shape analysis, the Hartigan and Wong k-means algorithm is adapted for this situation. Simulations on controlled artificial data sets demonstrate that distances on the pre-shape spaces are more appropriate than the Euclidean distance on the tangent space. Finally, results are presented of an application to a real problem of oceanography, which in fact motivated the current work.	[Amaral, Getulio J.

J	Bang, S; Koo, JY; Jhun, M				Bang, Sungwan; Koo, Ja-Yong; Jhun, Myoungshic			Support Vector Machine Using k-Spatial Medians Clustering and Recovery Process	COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						Classification; k-means clustering; k-spatial medians clustering; Outlier; Recovery process; Support vector machine		Even though support vector machine has been successfully applied to various classification problems with its flexibility and high classification accuracy, it is not suitable for classification of large data sets because its computational complexity grows rapidly as the size of data set increases. SVM using k-means clustering (KM-SVM) is a fast algorithm which has been developed to accelerate both computation and prediction of SVM classifiers. However, it seems likely that the data set is contaminated by outliers in real-world situations, and k-means clustering is sensitive to these outliers. Therefore, we propose to combine k-spatial medians clustering with SVM (KS-SVM) since k-spatial medians clustering is robust for outliers. In order to improve the classification accuracy in KS-SVM, furthermore, a recovery process based on KS-SVM (RKS-SVM) is also proposed in this article. Experiments show that KS-SVM can improve the performance of KM-SVM in terms of classification accuracy and number of support vector. It is also shown that the classification accuracy of RKS-SVM is better than one of KS-SVM, but there is a tradeoff between classification accuracy and the number of support vectors.

If a few of points are attacked badly or lost, the performance of the watermarking scheme will decline or fail. In this paper, we present a robust image watermarking scheme by the use of k-means clustering, scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) which is invariant to rotation, scaling, translation, partial affine distortion and addition of noise. SIFT features are clustered into clusters by k-means clustering. Watermark message is embedded bit by bit in each cluster. Because one cluster contains only one watermark bit but one cluster contains many feature points, the robustness of watermarking is not lean upon individual feature point. We use twice voting strategy to keep the robustness of watermarking in watermark detecting process. Experimental results show that the scheme is robust against various geometric transformation and common image processing operations, including scaling, rotation, affine transforms, cropping, JPEG compression, image filtering, and so on.

There are many different clustering techniques having been proposed. Some conventional partitioning-based clustering methods, such as K-means, may fail if a set of incorrect parameters is chosen, or breakdown when the objects consist of non-spherical patterns. Although density-based approaches, e.g. DBSCAN and IDBSCAN, could deliver better results, they may increase time cost when using large data bases. In this investigation, a new clustering algorithm termed DenVOICE is provided to circumvent the problems stated above. As a hybrid technique that combines density-partitioning clustering concept, the proposed algorithm is capable of resulting in precise pattern recognition while decreasing time cost. Experiments illustrate that the new algorithm can recognize arbitrary patterns, and efficiently eliminate the problem of long computational time when employing large data bases. It also indicates that the proposed approach produces much smaller errors than K-means,. DBSCAN and IDBSCAN techniques in most the cases examined herein.

J	Porter, ML; Wildenschild, D				Porter, Mark L.; Wildenschild, Dorthe			Image analysis algorithms for estimating porous media multiphase flow variables from computed microtomography data: a validation study	COMPUTATIONAL GEOSCIENCES			English	Article						Multiphase flow; Porous media; Computed microtomography; Image analysis; Marching cubes	X-RAY MICROTOMOGRAPHY; ORGANIC IMMISCIBLE-LIQUID; AIR-WATER; TOMOGRAPHIC-IMAGES; INTERFACIAL AREA; MEDIUM SYSTEMS; SEGMENTATION; TRANSPORT; VISUALIZATION; MORPHOLOGY	Image analysis of three-dimensional microtomographic image data has become an integral component of pore scale investigations of multiphase flow through porous media. This study focuses on the validation of image analysis algorithms for identifying phases and estimating porosity, saturation, solid surface area, and interfacial area between fluid phases from gray-scale X-ray microtomographic image data. The data used in this study consisted of (1) a two-phase high precision bead pack from which porosity and solid surface area estimates were obtained and (2) three-phase cylindrical capillary tubes of three different radii, each containing an air-water interface, from which interfacial area was estimated. The image analysis algorithm employed here combines an anisotropic diffusion filter to remove noise from the original gray-scale image data, a k-means cluster analysis to obtain segmented data, and the construction of isosurfaces to estimate solid surface area and interfacial area. Our method was compared with laboratory measurements, as well as estimates obtained from a number of other image analysis algorithms presented in the literature. Porosity estimates for the two-phase bead pack were within 1.5% error of laboratory measurements and agreed well with estimates obtained using an indicator kriging segmentation algorithm. Additionally, our method estimated the solid surface area of the high precision beads within 10% of the laboratory measurements, whereas solid surface area estimates obtained from voxel counting and two-point correlation functions overestimated the surface area by 20-40%. Interfacial area estimates for the air-water menisci contained within the capillary tubes were obtained using our image analysis algorithm, and using other image analysis algorithms, including voxel counting, two-point correlation functions, and the porous media marching cubes. Our image analysis algorithm, and other algorithms based on marching cubes, resulted in errors ranging from 1% to 20% of the analytical interfacial area estimates, whereas voxel counting and two-point correlation functions overestimated the analytical interfacial area by 20-40%. In addition, the sensitivity of the image analysis algorithms on the resolution of the microtomographic image data was investigated, and the results indicated that there was little or no improvement in the comparison with laboratory estimates for the resolutions and conditions tested.

To accurately partition web social networks, we proposed a hierarchical clustering algorithm based on blockmodeling, called HCUBE, which employs structural equivalence to measure the similarity of web pages and reduce a large and incoherent network to a set of smaller comprehensible subnetworks. HCUBE uses the inter-connectivity as well as the closeness of clusters to group structurally equivalent pages in an effective fashion. Experiments conducted on real data show that HCUBE is effective at partitioning web social networks compared to the k-means based method.

Hence attention has to be given to some form of dimension reduction to represent the data in terms of a smaller number of variables. The latter are often chosen to be a linear combinations of the original variables (genes) called metagenes. One commonly used approach is principal component analysis (PGA), which can be implemented via a singular value decomposition (SVD). However, in the case of a high-dimensional matrix, SVD may be very expensive in terms of computational time. We propose to reduce the SVD task to the ordinary maximisation problem with an Euclidean norm which may be solved easily using gradient-based optimisation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach to the supervised classification of gene expression data.

The result illustrated that K-means has a better performance. As a result, K-means cluster was used to classify 24 canals of 344 records of surface water quality within Bangkok; the capital city of Thailand. The data was obtained from the Department of Drainage and Sewerage Bangkok Metropolitan Administration during 2005-2008. Water samples were collected and analyzed on 13 different parameters: temperature, pH value (pH), hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S), dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), substance solid (SS), total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), ammonia nitrogen (NH(3)N), nitrite nitrogen (NO(2)N), nitrate nitrogen (NO(3)N), total phosphorous (T-P) and total conform. The data were analyzed and clustered. The results of cluster analysis divided the canals into five clusters. The information from clustering could enhance the understanding of surface water usage in the area. Additionally, it can provide the useful information for better planning and watershed management of canals in Bangkok.

Discrete Dynamic System (DDS) model has been introduced in describing Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). However, delay effect was not taken into consideration within the model. A Time-delay DDS model composed of linear difference equations is developed to represent temporal interactions among significantly expressed genes. Interpolation and re-sampling are imposed to equalize the non-uniformity of sampling time points. Statistical significance plays an active role in obtaining the optimal interaction matrix of GRNs.

J	Binderup, AT; Arendt-Nielsen, L; Madeleine, P				Binderup, Asbjorn T.; Arendt-Nielsen, Lars; Madeleine, Pascal			Cluster analysis of pressure pain threshold maps from the trapezius muscle	COMPUTER METHODS IN BIOMECHANICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						pressure pain topography; muscle subdivisions dependency; K-means algorithm	SUBSTANCES; RESPONSES; EXERCISE; WORK	The aim of this study was to investigate and present a new mapping method to describe muscle pain sensitivity based on the assessment of pressure pain threshold (PPT) over the trapezius muscle. PPT data were recorded from 36 points in 20 healthy males using a standardised grid. Points were clustered using the K-means algorithm with a fixed initialisation procedure. The total number of clusters was determined on the basis of (1) R(2) evaluation of the clustering outcome compared against a desired 95% reduction in variance criterion and (2) the number of empty clusters. A minimum of three clusters were found which fulfilled the criteria. The proposed method enables the identification of a relation between the muscle subdivisions and pressure pain sensitivity within the trapezius. Further, the cluster analysis will enable the study of differences in pain sensitivity distributions between patients and controls and quantify the effect of intervention (physical or pharmacological treatments).

In this paper, we first describe a novel and efficient algorithm for simplifying Gaussian mixture models using a generalization of the celebrated k-means quantization algorithm tailored to relative entropy. Our method is shown to compare experimentally favourably well with the state-of-the-art both in terms of time and quality performances. Second, we propose a practical enhanced approach providing a hierarchical representation of the simplified GMM while automatically computing the optimal number of Gaussians in the simplified mixture. Application to clustering-based image segmentation is reported.

Segmentation is done in the ROB color space with a version of the fuzzy k-means method. The obtained posterior probabilities are then nonlinearly filtered with the novel version of the shape-preserving anisotropic diffusion. In effect more precise detection of object boundaries is possible. Thanks to this, the overall quality of the detection stage was increased, as it was confirmed by many experiments.

When visual data scale up (in terms of the dimensionality of features or/and the number of samples), most existing algorithms (e.g. k-means) become unfavorable due to the prohibitive time and space requirements. In this paper we propose the random locality sensitive vocabulary (RLSV) scheme towards efficient visual vocabulary construction in such scenarios. Integrating ideas from the Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and the Random Forest (RE), RLSV generates and aggregates multiple visual vocabularies based on random projections, without taking clustering or training efforts. This simple scheme demonstrates superior time and space efficiency over prior methods, in both theory and practice, while often achieving comparable or even better performances. Besides, extensions to supervised and kernelized vocabulary constructions are also discussed and experimented with.

Clusters are detected by moving all points to their cluster cores using shift vectors. First, we propose a novel scale selection criterion based on local density isotropy which determines the neighborhoods over which the shift vectors are computed. We then construct a directed graph induced by these shift vectors. Clustering is obtained by simulating random walks on this digraph. We also examine the spectral properties of a similarity matrix obtained from the directed graph to obtain a K-way partitioning of the data. Additionally, we use the eigenvector alignment algorithm of [1] to automatically determine the number of clusters in the dataset. We also compare our approach with supervised[2] and completely unsupervised spectral clustering[1], normalized cuts[3], K-Means, and adaptive bandwidth meanshift[4] on MNIST digits, USPS digits and UCI machine learning data.

The algorithm is unique in that it is applicable to high- or low-density irregular data sets, such as yield data. The algorithm is described and a brief example. presented using unprocessed sensor-derived grain yield data. A comparison between the segmentation algorithm and a common classification algorithm (k-means clustering) was done using an aerial normalised differences vegetation index (NDVI) image collected on a 200 ha vineyard in Olite, Southern Navarre, Spain. Classification was performed as a univariate (NDVI) analysis and a spatially constrained analysis. Segmentation and classification were run to find 2, 4, 6, ..., 24 levels and the effectiveness of the outputs determined by how well it explained the variance in vine trunk circumference, a correlated but independent measurement. The results obtained demonstrated that for a given number of manageable (effective) zones the segmentation outputs were equivalent or superior to the classification outputs for partitioning vine circumference variance. The segmentation output also generated more coherent management units that should facilitate differential management. The algorithm presented is a first generation segmentation algorithm and several aspects still need to be developed, in particular methods for eliminating edge effects and converting management zones into management (treatment) classes. The results of the segmentation algorithm presented here would indicate that with further development, segmentation might provide an alternative and possibly preferable approach to delineating management zones.

A hybrid approach for supplier cluster analysis	COMPUTERS & MATHEMATICS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Cluster analysis; K-means; Simulated anneal algorithm; Particle swarm optimization; Taguchi method	PARTICLE SWARM; K-MEANS; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; INTEGRATED MODEL; SELECTION; OPTIMIZATION; PRODUCTS; STRENGTH; DESIGN	To differentiate part suppliers effectively, this study proposed a hybrid approach based on K-means, simulated annealing algorithm (SA), convergence factor particle swarm optimization (CPSO), and the Taguchi method abbreviated as KSACPSO. After all parts suppliers are confirmed by the bill of material (BOM), supplier cluster analysis was conducted on characteristics of customers' demands, including product cost, product quality, and procurement time using the proposed approach. To prove the KSACPSO approach has good clustering performance, the case study of a notebook computer was adopted to carry out the clustering procedures on parts suppliers, and compare the differences between the proposed approach and other hybrid methods. The execution results were analyzed to prove that the efficiency of the suggested KSACPSO approach is superior to K-means, K-means simulated annealing (KSA), K-means genetic algorithm (KGA), K-means genetic simulated annealing (KGSA), and K-means convergence factor particle swarm optimization (KCPSO).

The use of different radial basis functions in RBFN has been reported in the literature. Here, we discuss the use of the q-Gaussian function as a radial basis function employed in RBFNs. An interesting property of the q-Gaussian function is that it can continuously and smoothly reproduce different radial basis functions, like the Gaussian, the Inverse Multiquadratic, and the Cauchy functions, by changing a real parameter q. In addition, we discuss the mixed use of different shapes of radial basis functions in only one RBFN. For this purpose, a Genetic Algorithm is employed to select the number of hidden neurons, width of each RBF, and q parameter of the q-Gaussian associated with each radial unit. Network training is the search for optimal values of the radius and the q-parameter of each radial basis Gaussian. The minimum and maximum numbers of basis function in the mid layer are defined a priori. The k-means clustering algorithm was employed to calculate each set of center positions of the q-Gaussians. In training stage with a multivariate signal with n variable, the network inputs are the n samples of each channel at once, except for the channel which part of the data is missing, which was used as desired output. Results from testing dataset were precise for good and moderate quality signals. However, if channel which part is missing is very noisy, the reconstruction, in general, was not so good. This fact could be explained by the artificial network training that is strongly dependent on the desired output channel, getting to learn with certain efficiency even when some of the inputs are noisy.

Our framework addresses the problems of assessing and utilizing data mining models in medical domain. The framework consists of three stages. The first stage involves preprocessing of the data to improve its quality. The second stage employs k-means clustering algorithm to cluster the data into k clusters (in our case, k=2 i.e. cluster / no, cluster1 / yes) for validation the class labels associated with the data. After clustering, the class labels associated with the data is compared with the labels generated by clustering algorithm if both the labels are same it is assumed that the data is correctly classified. The instances for which the labels are not same are considered to be misclassified and are removed before further processing. In the third stage support vector machine classification is applied. The classification model is validated by using k-fold cross validation method. The performance of SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier is also compared with Naive Bayes classifier. In our case SVM classifier outperforms the Naive Bayes classifier. To validate the proposed framework, experiments have been carried out on benchmark datasets such as Indian Pima diabetes dataset and Wisconsin breast cancer dataset (WBCD). These datasets were obtained from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. Our proposed study obtained classification accuracy on both datasets, which is better with respect to the other classification algorithms applied on the same datasets as cited in the literature. The performance of the proposed framework was also evaluated using the sensitivity and specificity measures.	[Patil, B. M.; Joshi, R.

Most of the statistical and data mining techniques require complete datasets and obviously these techniques do not provide accurate results with missing values. Several methods have been proposed to deal with the missing data. Commonly used method is to delete instances with missing value attribute. These approaches are suitable when there are few missing values. In case of large number of missing values, deleting these instances results in loss of bulk of information. Other method to cope-up with this problem is to complete their imputation (filling in missing attribute). We propose an efficient missing value imputation method based on clustering with weighted distance. We divide the data set into clusters based on user specified value K. Then find a complete valued neighbor which is nearest to the missing valued instance. Then we compute the missing value by taking the average of the centroid value and the centroidal distance of the neighbor. This value is used as impute value. In our proposed approach we use K-means technique with weighted distance and show that our approach results in better performance.

J	Boryczka, U				Boryczka, Urszula			Ant colony metaphor in a new clustering algorithm	CONTROL AND CYBERNETICS			English	Article						data mining; cluster analysis; ant clustering algorithm		Among the many bio-inspired techniques, ant clustering algorithms have received special attention, especially because they still require much investigation to improve performance, stability and other key features that would make such algorithms mature tools for data mining. Clustering with swarm-based algorithms is emerging as an alternative to more conventional clustering methods, such as k-means algorithm. This proposed approach mimics the clustering behavior observed in real ant colonies. As a case study, this paper focuses on the behavior of clustering procedures in this new approach. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a number of well-known benchmark data sets.

Much research has concentrated on hardware and some have focused on personalisation in terms of content visualisation. The focus of this paper is on mobile content personalisation, seeking to understand the user groups through clustering users based on their profile. This paper focuses on the implementation of a technique known as 'Zoning-Centroid', which is the evaluation technique used to determine the appropriate number of clusters required to best cluster the given users profile. The user profile used in this paper includes mobile content usage and their demographic factors. The clustering algorithm used in this paper is k-means clustering. The results show that the proposed technique could suggest appropriate number of clusters to be used with the k-values, in order to implement for mobile entertainment content personalisation.

Geochemistry and Mineralogy of Clays from the Algarve Basin, Portugal: A Multivariate Approach to Palaeoenvironmental Investigations	CURRENT ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Algarve Basin; Clays; Geochemistry; Mineralogy; Multivariate analysis; Palaeoenvironments		Lower Cretaceous and Triassic-Hettangian clays from the Algarve Basin ( South Portugal) were deposited in distinct environments during basin subsidence due to Pangea break up. The mineralogy, geochemistry and granulometry of 45 samples of both clay groups were studied, using X-ray diffraction, instrumental neutron activation analysis, X-ray fluorescence and laser diffractometry by attenuation of X-rays. Multivariate statistical techniques ( principal component analysis and K-means clustering), after scandium normalization of chemical contents, were used to study simultaneously all data, enabling to distinguish the different clay types by establishing the best discriminatory parameters: high contents ( in decreased order) of kaolinite, quartz, Chemical Index of Alteration ( CIA), Ti, goethite, Hf, Si, > 63 mu m fraction and Zr, characterize the group of clays from Cretaceous; while high contents of hematite, Mg, mobile elements (K, Cs and P), illite, Ca, phyllosilicates in general, Mn and dolomite, are associated to Triassic-Hettangian clays. This approach revealed useful to facilitate the integration of all data, as was possible to confront the geochemistry with the mineralogy, enabling the best palaeoenvironmental interpretations. In fact, the clay mineral assemblage is significantly influenced by the dominant weathering process and provides information on changes in aridity/humidity patterns.

Identifying a flower of interest or segmenting against the background is a difficult task. We proposed and developed a hybrid automatic flower boundary extraction method called IPSOAntK-means based on swarm intelligence techniques in this article. The method employs ant colony optimization, incremental particle swarm optimization (IPSO), and K-means algorithms and it is the first swarm-based technique in flower segmentation on color images. The parameters of the algorithm are tuned by iterated F-race and experiments are conducted over two different benchmark data sets: CAVIAR-Flower and Oxford 17 flowers data sets. In the CAVIAR-flower data set, IPSOAntK-means outperformed K-means with 96.4% accuracy on average over 600 colored flower images. Comparison results of the Oxford flower data set show that our method is one of the best flower segmentation methods in the literature.

A NOTE ON WEIGHTED FUZZY K-MEANS CLUSTERING FOR CONCEPT DECOMPOSITION	CYBERNETICS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						concept decomposition; fuzzy K-means clustering; latent semantic indexing; singular value decomposition	C-MEANS; ALGORITHMS; RETRIEVAL; MATRIX	While reducing the dimensionality of a corpus, concept decomposition (CD) based on fuzzy K-means (FKM) clustering provides better approximation than CD based on spherical k-means clustering. However, performance of the FKM algorithm is limited by its distance metric and it is proved that assignment of feature weights can improve the performance of FKM. Our work builds upon this analysis and proposes two approaches to feature weight selection. Using four testing document collections, we demonstrate that the CD based on the proposed feature-weighted FKM provides better approximation than the CD based on FKM while maintaining the quality of retrieval.

However, most of the proposed approaches are sensitive to outliers. This paper aims to deal with this problem in order to make a partition, obtained by using a Dynamic Curve Clustering Algorithm with free knots spline estimation, more robust. The approach is based on a leave-some-out strategy, which defines a rule on the distances distribution of the curves from the barycenters, in order to identify outliers regions. The method is validated by an application on real data.

The most widely used index to determine the optimal number of groups is the Calinski Harabasz index. As shown in this paper, the presence of atypical observations has a strong effect on this index and may lead to the determination of a wrong number of groups. Furthermore, in order to study the degree of belonging of each unit to each group it is standard practice to apply a fuzzy k-means algorithm. In this paper we tackle this problem using a robust and efficient approach based on a forward search algorithm. The method is applied on a data set containing performance evaluation indicators of Italian universities.

In this paper we put the focus on the quality of these alternative clusterings, proposing two approaches based in the use of negative constraints in conjunction with spectral clustering techniques. The first approach tries to introduce these constraints in the core of the constrained normalised cut clustering, while the second one combines spectral clustering and soft constrained k-means. The experiments performed in textual collections showed that the first method does not yield good results, whereas the second one attains large increments on the quality of the results of the clustering while keeping low similarity with the avoided grouping.

This paper studies online forums hotspot detection and forecast using sentiment analysis and text mining approaches. First, we create an algorithm to automatically analyze the emotional polarity of a text and to obtain a value for each piece of text. Second, this algorithm is combined with K-means clustering and support vector machine (SVM) to develop unsupervised text mining approach. We use the proposed text mining approach to group the forums into various clusters. with the center of each representing a hotspot forum within the current time span. The data sets used in our empirical studies are acquired and formatted from Sina sports forums, which spans a range of 31 different topic forums and 220,053 posts. Experimental results demonstrate that SVM forecasting achieves highly consistent results with K-means clustering. The top 10 hotspot forums listed by SVM forecasting resembles 80% of K-means clustering results. Both SVM and K-means achieve the same results for the top 4 hotspot forums of the year.

A highly advanced bill classification technique, which distinguishes whether a bill is a reusable bill specifying the level of fatigue, is greatly required in order to comb out these problematic bills. Therefore, a purpose of this paper is to suggest a classification method of fatigue bills based on K-means with bill image data. The effectiveness of this approach is verified by the bill discriminant experimentation.

The method evolves a population of trees for a fixed number of rounds or generations and applies a clustering algorithm to the population, in a way that in the selection process of trees their structure is taken into account. The proposed method, named DistClustGP, runs in a parallel environment, according to the model master-slave, so that it can evolve simultaneously different populations, and evolve together the best individuals from each cluster. DistClustGP favors the analysis of the parameters involved in the genetic process, decreases the number of generations necessary to obtain satisfactory results through evolution of different populations, due to its parallel nature, and allows the evolution of the best individuals taking into account their structure.

Health data mining involving clustering for large complex data sets in such cases is often limited by insufficient key indicative variables. When a conventional clustering technique is then applied, the results may be too imprecise, or may be inappropriately clustered according to expectations. This paper suggests an approach which can offer greater range of choice for generating potential clusters of interest, from which a better outcome might in turn be obtained by aggregating the results. An example use case based on health services utilization characterization according to socio-demographic background is discussed and the blended clustering approach being taken for it is described.

J	Asadzadeh, S		Michel, U; Civco, DL		Asadzadeh, Saeid			Statistical convex partitioning for endmember extraction	EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING-GIS APPLICATIONS	Proceedings of SPIE-The International Society for Optical Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing - GIS Applications	SEP 21-23, 2010	Toulouse, FRANCE	SPIE		endmember extraction; convex partitioning; K-mean clustering; hyperspectral; PPI; SMACC; dimensionality reduction; mineral map	HYPERSPECTRAL DATA; N-FINDR; ALGORITHM; IMPLEMENTATION; IMAGERY	Endmember extraction is the process of selecting a collection of pure signature spectra of the materials present in a hyperspectral scene. Most of the spectral-based endmember extraction methods relay on the ability to discriminate between pixels based on their spectral characteristics and the assumption that pure pixels exist in the image. In some cases, though pure pixels are available inside image, spectral complexity of the image (e. g. low spectral contrast) makes it difficult to extract the best endmember candidates from hyperspectral imagery. This paper investigates the use of statistical convex partitioning (SCP) as a preprocessing tool for endmember extraction. The SCP method comprises three main steps: 1) partitioning input hyperspectral data set into partitions or so called convex regions using K-mean clustering algorithm; 2) finding the best candidate endmembers for each convex region; and, 3) comparing and listing of candidate endmembers extracted from each partition in order of spectral similarity. In order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method, the sequential maximum angle convex cone (SMACC) algorithm was used to extract endmembers of each partition and the results were compared to pixel purity index (PPI). Optimum number of convex regions as well as the impact of different dimensionality reduction transforms, principal component analysis (PCA), minimum noise fraction (MNF), and independent component analysis (ICA) were also investigated. Experimental results on both simulated and real AVIRIS hyperspectral image indicate that SCP is an effective method to preprocess hyperspectral data spectrally and extract low contrast and similar endmembers effectively.

Firstly, using the principal component analysis, the comprehensive credit score of each sample is obtained. Secondly, the kernel density estimation method is applied to analyze the comprehensive credit score series, and then the initial cluster centers are determined according to the local maximum points of density function. Finally, using K-means clustering algorithm, the final cluster centers are obtained, and the credit grades are divided. Thus, the credit rating for enterprises is realized. Through a specific example, it is proved that the model proposed by this paper is feasible and effective.

The objective is to determine automatically a set of user queries to define a set of must-link or cannot-link constraints. Some works on active constraint learning have already been proposed but they are mainly applied to K-Means like clustering algorithms which are known to be limited to spherical clusters, while we are interested in clusters of arbitrary sizes and shapes. The novelty of our approach relies on the use of a k-nearest neighbor graph to determine candidate constraints coupled with a new constraint utility function. Comparative experiments conducted on real datasets from machine learning repository show that our approach significantly improves the results of constraints based clustering algorithms.

It segments young-adult consumers by their decision-making styles and determines the differences among segments relative to their decision-making styles. The empirical analysis is based on data obtained from consumer survey. The data were analyzed using Cronbach alpha coefficients, exploratory factor analysis and k-means cluster analysis. Research results confirmed eight-factor model. Two homogeneous segments of consumers were identified: Economic consumers and Recreational consumers. Significant gender differences were found on four factors of consumer-decision making styles (brand consciousness, novelty-fashion consciousness, recreational-hedonistic consumer and habitual, brand-loyal consumer). Marketing strategies should be tailored to the specific characteristics of consumers in the Republic of Macedonia.

PEC-GMR technique is applied to solve the detection of cracks in multi-layered structures, in particular, the aircraft wing structure with rivets. In current techniques, time-dependent, (A scan) signals are processed for feature extraction. In this paper, for rivet inspection, the rivet image data is processed as a whole. In the C-scan image analysis, principle component analysis (PCA) is applied to transform the C-scan image into the PCs (principle components) subspace to extract appropriate features. The extracted features are used as input to a k-means classifier for detection of cracks in the 2nd and 3rd layers at rivet sites in multi-layered riveted samples.

J	Kovacevic, A; Devedzic, V; Pocajt, V				Kovacevic, Ana; Devedzic, Vladan; Pocajt, Viktor			Using data mining to improve digital library services	ELECTRONIC LIBRARY			English	Article						Digital libraries; Databases; Serbia; Data handling; Service delivery	RECOMMENDATION	Purpose This paper aims to propose a solution for recommending digital library services based on data mining techniques (clustering and predictive classification). Design/methodology/approach - Data mining techniques are used to recommend digital library services based on the user's profile and search history. First, similar users were clustered together, based on their profiles and search behavior. Then predictive classification for recommending appropriate services to them was used. It has been shown that users in the same cluster have a high probability of accepting similar services or their patterns. Findings - The results indicate that k-means clustering and Naive Bayes classification may be used to improve the accuracy of service recommendation. The overall accuracy is satisfying, while average accuracy depends on the specific service. The results were better for frequently occurring services. Research limitations/implications - Datasets were used from the KOBSON digital library. Only clustering and predictive classification was applied. If the correlation between the service and the institution were higher, it would have better accuracy. Originality/value - The paper applied different and efficient data mining techniques for clustering digital library users based on their profiles and their search behavior, i.e. users' interaction with library services, and obtain user patterns with respect to the library services they use. A digital library may apply this approach to offer appropriate services to new users more easily. The recommendations will be based on library items that similar users have already found useful.

The system exploits a priori knowledge about the type of object being sketched. In particular, we assume that the class of object being drawn is known, e.g., a rocket ship, and that the object will be drawn using a fixed number of known components. By using these assumptions, we show that we can build a sketch-based modeling system that, while object specific, is capable of quickly creating geometric models that are beyond the scope of current sketch-based modeling approaches. Key to our approach is the use of a K-means classifier for labeling each drawn stroke as being a particular component in the generic model. We demonstrate our approach by applying this classifier to face and rocket sketches.

Specially, we attend to the challenges of defining some measures to detect the dynamicity of a shot and video and extracting appropriate keyframes that assure the purity of video summary. We derive some efficient measures to compute the dynamicity of video shots using QR-decomposition, and we utilize it in detecting the number of keyframes that must be selected from each shot. Also, we derive a theorem that illustrates an important property of QR-decomposition. We utilize it in order to summarize video shots with low redundancy. The proposed algorithm is implemented and evaluated on TRECVID 2006 benchmark platform. Compared with other algorithms, our results are among the best.

This work proposes a sound source number and directions estimation method under a multisource reverberant environment. An eigenstructure-based generalized cross-correlation method is proposed to estimate time delay among microphones. A source is considered as a candidate if the corresponding time delay combination among microphones gives reasonable sound speed estimation. Under reverberation, some candidates might be spurious but their direction estimations are not consistent for consecutive data frames. Therefore, an adaptive K-means++ algorithm is proposed to cluster the accumulated results from the sound speed selection mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm in a real room.

Two research issues, namely, motion representation and subspace learning, are addressed. In order to have a rich motion descriptor, we propose to combine the distance signal and the width feature so that a silhouette can be characterized in more detail. These two features provide complementary information and are integrated to yield a better discriminative power. The combined features are subsequently quantized into mid-level features using k-means clustering. In the mid-level feature space, we apply the Nonparametric Weighted Feature Extraction (NWFE) to construct a compact yet discriminative subspace model. Finally, we can simply train a Bayes classifier for recognizing human actions. We have conducted a series of experiments on two publicly available datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system. Compared with the existing approaches, our system has a significantly reduced complexity in classification stage while maintaining high accuracy.

Existing methods are usually designed to segment fingerprint images originated from a certain sensor. Thus their performances are significantly affected when dealing with fingerprints collected by different sensors. This work studies the sensor interoperability of fingerprint segmentation algorithms, which refers to the algorithm's ability to adapt to the raw fingerprints obtained from different sensors. We empirically analyze the sensor interoperability problem, and effectively address the issue by proposing a k-means based segmentation method called SKI. SKI clusters foreground and background blocks of a fingerprint image based on the k-means algorithm, where a fingerprint block is represented by a 3-dimensional feature vector consisting of block-wise coherence, mean, and variance (abbreviated as CMV). SKI also employs morphological postprocessing to achieve favorable segmentation results. We perform SKI on each fingerprint to ensure sensor interoperability. The interoperability and robustness of our method are validated by experiments performed on a number of fingerprint databases which are obtained from various sensors.

The aim of this study was to identify the effect of the starting score-line, game location, and quality of opposition on basketball game quarter final score. The sample comprised 504 game quarters from the Spanish Basketball Professional League and these were classified as balanced (difference in scores equal of 8 points or less, n=194) and unbalanced (difference in scores of more than 8 points, n=310) using k-means cluster procedures. The effects of the predictor variables on game quarter outcome (difference between points scored and points received) in the whole game and in the second, third, and fourth game quarters were analysed using linear regression analysis. The starting game quarter score-line was only significant in unbalanced situations with very similar effects among different game quarters. The greater the difference in accumulated score at the beginning of each quarter, the more points recovered by the teams who were losing. A small effect from the quality of the opponent was found in the second and third quarters, whereas game location only had an effect when analysing the whole game and second quarter using balanced and unbalanced game quarters combined.

In a test set of 800 viruses we found more than 350 potential overlapping open reading frames of >500 bp which generate BLAST hits, indicating a possible biological function. Interestingly, five overlaps with more than 2000 bp were found, the largest may even contain triple overlaps. In order to perform the vast amount of BLAST searches required to test all detected open reading frames, we compared two clustering strategies (BLASTCLUST and k-means) and queried the database with one representative only. Our results show that this approach achieves a significant speed-up while retaining a high quality of the results (>99% precision compared to single queries) for both clustering methods. Future wet lab experiments are needed to show whether the detected overlapping reading frames are biologically functional.

The classical "port-based" and "payload-based" approaches to traffic classification have several shortcomings. These limitations have motivated the study of classification techniques that build on the foundations of learning theory and statistics. The current paper presents a new statistical classifier that allows real time classification of encrypted data. Our method is based on a hybrid combination of the k-means and k-nearest neighbor (or k-NN) geometrical classifiers. The proposed classifier is both fast and accurate, as implied by our feasibility tests, which included implementing and intergrading statistical classification into a realtime embedded environment. The experimental results indicate that our classifier is extremely robust to encryption.

G-means is a clustering algorithm based on k-means, used to find the number of Gaussian distributions and their centers inside a multi-dimensional dataset. It is normally used for data mining applications, and its execution can be divided into 6 execution steps. This paper analyzes each step to select which of them could be improved. In the implementation, the algorithm was modified to use the specific SIMD instructions of the Cell processor and to introduce parallel computing using the CellSs framework to handle the SPU tasks. The hardware used was an IBM BladeCenter QS22 containing two PowerXCell processors. The results show the execution of the algorithm 60% faster as compared with the non-improved code.

Unsupervised grouping of industrial textile dyes using K-means algorithm and optical fibre spectroscopy	FOURTH EUROPEAN WORKSHOP ON OPTICAL FIBRE SENSORS	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Fourth European Workshop on Optical Fibre Sensors	SEP 08-10, 2010	Porto, PORTUGAL	INSEC Porto, Univ Porto, SPIE		Optical Fibre Sensor; Absorption spectroscopy; Textile dyes; Principal Component Analysis; K-means clustering		A method for the unsupervised clustering of optically thick textile dyes based on their spectral properties is demonstrated in this paper. The system utilizes optical fibre sensor techniques in the Ultraviolet-Visible-Near Infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) to evaluate the absorption spectrum and thus the colour of textile dyes. A multivariate method is first applied to calculate the optimum dilution factor needed to reduce the high absorbance of the dye samples. Then, the grouping algorithm used combines Principal Component Analysis (PCA), for data compression, and K-means for unsupervised clustering of the different dyes. The feasibility of the proposed method for textile applications is also discussed in the paper.

K-means clustering technique was introduced to divide the original 84 compounds into a training set of 76 compounds and an external test set of 8 compounds, which is helpful for statistically robust QSPR model developments. The PLS model using the combination of electronic, physicochemical, quantum and topological descriptors predicted the skin permeability coefficient (k(p)) with the cross validation Q(2) of 0.878 and the square of predictive correlation coefficient R(Fed)(2) of 0.892. The result models showed that dipole moment (Dipole), melting point (Mp), Xu index (Xu), Harary index (Har) and logK(ow) had great influence on the skin permeation of organic chemicals.

Meanwhile, through comparing the dates available in the new algorithm model with the one in the traditional model, the result showed that the new one has more advantages. Finally, we predict the cluster center required from the last month by using the historical date, the results are very satisfactory. This new model is good at predicting short-swing trading stock price and has practical value, which can provide some advices for people who are interested in short-swing trading investment.

The framework uses GP at two levels. At the top level GP evolves ways of splitting the fitness cases into subsets. At the lower level GP evolves programs that solve the fitness cases in each subset. The top level GP programs include two components. Each component receives a training case as the input. The components' outputs act as coordinates to project training examples onto a 2-D Euclidean space. When an individual is evaluated, K-means clustering is applied to group the fitness cases of the problem. The number of clusters is decided based on the density of the projected samples. Each cluster then invokes an independent GP run to solve its member fitness cases. The fitness of the lower level GP individuals is evaluated as usual. The fitness of the high-level GP individuals is a combination of the fitness of the best evolved programs in each of the lower level GP runs. The proposed framework has been tested on several symbolic regression problems and has been seen to significantly outperforming standard GP systems.

GP evolves programs with multiple components. One component analyses statistical features extracted from the raw byte-series to divide the data into blocks. These blocks are then analysed via another component to obtain a signature for each file in a training set. These signatures are then projected onto a two-dimensional Euclidean space via two further (evolved) program components. K-means clustering is applied to group similar signatures. Each cluster is then labelled according to the dominant label for its members. Once a program that achieves good classification is evolved it can be used on unseen data without requiring any further evolution. Experimental results show that GP compares very well with established file classification algorithms (i.e., Neural Networks, Bayes Networks and J48 Decision Trees).

Grozdenovic-Varga (2010): Tomato (L. esculentum Mill.) genotypes variability of fruit traits. - Genetika, Vol 42, No. 3, 397-406. Tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum Mill.) is vegetable which could be produced and consumed in a many different ways, due to its variability, made by breeding programs. Variability of analyzed genotypes was determinated for further fruit traits: average mass, fruit shape, locules number and dry matter content. Variability source structure was determinated using principal components analysis (PCA). Three main components, which explain 94,2 % of total variability, were chosen for further analysis. The biggest part of the first main component has fruit shape and locule number. The second component is determinated by dry matter content, and the third by the fruit mass. For more precisely perception of homology and divergence between analyzed genotypes, nonhierarchical grouping analysis (k-means) was performed, and genotypes were divided into three groups. Divergency was determinated for fruit mass and locule number, while for index shape and dry matter contetent analyzed genotypes are homologous. The aim of this study is to examine tomato genotypes variability for fruit traits.

The K-means algorithm is well known for its simplicity and low time complexity. However, the algorithm has three main drawbacks: dependency on the initial centroids, dependency on the number of clusters, and degeneracy. Our solution accommodates these three issues, by proposing an approach to automatically detect a semi-optimal number of clusters according to the statistical nature of the data. As a side effect; the method also makes choices of the initial centroid-seeds not critical to the clustering results. The experimental results show the robustness of the Y-means algorithm as well as its good performance against a set of other well known unsupervised clustering techniques. Furthermore, we study the performance of our proposed solution against different distance and outlier-detection functions and recommend the best combinations.

Hybrid Approach for Automatic Evaluation of Emotion Elicitation Oriented to People with Intellectual Disabilities	HYBRID ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS, PT 1	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems	JUN 23-25, 2010	San Sebastian, SPAIN		Univ Pais Vasco	Automatic Evaluation; Human Emotion Management System; Human Emotion Elicitation; Machine Learning	RECOGNITION	People with intellectual disabilities and elderly need physical and intellectual support to ensuring independent living. This is one of the main issues in applying Information and Communication Technology (ICT) into Assistive Technology field. In this sense the development of appropriated Intelligent Systems (ISs) offers new perspectives to this community. In our project a new IS system (LAGUNTXO) which adds user affective information oriented to people with intellectual disabilities has been developed. The system integrates a Human Emotion Analysis System (HEAS) which attempts to solve critical situations for this community as block stages. In the development of the HEAS one of the critical issues was to create appropriated databases to train the system due to the difficulty to simulate pre-block stages in laboratory. Finally a films and real sequences based emotion elicitation database was created. The elicitation material was categorized with more actual features based on discrete emotions and dimensional terms (pleasant, unpleasant). Classically the evaluation is carried out by a specialist (psychologist). In this work we present a hybrid approach for Automatic Evaluation of Emotion Elicitation databases based on Machine Learning classifiers and K-means clustering. The new categorization and the automatic evaluation show a high level of accuracy with respect to others methodologies presented in the literature.			raquel.martinez@ehu.es; karmele.ipina@ehu.es; eloy.irigoyen@ehu.es; nagore.asla@ehu.es	Lopez-de-Ipina, Karmele/K-4379-2013; Irigoyen, Eloy/K-7785-2014	Lopez-de-Ipina, Karmele/0000-0003-0742-0932; Irigoyen, Eloy/0000-0002-9119-1652			Canamero L, 2005, NEURAL NETWORKS, V18, P445, DOI 10.1016/j.neunet.2005.03.003; Conde A., 2010, PAAMS 2010 SMC IEEE; Cowie R, 2005, NEURAL NETWORKS, V18, P371, DOI 10.1016/j.neunet.2005.03.002; Ezeiza A., 2008, P INT C ETH HUM VAL, P75; Fragopanagos N, 2005, NEURAL NETWORKS, V18, P389, DOI 10.1016/j.neunet.2005.03.006; GRANA M, 1986, EUR J OPER RES, V25, P20, DOI 10.1016/0377-2217(86)90110-4; GROSS JJ, 1995, COGNITION EMOTION, V9, P87, DOI 10.1080/02699939508408966; Ray R.

On the Design of a CADS for Shoulder Pain Pathology	HYBRID ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS, PT 1	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems	JUN 23-25, 2010	San Sebastian, SPAIN		Univ Pais Vasco	Musculoskeletal disorders; Shoulder Pain; Computer-Aided Decision Support system; Machine Learning	PRIMARY-CARE; DIAGNOSIS	A musculoskeletal disorder is a condition of the musculoskeletal system, which consists in part of it being injured continuously over time. Shoulder disorders are one of the most common musculoskeletal cases attended in primary health care services. Shoulder disorders cause pain and limit the ability to perform many routine activities, affecting about 15-25 % of the general population. Several clinical tests have been described to aid diagnosis of shoulder disorders. However, the current literature acknowledges a lack of concordance in clinical assessment, even among musculoskeletal specialists. We are working on the design of a Computer-Aided Decision Support (CADS) system for Shoulder Pain Pathology. The paper presents the results of our efforts to build a CADS system testing several classical classification paradigms, feature reduction methods (PCA) and K-means unsupervised clustering. The small database size imposes the use of robust covariance matrix estimation methods to improve the system performance. Finally, the system was evaluated by a medical specialist.

Research on production scheduling under uncertainty has recently received much attention. Although various approaches have been developed for scheduling under uncertainty, this problem is still difficult to tackle by any single approach, because of its inherent difficulties. This chapter describes a decomposition-based approach (DBA) for makespan minimisation of a flexible flow shop (FFS) scheduling problem with stochastic processing times. The DBA decomposes an FFS into several machine clusters which can be solved more easily by different approaches. A neighbouring K-means clustering algorithm is developed to firstly group the machines of an FFS into an appropriate number of machine clusters, based on a weighted cluster validity index. A back propagation network (BPN) is then adopted to assign either the Shortest Processing Time (SPT) Algorithm or the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to generate a sub-schedule for each machine cluster. After machine grouping and approach assignment, an overall schedule is generated by integrating the sub-schedules of the machine clusters. Computation results reveal that the DBA is superior to SPT and GA alone for FFS scheduling under stochastic processing times, and that it can be easily adapted to schedule FFS under other uncertainties.

The purpose of this real-time model analysis is to first detect the density and flow characteristics of urban population mobility according to the phone location data and then to dynamically monitor the real-time state and density of road traffic and urban population with low cost, all-weather detection capability and so on. The experimental study shows that better results can be achieved using our improved K-means clustering algorithm. We believe that such a model is helpful to the automatic detection of population density and road traffic.

Multivariate analysis is able to supplement the disadvantages of traditional method. Among methods of multivariate analysis, Principal component analysis (PCA) and Factor analysis (FA) have enjoyed widespread popularity. Though both of them are to reduce the dimensions of variances in the sample, there are differences between PCA and FA worth further investigation. The purpose of the paper is to demonstrate the differences between PCA and FA by analyzing the multivariate anthropometric data. K-means cluster analysis was developed to divide samples into groups with homogenous characteristics according to the PCA scores (or FA scores). ANOVA (analysis of variance) was adopted to compare the dimensions in corresponding clusters between PCA and FA. For all the dimensions, the p-value equals to 0.000, indicating there is significant difference for the samples between PCA and FA at the significance level of 0.005. Finally, the regression models of the reference dimensions based on the key dimensions, i.e., stature and waist girth, were investigated for the ease of utilization the FA (or PCA) results into applications such as building a family of digital manikin. In conclusion, the techniques have similarities and differences, and should not be abused. PCA analyzes all variance of the data set, while FA analyzes only common variances. A priori decision on the techniques depends on the domain expertise, and the statistic characteristics of the sample.

As more information is involved in the algorithm, and the distance measure is more flexible, the better the results. The selected algorithms for this work are the K-means, the FCM, the GK-B, and the GKPFCM. The GKPFCM gives the better results when all the algorithms are applied to the segmentation of two images, an image of bananas and the other one of tomates at different stages of ripeness in both cases. The results are interesting as it is possible to identify the objects, to determine the degree of ripeness, and to estimate the amount and proportion of ripe objects for a possible decision-making.

J	Mahata, P				Mahata, Pritha			Exploratory Consensus of Hierarchical Clusterings for Melanoma and Breast Cancer	IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						Consensus clustering; melanoma; breast cancer	GENE-EXPRESSION PATTERNS; MOLECULAR CLASSIFICATION; N-TREES; PARTITIONS; PROFILES	Finding subtypes of heterogeneous diseases is the biggest challenge in the area of biology. Often, clustering is used to provide a hypothesis for the subtypes of a heterogeneous disease. However, there are usually discrepancies between the clusterings produced by different algorithms. This work introduces a simple method which provides the most consistent clusters across three different clustering algorithms for a melanoma and a breast cancer data set. The method is validated by showing that the Silhouette, Dunne's and Davies-Bouldin's cluster validation indices are better for the proposed algorithm than those obtained by k-means and another consensus clustering algorithm. The hypotheses of the consensus clusters on both the data sets are corroborated by clear genetic markers and 100 percent classification accuracy. In Bittner et al.'s melanoma data set, a previously hypothesized primary cluster is recognized as the largest consensus cluster and a new partition of this cluster into two subclusters is proposed. In van't Veer et al.'s breast cancer data set, previously proposed "basal" and "luminal A" subtypes are clearly recognized as the two predominant clusters. Furthermore, a new hypothesis is provided about the existence of two subgroups within the "basal" subtype in this data set. The clusters of van't Veer's data set is also validated by high classification accuracy obtained in the data set of van de Vijver et al.

Detection of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis in Ziehl-Neelsen Stained Tissue Images using Zernike Moments and Hybrid Multilayered Perceptron Network	IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN AND CYBERNETICS (SMC 2010)	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	OCT 10-13, 2010	Istanbul, TURKEY	IEEE		tuberculosis; tissue section; Zernike moment; hybrid multilayered perceptron network	SHAPE	Conventional clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis disease such as manual screening by microbiologist are tedious, laborious and time consuming. Therefore, more research has been carried out to develop technologies that able to automate the detection process. This paper presents an automated approach to tuberculosis bacilli detection in tissue section. The proposed approach employs image processing technique and neural network for the segmentation and detection of tuberculosis bacilli. First, images of tuberculosis bacilli in tissue samples are captured using light microscope after stained with Ziehl-Neelsen staining method. Then colour image segmentation using moving k-mean clustering is used to extract tuberculosis bacilli from the tissue image. Two colour spaces, RGB and C-Y colour, were utilised in order to improve the quality of segmentation and robust against various staining condition. Next, geometrical features of Zernike moments are calculated. From these features, the best features that could detect tuberculosis bacilli with higher accuracy were selected using hybrid multilayered perceptron network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is efficient and accurate to detect the tubercle bacilli in tissue.	[Osman, M.

T his transformation is generally not invertible and it is impossible to reconstruct the original color information from a yielded monochrome image. In this paper, we propose an invertible color-to-monochrome transform method obtaining the monochrome image which contains the color information and enables us to reconstruct a color image. In the proposed method, colors in an input image are clustered by k-means-based algorithm with a lightness constraint, and the output monochrome image is obtained using the clustering result.

Basically, the system has three modules: pre-processing, feature extraction and selection, and classification of the information. Gait frequency, spectral envelope, cepstral and mel-cepstral analysis and loudness compose the set of parameters used to identify subjects in the smart building. In order to select features, the Fisher's criterion was used. For the classification task, K-Means and K-NN algorithms were performed along with different methodologies for test and validation. Moreover, the best sets were gathered, increasing the accuracy of classification. Several experiments were performed with 15 subjects wearing 6 different footwear. The classification rates were in the range from 33.5% to 97.5%.

Motion Segmentation and 3D Positioning of Multiple Mobile Robots Using an Array of Static Cameras in an Intelligent Space	IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS (ISIE 2010)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics (ISIE 2010)	JUL 04-07, 2010	Bari, ITALY	IEEE, IEEE Ind Elect Soc, IEEE Control Syst Soc, Soc Instrument & Control Engineers				This paper presents a method for obtaining the motion segmentation and 3D localization of multiple mobile robots in an intelligent space. Motion segmentation and positioning are obtained from the images acquired using an array of calibrated and synchronized cameras, without previous knowledge about the number of mobile robots. These cameras are placed in fixed positions within the environment (intelligent space). The proposed algorithm does not rely on previous knowledge or invasive landmarks on board the robots. The proposal presented in this work is based on the minimization of an objective function that includes information from all the cameras. This function depends on three groups of variables: the segmentation boundaries, the 3D rigid motion parameters (linear and angular velocity components) and the depth (distance to the cameras). Before the minimization, it is necessary to initialize the segmentation boundaries and the depth. The use of an extended version of the k-means algorithm allows obtaining a good estimation of the number of robots in the scene during the initialization process. For the objective function minimization, we use a greedy iterative algorithm.

We propose two algorithms, one for the estimation of the masks which are to be applied to the mixture in the TF domain for the separation of signals in the frequency domain, and the other for solving the permutation problem. The algorithm for mask estimation is based on the concept of angles in complex vector space. Unlike the previously reported methods, the algorithm does not require any estimation of the mixing matrix or the source positions for mask estimation. The algorithm clusters the mixture samples in the TF domain based on the Hermitian angle between the sample vector and a reference vector using the well known k-means or fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms. The membership functions so obtained from the clustering algorithms are directly used as the masks. The algorithm for solving the permutation problem clusters the estimated masks by using k-means clustering of small groups of nearby masks with overlap.

Our application transforms remotely sensed topographic data gathered by orbiting satellites into semantically meaningful maps of landforms; such maps are valuable research tools for planetary science. As topographic data become increasingly available, the ability to derive geomorphic maps efficiently is becoming essential. In our proposed framework, the mapping is achieved by means of scene segmentation followed by supervised classification of segments. The two mapping steps use different sets of features derived from digital elevation models of planetary surfaces; selection of appropriate features is discussed. Using a particular set of terrain attributes relevant to annotating cratered terrain on Mars, we investigate the design choices for both segmentation and classification components. The segmentation assessment includes K-means-based agglomerative segmentation and watershed-based segmentation. The classification assessment includes three supervised learning algorithms: Naive Bayes, Bagging with decision trees, and support-vector machines (SVMs); segments are classified into the following landforms: crater floors, crater walls (concave and convex), ridges (concave and convex), and intercrater plains. The method is applied to six test sites on Mars. The analysis of the results shows that a combination of K-means-based agglomerative segmentation and either SVM with a quadratic kernel or Bagging with C4.5 yields best maps. The presented framework can be adopted to generate geomorphic maps of sites on Earth.

Bayesian Classifiers Programmed in SQL	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Classification; K-means; query optimization		The Bayesian classifier is a fundamental classification technique. In this work, we focus on programming Bayesian classifiers in SQL. We introduce two classifiers: Naive Bayes and a classifier based on class decomposition using K-means clustering. We consider two complementary tasks: model computation and scoring a data set. We study several layouts for tables and several indexing alternatives. We analyze how to transform equations into efficient SQL queries and introduce several query optimizations. We conduct experiments with real and synthetic data sets to evaluate classification accuracy, query optimizations, and scalability. Our Bayesian classifier is more accurate than Naive Bayes and decision trees. Distance computation is significantly accelerated with horizontal layout for tables, denormalization, and pivoting. We also compare Naive Bayes implementations in SQL and C++: SQL is about four times slower. Our Bayesian classifier in SQL achieves high classification accuracy, can efficiently analyze large data sets, and has linear scalability.

Due to real-time requirements and computational-cost constraints in embedded systems, it is necessary to accelerate K-Means algorithm by hardware implementations in SoC environments, where the bandwidth of the system bus is strictly limited. In this paper, a bandwidth adaptive hardware architecture of K-Means clustering is proposed. Experiments show that the proposed hardware can be used in applications such as image segmentation, and it has the maximum clock speed 400-MHz and 440-K gate count with TSMC 90-nm technology. Moreover, the throughput of the proposed hardware reaches 16 dimension/cycle, and it can deal with feature vectors with different dimensions using five parallel modes to utilize the input bandwidth efficiently.

To apply this improved K-method. we set the number of groups for the process to two (K=2) in the three dimensional R, G, B color space. We then improved the R, G, B color value of all of the pixels by moving the current R, G, B color value of each pixel to calculated center values, which reduced the ringing artifacts. The results were verified by calculating the overshoot and the slope of the light luminance around the edges of test images that had been processed by the new algorithm. We then compared the calculated results with the overshoot and slope of the light luminance of the unprocessed image.

Measuring the scar in myocardium is important to cardiologists to assess the viability of the heart. Delayed enhancement (DE) images are acquired after about 10 minutes following injecting the patient with contrast agent so the infracted region appears brighter than its surroundings. A common method to segment the infarction from DE images is based on intensity Thresholding. This technique performed poorly for detecting small infarcts in noisy images. In this work we aim to identify the best threshold value to segment the infarction in case of segmentation using simple Threshold and propose a modified technique to improve the segmentation in noisy images. Our proposed technique is based on enhancing Thresholding using k-means clustering. We test our proposed model using computer simulated and real images with different contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). We used F-score, which is a combined measure of the precision and sensitivity, to determine the performance of the proposed technique versus simple Thresholding. The results show that the proposed technique outperforms existing methods.			mohamed.ali@nileuniversity.edu.eg; nelgayar@nileuniversity.edu.eg; nosman@nileuniversity.edu.eg					BEITZEL SM, 2006, UNDERSTANDING CLASSI; BERNHARD K, 2006, INVEST RADIOL, V41, P661; DOUBLIER C, 2003, BIOMEDSIM, V3, P151; DUDA RO, 1973, PATTERN CLASSIFICATI, P526; Gonzalez R.C., 2002, DIGITAL IMAGE PROCES, P147; HOOD M, 2009, OVERVIEW DELAYED MYO; Hsu LY, 2006, J MAGN RESON IMAGING, V23, P298, DOI 10.1002/jmri.20496; Kolipaka A, 2005, INT J CARDIOVAS IMAG, V21, P303, DOI 10.1007/s10554-004-5806-z; MARINA S, 2006, AUSTR C ART INT; Pham DL, 2000, ANNU REV BIOMED ENG, V2, P315, DOI 10.1146/annurev.bioeng.2.1.315; Sievers B, 2008, RADIOLOGY, V247, P106, DOI 10.1148/radiol.2471070132; Sijbers J., 1998, P INT C SIGN PROC CO, P140; ZUMEL N, 2009, STAT ENGLIGH TRANS 1	13	1	1	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743		978-3-642-13774-7	LECT NOTES COMPUT SC			2010	6112		II				108	119				12	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BQA02	WOS:000280464400012

Segmentation of Very High Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery of Urban Areas Using Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm	IMAGE ANALYSIS AND RECOGNITION, PT I, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Image Analysis and Recognition	JUN 21-23, 2010	Povoa de Varzim, PORTUGAL	Assoc Image & Machine Intelligence, Univ Porto, Fac Engn, Dept Elet & Comp Engn, Inst Engenhar Boiomed, PAMI		Swarm Intelligence; Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO); Remote Sensing; Aerial Images; and Clustering-Based Segmentation		As the improvement of the resolution of aerial and satellite remote sensed images, the semantic richness of the image increases which makes image analysis more difficult. Dense urban environment sensed by very high-resolution (VHR) optical sensors is even more challenging. Occlusions and shadows due to buildings and trees hide some objects of the scene. Fast and efficient segmentation of such noisy images (which is essential for their further analysis) has remained a challenging problem for years. It is difficult for traditional methods to deal with such noisy and large volume data. Clustering-based segmentation with swarm-based algorithms is emerging as an alternative to more conventional clustering methods, such as hierarchical clustering and k-means. In this paper, we introduce the use of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) clustering algorithm segmenting high resolution remote sensing images. Contrary to the localized searching of the K-means algorithm, the PSO clustering algorithm performs a globalized search in the entire solution space. We applied the PSO and K-means clustering algorithm on thirty images cropped from color aerial images. The results illustrate that PSO algorithm can generate more compact clustering results than the K-means algorithm.

This method is able to find nonlinear boundaries to the change detection problem by exploiting a kernel-based clustering algorithm. The kernel k-means algorithm is used in order to cluster the two groups of pixels belonging to the 'change' and 'no change' classes (binary mapping). In this paper, we provide an effective way to solve the two main challenges of such approaches: i) the initialization of the clustering scheme and ii) a way to estimate the kernel function hyperparameter(s) without an explicit training set. The former is solved by initializing the algorithm on the basis of the Spectral Change Vector (SCV) magnitude and the latter is optimized by minimizing a cost function inspired by the geometrical properties of the clustering algorithm. Experiments on VHR optimal imagery prove the consistency of the proposed approach.

In this paper, the technique of the feature generation is carried out by integrating genetic programming and the expectation maximization algorithm with the fitness of the mean square error measure (GP-EM-MSE) in order to improve the overall performance of a hand-based biometric system. The GP program trees of the approach are utilized to find optimal generated feature representations in a nonlinear fashion; derived from EM, the learning task results in the simple k-means problem that reveals better convergence properties. As a subsequent refinement of the identification, GP-EM-MSE exhibits an improved capability which achieves a recognition rate of 96% accuracy by using the generated features, better than the performance obtained by the selected primitive features.

A hybrid and adaptive segmentation method using color and texture information	IMAGE PROCESSING: MACHINE VISION APPLICATIONS III	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Image Processing - Machine Vision Applications III	JAN 19-21, 2010	San Jose, CA	Soc Imaging Sci & Technol (IS&T), SPIE		image segmentation; adaptive combination; color; texture; mathematical morphology		This paper presents a new image segmentation method based on the combination of texture and color informations. The method first computes the morphological color and texture gradients. The color gradient is analyzed taking into account the different color spaces. The texture gradient is computed using the luminance component of the HSL color space. The texture gradient procedure is achieved using a morphological filter and a granulometric and local energy analysis. To overcome the limitations of a linear/barycentric combination, the two morphological gradients are then mixed using a gradient component fusion strategy (to fuse the three components of the color gradient and the unique component of the texture gradient) and an adaptive technique to choose the weighting coefficients. The segmentation process is finally performed by applying the watershed technique using different type of germ images. The segmentation method is evaluated in different object classification applications using the k-means algorithm. The obtained results are compared with other known segmentation methods. The evaluation analysis shows that the proposed method gives better results, especially with hard image acquisition conditions.

Scene classification with respect to image quality measurements	IMAGE QUALITY AND SYSTEM PERFORMANCE VII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Image Quality and System Performance VII	JAN 18-19, 2010	San Jose, CA	SPIE, IS & T (Soc Imaging Sci & Technol)		scene dependency (scene susceptibility) of image quality; scene classification; scene descriptors (image analysis tools)		Psychophysical image quality assessments have shown that subjective quality depended upon the pictorial content of the test images. This study is concerned with the nature of scene dependency, which causes problems in modeling and predicting image quality. This paper focuses on scene classification to resolve this issue and used K-means clustering to classify test scenes. The aim was to classify thirty two original test scenes that were previously used in a psychophysical investigation conducted by the authors, according to their susceptibility to sharpness and noisiness. The objective scene classification involved: 1) investigation of various scene descriptors, derived to describe properties that influence image quality, and 2) investigation of the degree of correlation between scene descriptors and scene susceptibility parameters. Scene descriptors that correlated with scene susceptibility in sharpness and in noisiness are assumed to be useful in the objective scene classification. The work successfully derived three groups of scenes. The findings indicate that there is a potential for tackling the problem of sharpness and noisiness scene susceptibility when modeling image quality. In addition, more extensive investigations of scene descriptors would be required at global and local image levels in order to achieve sufficient accuracy of objective scene classification.

Clustering analysis prioritization of automobile logistics services	INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS			English	Article						Automotive industry; Distribution channels and markets; Channel relationships; Cluster analysis	CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT; PROVIDER CEO PERSPECTIVE; MARKET-SEGMENTATION; 3RD-PARTY LOGISTICS; K-MEANS; INDUSTRY; PERFORMANCE; INTEGRATION; BUSINESS; OUTCOMES	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a clustering approach to segment supply chain partners in the automobile industry and prioritize services offered by third party logistics service (3PL) providers. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 98 automobile and auto-parts manufacturers are surveyed to identify service needs, preferences, and outsourcing commitments. By applying a two-stage clustering approach combined with Ward's minimum-variance method and the K-means algorithm, the logistics companies prioritize their services to better satisfy groups of customers with specific preferences. Findings - Four distinctive groups of manufacturers are identified using the two-stage clustering approach. The clusters separate logistic preferences and outsourcing patterns of after market parts suppliers, original equipment service parts suppliers, original equipment manufacturer parts suppliers, and tier one car makers. The paper finds that distribution and delivery services hold the highest percentage of services outsourced among the manufacturers. Originality/value - This paper models logistic services as customizable services and develops a data system methodology to define the profiles of automobile manufacturers and their preferred logistic services. Through the analysis of service preferences and clustering, the paper identifies the key logistic services that can be customized for members of the automobile supply chain. A case is provided which demonstrates how a logistics company can provide customized service designs for specific target markets and customers.

This paper presents the approach to generate the multistage multidimensional scenario tree out of a set of scenario fans. For this purpose, the multistage K-means clustering algorithm is developed. The presented scenario tree generation algorithm is motivated by the stability results for optimal values of a multistage stochastic program. The time complexity of developed multistage K-means clustering algorithm is proved to be linear in regard to the number of scenarios in the fan. The algorithm to determine the branches with nonduplicate information in the multistage scenario tree is also presented as an intermediate result of research.

But both the approximation quality and stability depend on the distribution of the center set. Many methods have been constructed to select optimal center sets for radial basis function interpolation. A review of these methods is given. Four kinds of center choosing algorithms which are thinning algorithm, greedy algorithm, arclength equipartition like algorithm and k-means clustering algorithm are introduced with some algorithmic analysis.

Abstracting audit data is a potential solution to improve the efficiency of data processing. In this work, we propose two strategies of data abstraction in order to build a lightweight detection model. The first strategy is exemplar extraction and the second is attribute abstraction. Two clustering algorithms, Affinity Propagation (AP) as well as traditional k-means, are employed to extract the exemplars, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is employed to abstract important attributes (a.k.a. features) from the audit data. Real HTTP traffic data collected in our institute as well as KDD 1999 data are used to validate the two strategies of data abstraction. The extensive test results show that the process of exemplar extraction significantly improves the detection efficiency and has a better detection performance than PCA in data abstraction.

At first, a color texture image has been decomposed three sub-bands that R (red), G (green), B (blue) channel. Second, each sub-bands channel has been decomposed by discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to the same resolution. Third, fusion operation is performed on the transformed images according to PCA-based (Principal Component Analysis) weighted average rule to choose the reconstructed coefficients. Then all the decomposed sub-bands images are reconstructed using inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT) that becoming a fusion image. Finally, k-means cluster segmentation algorithm has been applied for this fusion image, the segmentation results has been obtained.

An information cell mixture model on domain Omega is actually a set of weighted information cells L(i)s, where each information cell L(i) has a transparent cognitive structure 'L(i) = about P(i)' which is mathematically formalized by a 3-tuple < P(i), d(i), delta(i)> comprising a prototype set P(i)(subset of Omega), a distance function d(i) on Omega and a density function delta(i) on [0, + infinity). A positive neighborhood function of the information cell mixture model is introduced in this paper to reflect the belief distribution of positive neighbors of the underlying concept. An information cellularization algorithm is also proposed to learn the information cell mixture model from training data set, which is a direct application of k-means and EM algorithms. This novel transparent cognitive structure of vague concept provides a powerful tool for information coarsening and concept modelling, and has potential application in uncertain reasoning and classification.

Efficient Privacy Preserving K-Means Clustering	INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	Pacific Asia Workshop on Intelligence and Security Informatics	JUN 21, 2010	Hyderabad, INDIA	IEEE		K-Means; Privacy; Security; Secret Sharing		This paper introduces an efficient privacy-preserving protocol for distributed K-means clustering over an arbitrary partitioned data, shared among N parties. Clustering is one of the fundamental algorithms used in the field of data mining. Advances in data acquisition methodologies have resulted in collection and storage of vast quantities of user's personal data. For mutual benefit, organizations tend to share their data for analytical purposes, thus raising privacy concerns for the users. Over the years, numerous attempts have been made to introduce privacy and security at the expense of massive additional communication costs. The approaches suggested in the literature make use of the cryptographic protocols such as Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) and/or homomorphic encryption schemes like Paillier's encryption. Methods using such schemes have proven communication overheads. And in practice are found to be slower by a factor of more than 10(6). In light of the practical limitations posed by privacy using the traditional approaches, we explore a paradigm shift to side-step the expensive protocols of SMC. In this work, we use the paradigm of secret sharing, which allows the data to be divided into multiple shares and processed separately at different servers. Using the paradigm of secret sharing, allows us to design a provably-secure, cloud computing based solution which has negligible communication overhead compared to SMC and is hence over a million times faster than similar SMC based protocols.

Implementing the clustering and classification algorithms upon an ordinary computer will not be efficient, since this shows limitations as regards the computational ability and available memory. Within this paper, an algorithm of clustering the huge volumes of data on a hybrid HPC cluster, is proposed. This cluster has a RoadRunner architecture. It includes 48 QS22 blade servers, each of them having 2 PowerXCell 8i processors. The algorithm proposed within the present paper will carry out the clustering of a number of documents, by using a parallel version of the k-means algorithm, implemented upon the RoadRunner hybrid architecture.

The best known approach to our knowledge is HOT SAX technique based on the equiprobable distribution of SAX representations of time series. This characteristic, however, is not preserved in the reduced-dimensionality literature, especially on the lack of Gaussian distribution datasets. In this paper, we introduce a k-means based algorithm for symbolic representations of time series called adaptive Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (aSAX) and propose HOT aSAX algorithm for time series discords discovery. Due to the clustered characteristic of aSAX words, our algorithm produces greater pruning power than the previous approach. Our empirical experiments with real-world time series datasets confirm the theoretical analyses as well as the efficiency of our approach.

In order to avoid vicious competition so that transportation market is disturbed, multi-objective and nonlinear programming model is built up, which is based on the maximization of unity of traveler. The objective of model is minimization of distance between practical capacity coefficient and ideal capacity coefficient. Multi-objective is transferred into single objective by TOPSIS method before model is solved. The transformed objective function is multi-peak function, so niche GA is introduced into solving the problem to obtain all of optimal solution. K-means clustering is adapted to classify the set of optimal solution. The centre of gravity of each cluster is taken as value of decision variables. At last a numeric example demonstrates the validity and feasibility.

The object is adaptively divided using fuzzy k-means clustering algorithm, and the sub-regions are weighted with monotone decreasing kernel function. The object model is updated through mean value of sub-regions' colors, so the calculation is simple. During the object tracking, the method of integral matching is used; combining with the adaptive Kalman filter, the object tracking under occlusion is resolved effectively. The experiments show that the new algorithm can track the object exactly.

Firstly, we hierarchically divide images into sub regions and construct the spatial visual vocabulary by grouping the low-level features collected from every corresponding spatial sub region into a specified number of clusters using k-means algorithm. To recognize the category of a scene, the visual vocabulary distributions of all spatial sub regions are concatenated to form a global feature vector. The classification is obtained using LIBSVM, a support vector machine classifier. Our goal is to find a universal framework which is applicable to various types of features, so two kinds of features are used in the experiments: "V1-like" filters and PACT features. In almost all experimental cases, the proposed model achieves superior results. Source codes are available by email.

Here the unsupervised part of the RBF is taken care of by K-means clustering. The new network is named as differential evolution trained radial basis function (DERBF) network. The efficacy of DERBF is tested on bank bankruptcy datasets viz. Spanish banks, Turkish banks, US banks and UK banks as well as benchmark datasets such as iris, wine and Wisconsin breast cancer. The performance of DERBF is compared with that of differential evolution trained wavelet neural networks (DEWNN) (Chauhan et al., 2009), threshold accepting trained wavelet neural network (TAWNN) (Vinaykumar et al., 2008) and wavelet neural network with respect to the criterion area under receiver operating characteristic curve. The results showed that DERBF is very good at generalisation in the ten-fold cross validation for all datasets.

In this paper, we apply differential evolution to the problem of extracting the optimal colours of a colour map for quantised images. The choice of entries in the colour map is crucial for the resulting image quality as it forms a look-up table that is used for all pixels in the image. We show that differential evolution can be effectively employed as a method for deriving the entries in the map. In order to optimise the image quality, our differential evolution approach is combined with a local search method that is guaranteed to find the local optimal colour map. This hybrid approach is shown to outperform various commonly used colour quantisation algorithms on a set of standard images.

Quantisation is often useful before statistical analysis and modelling of large discrete network models from observations of multiple continuous random variables. The quantisation algorithm is applied to genomic features including the recombination rate distribution across the chromosomes and the non-coding transposable element LINE-I in the human genome. The association pattern is studied between the recombination rate, obtained by quantisation at genomic locations around LINE-1 elements, and the length groups of LINE-I elements, also obtained by quantisation on LINE-I length. The exact and density-preserving quantisation approach provides an alternative superior to the inexact and distance-based univariate iterative k-means clustering algorithm for discretisation.

Because of the fixed size, these approaches often deliver a number of similar motifs simply shifted by some bases or including mismatches. To confront the mismatched motifs problem, we use the super-rule concept to construct a Super-Rule-Tree (SRT) by a modified Hybrid Hierarchical K-means (HHK) clustering algorithm, which requires no parameter set-up to identify the similarities and dissimilarities between the motifs. By analysing the motif results generated by our approach, they are significant not only in sequence area but also in secondary structure similarity.

Optimizing Cluster Heads for Energy Efficiency in Large-Scale Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article							ALGORITHMS	Many complex sensor network applications require deploying a large number of inexpensive and small sensors in a vast geographical region to achieve quality through quantity. Hierarchical clustering is generally considered as an efficient and scalable way to facilitate the management and operation of such large-scale networks and minimize the total energy consumption for prolonged lifetime. Judicious selection of cluster heads for data integration and communication is critical to the success of applications based on hierarchical sensor networks organized as layered clusters. We investigate the problem of selecting sensor nodes in a predeployed sensor network to be the cluster heads to minimize the total energy needed for data gathering. We rigorously derive an analytical formula to optimize the number of cluster heads in sensor networks under uniform node distribution, and propose a Distance-based Crowdedness Clustering algorithm to determine the cluster heads in sensor networks under general node distribution. The results from an extensive set of experiments on a large number of simulated sensor networks illustrate the performance superiority of the proposed solution over the clustering schemes based on k-means algorithm.

The method is implemented first by classifying every location into morphometric classes based on the mathematical shape of a locally fitted quadratic surface and its positional relationship with the analysis window. Single-scale fuzzy terrain indices of peakness, pitness, passness, ridgeness, and valleyness are then calculated based on the distance of the analysis location from the ideal cases. These can then be combined into multi-scale terrain indices to summarise terrain information across different operational scales. The algorithm has four characteristics: (1) the ideal cases of different geomorphometric features are simply and clearly defined; (2) the output is spatially continuous to reflect the inherent fuzziness of geomorphometric features; (3) the output is easily combined into a multi-scale index across a range of operational scales; and (4) the standard general morphometric parameters are quantified as the first and second order derivatives of the quadratic surface. An additional benefit of the quadratic surface is the derivation of the R 2 goodness of fit statistic, which allows an assessment of both the reliability of the results and the complexity of the terrain. An application of the method using a test DEM indicates that the single- and multi-scale terrain indices perform well when characterising the different geomorphometric features.

J	Sharot, T				Sharot, Trevor			Applications of simulated annealing in market research	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MARKET RESEARCH			English	Article								Simulated annealing (SA) is a statistical optimisation method with a wide variety of applications. The best known of these is the travelling salesman problem in operations research: a salesman has to visit a number of clients in different towns in a single trip in which order should he make the calls to minimise the total distance travelled? With more than a small number of towns, the number of permutations is too large to permit an exhaustive search, so some method is required to find the optimum without excessive computation. Simulated annealing provides a practical solution to this and many other combinatorial problems. It works by starting with any non-optimal arrangement and making a series of incremental changes to arrive at the optimal, or a near-optimal, solution. In the case of the travelling salesman problem, each change would consist of exchanging two towns in the itinerary. If this reduces the total distance, then the exchange is confirmed; but it is also beneficial to accept some exchanges that increase total distance, since this permits a wider range of permutations to be explored. Despite its many successful applications, it seems that simulated annealing has not yet been applied within market research other than the developments reported here. This paper presents three applications of SA in market research. The first is in the design of matched subsamples, where sample elements are swapped between the subsamples to achieve optimum balance. The second is for choosing new members to recruit to panels, by swapping potential recruits on and off the list. The third is as a new method for performing cluster analysis, by swapping elements between clusters. In this application, simulated annealing provides insights into the properties of the popular k-means method.

J	Melendez-Pastor, I; Navarro-Pedreno, J; Koch, M; Gomez, I				Melendez-Pastor, Ignacio; Navarro-Pedreno, Jose; Koch, Magaly; Gomez, Ignacio			Multi-resolution and temporal characterization of land-use classes in a Mediterranean wetland with land-cover fractions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							RADIOMETRIC CALIBRATION; ACCURACY ASSESSMENT; MULTISPECTRAL DATA; SATELLITE IMAGERY; AREA ESTIMATION; MIXING MODEL; CLASSIFICATION; VEGETATION; DEGRADATION; INDEXES	Four different methods for analysing land-use and land-cover fractions at multiple scales, namely composite operator, t-test, Dutilleul's modified t-test and ternary diagrams of physical models for process pathways, were applied to sets of multi-resolution images in order to evaluate the usefulness of coarse-resolution satellite data (e.g. the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer; MODIS) in obtaining similar results to those obtainable with moderate-resolution satellite data (e.g. Landsat). A spectral-mixture model based on three endmembers (soil, vegetation and water) was used to determine the land-cover fractions of the main land-use classes of a wetland in southeast Spain. The land-use map was produced by applying the unsupervised k-means classification method to the moderate-resolution image. Spatial and temporal changes in the mixture fractions at multiple resolutions and their corresponding land-cover fraction maps were assessed. Three different t-tests (paired-samples, independent-samples and Dutilleul's modified t-tests) were used to evaluate the effects of pixel aggregation on land-cover fractions and land-use maps in terms of surface-area estimations. Ternary plots of land-use classes characterized by land-cover fractions were used to visualize environmental processes pathways describing temporal changes in the landscape. The results obtained with moderate- and coarse-resolution data were not significantly different from each other. Land-use and land-cover surface-area estimations were not significantly different between Landsat moderate-resolution (30 m) and Landsat resampled coarse-resolution (300 m) data. Spatial autocorrelation had an important effect when comparing Landsat moderate-resolution (30 m) with MODIS coarse-resolution (250 m) data. In order to minimize these effects Dutilleul's modified t-test was applied for the comparison of Landsat with MODIS image data. However, this test did not reveal significant differences between both datasets, whereas with the ordinary t-test, significant differences were found, which suggest the existence of a bias by spatial autocorrelation that must be taken into account for up-scaling or down-scaling of remote-sensing data. The results suggest the possibility of using coarse-resolution images (MODIS) to characterize environmental changes with a similar accuracy to those of moderate-resolution images (Landsat), as long as potential spatial autocorrelation effects are taken into account. This finding indicates that a substantial reduction in the costs of conducting wetland management and monitoring tasks can be achieved by using free or low-cost coarse-resolution satellite images.

It is a technique commonly used for statistical data analysis, and is also used in many other fields, including machine learning, data mining, pattern recognition, image analysis, and bioinformatics, in which the distribution of information can be of any size and shape. An improved technique combining linearly decreasing weight particle swarm optimization (LDWPSO) with an acceleration strategy is proposed in this paper. Accelerated linearly decreasing weight particle swarm optimization (ALDWPSO) searches for cluster centers in an arbitrary data set and can effectively indentify the global optima. ALDWPSO is tested on six experimental data sets, and its performance is compared to the performance of PSO, NM-PSO, K-PSO, K-NM-PSO, LDWPSO and K-means clustering. Results indicate that ALDWPSO is both robust and suitable for solving data clustering problem.

Having both accuracy and efficiency for high dimensional data sets with enormous number of samples is a challenging arena. For really large and high dimensional data sets, vertical data reduction should be performed prior to applying the clustering techniques which is performing dimension reduction, and the main disadvantage is sacrificing the quality of results. However, because dimensionality reduction methods inevitably cause some loss of information or may damage the interpretability of the results, even distorting the real clusters, extra caution is advised. Furthermore, in some applications data reduction is not possible e.g. personal similarity, customer preferences profiles clustering in customer recommender system or data by which is generated sensor networks. Existing clustering techniques would normally apply in a large space with high dimension; dividing big space into subspaces horizontally can lead us to high efficiency and accuracy. In this study we propose a method that uses divide and conquer technique with equivalency and compatible relation concepts to improve the performance of the K-Means clustering method for using in high dimensional datasets. Experiment results demonstrate appropriate accuracy and speed up.

Analyzing huge data sets and extracting valuable pattern in many applications are interesting for researchers. We can identify two main groups of techniques for huge data bases mining. One group refers to streaming data and applies mining techniques whereas second group attempts to solve this problem directly with efficient algorithms. Recently many researchers have focused on data stream as an efficient strategy against huge data base mining instead of mining on entire data base. The main problem in data stream mining means evolving data is more difficult to detect in this techniques therefore unsupervised methods should be applied. However, clustering techniques can lead us to discover hidden information. In this survey, we try to clarify: first, the different problem definitions related to data stream clustering in general; second, the specific difficulties encountered in this field of research; third, the varying assumptions, heuristics, and intuitions forming the basis of different approaches; and how several prominent solutions tackle different problems.

The key idea is to cluster the documents after measuring the proximity of the documents with the extracted features. The extracted features are considered as the final cluster labels and clustering is done using cosine similarity which is equivalent to k-means with a single turn. This model was implemented using apache lucene project for indexing documents and mapreduce framework of apache hadoop project for parallel implementation of k-means algorithm. Since experiments were carried only in one cluster of Hadoop, the significant reduction in time was obtained by mapreduce implementation when clusters size exceeded 9 i.e. 40 documents averaging 1.5 kilobytes. Thus it is concluded that the feature extracted using NMF can be used to cluster documents considering them to be final cluster labels as in k-means, and for large scale documents, the parallel implementation using mapreduce can lead to reduction of computational time. We have termed this model as KNMF (K-means with NMF algorithm).

Comparison and Combination of Shuffled Frog-Leaping Algorithm and K-Means for Clustering of VCAs in Power System	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING-IREE			English	Article						Voltage Control Area; Participation Factors; Data Clustering; Evolutionary Algorithms; Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm	OPTIMIZATION	Voltage Control Areas, is one of the main concepts in both voltage stability assessment and control. Employing an artificial intelligent system, for detecting VCAs and identifying the prone buses is an important part of a reasonable response to the need for real time monitoring and control of power system in emergency cases of voltage instability appearance. For this purpose the database of training data, contains the simulation results due to wide range of various emergency cases. A clustering process which provide finite clusters belong to VCAs, in addition of a classification function based on the provided clusters, are the main stages to prepare A IS for automatic VCA identification. In this paper a novel data clustering method based on Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm is presented to cluster the VCAs in excessive emergency cases in electric power system. In present study the application of SFLA in data clustering is also compared with the most popular analytic algorithm of clustering, K-means, and also the hybrid SFLA and K-means method are used for better clustering performance. The advantage of using the data points from the same under clustering database as initial positions for some frogs is illustrated too. Numerical results are presented for IEEE 14-bus test system and two standard test data sets. The comparative results show the effectiveness of proposed algorithms.

J	Kathuria, A; Jansen, BJ; Hafernik, C; Spink, A				Kathuria, Ashish; Jansen, Bernard J.; Hafernik, Carolyn; Spink, Amanda			Classifying the user intent of User intent of web queries web queries using k-means clustering	INTERNET RESEARCH			English	Article						User interfaces; Methods of enquiry; Search engines	ENGINE TRANSACTION LOGS; SEARCH ENGINE	Purpose - Web search engines are frequently used by people to locate information on the Internet. However, not all queries have an informational goal. Instead of information, some people may be looking for specific web sites or may wish to conduct transactions with web services. This paper aims to focus on automatically classifying the different user intents behind web queries. Design/methodology/approach - For the research reported in this paper, 130,000 web search engine queries are categorized as informational, navigational, or transactional using a k-means clustering approach based on a variety of query traits. Findings - The research findings show that more than 75 percent of web queries (clustered into eight classifications) are informational in nature, with about 12 percent each for navigational and transactional. Results also show that web queries fall into eight clusters, six primarily informational, and one each of primarily transactional and navigational. Research limitations/implications - This study provides an important contribution to web search literature because it provides information about the goals of searchers and a method for automatically classifying the intents of the user queries. Automatic classification of user intent can lead to improved web search engines by tailoring results to specific user needs. Practical implications - The paper discusses how web search engines can use automatically classified user queries to provide more targeted and relevant results in web searching by implementing a real time classification method as presented in this research. Originality/value - This research investigates a new application of a method for automatically classifying the intent of user queries. There has been limited research to date on automatically classifying the user intent of web queries, even though the pay-off for web search engines can be quite beneficial.

To improve the computational speed, an embedded memory configuration has been used to store all sample data on the same chip for massively parallel processing. As a solution to the problem of the maximum sample data size limited by the chip area, a multiple-chip architecture has been developed, in which dedicated processor chips are connected in a binary-tree hierarchical structure. As a result, the system has been made extendible to any larger scale depending on the application needs. Furthermore, the pipeline calculation flow has been introduced to compensate for the interchip data communication delay. A proof-of-concept chip was designed using a 0.18 mu m five-metal complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The chip operation was verified by NanoSim simulation, and pipeline calculation flow was demonstrated by test chip measurement.

For the aerial and satellite imaging based pattern recognition, it is unavoidable that these images are affected by various uncertainties, like the atmosphere medium dispersing. Image denoising is thus necessary to remove noises and retain important signatures of digital images. The linear denoising approach is suitable for slowly varying noise cases. However, the spatial object recognition problem is essentially nonlinear. Being a nonlinear wavelet based technique, wavelet decomposition is effective to denoise blurring spatial images. The digital image can be split into four subbands, representing approximation (low frequency feature) and three details (high frequency features) in horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions. The proposed soft thresholding wavelet decomposition is simple and efficient for noise reduction. To further identify the individual targets, nonlinear K-means clustering based segmentation approach is proposed for image object recognition. The selected spatial images are taken across hurricane affected Louisiana areas. In addition to evaluate this integration approach via qualitative observation, quantitative measures are proposed on a basis of the information theory, where the discrete entropy, discrete energy and mutual information, are applied for the accurate decision support.

Our proposed thermal error modeling methodology (called KRL) integrates the schemes of K-means theory (KM), rough-set theory (RS), and linear regression model (LR). First, to explore the machine tool's thermal behavior, an integrated system is designed to simultaneously measure the temperature ascents at selected characteristic points and the thermal deformations at spindle nose under suitable real machining conditions. Second, the obtained data are classified by the KM method, further reduced by the RS scheme, and a linear thermal error model is established by the LR technique. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, an adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) thermal error model is introduced for comparison. Finally, a verification experiment is carried out and results reveal that the proposed KRL model is effective in predicting thermal behavior in machine tools. Our proposed KRL model is transparent, easily understood by users, and can be easily programmed or modified for different machining conditions.

Treating unobserved heterogeneity in PLS path modeling: a comparison of FIMIX-PLS with different data analysis strategies	JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						partial least square (PLS); path modeling; heterogeneity; latent class; finite mixture; market segmentation; corporate reputation	STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELS; SEGMENTATION	In the social science disciplines, the assumption that the data stem from a single homogeneous population is often unrealistic in respect of empirical research. When applying a causal modeling approach, such as partial least squares path modeling, segmentation is a key issue in coping with the problem of heterogeneity in the estimated cause-effect relationships. This article uses the novel finite-mixture partial least squares (FIMIX-PLS) method to uncover unobserved heterogeneity in a complex path modeling example in the field of marketing. An evaluation of the results includes a comparison with the outcomes of several data analysis strategies based on a priori information or k-means cluster analysis. The results of this article underpin the effectiveness and the advantageous capabilities of FIMIX-PLS in general PLS path model set-ups by means of empirical data and formative as well as reflective measurement models.

We applied k-means clustering to the time course data of fluorescent intensity of EGFP and successfully found four subpopulations. Discriminating the appropriate clusters and investigating the details of them, we found that almost all cells express the transfected gene after cell division and also found there is a strong correlation between onset timing and cell division. This result suggested that it is possible to normalize the dynamics of gene by arranging the onset timing of gene expression or by arranging the cell division.

The aim of this study was to identify pathways associated with chronic demyelination using an assumption-free combined microarray and immunohistology approach. Movement control as determined by rotarod assay significantly worsened in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis -virus-infected SJL/J mice from 42 to 196 days after infection (dpi). In the spinal cords, inflammatory changes were detected 14 to 196 dpi, and demyelination progressively increased from 42 to 196 dpi. Microarray analysis revealed 1001 differentially expressed genes over the study period. The dominating changes as revealed by k-means and functional annotation clustering included up-regulations related to intrathecal antibody production and antigen processing and presentation via major histocompatibility class II molecules. A random forest machine learning algorithm revealed that down-regulated lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis, differentially expressed neurite morphogenesis and up-regulated toll-like receptor-4-induced pathways were intimately associated with demyelination as measured by immunohistology. Conclusively, although transcriptional changes were dominated by the adaptive immune response, the main pathways associated with demyelination included up-regulation of toll-like receptor 4 and down-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis. Cholesterol biosynthesis is a rate limiting step of myelination and its down-regulation is suggested to be involved in chronic demyelination by an inhibition of remyelination.

J	Palsdottir, A				Palsdottir, Agusta			The connection between purposive information seeking and information encountering A study of Icelanders' health and lifestyle information seeking	JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION			English	Article						Personal health; Lifestyles; Iceland; Information searches; Individual behaviour; Information retrieval	INCOME INEQUALITY; BREAST-CANCER; KNOWLEDGE GAP; BEHAVIOR; MODEL; DETERMINANTS; ASSOCIATIONS; ACQUISITION; GOAL; CARE	Purpose - This paper aims to explore health and lifestyle information seeking behaviour by examining the connection between purposive information seeking and information encountering. Design/methodology/approach - Data on purposive seeking and information encountering, gathered from postal surveys in 2002 and 2007, were compared. Random samples of 1,000 Icelanders, aged 18 to 80 were used. The response rate was 51 per cent in 2002 and 47 per cent in 2007. Based on the purposive seeking in 22 sources, k-means cluster analysis was used to draw four clusters of participants: passive, moderately passive, moderately active and active. Findings - The results from 2007 and 2002 revealed the same kind of information seeking. The findings indicate that information encountering is an integral feature of information seeking behaviour. Information is encountered more often than sought on purpose by all clusters. Clusters that were active in purposive information seeking were also active in information encountering and those who were passive in either of the two styles of information seeking were also passive in the other. Research limitations/implications - The response rates are considered satisfactory in postal surveys. Nevertheless, when missing data in the cluster analysis are also considered it raises a question about the validity of the findings. The findings of the studies, however, are strengthened by the fact that respondents reflect the population fairly well. Practical implications - Improved knowledge of information seeking and how different groups within society can be reached more effectively is important for health promotion and public health practice. Originality/value - The paper uses quantitative methods to examine the connection between purposive information seeking and information encountering.

A large data set consisting of a group of 100 patients suffering diabetes mellitus type 2 disease characterized by more than 30 clinical parameters was explored using self-organizing maps (SOM) and classified by the use of non-hierarchical K-means algorithm implemented in the SOM. An attempt was made to correlate the classification results with the parameters of the metabolic syndrome. The classification result revealed 4 specific patterns of patients, each presented by respective discriminating parameters: (i) patients with well-controlled state of the disease, (ii) patients with disturbed kidney function, (iii) patients who do not keep the required medical treatment regime, and (iv) patients who neglect the disease. All patterns included respective number of patients with different clinical status and attitude to the health problem. Patients with a well-controlled state of the disease, although being chronic for a long period of time were characterized by very low density proteins and triglycerides levels as well as by the lowest levels for hemoglobin A(1c), total protein and creatine phosphokinase. Patients with disturbed kidney function were characterized by the highest averages of the uric acid, albumin, total protein and creatinine, and relatively low values for glucose. Patients who do not keep the required regime possessed the highest level of glucose along with maximal values for cholesterol and trombocytes. Patients who neglect the disease were characterized by high values of cholesterol and relatively high level of glucose, although the duration of the disease was the shortest as compared to the other groups of patients.

One hundred and thirty erosive rainfall events generating runoff in plots were grouped into four rainfall types by means of K-mean clustering method. Erosive rainfall type I is the dominant rainfall type. The amount of runoff and the soil loss under erosive rainfall type In were the most, followed by rain-fall type II, IV and I. Compared with CSF treatment, reforestation treatments decreased the average annual runoff depth and the soil loss by 25.5%-61.8% and 93.9%-96.2% during the study period respectively. Meanwhile, runoff depth at PSF and EEF treatments was significantly lower than that in NST treatment, but no significant difference existed in soil erosion modulus among the three reforestation treatments. This is mainly due to the improved vegetation properties (i.e., vegetation coverage, biomass of above- and below-ground and litter-fall mass) and soil properties (i.e., bulk density, total porosity, infiltration rate and organic carbon content) in the three reforestation treatments compared to CSF treatment. The PSF and EEF are recommended as the preferred reforestation types to control runoff and soil erosion in the red soil region of southern China, with the NST potentially being used as an important supplement.

J	Roy, K; Paul, S				Roy, Kunal; Paul, Somnath			Docking and 3D QSAR studies of protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibitor 3H-pyrazolo[3,4-d][1,2,3]triazin-4-one derivatives	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MODELING			English	Article						GFA; PLS; G/PLS; K-means cluster; Docking; QSAR; Protoporphyrinogen oxidase	MODELS; HERBICIDE; ANALOGS; SELECTION; DESIGN; SETS; 2D	Docking and three dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) studies have been performed for protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO) inhibitor 3H-pyrazolo[3,4-d][1,2,3]triazin-4-one analogues which are potential herbicides to protect agricultural products from unwanted weeds. The 3D-QSAR studies have been carried out using shape, spatial, electronic and molecular field descriptors along with a few structural parameters. The chemometric tools used for the analyses are genetic function approximation (GFA), partial least squares (PLS) and genetic partial least squares (G/PLS). The whole data set (n=34) was divided into a training set (75% of the data set) and a test set (remaining 25%) on the basis of K-means clustering technique applied on topological, spatial and electronic descriptor matrix. Models developed from the training set were used to predict the activity of the test set compounds. All the models have been validated internally, externally and by Y-randomization technique. Docking studies suggest that the molecules bind with a hydrophobic pocket of the enzyme formed by some nonpolar amino acid (Ile168, Ile311, Ile412, Met365, Phe65 and Val164) residues. The QSAR studies suggest that for better activity the molecules should have symmetrical shape in the 3D space. For better PPO inhibitory activity, there should be a balance between the electrophilic and nucleophilic characters of the inhibitors. The charged surface area descriptors suggest that, the positive charge distributed over a large surface area may enhance the activity. Molecular field probes reflect that increase in steric volume and positively charged surface area may enhance the herbicidal activity.

Explanations for the United States of America's dominance in basketball at the Beijing Olympic Games (2008)	JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCES			English	Article						Statistics; team sports; match analysis	EMPIRICAL VERIFICATION; DECISION-MAKING; PLAYERS; STATISTICS; PERFORMANCE; FATIGUE; SYSTEM; TEAMS	Anecdotally, the fast pace at which the USA men's basketball team played at the 2008 Olympics was the main reason for their dominance, although there is no way of quantifying what a fast pace is or how it contributed to point differentials. The aim of this study was to examine the game-related statistics that discriminate between fast- and slow-paced games, as well as to identify key performance factors relating to point differentials. We analysed game-related statistics for each quarter of the eight games played by the USA using a k-means cluster analysis to classify game pace using ball possessions per game quarter. We then tested for differences in game statistics between slow- and fast-paced game quarters using analysis of variance and discriminant analysis. How differences in game-related statistics affected point differentials was examined using linear regression. The largest structure coefficient between game paces for the USA was for recovered balls (0.33, P<0.001). The biggest contributors to the point differences in games were recovered balls (16.9, P<0.001) and field goals (22.2, P<0.001). We conclude that when the USA play a fast-paced game, they are able to recover more balls from opponents that they then turn into effective field-goal shooting.

The segments of PPA visitors are also compared with other nature-based tourist segments using some empirical benefit segmentation literature. Data were collected by means of a self-administered questionnaire and multivariate statistics techniques (principal components, hierarchical and K-means cluster analyses) were applied. Five distinct segments of visitors were identified based on the motivation for their visit and further characterized by the perceived importance of activities, facilities and services, frequency of visit and socio-demographics. Three segments are nature-focused and two are focused on activities or events. Only one segment shows specific interests and motivations associated with ecotourism and similar characteristics to international ecotourists; moreover, the reasons for the visit in one segment are unrelated to any of the motivations of nature-based tourism. Some implications for management are also described.

J	Kumar, A; Sabharwal, Y; Sen, S				Kumar, Amit; Sabharwal, Yogish; Sen, Sandeep			Linear-Time Approximation Schemes for Clustering Problems in Any Dimensions	JOURNAL OF THE ACM			English	Article						Algorithms; Theory		We present a general approach for designing approximation algorithms for a fundamental class of geometric clustering problems in arbitrary dimensions. More specifically, our approach leads to simple randomized algorithms for the k-means, k-median and discrete k-means problems that yield (1 + epsilon) approximations with probability >= 1/2 and running times of O(2((k/epsilon)O(1)) dn). These are the first algorithms for these problems whose running times are linear in the size of the input (nd for n points in d dimensions) assuming k and e are fixed. Our method is general enough to be applicable to clustering problems satisfying certain simple properties and is likely to have further applications.

The algorithm easily and rapidly selects air areas that have significantly higher contrast in each projection image by applying K-means clustering method on CPU, and then generates boundary tables for verifying valid region using segmented air areas. Based on these boundary tables of each projection image, clipped polygon that indicates active region when back-projection operation is performed on GPU is determined on each volume slice. This polygon clipping process makes it possible to use smaller number of voxels to be back-projected, which leads to a faster GPU-based reconstruction method. This approach has been applied to a clinical data set and Shepp-Logan phantom data sets having various ratio of air region for quantitative and qualitative comparison and analysis of our and conventional GPU-based reconstruction methods. The algorithm has been proved to reduce computational time to half without losing any diagnostic information, compared to conventional GPU-based approaches.

But now this rate is decreased in the recent years due to the earlier diagnosis and proper treatment. Chances of the long survival of the patient can be increased by the accurate brain tumor diagnosis. For this regard we are proposing more accurate and efficient system for brain tumor diagnosis and brain tumor region extraction. Proposed system first diagnosis the tumor from the brain MR images using naive bayes classification. After diagnosis brain tumor region is extracted using K-means clustering and boundary detection techniques. We are achieving diagnosis accuracy more than 99%. Qualitative results show that accurate tumor region is extracted by the proposed system. The proposed technique is tested against the datasets of different patients received from Holy Family hospital and Abrar MRI&CT Scan center Rawalpindi.	[Qurat-ul Ain; Mehmood, Irfan; Jaffar, M.

Clustering strategy can be used as a powerful tool of discovering hidden knowledge that can easily be applied on historical traffic data to predict accurate travel time. In our Modified K-means Clustering (M KC) approach, a set of historical data is portioned into a group of meaningful sub-classes (also known as clusters) based on travel time, frequency of travel time and velocity for a specific road segment and time group. With the use of same set of historical travel time estimates, comparison is also made to the forecasting results of other three methods: Successive Moving Average (SMA), Chain Average (CA) and Naive Bayesian Classification (NBC) method. The results suggest that the travel times for the study periods could be predicted by the proposed method with the minimum Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE).

Several approaches have been proposed suffering however from problems like synonymy, ambiguity and lack of a descriptive content marking of the generated clusters. We are proposing the enhancement of standard kmeans algorithm using the external knowledge from Word Net hypernyms in a twofold manner: enriching the "bag of words" used prior to the clustering process and assisting the label generation procedure following it. Our experimentation revealed a significant improvement over standard kmeans for a corpus of news articles derived from major news portals. Moreover, the cluster labeling process generates useful and of high quality cluster tags.

Two essential ingredients of everyday cognition that are employed during language comprehension are the ability to reason counterfactually, and the ability to understand and predict other peoples' behaviour by attributing independent mental states to them (theory of mind). We report two visual-world studies investigating the extent to which the constraints of world knowledge and prior context, as established by a counterfactual (Exp. 1) or a false belief situation (Exp. 2), influence eye-movements directed towards objects in a visual field. Proportions of anticipatory eye-movements indicated an initial visual bias towards contextually supported referents in both studies. Thus, we propose that when visual information is available to reinforce linguistic input, participants expect a context-relevant continuation. Shortly after the critical word onset, the linguistically supported referent was visually favoured, with counterfactual (but not false belief) contexts revealing a temporal delay in integrating factually inconsistent language input. Results are discussed in relation to accounts of discourse processing and the processing relationship between counterfactual and theory of mind reasoning. Finally, we compare findings across different experimental paradigms and propose a novel cluster-analytic procedure to identify time-windows of interest in visual-world data.

In the general data mining and classification literature, functions such as Euclidean distance or Pearson correlation have gained their status of de facto standards thanks to a considerable amount of experimental validation. For microarray data, the issue of which distance function "works best" has been investigated, but no final conclusion has been reached. The aim of this paper is to shed further light on that issue. Indeed, we present an experimental study, involving several distances, assessing (a) their intrinsic separation ability and (b) their predictive power when used in conjunction with clustering algorithms. The experiments have been carried out on six benchmark microarray datasets, where the "gold solution" is known for each of them. We have used both Hierarchical and K-means clustering algorithms and external validation criteria as evaluation tools. From the methodological point of view, the main result of this study is a ranking of those measures in terms of their intrinsic and clustering abilities, highlighting also the correlations between the two. Pragmatically, based on the outcomes of the experiments, one receives the indication that Minkowski, cosine and Pearson correlation distances seems to be the best choice when dealing with microarray data analysis.

In this paper, a clustering-based geometric support vector machines (CBGSVM) was proposed to resolve this problem, initial classes are got by k-means cluster, then develop a fast iterative algorithm for identifying the support vector machine of the centers of all subclasses. To speed up convergence, we initialize our algorithm with the nearest pair of the center from opposite classes, and then use an optimization-based approach to increment or prune the candidate support vector set. The algorithm makes repeated passes over the centers to satisfy the KKT constraints. The method speeds up the training process fast comparing with standard support vector machines under the almost same classification precision.

Vessel trajectories are an example of moving object trajectories, which have recently become an important research topic. The alignment measures are defined as kernels and are used in the kernel k-means clustering algorithm. We investigate the performance of these alignment kernels in combination with a trajectory compression method. Experiments on a gold standard dataset indicate that compression has a positive effect on clustering performance for a number of alignment measures. Also, soft-max kernels, based on summing all alignments, perform worse than classic kernels, based on taking the score of the best alignment.

In this paper, we propose a cluster-level semi-supervision model for inter-active clustering. Prototype based clustering algorithms typically alternate between updating cluster descriptions and assignment of data items to clusters. In our model, the user provides semi-supervision directly for these two steps. Assignment feedback re-assigns data items among existing clusters, while cluster description feedback helps to position existing cluster centers more meaningfully. We argue that providing such supervision is more natural for exploratory data mining, where the user discovers and interprets clusters as the algorithm progresses, in comparison to the pair-wise instance level supervision model, particularly for high dimensional data such as document collection. We show how such feedback can be interpreted as constraints and incorporated within the k-means clustering framework. Using experimental results on multiple real-world datasets, we show that this framework improves clustering performance significantly beyond traditional k-means. Interestingly, when given the same number of feedbacks from the user, the proposed framework significantly outperforms the pair-wise supervision model.

The traditional approach used spectral relaxation to solve the graph cut problem. The main disadvantage of this approach is that the obtained spectral solution has mixed signs, which could severely deviate from the true solution and have to resort to other clustering methods, such as K-means, to obtain final clusters. In this paper, we propose to apply additional nonnegative constraint into MinMax Cut graph clustering and introduce novel algorithms to optimize the new objective. With the explicit nonnegative constraint, our solutions are very close to the ideal class indicator matrix and can directly assign clusters to data points. We present efficient algorithms to solve the new problem with the nonnegative constraint rigorously. Experimental results show that our new algorithm always converges and significantly outperforms the traditional spectral relaxation approach on ratio cut and normalized cut.

We present a data-driven segmentation method comprising tracer-kinetic model-driven registration for motion correction, conversion from MR signal intensity to contrast agent concentration for cross-visit normalization, iterative principal components analysis for imputation of missing data and dimensionality reduction, and statistical outlier detection using the minimum covariance determinant to obtain a robust Mahalanobis distance. After applying these techniques we cluster in the principal components space using k-means. We present results from a clinical trial of a VEGF inhibitor, using time-series data selected because of problems due to motion and outlier time series. We obtained spatially-contiguous clusters that map to regions with distinct microvascular characteristics. This methodology has the potential to uncover localized effects in trials using DCE-MRI-based biomarkers.	[Buonaccorsi, G. A.; Rose, C. J.; O'Connor, J. P.

We propose using an observer-independent laminar profile-based parcellation method to detect cortical lesions. Following cortical surface extraction, profiles are extended from the white matter surface to the grey matter surface. The cortex is parcellated according to profile intensity and shape features using a k-means classifier. The method is applied to a high-resolution quantitative magnetic resonance data set from a fixed post mortem multiple sclerosis brain, and validated using histology.

We focus on the Cingulum Bundle (CB) - a major tract for the Limbic System and the main connection of the Cingulate Gyrus, which has been associated with several aspects of Schizophrenia symptomatology. The Tubular Surface Model represents a tubular surface as a center-line with an associated radius function. It provides a natural way to sample statistics along the length of the fiber bundle and reduces the registration of fiber bundle surfaces to that of 4D curves. We apply our framework to a population of 20 subjects (10 normal, 10 schizophrenic) and obtain excellent results with neural network based classification (90% sensitivity, 95% specificity) as well as unsupervised clustering (k-means). Further, we apply statistical analysis to the feature data and characterize the discrimination ability of local regions of the CB, as a step towards localizing CB regions most relevant to Schizophrenia.

A variety of segmentation algorithms have been proposed, and most are evaluated on a small dataset or based on classification of a single feature. The lack of a gold standard (ground truth) further adds to the discrepancy in these comparisons. This work proposes a new methodology for comparing image segmentation algorithms without ground truth by building a matrix called region-correlation matrix. Subsequently, suitable distance measures are proposed for quantitative assessment of similarity. The first measure takes into account the degree of region overlap or identical match. The second considers the degree of splitting or misclassification by using an appropriate penalty term. These measures are shown to satisfy the axioms of a quasi-metric. They are applied for a comparative analysis of synthetic segmentation maps to show their direct correlation with human intuition of similar segmentation. Since ultrasound images are difficult to segment and usually lack a ground truth, the measures are further used to compare the recently proposed spectral clustering algorithm (encoding spatial and edge information) with standard k-means over abdominal ultrasound images. Improving the parameterization and enlarging the feature space for k-means steadily increased segmentation quality to that of spectral clustering.

Tumor segmentation; tumor delineation; positron emission tomography; NSCLC	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; RADIOTHERAPY; CANCER; TARGET; DELINEATION; DEFINITION; ORGANS; IMPACT	We propose an automated lung tumor segmentation method for whole body PET images based on a novel downhill region growing (DRG) technique, which regards homogeneous tumor hotspots as 3D monotonically decreasing functions. The method has three major steps: thoracic slice extraction with K-means clustering of the slice features; hotspot segmentation with DRG; and decision tree analysis based hotspot classification. To overcome the common problem of leakage into adjacent hotspots in automated lung tumor segmentation, DRG employs the tumors' SUV monotonicity features. DRG also uses gradient magnitude of tumors' SUV to improve tumor boundary definition. We used 14 PET volumes from patients with primary NSCLC for validation. The thoracic region extraction step achieved good and consistent results for all patients despite marked differences in size and shape of the lungs and the presence of large tumors. The DRG technique was able to avoid the problem of leakage into adjacent hotspots and produced a volumetric overlap fraction of 0.61 +/- 0.13 which outperformed four other methods where the overlap fraction varied from 0.40 +/- 0.24 to 0.59 +/- 0.14. Of the 18 tumors in 14 NSCLC studies, 15 lesions were classified correctly, 2 were false negative and 15 were false positive.

Distortion rate function; Gaussian mixture model order; classification error; diagnostic classification	CLUSTERS	The difficult problem of identifying dominant structures in unknown data sets has been elegantly addressed recently by a non-parametric information theoretic approach, the "Jump" method. The method employs an appropriate but fixed power transformation on the distortion-rate, D(R), curve estimated by the popular K-means algorithm. Although this approach yields good results asymptotically for higher dimensional spaces, in many practical cases involving lower dimensional spaces, a transformation function with a fixed power may not find the correct model order. The work presented here develops an objective function to derive a more suitable transformation function that minimizes classification error in low dimensional data sets. In addition, a number of carefully chosen K-means seeding methods based upon proper heuristic choices have been used to enhance the detection sensitivity and to allow a more accurate estimation. The proposed method has been evaluated for a large variety of datasets and compared with the original Jump method and other well-known order estimation methods such as Minimum Description Length (MDL), Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), and Consistent Akaike Information Criteria (CAIC), demonstrating superior overall performance. Comparative results for the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer Dataset have been included. This modified information theoretic approach to model order estimation is expected to improve and validate diagnostic classification and detection of pre-cancerous lesions.

Multi-mode atlases; diffeomorphic demons; Riemannian distance; averaging diffeomorphisms	ATLAS	A major focus of computational anatomy is to extract the most relevant information to identify and characterize anatomical variability within a group of subjects as well as between different groups. The construction of atlases is central to this effort. An atlas is a deterministic or probabilistic model with intensity variance, structural, functional or biochemical information over a population. To date most algorithms to construct atlases have been based on a single subject assuming that the population is best described by a single atlas. However, we believe that in a population with a wide range of subjects multiple atlases may be more representative since they reveal the anatomical differences and similarities within the group. In this work, we propose to use the K-means clustering algorithm to partition a set of images into several subclasses, based on a joint distance which is composed of a distance quantifying the deformation between images and a dissimilarity measured from the registration residual. During clustering, the spatial transformations are averaged rather than images to form cluster centers, to ensure a crisp reference. At the end of this algorithm, the updated centers of the k clusters are our atlases. We demonstrate this algorithm on a subset of a public available database with whole brain volumes of subjects aged 18-96 years. The atlases constructed by this method capture the significant structural differences across the group.

Non-local means; NL-means; Adaptive non-local means; ANL-means; Medical image denoising; Gaussian noise; Rician noise	MAGNETIC-RESONANCE IMAGES; ALGORITHMS	Medical images often consist of low-contrast objects corrupted by random noise arising in the image acquisition process. Thus, image denoising is one of the fundamental tasks required by medical imaging analysis. In this work, we investigate an adaptive denoising scheme based on the nonlocal (NL)-means algorithm for medical imaging applications. In contrast with the traditional NL-means algorithm, the proposed adaptive NL-means (ANL-means) denoising scheme has three unique features. First, it employs the singular value decomposition (SVD) method and the K-means clustering (K-means) technique for robust classification of blocks in noisy images. Second, the local window is adaptively adjusted to match the local property of a block. Finally, a rotated block matching algorithm is adopted for better similarity matching. Experimental results from both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rician noise are given to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed ANL denoising technique over various image denoising benchmarks in term of both PSNR and perceptual quality comparison.

Since further purification is not feasible, the presence of several conformational states of ribosomal complexes in thermodynamic equilibrium requires methods for separating these states in silico. We describe a procedure for generating subnanometer resolution cryo-EM structures from large sets of projection images of ribosomal complexes. The incremental K-means-like method of unsupervised 3D sorting discussed here allows separation of classes in the dataset by exploiting intrinsic divisions in the data. The classification procedure is described in detail and its effectiveness is illustrated using current examples from our work. Through a good separation of conformational modes, higher resolution reconstructions can be calculated. This increases information gained from single states, while exploiting the coexistence of multiple states to gather comprehensive mechanistic insight into biological processes like ribosomal translocation.

By the method, we know clusters of mind-set but the clusters are not always optimal in some criterion. In this paper, we develop non-hierarchical clustering techniques for decision tables. In order to treat positive and negative evaluations to a common profile, we use a vector of rough membership values to represent individual opinion to a profile. Using rough membership values, we develop a K-means method as well as fuzzy c-means methods for clustering decision tables. We examined the proposed methods in clustering real world decision tables.

The QSAR studies were performed using 35 compounds among which 26 molecules were taken using k-means clustering technique in the training set for the derivation of the QSAR models and nine molecules were kept as the test-set compounds to evaluate the predictive ability of the derived models. The chemometric tool used for the analysis was the genetic function approximation. The developed models were analysed in terms of their predictive ability, and comparable results were obtained for cross-validated predictive variance (Q(2)) and externally predicted variance (R-pred(2)) values (0.761 and 0.829, respectively, for the D6 model, 0.708 and 0.748, respectively, for the W2 model and 0.984 and 0.982, respectively for the QAAR model). The QSAR models suggest that the number of methylene groups (between the triazolyl and hydroxamate moieties) and partially negatively charged surface areas of the molecules are important parameters for the antimalarial activity.

While density or distance-relatedness based clustering algorithms are used to efficiently discover clusters of arbitrary shapes and densities, classical (yet less efficient) clustering algorithms can be used to analyze the internal cluster structure and visualize it. In this work, a sequential ensemble, that uses an efficient distance-relatedness based clustering, "Mitosis", followed by the centre-based K-means algorithm, is proposed. K-means is used to segment the clusters obtained by Mitosis into a number of subclusters. The ensemble is used to reveal the gradual change of patterns when applied to gene expression sets.

Simultaneous Two-Way Clustering of Multiple Correspondence Analysis	MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH			English	Article							FUZZY-SETS; TRAJECTORIES; ADOLESCENCE; VARIABLES; TAXONOMY; BEHAVIOR; OBJECTS; MODELS	A 2-way clustering approach to multiple correspondence analysis is proposed to account for cluster-level heterogeneity of both respondents and variable categories in multivariate categorical data. Specifically, in the proposed method, multiple correspondence analysis is combined with k-means in a unified framework in which k-means is applied twice to partition the object scores of respondents and the weights of variable categories. In this way, joint clusters that relate a subgroup of respondents exclusively to a subset of variable categories are obtained. The proposed method provides a low-dimensional map of displaying variable category points and the centroids of joint clusters simultaneously. In addition, it offers joint-cluster memberships of variable categories as well pas respondents. A Monte Carlo study is conducted to assess the parameter recovery capability of the proposed method based on synthetic data. An empirical application concerning Korean consumers' preferences to ward various underwear brands and attributes is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method as compared with 2 relevant extant approaches	[Hwang, Heungsun] McGill Univ, Dept Psychol, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada; [Dillon, William R.] So Methodist Univ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA	Hwang, H (reprint author), McGill Univ, Dept Psychol, 1205 Dr Penfield Ave, Montreal, PQ H3A 1B1, Canada.	heungsun.hwang@mcgill.ca	Dillon, William/E-8681-2010				Aldwin CM, 2001, PSYCHOL AGING, V16, P450, DOI 10.1037//0882-7974.16.3.450; ARABIE P, 1997, J MAT SOCIOLOGY, V5, P113; Arabie P., 1994, ADV METHODS MARKETIN, P160; BAGOZZI RP, 1982, J MARKETING RES, V19, P562, DOI 10.2307/3151727; Benzecri J.P., 1979, CAHIERS ANAL DONNEES, V4, P377; Benzecri J-P, 1973, ANAL DONNEES, VII; BEZDEK JC, 1974, J MATH BIOL, V1, P57, DOI 10.1007/BF02339490; Bollen KA, 2007, SOCIOL METHOD RES, V36, P48, DOI 10.1177/0049124107301947; Chang W., 1983, APPL STAT-J ROY ST C, V32, P267, DOI 10.2307/2347949; CIAMPI A., 2005, SORT, V29, P27; De Soete G, 1994, NEW APPROACHES CLASS, P212; Deihl LM, 1997, J RES ADOLESCENCE, V7, P393, DOI 10.1207/s15327795jra0704_3; DELEEUW J, 1976, PSYCHOMETRIKA, V41, P471; DeSarbo WS, 1990, MARKET LETT, V2, P129; DESARBO WS, 1982, PSYCHOMETRIKA, V47, P449, DOI 10.1007/BF02293709; Dunn J.

A city scenario with normal demands is examined and the advantages/disadvantages of this method are discussed. The planner and optimizing tasks are based on an iterative K-Means clustering method. Numerical results of coverage, as well as graphical results permit on radio coverage maps, are presented as base for main consequences. Furthermore, the final results are compared to another simple planning algorithm.

The algorithm is capable of distinguishing between clusters and noisy background data and finds an arbitrary number of clusters of arbitrary shape. These properties render the approach particularly useful for visual scene segmentation into arbitrarily shaped homogeneous regions. We present several application examples, and in order to highlight the advantages and the weaknesses of our method, we systematically compare the results with those from standard methods such as the k-means and Ward's linkage clustering. The analysis demonstrates that not only the clustering ability of the proposed algorithm is more powerful than those of the two concurrent methods, the time complexity of the method is also more modest than that of its generally used strongest competitor.

In order to utilize the gesture UI for the real-time systems with various users, the diversity robust algorithm, yet having low training/recognition complexity, is required. Meantime, dynamic time warping (DTW) has shown good performance on the simple time-series pattern recognition problems. Since DTW is based on the template matching, its processing time and accuracy depend on the number of templates and their quality, respectively. In this paper, an optimized method for online gesture UI of mobile devices is proposed which is based on the DTW and modified k-means clustering algorithm. The templates, estimated by using the modified clustering algorithm, can preserve the time varying attribute while contain diversities of the given training patterns.

The supervised fuzzy clustering algorithm [6] allows each rule to represent more than one output with different probabilities for each output. This algorithm implements k-means to initialize the fuzzy model. However, the main drawbacks of this approach are that the number of clusters is unknown and the initial positions of clusters are randomly generated. In this work, the initialization is done by the global k-means algorithm [1], which can autonomously determine the actual number of clusters needed and give a deterministic clustering result. In addition, the fast global k-means algorithm [1] is presented to improve the computation time. The model is tested on medical diagnosis benchmark data and Westland vibration data. The results obtained show that the model that uses the global k-means clustering algorithm [1] has higher accuracy when compared to a model that uses the k-means clustering algorithm. Besides that, the fast global k-means algorithm [1] also improved the computation time without degrading much the model performance.

J	Cardoso, A; Wichert, A				Cardoso, Angelo; Wichert, Andreas			Neocognitron and the Map Transformation Cascade	NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						Clustering; Hierarchical neural networks; Neocognitron; Invariant pattern recognition	VISUAL-PATTERN RECOGNITION; NEURAL NETWORK; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; SHIFT	Based on our observations of the working principles of the archetypal hierarchical neural network, Neocognitron, we propose a simplified model which we call the Map Transformation Cascade. The least complex Map Transformation Cascade can be understood as a sequence of filters, which maps and transforms the input pattern into a space where patterns in the same class are close. The output of the filters is then passed to a simple classifier, which yields a classification for the input pattern. Instead of a specifically crafted learning algorithm, the Map Transformation Cascade separates two different learning needs: Information reduction, where a clustering algorithm is more suitable (e.g., K-Means) and classification, where a supervised classifier is more suitable (e.g., nearest neighbor method). The performance of the proposed model is analyzed in handwriting recognition. The Map Transformation Cascade achieved performance similar to that of Neocognitron. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It is widely used for pattern recognition, feature extraction, vector quantization (VQ), image segmentation, function approximation, and data mining. As an unsupervised classification technique, clustering identifies some inherent structures present in a set of objects based on a similarity measure. Clustering methods can be based on statistical model identification (McLachlan & Basford, 1988) or competitive learning, In this paper, we give a comprehensive overview of competitive learning based clustering methods. Importance is attached to a number of competitive learning based clustering neural networks such as the self-organizing map (SOM), the learning vector quantization (LVQ), the neural gas, and the ART model, and clustering algorithms such as the C-means, mountain/subtractive clustering, and fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithms. Associated topics such as the under-utilization problem, fuzzy clustering, robust clustering, clustering based on non-Euclidean distance measures, supervised clustering, hierarchical clustering as well as cluster validity are also described. Two examples are given to demonstrate the use of the clustering methods. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We combined chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequencing, analysed using statistical parsimony network, with nonhierarchical K-means clustering of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) genotyping, to unravel patterns of genetic structure across the native range of Ae. geniculata. The AFLP dataset was further explored by measurement of the regional genetic diversity and the detection of isolation by distance patterns. Both cpDNA and AFLP suggest an eastern Mediterranean origin of Ae. geniculata. Two lineages have spread independently over northern and southern Mediterranean areas. Northern populations show low genetic diversity but strong phylogeographical structure among the main peninsulas, indicating a major influence of glacial cycles. By contrast, low genetic structuring and a high genetic diversity are detected in southern Mediterranean populations. Finally, we highlight human-mediated dispersal resulting in substantial introgression between resident and migrant populations. We have shown that the evolutionary trajectories of ruderal plants can be similar to those of wild species, but are interfered by human activities, promoting range expansions through increased long-distance dispersal and the creation of suitable habitats.

J	Brooks, BGJ; Cervato, C				Brooks, Bjorn-Gustaf J.; Cervato, Cinzia			A HABITAT-BASED PERSPECTIVE OF MARINE BIOGEOGRAPHY IN PASSIVE AND CONVERGENT TECTONIC SETTINGS	PALAEONTOLOGIA ELECTRONICA			English	Article						paleoecology; ecosystem paleodiversity; habitat; k-means clustering	DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION	The dominant biodiversity paradigm in the Earth sciences has been that abiotic forces such as orbital variations, bolide impacts, and volcanism, among others, are the primary drivers of extinction and biodiversification. By describing several instances when increased tectonism and biodiversity hotspots coincided, a recent study of fossil foraminifera indicated that over the past 50 million years (m.y.) the predominant driver of biodiversity has been plate tectonics. We test whether this hypothesis holds true for assemblages of marine macrofossils from temperate latitudes using one of the most comprehensive data sets of its kind, the Paleobiology Database. Our multivariate statistical approach provides a base for examining the historical biogeography of marine macrofossils and for investigating ecosystem interactions on various scales. We began by examining the biogeographical patterns across 40 phylogenetic classes of marine animal macrofossils spanning the most recent 57 m.y. in both passive and convergent tectonic settings using area-standardized alpha and beta diversity components at the species and genus level. When the diversity components of average grid cells were compared between regions, the highest alpha diversities occurred in the passive tectonic setting of the eastern United States. We tested whether this could be due to biased coverage of North American fossils by rarefying and recomputing our diversities. Although the subsequent alpha diversities were more homogeneous, eastern North America was still the most diverse. To explore the connection between this observation and ecological niche theory, we simulated paleo-habitats for each grid cell using a multivariate k-means clustering of the lithological annotations of occurrences within grid cell assemblages. Across 83,000 occurrences, the number of simulated habitat types within a grid cell was significantly correlated to the alpha diversity of that grid cell (species-level r = 0.763, genus-level r = 0.857). Further tests using rarefied subsets of occurrences did not strongly impact this correlation (species-level r = 0.679, genus-level r = 0.762). Our results, which apply to Cenozoic marine macrofossils, imply that a more robust predictor of alpha diversity across both passive and convergent tectonic settings is the diversity of paleo-habitat types. This investigation provides statistical evidence that simulated habitat types from litholgies can be used as a rudimentary analogue for ecosystem complexity, and that the abundance of habitats scales linearly with the alpha diversity of fossil assemblages.

As the number of features increases, the matching process rapidly becomes a bottleneck. This paper presents a novel method to speed up SIFT feature matching. The main idea is to extend SIFT feature by a few pairwise independent angles, which are invariant to rotation, scale and illumination changes. During feature extraction, SIFT features are classified based on their introduced angles into different clusters and stored in multidimensional table. Thus, in feature matching, only SIFT features that belong to clusters, where correct matches may be expected are compared. The performance of the proposed methods was tested on two groups of images, real-world stereo images and standard dataset images, through comparison with the performances of two state of the arte algorithms for ANN searching, hierarchical k-means and randomized kd-trees. The presented experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method extremely outperforms the two other considered algorithms. The experimental results show that the feature matching can be accelerated about 1250 times with respect to exhaustive search without losing a noticeable amount of correct matches.

J	Tsai, CF; Lin, CY				Tsai, Chih-Fong; Lin, Chia-Ying			A triangle area based nearest neighbors approach to intrusion detection	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Triangle area; k-means; k-nearest neighbors; Support vector machines	DETECTION SYSTEM; NETWORK INTRUSION; ANOMALY DETECTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; ALGORITHM	Intrusion detection is a necessary step to identify unusual access or attacks to secure internal networks. In general, intrusion detection can be approached by machine learning techniques. In literature, advanced techniques by hybrid learning or ensemble methods have been considered, and related work has shown that they are superior to the models using single machine learning techniques. This paper proposes a hybrid learning model based on the triangle area based nearest neighbors (TANN) in order to detect attacks more effectively. In TANN, the k-means clustering is firstly used to obtain cluster centers corresponding to the attack classes, respectively. Then, the triangle area by two cluster centers with one data from the given dataset is calculated and formed a new feature signature of the data. Finally, the k-NN classifier is used to classify similar attacks based on the new feature represented by triangle areas. By using KDD-Cup '99 as the simulation dataset, the experimental results show that TANN can effectively detect intrusion attacks and provide higher accuracy and detection rates, and the lower false alarm rate than three baseline models based on support vector machines, k-NN, and the hybrid centroid-based classification model by combining k-means and k-NN.

This algorithm first performs a mesh segmentation scheme, based on fusion of the well-known k-means clustering and the proposed principal plane analysis to separate the input 3D mesh into a set of disjointed polygonal regions. The boundary indexing scheme for the whole object is created by assembling local regions. Finally, the current work proposes a triangle traversal scheme to encode the connectivity and geometry information simultaneously for every patch under the guidance of the boundary indexing scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm obtains good performance in terms of compression rate and reconstruction quality. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Oil the basis of the fact that the dynamics oil networks are intensively affected by the related topology, in this paper the dynamics of excitable systems oil networks and a corresponding approach for detecting communities are discussed. Dynamical networks are formed by interacting neurons; each neuron is described using the FHN model. For noisy disturbance and appropriate coupling strength, neurons may oscillate coherently and their behavior is tightly related to the community structure. Synchronization between nodes is measured in terms of a correlation coefficient based on long time series. The correlation coefficient matrix call be used to project network topology onto a vector space. Then by the K-means cluster method, the communities can be detected. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm is effective at discovering community structure in artificial networks and real networks, especially for directed networks. The results also provide us with a deep understanding of the relationship Of function and structure for dynamical networks (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A two-tier atmospheric circulation classification scheme for the European-North Atlantic region	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH			English	Article						Circulation classification; Europe; Sea-level pressure; Cluster analysis; Temporal changes; Temperature extreme events	SYNOPTIC CLIMATOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION; LARGE-SCALE CIRCULATION; WEATHER-TYPES; TEMPORAL FLUCTUATIONS; HEAT WAVES; PATTERNS; VARIABILITY; CLIMATE; PRECIPITATION; GCM	A two-tier classification of large-scale atmospheric circulation was developed for the European-North-Atlantic domain. The classification was constructed using a combination of principal components and k-means cluster analysis applied to reanalysis fields of mean sea-level pressure for 1951-2004. Separate classifications were developed for the winter, spring, summer, and fall seasons. For each season, the two classification tiers were identified independently, such that the definition of one tier does not depend on the other tier having already been defined. The first tier of the classification is comprised of supertype patterns. These broad-scale circulation classes are useful for generalized analyses such as investigations of the temporal trends in circulation frequency and persistence. The second, more detailed tier consists of circulation types and is useful for numerous applied research questions regarding the relationships between large-scale circulation and local and regional climate. Three to five supertypes and up to 19 circulation types were identified for each season. An intuitive nomenclature scheme based on the physical entities (i.e., anomaly centers) which dominate the specific patterns was used to label each of the supertypes and types. Two example applications illustrate the potential usefulness of a two-tier classification. In the first application, the temporal variability of the supertypes was evaluated. In general, the frequency and persistence of supertypes dominated by anticyclonic circulation increased during the study period, whereas the supertypes dominated by cyclonic features decreased in frequency and persistence. The usefulness of the derived circulation types was exemplified by an analysis of the circulation associated with heat waves and cold spells reported at several cities in Bulgaria. These extreme temperature events were found to occur with a small number of circulation types, a finding that can be helpful in understanding past variability and projecting future changes in the occurrence of extreme weather and climate events.

Such relationships may be represented in the form of networks, which usually require disassembly into smaller manageable units, or clusters, to facilitate interpretation. Several graph-clustering algorithms that may be used to visualize biological networks are available. However, only some of these support weighted edges, and none provides good control of cluster sizes, which is crucial for comprehensible visualization of large networks. We constructed an interactive coexpression network for the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome using a novel Heuristic Cluster Chiseling Algorithm (HCCA) that supports weighted edges and that may control average cluster sizes. Comparative clustering analyses demonstrated that the HCCA performed as well as, or better than, the commonly used Markov, MCODE, and k-means clustering algorithms. We mapped MapMan ontology terms onto coexpressed node vicinities of the network, which revealed transcriptional organization of previously unrelated cellular processes. We further explored the predictive power of this network through mutant analyses and identified six new genes that are essential to plant growth. We show that the HCCA-partitioned network constitutes an ideal "cartographic" platform for visualization of correlation networks. This approach rapidly provides network partitions with relative uniform cluster sizes on a genome-scale level and may thus be used for correlation network layouts also for other species.

Plasticity of Arabidopsis Root Gravitropism throughout a Multidimensional Condition Space Quantified by Automated Image Analysis	PLANT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; CURVATURE PRODUCTION; GENETIC-VARIATION; REACTION NORMS; THALIANA; GRAVITY; GROWTH; PLANTS; MECHANISMS; EVOLUTION	Plant development is genetically determined but it is also plastic, a fundamental duality that can be investigated provided large number of measurements can be made in various conditions. Plasticity of gravitropism in wild-type Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seedling roots was investigated using automated image acquisition and analysis. A bank of computer-controlled charge-coupled device cameras acquired images with high spatiotemporal resolution. Custom image analysis algorithms extracted time course measurements of tip angle and growth rate. Twenty-two discrete conditions defined by seedling age (2, 3, or 4 d), seed size (extra small, small, medium, or large), and growth medium composition (simple or rich) formed the condition space sampled with 1,216 trials. Computational analyses including dimension reduction by principal components analysis, classification by k-means clustering, and differentiation by wavelet convolution showed distinct response patterns within the condition space, i.e. response plasticity. For example, 2-d-old roots (regardless of seed size) displayed a response time course similar to those of roots from large seeds (regardless of age). Enriching the growth medium with nutrients suppressed response plasticity along the seed size and age axes, possibly by ameliorating a mineral deficiency, although analysis of seeds did not identify any elements with low levels on a per weight basis. Characterizing relationships between growth rate and tip swing rate as a function of condition cast gravitropism in a multidimensional response space that provides new mechanistic insights as well as conceptually setting the stage for mutational analysis of plasticity in general and root gravitropism in particular.

In these languages, a developer focuses on the flow of data through the computation and these systems free the developer from the complexities of low-level, thread-oriented concurrency primitives. This simplification comes at a cost traditional data-oriented approaches restrict the mutation of state and, in practice, the types of data structures a program can effectively use. Bamboo borrows from work in typestate and software transactions to relax the traditional restrictions of data-oriented programming models to support mutation of arbitrary data structures. We have implemented a compiler for Bamboo which generates code for the TILEPro64 many-core processor. We have evaluated this implementation on six benchmarks: Tracking, a feature tracking algorithm from computer vision; KMeans, a K-means clustering algorithm; Monte Carlo, a Monte Carlo simulation; Filter Bank, a multi-channel filter bank; Fractal, a Mandelbrot set computation; and Series, a Fourier series computation. We found that our compiler generated implementations that obtained speedups ranging from 26.2 x to 61.6 x when executed on 62 cores.

In such systems, each node holds some data value, e.g., a local sensor read, and a concise picture of the global system state needs to be obtained. In resource-constrained environments like sensor networks, this needs to be done without collecting all the data at any location, i.e., in a distributed manner. To this end, we define the distributed classification problem, in which numerous interconnected nodes compute a classification of their data, i.e., partition these values into multiple collections, and describe each collection concisely. We present a generic algorithm that solves the distributed classification problem and may be implemented in various topologies, using different classification types. For example, the generic algorithm can be instantiated to classify values according to distance, like the famous k-means classification algorithm. However, the distance criterion is often not sufficient to provide good classification results. We present an instantiation of the generic algorithm that describes the values as a Gaussian Mixture (a set of weighted normal distributions), and uses machine learning tools for classification decisions. Simulations show the robustness and speed of this algorithm. We prove that any implementation of the generic algorithm converges over any connected topology, classification criterion and collection representation, in fully asynchronous settings.

Its main ingredient is the algorithm for semi-supervised data clustering using cluster size constraints which implements several improvements over existing k-means constrained clustering algorithms. First, it allows for a larger set of userdefined cluster size constraints of different types (lower- and upper-bound constraints). Second, it allows for dynamic re-assignment of predefined constraints to clusters in iterative cluster computation/optimization, thus improving the results of constrained clustering. Third, it allows for expert-guided cluster optimization achieved by combining constrained clustering and data visualization, which enables finer-grained expert's control over the clustering process, leading to further improvements of the quality of obtained clustering solutions. Incorporating data. visualization into the clustering process allows the user to select referential points which act as constraint anchors in the course of iterative cluster computation. The proposed semi-supervised constrained clustering methodology has been implemented using a service-oriented data mining environment Orange4WS and evaluated on different document corpora.

An important problem in this area is milling hot clusters of similar anomalies for system management. A hot anomaly cluster is defined as a largest-sized group of similar anomalies, whose similarity satisfies some user-specified constraints. While, some major anomalies have common symptoms and are shared by several hot clusters, these clusters do not have to be disjoint. So this problem could not be easily solved by existing clustering algorithms, such as k-means and EM. In this paper we propose a novel heuristic clustering algorithm, named Hot Clustering (HC), for mining these patterns. The key idea of HC is to group neighboring anomalies into hot clusters based on some heuristic rules. To validate our approach, we perform the experiment on bug reports from Bugzilla database by k-means, EM and HC. The experimental results show that our approach is both efficient and effective for this problem.

Morphological change during aging below A(1) tempearture was examined in terms of Gaussian(K)/mean curvatures(H), genus and Euler characteristics based on 3D images. The holes presentnaturally grown cementite lamella caused shape instability andinduced shape evolution of the lamellar structure during spheroidization. 3D visualization demonstrated that the intrinsic holes played an important role in the initiation and development of pearlitespheroidization. The hole coalescence and expansion causedthe breakup of large cementite lamellae into several long narrow ribbons. H-K plot actually suggested that the number of thses holes decreased with increasing aging period. In addition, small cementite particles and narrow rod cementite decreased during aging. These microstractural evolutions were discussed from the view point of ferrite/cementite interfacial energy.

The proposed tracking system, based on the track-before-detect approach, is designed to track and detect multiple targets from a sequence of a vision sensor under low SNR conditions. The system achieves multiple point target detection in three steps. The first step is morphological filtering process based on grayscale morphology for extracting intensive point-like features within image frame. Such filters are derived from combinations of dilation and erosion operations. The second step is target detection and tracking based on a dynamic programming approach. The dynamic programming approach accumulates scores of the pixels from the image sequence of morphological filter outputs along possible target trajectories. The scores for the potential target trajectories can be accumulated by considering the temporally and spatially uncorrelated noise and smoothly moving targets with only gradually changes in direction and speed. The decision of the target presence and position is made in the third step with threshold parameters set to achieve appropriate probabilities of detection and false alarm. In this step, K-means algorithm is used for identifying position and number of targets in two-dimensional space. The proposed track-before-detect approach using K-means clustering algorithm is applied to several image sequences containing different scenarios and noise conditions.

Furthermore, using this method can obtain actual outdoor propagation model fitting for TD-SCDMA network. Simulation results indicate that the calculating complexity is reduced obviously; After and before propagation environment classification the maximum error of forecasting data calculated by tuned model reduces by 18.5%, and the tuned model matches the local ratio propagation environment much better.

In this paper, in order to overcome the shortcoming, a new "Vanish Circle K-means" clustering algorithm that can estimate the mixing matrix more effectively is proposed, combined with time-frequency analysis to achieve the instantaneous linear aliasing blind separation signals and obtain a good separation effect.

The research explores a multi-user's behavior analysis and program recommendation using Bluetooth cell phones and a Playstation 3 working as a set-top box connected to a digital TV network with return channel or an IPTV network. Supposing that every viewer has a Bluetooth enabled cell phone, each mobile will identify one spectator to the set-top box wirelessly. Since the set-top box used is a Playstation 3, it is a full computer with IBM Cell BE processor capable of executing computer-intensive algorithms. This device was used to store the history of programs watched by every person near the TV connected to the set-top box, and to identify their profile and preferences using data mining algorithms. The program recommendation system is a hybrid of a content-based approach with a collaborative approach using a rate system, and uses the k-Means and k-NN data mining algorithms modified to explore the Cell BE features.

Within this context, traffic prediction is essential for the network operator. Traffic prediction can be undertaken based on link traffic or on origin-destination (OD) traffic which presents better results. This work investigates a methodology for traffic prediction based on multidimensional OD traffic, focusing on the stage of short-term traffic prediction using Principal Components Analysis as a technique for dimensionality reduction and a Local Linear Model based on K-means as a technique for prediction and trend analysis. The results validated with data on a real network present a satisfactory margin of error for use in practical situations.

However, for large and high-dimension image databases, it is obvious that this retrieval method has been unable to meet efficiency. It is more important that the image database should be preprocessed and establish indexing to improve retrieval efficiency. Focus on the hierarchical clustering algorithm's high computational complexity, this paper introduces ART2 clustering algorithm for image database preprocessing, which reduces the computational complexity, and makes the Algorithm more efficient. In order to avoid the clustering center offset of ART2, K-means algorithm is used to calculate the pattern center, improving the accuracy of clustering. Compared by retrieval efficiency and retrieval result, it is convincingly proved that hierarchical index structure based on clustering is efficient and applicable in CBIR.

In this paper, a Fuzzy C Means (FCM) clustering algorithm integrating the complementary physical information and statistical property contained in both polarimetric and interferometric data, is used for POLInSAR classification. At first, the area dominated by volume scattering is extracted from polarimetric information using unsupervised H-A-Alpha k-means Wishart classifier with the physical scattering mechanisms of different terrain types; and the volume scattering area (forest area) is further segmented in the feature space of the relative optimal interferometric coherence spectrum A(1) and A(2). Then a robust unsupervised fuzzy C means (FCM) classifier initialized with the results of the segmentation is applied to the polarimetric interferometric coherency data sets corresponding to the volume scattering area. This will not only take into account the scattering mechanisms of the data, so that the results of the classification have definite physical meaning, but also avoid the problem that the initial value of FCM algorithm is difficult to identify. The proposed method is evaluated and compared with k-means Wishart classifier using repeat pass E-SAR L band polarimetric interferometric SAR data and the corresponding auxiliary image. Preliminary results show that the proposed method has better performance.

However, it is an ill-defined problem due to the high degree of freedom exhibited by the human body. In this paper, we study both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms to recognise human posture in image sequences. In particular, we are interested in a specific set of postures which are representative of typical applications found in video analytics. The algorithms chosen for this paper are K-means, artificial neural network, self organizing maps and particle swarm optimization. Experimental results have shown that the supervised learning algorithms outperform the unsupervised learning algorithms in terms of the number of correctly classified postures. Our future work will focus on detecting abnormal behaviour based on these recognised static postures.

This component has been produced in large amounts and has been a major income source for a case study company. The manufacturing process of the hard disk drive arm, especially the machining process, is highly complicated and also a main factor of defining the usability of the final product. However, during dimension inspections, many defected parts were detected, resulting in an overall decrease in productivity, sales and profit. Normally, parts are randomly chosen from each CNC machine to be inspected. If there is a defective product, that machine would be shut down and the tool settings will be reset. If the machine that has been producing defective products is inspected late into the inspection shifts, it would result in a considerable amount of defective parts produced before any corrective actions can be made. Therefore, this study presents an application of the integration between Multiple Attribute Decision Making (MADM) and Data Mining (DM) to define the inspection order for tooling adjustment of which the machines with higher risk of producing defective parts can be inspected and corrected before those with lower risk. The methodology is as follows. First, raw measurement data from each machine was collected and noise elimination was performed using the anomaly clustering method. Secondly, K-means clustering, after a machine performance hypothesis test to confirm that the performance of each machine is not equal, was opted for dividing the raw data into three clusters, consisting of good, normal, and bad machines. Finally, a daily CNC machine priority assessment model (CNC-MPAM) is developed based on the Simple Additive Weight (SAW) technique, resulting in a machine performance score for optimal ordering of machine tooling adjustment. Experimental results suggested that this proposed method is capable of machine adjustment ordering so that defective prone machines can be serviced sooner, reducing defective parts produced and improving overall productivity.

However, most techniques presently available require a good level of expertise in order to apply them successfully. Therefore, there is a demand for techniques that can make decisions on the running health of a machine automatically and without the need for a specialist to examine the data and diagnose the problem. Artificial neural networks (ANN), fuzzy c-means (FCM), hierchical and partitional clustering, and support vector machines (SVM) have been applied in automated detection and diagnosis of machine conditions. Most of these methods require training based on experimental data both from the healthy as well as the defective machine. This fact significantly diminishes their practical applicability. For this reason, the well established K-means clustering partitional method is proposed in this paper, due to its ease of programming and because it accomplishes a good trade-off between achieved performance and computational complexity. The first step in K-means clustering is finding a set of initial centers. The algorithm is significantly sensitive to the initial randomly selected clusters' centers. In this paper, in order to overcome this limitation, the initial centers are selected by features extracted from signals simulating the dynamic behavior of bearings under normal condition or under special types of defects (outer or inner race defect). After the selection of the centers of the clusters, the method can be directly implemented to signals measured from the industrial environment. As shown in three different industrial cases, each containing a set of 5 successive measurements following the evolution of a defect, the method is able to identify and appropriately classify the bearing defect. Critical to the success of the method is the type of features extracted from the signals. Some features seem to be irrelevant and redundant in fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, resulting to low diagnosis accuracy. Thus, in order to increase the effectiveness and improve the simplicity of the procedure, a set of features is proposed in this paper, able to clearly characterize the existence and the type of the defect. These features are mostly based on appropriately selected frequency domain parameters. Comparing the proposed frequency domain features to traditional time domain statistical features, indicates the relevance and superiority of the proposed feature set, resulting in 100% success in all 15 measurements of all 3 test cases.

Weights of all features are equally set in most K-means algorithms when evaluating dissimilarity during clustering. However, the practice shows that the data clustering effects often depend on a specific subset of all features, that is, the contribution degree of different features vary in clustering. In this paper, to improve the clustering effect of K-means, the features were successively weighted by using the method of Fisher's linear discriminant ratio according to their contribution degree in clustering and the data were clustered. The experiment did on synthetic and real data showed that the method had superiority over other similar weighting K-means clustering algorithm in the clustering effects.

As observing clusters with very similar mean vectors but differing only on the covariance structure is not natural for remote sensing objects, a modification was proposed to avoid keeping clusters whose centres are too close. Another modification were also proposed to improve the EM initialization by providing results of the well known K-means algorithm as seed points and to provide rules for decreasing the number of modes once a certain a priori cluster probability is very low. Experiments for classifying Quickbird high resolution images of an urban region were accomplished. It was observed that this modified EM algorithm presented the best agreement with a reference map ploted on the scene when compared with standard K-means and SUM results.

Sampling for High-Resolution Soil Mapping	PROXIMAL SOIL SENSING	Progress in Soil Science		English	Proceedings Paper	1st Global Workshop on High Resolution Digital Soil Sensing and Mapping	2008	Sydney, AUSTRALIA	Univ Australias Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, Environm Earth Sci Int Pty Ltd, Int Union Soil Sci, Australian Collaborat Land Evaluat Program	Univ Sydney Fac Agr, Food & Nat Resources	Soil sampling; Calibration; Proximal sensing; Latin hypercube sampling; Fuzzy k-means; Cost modeling	VARIABLES	When doing sensing for high-resolution soil mapping, one has to decide on the disposition of the sensor, which is a special case of spatial sampling. To optimise the pattern of measurements, a cost model and a quality model are proposed. The quality model reflects the coverage of the geographic space, and this is illustrated with some practical experiments. Optimisation of sensing patterns is worked out for two different types of sensing equipment. If the sensor variable differs from the target (management or decision) variable, then a model is needed to predict the target variable from the ancillary data. So in that case, one also has to decide how and where to sample for calibration data. This 'calibration sampling' differs from 'sensor sampling', as now coverage of the predictor space rather than the geographic space is important. In addition, the handling of extremes is an issue here. Existing methods for calibration sampling are reviewed and a suggestion is made for a new approach, based on fuzzy cluster analysis, which might avoid some of the shortcomings of existing methods.

J	Wojcik, W; Kisala, P				Wojcik, Waldemar; Kisala, Piotr			The method for the recovery of the apodization function of the fiber Bragg gratings on the basis of its spectra	PRZEGLAD ELEKTROTECHNICZNY			Polish	Article						multidimensional and multicriteria classification; fiber Bragg gratings; apodization; optoelectronic sensors	DISPERSION COMPENSATION	A new method for the recovery of apodization function of fiber Bragg gratings (FBG) was presented in this paper. There were two considered cases. First case concerns the situation in which the apodization function equation is known. In this case we have to select only apodization function parameters. The second case concerns the situation in which apodization function equation isn't known. In this case we have to recover the equation of apodization function and also we have to find parameters of this function. In the first part of the article the hypothetical function, which were generated for different parameters, were presented. Then we analyzed the influence of the function and its parameters change on the grating spectra. In the next part of the article results of the cluster analysis by the use of k-means method were presented. The use of k-means method were based on a Euclidean, Manhattan and Czebyszew measure between the objects for the aim of apodization function classification on the base of its spectra. The estimation of apodization function parameters was possible by the use of Gauss-Newton algorithm. In the article exploitation results of apodization function classification were presented with and without the testing set and training set.

Considering K-means with respect to the probabilistic model, requires incorporating of a probabilistic distance, which provides us with measure of similarity between two probability distributions, as the distance measure. We use various kinds of probabilistic distances in order to evaluate their effectiveness when applied to the algorithm with the proposed model of the analyzed data. Further, we report the results of experiments with the discussed clustering algorithm in the field of sound recognition and choose these probabilistic distances, which correspond to the highest clustering performance. As a reference technique, we used the traditional K-means algorithm with the most commonly employed Euclidean distance. Our experiments have shown that the presented method outperforms the traditional K-means algorithm, regardless of the statistical distance applied.

Parenting practices are associated with fruit and vegetable consumption in pre-school children	PUBLIC HEALTH NUTRITION			English	Article						Fruit; Vegetables; Pre-school children; Parenting; Feeding; Parenting practices; Diet; Negative affectivity	AFRICAN-AMERICAN; DIETARY-INTAKE; BEHAVIOR QUESTIONNAIRE; SOCIAL DESIRABILITY; YOUNG-CHILDREN; SHORT FORMS; STYLE; AVAILABILITY; OVERWEIGHT; CHILDHOOD	Objective: Parents may influence children's fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption in many ways, but research has focused primarily on counterproductive parenting practices, such as restriction and pressure to eat. The present study aimed to assess the association of diverse parenting practices to promote F&V and its consumption among pre-school children. Design: An exploratory analysis was performed on cross-sectional data from 755 Head Start pre-school children and their parents collected in 2004-5. Data included parent practices to facilitate child F&V consumption (grouped into five categories); parent-reported dietary intake of their child over 3d; and a number of potential correlates. K-means cluster analysis assigned parents to groups with similar use of the food parenting practice categories. Stepwise linear regression analyses investigated the association of parent clusters with children's consumption of F&V, after controlling for potential confounding factors. Results: A three-cluster solution provided the best fit (R(2) = 0.62), with substantial differences in the use of parenting practices. The cluster were labelled Indiscriminate Food Parenting, Non-directive Food Parenting and Low-involved Food Parenting. Non-directive parents extensively used enhanced availability and teachable moments' practices, but less firm discipline practices than the other clusters, and were significantly associated with child F&V intake (standardized beta = 0.09, P < 0.1; final model R(2) = 0.17) after controlling for confounders, including parental feeding styles. Conclusions: Parents use a variety of parenting practices, beyond pressuring to eat and restrictive practices, to promote F&V intake in their young child. Evaluating the use of combinations of practices may provide a better understanding of parental influences on children's F&V intake.

The GA techniques differ in their encoding of the clustering problem using either a class id for each object (GAIE), medoids to assign objects to the class associated with the nearest medoid (GAME), or parameters for multivariate distributions that describe each cluster (GAPE). For the simple Iris dataset, all algorithms except GAIE obtained results with comparable accuracy, but k-means and EM had more runs with inferior results compared to GAME and GAPE. For the more complex Glass dataset, the results for GAME and GAPE were superior compared to k-means, EM and GAIE regarding their accuracy and variance of the results for repeated runs. None of the algorithms was superior for the most complex dataset (Vowel). We conclude that GAs in clustering are a valuable alternative to k-means and EM, but that the choice of the problem representation is crucial.

These texts are demonstrating in an electronic documents format hosted on the web. The documents exchanged using special forms in an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) environment. Using web text mining approaches to mine documents in EDI environment could be new challenging guidelines in web text mining. Applying text-mining approaches to discover knowledge previously unknown patters retrieved from the web documents by using partitioned cluster analysis methods such as k- means methods using Euclidean distance measure algorithm for EDI text document datasets is unique area of research these days. Our experiments employ the standard K-means algorithm on EDI text documents dataset that most commonly used in electronic interchange. We also report some results using text mining clustering application solution called WEKA. This study will provide high quality services to any organization that is willing to use the system.

These rankings are usually based on combinations of arbitrarily weighted performance factors. This method has a number of shortcomings. To overcome these shortcomings, a cluster-based approach to university performance evaluation is proposed. Different data mining techniques are used to analyse the performance of UK universities based on the same data used to compile The Sunday Times University Guide 2010 league table and the results are compared with the original ranking. It is shown that clustering techniques, such as Self-Organizing Map or the k-means algorithm, can be used to successfully classify universities in terms of performance.

Avoiding complex and time-consuming implementations, the proposed approach use the advantages of the discrimination measure of the F-ratio and the fast convergence rate of a k-means algorithm in the feature selection problem. An extremely efficient set of only four features per sensor is selected for AE sources localization using a radial basis function (RBF) neural network (NN) giving error-free localization accuracy. In the presence of additive white Gaussian noise, different type of information has been selected from the original set of 90 features. Extensive experiments show that even in the very noisy environment of 0dB SNR, a small set of four features can be used for robust neural localization of AE sources giving localization rates better than 94%.

These factors were obtained of applying the Ordered Probit model on a sample of 102 farms, located in Jesus Enrique Lossada, La Canada de Urdaneta y Rosario de Perija Municipalities of the Zulia State, Venezuela. The sample was previously stratified in three technological groups: Low (TG(1)), Middle (TG(2)) and High (TG(3)) by the K-means algorithm. The geographic locations of the farm, educative level of the farmer and farm size resulted to be the determinant factors. These factors were utilized to evaluate their effect on the probability due to the changes of original conditions of the farm. These changes in the probability are called sensitivity. The results showed that there is a positive relationship between the determinant factors and technological level of the farm. Therefore, a farmer with university degree, his or her farm is located in Rosario de Perija with more than 200 animal units. In addition, the farmer utilizes the frequently technical assistance; it is much more probably that this farmer tends more innovated and reaches a higher technological level than the TG(1).

Both rough and fuzzy clustering are less restrictive than conventional clustering. Fuzzy clustering memberships are more descriptive than rough clustering. In some cases, descriptive fuzzy clustering may be advantageous, while in other cases it may lead to information overload. This paper provides an experimental comparison of both the clustering techniques and describes a procedure for conversion from fuzzy membership clustering to rough clustering. However, such a conversion is not always necessary, especially if one only needs lower and upper approximations. Experiments also show that descriptive fuzzy clustering may not always (particularly for high dimensional objects) produce results that are as accurate as direct application of rough clustering. We present analysis of the results from both the techniques.

The system has been developed using the SwingX-WS library, and incorporates functionalities such as unsupervised classification of image portions selected by the user (at the maximum zoom level) using ISODATA and k-Means, and supervised classification using the Minimum Distance and Maximum Likelihood, followed by spatial post-processing based on majority voting. Selected regions in the classified portion are used to train a maximum likelihood classifier able to map larger image areas in a manner transparent to the user. The system also retrieves areas containing regions similar to those already classified. An experimental validation of the proposed system has been conducted by comparing the obtained classification results with those provided by commercial software, such as the popular Research Systems ENVI package.

The paper presents a new, clustering based approach, called Image Co-Clustering. The term co-clustering is related to cosegmentation, where two or more images are segmented simultaneously. The proposed approach simultaneously clusters feature vector sets from two images. Generated clusters represent similar parts in both images. To have visually coherent clusters, spatial constrains should be imposed onto the clustering algorithm. The key difficulty is to impose spatial constrains in such a way, that the same objects having different locations, rotations and scales on two images are captured in the same cluster. The proposed spatial constraining is called partial spatial constraining.

This paper presents a license plate detection prototype system for a Macao law enforcement department using Modest Adaboost combined with template matching technique. Firstly, a machine learning algorithm, based on Modest AdaBoost which mostly aims for better generalization capability and resistance to overfitting, was applied to find out candidate license plates over the input images. In the second stage, template matching technique was employed to verify the license plate appearances in order to reduce false positives. This paper shows that the AdaBoost algorithm, which was originally used for face detection, has successfully been applied to solve the problems of license plate detection. Experimental results demonstrate high accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.

In general, solutions to the NP-hard problems involve searches through vast spaces of possible solutions and evolutionary algorithms have been a success. In this paper, we explore one such approach which is hardly known outside the search heuristic field - the Particle Swarm Optimisation+k-means (PSOk) for this purpose. The proposed hybrid algorithm consists of two modules, the PSO module and the k-means module. For the initial stage, the PSO module is executed for a short period to search for the clusters centroid locations. Succeeding to the PSO module is the refining stage where the detected locations are transferred to the k-means module for refinement and generation of the final optimal clustering solution. Experimental results on two challenging datasets and a comparison with other hybrid PSO methods has demonstrated and validated the effectiveness of the proposed solution in terms of precision and computational complexity.

Image retrieval using Feature Extraction based on Shape and Texture	SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DIGITAL IMAGE PROCESSING	Proceedings of SPIE-The International Society for Optical Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Digital Image Processing	FEB 26-28, 2010	Singapore, SINGAPORE	Int Assoc Comp Sci & Informat Technol		Image Retrieval; Feature Extraction; Indexing; Content Categorization; Compression		Data mining refers to the process of extracting knowledge that is of interest to the user. Traditional data mining techniques have been developed mainly for structured data types. The image data type does not belong to this structured category, suitable for interpretation by a machine and hence the mining of image data is a challenging problem. Accordingly, in image mining, an image retrieval system is a computer system that can browse, search and retrieve images from a large database of digital images. This research work is aimed at compression and retrieval of images from large image archives. A Kohonen Self Organization Map approach using content categorization, including feature level clustering, is developed to provide a differential compression scheme. It ensures that the visual features are mapped to codebooks, which significantly speed up content-based retrieval. The interaction between compression and content indexing are proposed, which include techniques for feature extraction, indexing, and categorization. K-means clustering algorithm is used to build the feature cluster. This approach leads to the similarity matching based on shape and texture, which supports functions like "query by example". Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the compression ratio compared to VQ. The average retrieval time is less than 2seconds, which is proved to be efficient.

Most current intrusion detection systems focus on hybrid supervised and unsupervised machine learning technologies. The related work has demonstrated that they can get superior performance than applying single machine learning algorithm in detection model. Besides, with the scrutiny of related works, feature selecting and representing techniques are also essential in pursuit of high efficiency and effectiveness. Performance of specified attack type detection should also be improved and evaluated. In this paper, we incorporate information gain (IG) method for selecting more discriminative features and triangle area based support vector machine (TASVM) by combining k-means clustering algorithm and SVM classifier to detect attacks. Our system achieves accuracy of 99.83%, detection rate of 99.88% and false alarm rate of 2.99% on the 10% of KDD CUP 1999 evaluation data set. We also achieve a better detection performance for specific attack types concerning precision and recall.

They consist of high dimensional datasets, which challenge conventional clustering methods. The data's high dimensionality calls for Self Organizing Maps (SOMs) to cluster DNA micro-array data. The DNA micro-array dataset are stored in huge biological databases for several purposes [1]. The proposed methods are based on the idea of selecting a gene subset to distinguish all classes, it will be more effective to solve a multi-class problem, and we will propose a genetic programming (GP) based approach to analyze multi-class micro-array datasets. This biological dataset will be derived from multiple biological databases. The procedure responsible for extracting datasets called DNA-Aggregator. We will design a biological aggregator, which aggregates various datasets via DNA micro-array community-developed ontology based upon the concept of semantic Web for integrating and exchanging biological data. Our aggregator is composed of modules that retrieve the data from various biological databases. It will also enable queries by other applications to recognize the genes. The genes will be categorized in groups based on a classification method, which collects similar expression patterns. Using a clustering method such as k-mean is required either to discover the groups of similar objects from the biological database to characterize the underlying data distribution.

To get the maximum benefit of computational power from the multi-core architecture, we need a new design on existing algorithms and software. In this paper we propose the parallelization of the well-known k-means clustering algorithm. We employ a single program multiple data (SPMD) approach based on a message passing model. Sending and receiving messages between a master and the concurrently created process are done in an asynchronous manner. Therefore, the implementation can be highly parallel and fault tolerant. The experimental results demonstrate considerable speedup rate of the proposed parallel k-means clustering method, compared to the serial k-means approach.

A generic framework for colour texture segmentation	SENSOR REVIEW			English	Article						Image processing; Adaptive system theory; Colours technology; Cluster analysis; Smoothing methods	FEATURE DISTRIBUTIONS; UNSUPERVISED SEGMENTATION; CLASSIFICATION; IMAGES; INFORMATION	Purpose The purpose of this paper is to propose a generic framework based on the colour and the texture features for colour-textured image segmentation. The framework can be applied to any real-world applications for appropriate interpretation. Design/methodology/approach The framework derives the contributions of colour and texture in image segmentation. Local binary pattern and an unsupervised k-means clustering are used to cluster pixels in the chrominance plane. An unsupervised segmentation method is adopted. A quantitative estimation of colour and texture performance in segmentation is presented. The proposed method is tested using different mosaic and natural images and other image database used in computer vision. The framework is applied to three different applications namely, Irish script on screen images, skin cancer images and sediment profile imagery to demonstrate the robustness of the framework. Findings The inclusion of colour and texture as distributions of regions provided a good discrimination of the colour and the texture. The results indicate that the incorporation of colour information enhanced the texture analysis techniques and the methodology proved effective and efficient. Originality/value The novelty lies in the development of a generic framework using both colour and texture features for image segmentation and the different applications from various fields.

Reverse Annotation Based Retrieval from Large Document Image Collections	SIGIR 2010: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 33RD ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL ACM SIGIR CONFERENCE ON RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL			English	Proceedings Paper	33rd Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval	JUL 19-23, 2010	Geneva, SWITZERLAND	Special Interest Grp Informat Retrieval, Assoc Comp Machinery, Baidu, Google, Microsoft Res, Yahoo, Informat Retrieval Fac, IBM Res, FNSNF, Swiss Natl Sci Fdn		Document Images; Recognition-free; Scalability		A number of projects are dedicated to creating digital libraries from scanned books, such as Google Books, UDL, Digital Library of India (DLI), etc. The ability to search in the content of document images is essential for the usability and popularity of these DLs. In this work, we aim toward building a retrieval system over 120K document images coming from 1000 scanned books of Telugu literature. This is a challenge because: i) OCRs are not robust enough for Indian languages, especially the Telugu script, ii) the document images contain large number of degradations and artifacts, iii) scalability to large collections is hard. Moreover, users expect that the search system accept text queries and retrieve relevant results in interactive times. We propose a Reverse Annotation framework [1], that labels word-images by their equivalent text label in the offline phase. Reverse Annotation applies a retrieval based approach to recognition. Unlike traditional annotation/recognition that identifies keywords for data, Reverse Annotation identifies data that corresponds to a given keyword. It first selects a set of keywords which are considered useful for labeling and retrieval, such as those that repeat often, and ignoring stop-words and rare-words. Exemplars are obtained for each word from a crude OCR or human annotations. The labels are then propagated across the rest of the collection by matching words in the image-feature space. Since such a matching is computationally expensive, scalability is achieved using a fast approximate nearest neighbor technique based on Hierarchical K-Means. Once text labels are assigned, each document image is considered a bag-of-words over the labeled keywords. A standard search engine is used to build a search index for quick online retrieval. An example query and the retrieved results are shown in Figure 1. We are unaware of any conventional OCRs which can retrieve such images for the given query. There are three major contributions of our work: i) recognizing the entire document collection together, instead of one-at-a-time; this means that the repetition of words in the test set is effectively used for improving accuracy, ii) speeding up recognition by clustering multiple instances of a given word, iii) recognising at the word-level, avoiding the pitfalls of character segmentation and recognition. Other OCR techniques that use word-level context still rely on inaccurate component-level classification. [GRAPHICS] Using the techniques developed from this work, we were able to successfully build a retrieval system over our challenging dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest collection of document images that has been made searchable for any Indian language. Our algorithm is easily scalable to larger collections, and directly applicable to documents from other language scripts. The first issue to discuss, is the fraction of word-images that remain unrecognized at the end of the Reverse Annotation phase. Rare-words, nouns etc. are not labeled in the test set. It is important to estimate the cost of not being able to answer such queries. If this cost is indeed high, we need to explore methods to label such infrequently occurring words in the collection. Needless to say, such methods should be computationally efficient without compromising on accuracy. The other major issue to discuss is the evaluation of retrieval results. The true recall of the retrieval system cannot be computed, since it is impossible to identify every occurrence of the given query in such large data. Questions to be considered include: whether precision alone is a sufficient indicator of retrieval performance; whether there is some better document-level effectiveness assessment possible; and how best to estimate the relative satisfaction of the user's information need.

However, the number of components in the mixture distribution tends to grow rapidly when multiple GMMs are combined. In order to keep the computational complexity bounded, it is necessary to approximate a Gaussian mixture by one with reduced number of components. Gaussian mixture reduction is traditionally conducted by recursively selecting two components that appear to be most similar to each other and merging them. Different definitions on similarity measure have been used in literature. For the case of one-dimensional Gaussian mixtures, K-means algorithms and some variations are recently proposed to cluster Gaussian mixture components in groups, use a center component to represent all in each group, readjust parameters in the center components, and finally perform weight optimization. In this paper, we focus on multi-dimensional Gaussian mixture models. With a variety of reduction algorithms and possible combinations, we developed a hybrid algorithm with constraint optimized weight adaptation to minimize the integrated squared error (ISE). In additions, with extensive simulations, we showed that the proposed algorithm provides an efficient and effective Gaussian mixture reduction performance in various random scenarios.	[Chen, H.

Biodiversity, visual landscape, water systems, and different forms of forest use are now better taken into account. The objectives, outdoor recreation motives, and attitudes towards the present forest management activities of the non-industrial private forest owners called family forest owners in this article, whose forest holdings are located in northern Finland, were studied. In addition, a forest owner typology based on the above-mentioned motives, objectives, and attitudes was created, and the relationship between the typology and the forest owners' background was tested. Principal component analysis, log-linear models, canonical correlations, and K-means cluster analysis were used in the data analysis. The results showed that especially commercial timber production, but also multiple-use forestry, is important for forest owners. Non-timber products such as game, berries, and forest mushrooms were considered more important than biodiversity, conservation of endangered species, tourism, and reindeer herding. The current, more ecological forest management activities were widely accepted by the owners. The changes had been perceived in the forest management activities. Close relationships were found between the objectives, attitudes and motives of the forest owners. Those owners who emphasized ecological tourism and multiple-use forestry, more frequently accepted detailed conservation and other "softer" management methods than those who emphasized commercial timber production. Typologies, called conservationists, timber producers, and multi-objective forest owners, were identified. Forest owner's education and source of income were closely related to their typology. Highly educated forest owners and those who gained their money from tourism belonged to the groups named conservationists or multi-objective owners, whereas those who lived on forestry income represented timber producers.

EPIC: Efficient Integration of Partitional Clustering Algorithms for Classification	SIMULATED EVOLUTION AND LEARNING	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference of Simulated Evolution and Learning	DEC 01-04, 2010	Kanpur, INDIA	Golden Jubilee Comm, IIT Kanpur, Dept Sci & Technol New Delhi, Council Sci & Ind Res	Indian Inst Technol Kanpur			Partitional algorithms form an extremely popular class of clustering algorithms. Primarily, these algorithms can be classified into two sub-categories: a) k-means based algorithms that presume the knowledge of a suitable k, and b) algorithms such as Leader, which take a distance threshold value, tau, as an input. In this work, we make the following contributions. We 1) propose a novel technique, EPIC, which is based on both the number of clusters, k and the distance threshold, tau, 2) demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves better performance than the standard k-means algorithm, and 3) present a generic scheme for integrating EPIC into different classification algorithms to reduce their training time complexity.

Fourier Descriptor (FDs) was introduced in this paper as a new method to extract and represent objects' shape features of IKONOS imagery and a 5-dimensional (5-D) feature-vector was proposed as a shape parameter. A classification model was established based on K-means clustering algorithm, the 5-D feature-vector was taken as discrimination variable together with the mean gray values. The results showed that when involving the shape feature-vector into the classification model, the overall classification accuracy was 82.4% with 84.6% producer accuracy of roads. So it was confirmed a feasible way to represent shape features of remotely sensed imagery based on FDs.

J	Sheng, WG; Tucker, A; Liu, XH				Sheng, Weiguo; Tucker, Allan; Liu, Xiaohui			A niching genetic k-means algorithm and its applications to gene expression data	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Genetic algorithms; Niching methods; Clustering; K-means; Gene expression	CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM; SEARCH; DESIGN	Partitional clustering is a common approach to cluster analysis. Although many algorithms have been proposed, partitional clustering remains a challenging problem with respect to the reliability and efficiency of recovering high quality solutions in terms of its criterion functions. In this paper, we propose a niching genetic k-means algorithm (NGKA) for partitional clustering, which aims at reliably and efficiently identifying high quality solutions in terms of the sum of squared errors criterion. Within the NGKA, we design a niching method, which encourages mating among similar clustering solutions while allowing for some competitions among dissimilar solutions, and integrate it into a genetic algorithm to prevent premature convergence during the evolutionary clustering search. Further, we incorporate one step of k-means operation into the regeneration steps of the resulted niching genetic algorithm to improve its computational efficiency. The proposed algorithm was applied to cluster both simulated data and gene expression data and compared with previous work. Experimental results clear show that the NGKA is an effective clustering algorithm and outperforms two other genetic algorithm based clustering methods implemented for comparison.

J	Li, YL; Shen, Y				Li, Yan-ling; Shen, Yi			An automatic fuzzy c-means algorithm for image segmentation	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Image segmentation; Fuzzy c-means; Fuzzy clustering; K-means; Spatial information	CLUSTER VALIDITY	Fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm is one of the most popular methods for image segmentation. However, the standard FCM algorithm must be estimated by expertise users to determine the cluster number. So, we propose an automatic fuzzy clustering algorithm (AFCM) for automatically grouping the pixels of an image into different homogeneous regions when the number of clusters is not known beforehand. In order to get better segmentation quality, this paper presents an algorithm based on AFCM algorithm, called automatic modified fuzzy c-means cluster segmentation algorithm (AMFCM). AMFCM algorithm incorporates spatial information into the membership function for clustering. The spatial function is the weighted summation of the membership function in the neighborhood of each pixel under consideration. Experimental results show that AMFCM algorithm not only can spontaneously estimate the appropriate number of clusters but also can get better segmentation quality.

Our goal is to enable the programmer to seamlessly use such a system without rewriting the application and with minimal knowledge of the underlying architectural details Assuming that applications perform function calls to computational kernels with available CPU and GPU implementations, our runtime achieves this goal by automatically scheduling the kernels and managing data placement. In particular, It intercepts function calls to well-known computational kernels and schedules them on CPU or GPU based on their argument size and location To improve performance, it defers all data transfers between the CPU and the GPU until necessary By managing data placement transparently to the programmer, it provides a unified memory view despite the underlying separate memory sub-systems We experimentally evaluate our runtime on a heterogeneous platform consisting of a 2 5GHz quad-core Xeon CPU and an NVIDIA C870 GPU Given array sorting, parallel reduction, dense and sparse matrix operations and ranking as computational kernels, we use our runtime to automatically retarget SSI [25], K-means [32] and two synthetic applications to the above platform with no code changes We find that, in most cases, performance improves if the computation is moved to the data, and not vice-versa. For instance, even if a particular instance of a kernel is slower on the GPU than on the CPU, the overall application may be faster if the kernel is scheduled on the GPU anyway, especially if the kernel data is already located on the GPU memory due to prior decisions Our results show that data-aware CPU/GPU scheduling improves performance by up to 25% over the best data-agnostic scheduling on the same platform	[Becchi, Michela; Byna, Surendra; Cadambi, Srihari; Chakradhar, Srimat] NEC Labs Amer Inc, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA	Becchi, M (reprint author), NEC Labs Amer Inc, 4 Independence Way, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.	mbecchi@nec-labs.com; sbyna@nec-labs.com; cadambi@nec-labs.com; chak@nec-labs.com					*AMD, 2009, AMD STREAM SDK US GU; AUGONNET C, 2008, P HPPC 08 LAS PALM D; AUGONNET C, 2009, P 15 INT EUR PAR C D; BAI B, 2009, SPECIAL ISSUE LEARNI; BECCHI M, 2010, P HOTPAR 2010 BERK C; BENT J, 2005, P CHALL LARG APPL DI; *CAPS, HMPP WORKB; DIAMOS, P HPDC 2008 NEW YORK; DIAMOS G, GPUOCELOT BINARY TRA; FATAHALIAN K, P 2006 ACM IEEE C SU; GELADO I, P ICS 08 ISL KOS GRE; Ghuloum Anwar, 2007, Intel Technology Journal, V11, DOI 10.1535/itj.1104.07; *HPC PROJ, PAR4ALL; *INT, INT RAPIDMIND; *INT, INT MKL; Intel, INT THREAD BUILD BLO; KHANNA G, 2008, THESIS OHIO STATE U; KNIGHT TJ, P PPOPP 2007 SAN JOS; KOSAR T, 2006, P CHALL LARG APPL DI; LIAO SW, 2006, P 4 C CGO MARCH; LINDERMAN MD, 2008, P 2008 ASPLOS MARCH; Lloyd S.

Is it possible to parallelize some of the beautiful results from the sequential setting? Our starting point is a small, but diverse, subset of results in approximation algorithms for facility-location problems, with a primary goal of developing techniques for devising their efficient parallel counterparts.

However, commonly used mixture models are generally of a parametric form (e.g., mixture of Gaussian distributions or GMM), which significantly limits their capacity in fitting diverse multidimensional data distributions encountered in practice. We propose a non-parametric mixture model (NMM) for data clustering in order to detect clusters generated from arbitrary unknown distributions, using non-parametric kernel density estimates. The proposed model is non-parametric since the generative distribution of each data point depends only on the rest of the data points and the chosen kernel. A leave-one-out likelihood maximization is performed to estimate the parameters of the model. The NMM approach, when applied to cluster high dimensional text datasets significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art and classical approaches such as K-means, Gaussian Mixture Models, spectral clustering and linkage methods.

The choice of a good dissimilarity is a difficult task because each dissimilarity reflects different features of the data. Therefore, different dissimilarities should be integrated in order to reflect more accurately which is similar for the user and the problem at hand. In many applications, the user feedback or the a priory knowledge about the problem provide pairs of similar and dissimilar examples. This side-information may be used to learn a distance metric and to improve the clustering results. In this paper, we address the problem of learning a linear combination of dissimilarities using side information in the form of equivalence constraints. The minimization of the error function is based on a quadratic optimization algorithm. A smoothing term is included that penalizes the complexity of the family of distances and avoids overfitting. The experimental results suggest that the method proposed outperforms a standard metric learning algorithm and improves the classical k-means clustering based on a single dissimilarity.

Breast shape is gradually changing with time, and also varies with many other factors such as life styles, nutrition, ethnic composition of populations, etc. This paper aims to develop the basic breast shapes of Chinese women in Yangtze River delta. We used [TC](2) body scanning system as the tool to acquire 3-D body point clouds and upper body measurements. Some special measurements needed in brassiere design were gained by using manual anthropometric tools. All subjects were Chinese women born and living in Yangtze River delta aged from 18 to 50. In order to support market segmentation strategy, the data set was analyzed by foundational statistical analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) by age group. It looked into the mathematical distributions and relationships of characteristic parameters regarding to brassiere pattern design. In a conclusion, the breast shapes of different ages were classified and characterized by k-means clustering. This work will be helpful for designers to make brassieres for a certain group of women who have the same type of breast shape and also able to give some advice on brassiere production according to market demand.

To implement an automatic attribute-scaled K-mean algorithm, the concept of classification has been integrated. Data points which belong to the same target class are considered similar in K-means clustering. In this paper, we explore and determine the optimal attribute-scaled vector that minimizes misclassification error of the target class. This paper uses the non-linear unconstrained optimization technique in attribute-scaled space, called the cyclic coordinate method together with the golden section line search to find the optimal vector. Our experiments show that the methods can provide the optimal scaling vectors which effectively reduce the misclassification error of supervised K-means clustering and lead to the effective supervised clustering in some data sets.

It aims to find some structure in a collection of unlabeled data. Dealing with a large quantity of data items can be problematic because of time complexity. On the other hand high dimensional data is a challenge arena in data clustering e. g. time series data. Novel algorithms are needed to be robust, scalable, efficient and accurate to cluster of these kinds of data. In this study we proposed a two stages algorithm base on K-Means to achieve our objective.

First, the enteromorpha images are converted into NTSC space from RGB color space and are then separated into enteromorpha and background class by means of k-means algorithm. Then, all those images which only consist of enteromorpha class are stored as sample images. Next, in the stage of detection, an nxn representative patch is chosen from the detecting and a sample image respectively. And Sum of Squared Difference (SSD) of these two patches is calculated. If the value of SSD is smaller than a threshold which obtained by doing trial and error test, the detecting image is regarded as containing enteromorpha. Otherwise, the next sample image will be checked in the same way. If all sample images do not meet the requirement, as a result, there is not enteromorpha in the detecting image.

The proposed approach includes a two-stage prediction model with an integrated algorithm. The two-stage prediction model uses K-means algorithm to extract clusters of traffic patterns and then employs genetic programming to predict the traffic in each cluster. The integrated algorithm combines cell transmission model with extended Kalman filtering to estimate the arrival distributions and the O-D proportions. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach, a field study of on-ramp traffic patterns on a freeway is examined. The results show that the proposed approach can accurately predict the traffic and satisfactorily estimate the O-D proportions along a freeway.

The present research identifies 11 systems and control-related parameters for time headway, the inverse of the time to collision, and the switch time between accelerator release and brake activation. These parameters are used to determine and distinguish between dissimilar types of longitudinal driving behavior according to driving and driver characteristics. The efficient K-means clustering algorithm is used to classify longitudinal driving behavior. Driver behavior experiments were carried out with 45 participants. The results of the study show that four main determinants of longitudinal driving behavior can be distinguished by using measurable parameters with the indicated opposite extreme values: prudence (aggressive versus prudent), stability (unstable versus stable), conflict proneness (risk prone versus risk infrequent), and skillfulness (nonskillful versus skillful).

J	Greene, ER; Smith, C				Greene, Elizabeth R.; Smith, Colin			Congestion Pricing on Highways in Chicago, Illinois What Do Drivers Think?	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Traffic congestion causes losses of $7.3 billion per year in the six-county Chicago, Illinois, area. Many efforts are under way to improve existing infrastructure and manage travel demand to reduce the burdens of congestion. In 2008, the Chicago Travel Options Study, a stated preference survey, was conducted to assess whether two types of road pricing would manage travel demand. The survey employed a split sample approach: half of the respondents completed stated preference experiments that tested the likelihood of using managed lanes on Chicago area highways, and the other half completed experiments that tested peak period toll increases. The paper finds that Chicago travelers appear to favor managed lanes over increasing or placing tolls on toll-ways and expressways. The survey asked a set of questions to gauge attitudes toward tolling, public transit, and environmental concerns. The paper examines how individuals' opinions on these three topics vary by demographics and trip characteristics and presents the results of a K-means cluster analysis that shows that around 20% of the respondents have a strong willingness to pay tolls and to change their behavior to benefit transit and the environment. A group of respondents similar in size is open to managed lanes as a means to reduce congestion but is less likely to change behavior for environmental reasons. The paper benchmarks Chicago area travelers' opinions against those of travelers from other parts of the United States and shows that they have a higher willingness to pay tolls and to use toll roads but have similar environmental attitudes.

J	Azimi, M; Zhang, YL				Azimi, Mehdi; Zhang, Yunlong			Categorizing Freeway Flow Conditions by Using Clustering Methods	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							TRAFFIC FLOW; EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES; CLASSIFICATION; STATES	Three pattern recognition methods were applied to classify freeway traffic flow conditions on the basis of flow characteristics. The methods are K-means, fuzzy C-means, and CLARA (clustering large applications), which fall into the category of unsupervised learning and require the least amount of knowledge about the data set. The classification results from the three clustering methods were compared with the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) level-of-service criteria. Through this process, the best clustering method consistent with the HCM classification was identified. Clustering methods were then used to further categorize oversaturated flow conditions to supplement the HCM classification. The clustering results supported the HCM's density-based level-of-service criterion for uncongested flow. In addition, the methods provide a means of reasonably categorizing oversaturated flow conditions, which the HCM is currently unable to do.

In order to establish the relationships between the main soil factors and plant species in this stressed ecosystem, 133 releves related to soil and vegetation were realized. Soil variables measured included electrical conductivity and calcium carbonate. The 133 releves were arranged in clusters using k-means classification. The similarity analysis used to examine the variation in vegetation assemblage structure showed significant differences in taxonomical composition among groups of releves. The phi coefficient of fidelity used then to extract the different vegetation units and to measure species concentration in each vegetation unit enabled us to extract a synoptic table with 6 vegetation units, exclusively related to conductivity. The results of redundancy analysis were concordant with k-means clustering results and showed that conductivity is the main factor affecting the vegetation distribution in the Lower Cheliff plain whereas CaCO(3) plays a secondary role. The approach used in this study enabled us to extract 4 ranges of salinity in the Lower Cheliff according to the optimum of salinity tolerated by each vegetation unit.

Many literatures have reviewed the application of data mining technology in customer segmentation, and achieved sound effectives. But in the most cases, it is performed using customer data from a special point of view, rather than from systematical method considering all stages of CRM. This paper, with the aid of data mining tools, constructs a new customer segmentation method based on RFM, demographic and LTV data. The new customer segmentation method consists of two phases. Firstly, with K-means clustering, customers are clustered into different segments regarding their RFM. Secondly, using demographic data, each cluster again is partitioned into new clusters. Finally, using LTV, a profile for customer is created. The method has been applied to a dataset from Iranian bank, which resulted in some useful management measures and suggestions.

Results of this study suggest that important differences exist in patterns of victimization and psychological distress among drug-involved women. Identification of this variation can be used to tailor intervention strategies to the particular needs of different subgroups within the population of crack-using women.

For iterative clustering, research has shown that the initial conditions are crucial to clustering quality and running time of a clustering computation. Using a novel visualization tool, CComViz (Cluster Comparison Visualization), we present an innovative approach to refine the initial centroids and the number of clusters by visually analyzing multiple clustering results generated by different clustering algorithms. As an example, we apply our new approach to a gene expression case study for generating a better and converging clustering.

Mapping of Conjunctive Water Use Productivity Pattern in an Irrigation Command Using Temporal IRS WiFS Data	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						IRS-1D-WiFS; Reflectance; Conjunctive water use; LAI; Irrigation mapping	LEAF-AREA INDEX; VEGETATION INDEXES; RICE; VALIDATION; IMAGES; BASIN; MAP	Irrigated agriculture in many areas of the world is currently being practiced from multiple water sources such as precipitation, canal, wetlands, ground aquifer, etc. This study highlights the use of high temporal remote sensing data [IRS-1D; Wide Field Sensor (WiFS), 188-m resolution] to assess conjunctive water use pattern and its productivity in the 6 Main Canal command of Damodar Irrigation Project West Bengal, India. In this command three sources of water (canal water, groundwater and wetland) were used for the rice growing system during the summer season. A multi-date (ten dates, two bands) image stack was prepared. Using this image stack and an unsupervised classification (Fuzzy k-means) backed by space-time spiral curve (ST-SCs) technique, canal release and wetlands information was used to prepare irrigated classes (canal, groundwater or wetlands) map for summer 2000. ST-SCs have been used to analyze temporal WiFS data to continuously monitor class dynamics over time and space and to determine class separability (different types of irrigated-classes) at various time periods within the season. Results showed that the area under agriculture, non-agriculture and water were 81%, 18.5% and 0.5%, of the total area respectively. While, groundwater, canal water and wetland irrigated rice were 67.6%, 25.6% and 6.8%, respectively out of the total agriculture area. Classification results found to have more than 89.3% overall accuracy for broad land cover, while sub-classes of rice i.e. irrigated classes found have reasonably good accuracy of 85.7%. A productivity index (LAI/water-requirement) was also developed. Productivity index was high for the wetland and groundwater irrigated rice as compared to the rice irrigated through canal water. These results were weighed against the observed yield data.	[Gupta, P.

WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							PEDOTRANSFER FUNCTIONS; CONDUCTIVITY; RETENTION	In the past, texture-based classification of soils has been used for grouping soils in variably saturated water flow and solute transport studies. Classification of soils becomes especially important for large-scale studies where the spatial and temporal variability in the hydraulic properties of soils exceeds the field sampling capabilities. Although soil-texture-based classification has been widely used, questions remain about the validity of its use from a hydraulic perspective. In this study, we attempt to answer the following questions: (1) what is the optimal number of (soil hydraulic) classes that can adequately classify the soils from a hydraulic standpoint, and (2) how does such a classification compare to the soil texture classification currently used? To investigate these questions, the commonly used k-means clustering algorithm was integrated with the ROSETTA pedotransfer functions to predict the so-called soil hydraulic classes. The optimal soil hydraulic classifications and the associated uncertainty were estimated for numbers of soil hydraulic classes varying from 2 to 30. It was concluded that the optimal number of soil hydraulic classes is 12. The optimal soil hydraulic classes were represented in a ternary diagram called the soil hydraulic triangle. While there exist some surprising similarities in classification between the soil texture triangle and the soil hydraulic triangle for soils with high sand percentages (sand >60%), the opposite is true for soils with low sand contents. From a hydraulic standpoint, the texture-based classification does not classify soils well when there is a considerable impact of capillary forces. The soil texture and hydraulic classes were analyzed for accuracy using two databases. Compared to the soil texture classes, it was found that the soil hydraulic classes marginally improve the accuracy of classification. Even though the improvement is only marginal, it was observed that the optimality of soil texture triangle for hydraulic studies cannot be assured because of the nonuniform distribution of data across various textural possibilities in the two databases. As an extension of this research, we have also estimated the average soil hydraulic parameters for the different optimal soil hydraulic classes.	[Twarakavi, Navin K.

Usually, such work can be done by some software (e.g. ENVI, ERDAS IMAGINE) in personal computers. However, for PCs, the limitation of hardware resources and the tolerance of time consuming present a bottleneck in processing a large amount of RS images. The techniques of parallel computing and distributed systems are no doubt the suitable choices. Different with traditional ways, in this paper we try to parallel this algorithm on Hadoop, an open source system that implements the MapReduce programming model. The paper firstly describes the color representation of RS images, which means pixels need to be translated into a particular color space CIELAB that is more suitable for distinguishing colors. It also gives an overview of traditional K-Means. Then the programming model MapReduce and a platform Hadoop are briefly introduced. This model requires customized 'map/reduce' functions, allowing users to parallel processing in two stages. In addition, the paper detail map and reduce functions by pseudo-codes, and the reports of performance based on the experiments are given. The paper shows that results are acceptable and may also inspire some other approaches of tackling similar problems within the field of remote sensing applications.

In such networks sensors data are collected over multi-hop routes at one or multiple base-stations (gateway nodes) for processing. In many WSN applications such as disaster management and combat field surveillance, rapid response to detected events is necessary and thus data latency should be minimal. Given the sensor's energy and radio range constraints, direct communication with the gateway is inefficient and often infeasible for most deployed sensors. An intuitive approach to limit data latency is to increase the population of gateways and place them in them vicinity of sensors. However, gateway nodes are typically costly and thus it IS desired to limit their count. Therefore, there is I need to balance between such conflicting requirements. In this paper, We pursue all integrated approach to asset planning in WSNs so that the data latency is minimized. the goal is to determine the least number of gateways and identify where to place them in the network in order to achieve a certain delay bound oil data delivery. We formulate ail optimization model for the asset planning problem and present effective algorithms for solving it The proposed solution scheme employs contemporary search heuristic,; such as k-means and genetic algorithms. Validation results confirm the effectiveness of our approach in achieving the desired design goals.

In this work, we focus on exploiting Received Signal Strength (RSS) obtained from the existing wireless infrastructures for performing intrusion detection when the intruders or objects do not carry any radio devices. This is also known as passive intrusion detection. Passive intrusion detection based on the RSS data is an attractive approach as it reuses the existing wireless environmental data without requiring a specialized infrastructure. We propose a clustering-based learning mechanism for passive intrusion detection in wireless networks. Specifically, our detection scheme utilizes the clustering method to analyze the changes of RSS, caused by intrusions, at multiple devices to diagnose the presence of intrusions collaboratively. Our experimental results using an IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee) network in a real office environment show that our clustering-based learning can effectively detect the presence of intrusions.

In this context, the complex multi-faceted ICT refers to an important productivity tool as well as to a source of new knowledge. However, it is important to underline, on one hand, the close relationship between the average level of education and the training of the population, and, on the other hand, the dissemination of new technologies. Indeed, it is necessary to highlight, as we propose in our study, the relationship between the variables relating to education and investments, and those referring to ICT field. In fact, the link connecting technology and education is currently supported not only by the dynamics of learning by doing, which enhance the same processes of learning, but also by the empirical evidence that an inadequately educated work force could not effectively take advantage of high technologies at all. By analyzing European cross-country differences we study the influence of education level with regard to some selected variables, using a multivariate investigation approach. Moreover, given the particular articulation of the research field observed, we have made use of factor analysis in order to compress the redundancy of information and prevent the occurrence of multicollinearity. Once we have extracted enough information from our datasets we carry out a regression analysis and tests of randomness on the residual component of the phenomenon. We group the countries having uniformity in education, and then we focus attention on the realities which have a low education level, and which gather critical elements of policy. Finally, we can prove the usefulness of the dissemination and application of modern technology to education and training processes thanks to the relationship between the process of education and the adoption of ICT which are essential for the competitiveness and the long run development of the European countries analyzed whose economy is based on advanced knowledge and highly trained human capital.

Positive changes have been experienced on dimensions of user, management and teacher in distance education systems at each passing day. In addition to these positive changes, new approaches to be used at the evaluation of distance education are emerging. Each of these approaches is an algorithm. In this study, the algorithms to be used at the evaluation of distance education platforms are analyzed and compared. Distance education algorithms as K-means, Apriori, C45, Support Vector Machines (SVM), KNN and Naive Bayes are created the universe and sample of this research.

As the musicians in improvisation process try to find the best harmony in terms of aesthetics, the decision variables in optimization process try to be the best vector in terms of objective function. Cluster analysis is one of attractive data mining technique that use in many fields. One popular class of data clustering algorithms is the center based clustering algorithm. K-means used as a popular clustering method due to its simplicity and high speed in clustering large datasets. However, k-means has two shortcomings: dependency on the initial state and convergence to local optima and global solutions of large problems cannot found with reasonable amount of computation effort. In order to overcome local optima problem lots of studies done in clustering. This paper describes a new clustering method based on the harmony search (HS) meta-heuristic algorithm, which was conceptualized using the musical process of searching for a perfect state of harmony. The HS algorithm does not require initial values and uses a random search instead of a gradient search, so derivative information is unnecessary. We compared proposed algorithm with other heuristics algorithms in clustering, such as GA, SA, TS, and ACO, by implementing them on several simulation and real datasets. The results indicate that the proposed clustering is a powerful clustering method suggesting higher degree of precision and robustness than the existing algorithms.

Improving an SVM-based Liver Segmentation Strategy by the F-score Feature Selection Method	WORLD CONGRESS ON MEDICAL PHYSICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL 25, PT 4: IMAGE PROCESSING, BIOSIGNAL PROCESSING, MODELLING AND SIMULATION, BIOMECHANICS	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering	SEP 07-12, 2009	Munich, GERMANY	IUPESM, IOMP		GLCM; F-score; FOS-MOD; PCA		A fast and accurate computer-aided liver segmentation plays a vital role in the virtual hepatic surgery. Large amount of features yielded in supervised segmentation methods may lead to slow training and classifying processes. Therefore, feature selection is of importance in order to speed up the liver segmentation. Recently, a hybrid method was proposed by Liu et al. combining thresholding, classifier and region growing. However, this method suffers from long process time caused by the large amount of features. F-score is a simple technique to measure the discrimination of different features. We therefore combine F-score to the hybrid method to reduce the time required in the training and testing stage. Four sets of abdominal CT images were obtained from Shan Dong University. The data consists of multiple, serial, axial computed tomography images derived from helical, 64 multi-slice CT and was stored in DICOM format of size 512 by 512 with 12-bit gray level resolution. The hybrid method which we proposed is to segment CT images by support vector machines after supervised thresholding, K means clustering, and texture feature extraction (Gray level co-occurrence Matrix-GLCM). We applied principle component analysis (PCA), forward orthogonal search algorithm by maximizing the overall dependency (FOS-MOD) and F-score to select the features from the GLCM. The experiment showed that F-score helps in accelerating training and classifying stage by 50% whilst the PCA-based feature selection method failed to extract the liver contour correctly. This may be explained by the fact that useful information for classifying may be lost when using PCA. FOS-MOD algorithm is time consuming mainly because its orthogonalization procedure and the calculation of the correlation matrix are very complex. In conclusion, F-score is a promising feature selection method for the svm-based classification. Our hybrid method with F-score can speed up the segmentation with accurate results ensured.

Computed tomography (CT) image of the human thorax has been a useful modality for assessing emphysema. Out goal in this paper is to automatically visualize bullaes (continuous low-attenuated region in CT which represents the air-filled region in the CT and therefore the emphysematous lesion in the lung) in the lungs in three dimensions and quantify the emphysema severity of each bullae based on its size and the distance of the bullae from the center of the lungs using fuzzy logic. From the computed emphysema severity score of bullae in the lung, we calculate the overall emphysema severity of the lung by summing up the emphysema severity score of all bullaes in the lung. For the visualization part, we first compute a transparent three-dimensional lung model and from there, we cluster the bullaes using K-means clustering method to see how the bullaes are distributed in groups in the lung. Besides, we compress the three-dimensional lung model along x-, y- and z-axis by assigning the value of every bullae pixel as one and adding up the pixel intensity along x-, y- and z-axis allowing the visualization of the compressed lung from the front, side, and top view, respectively. Consequently, we color the compressed image using continuous multi-valued color code for indicating the severity of the emphysematous destruction in the lung. Our visualization techniques can be used as a medical assistant visualization tool for radiologists.	[Tan, K.

Autoregressive and Cepstral Analysis of Electromyogram in Rapid Movement Sleep	WORLD CONGRESS ON MEDICAL PHYSICS AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING, VOL 25, PT 4: IMAGE PROCESSING, BIOSIGNAL PROCESSING, MODELLING AND SIMULATION, BIOMECHANICS	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering	SEP 07-12, 2009	Munich, GERMANY	IUPESM, IOMP		EMG; Sleep; Rapid eye movement Behavior Disorder; Autoregressive Modeling; Cepstral Analysis; Linear Discriminant Analysis		Quantitative electromyographic (EMG) signal analysis in the frequency domain using classical power spectrum analysis techniques have been well documented over the past decade. Yet no work has been done on EMG during Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Stage of Sleep. In this work a technique for classifying chin movement via EMG signals during sleep is presented. Two methods (Autoregressive modeling-Cepstrum Analysis) for extracting features from EMG signal during sleep and a classification algorithm (Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)) were analyzed and compared. EMG findings are used to detect and describe different disease processes affecting sleep. Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder (RBD) is an example of EMG abnormality in which patients lose their muscle control while in REM stage of sleep resulting in physically acting out their dreams. An adaptive segmentation based on Recursive Least Square (RLS) algorithm was analyzed. This algorithm was used to segment the non-stationary EMG signal into locally stationary components, which were then autoregressive modeled using the Burg-Lattice method. The Cepstrum measurement described and applied to modify the coefficients computed from the autoregressive (AR) model. Furthermore, the classification performance of the above two feature sets was investigated for the two classes (Normal and Abnormal). Results showed AR modeling and Cepstrum both are good assessments in finding EMG abnormalities during sleep, however; unlike in speech analysis Cepstrum results does not improve the accuracy as expected. An accuracy of more than 75% to classify the normal segment as normal and more than 68% to classify abnormal as abnormal made LDA a better discriminator compared to K-means. These methods may be useful in distinguishing EMG patterns that predict the emergence of Parkinson disease in humans.

For analysing data which are lack of expected response and brain regions of interest, we have previously proposed a completely data-driven method in subject level, which sought for spatially connected voxels with their temporal maxima occurring within a detected time window, in the whole brain. As subject number grows, the interpretation of various numbers of components obtained, depending on the temporal peaks and their spatial associations, as a whole became extremely difficult. Here, we propose a group-level analysis method, which utilises the connected components from all subjects and the K-means algorithm, and returns the period during which there is a significant response and an activation map. For validation, four data sets acquired in a single-event visual experiment were used and the associated time window and brain regions to the experimental paradigm were detected.

The construction of networks of this form requires a formation of efficient interfaces that constitute a conceptually appealing bridge between the model and the real-world experimental environment in which the model is to be used. In general, the interfaces are constructed by invoking some form of granulation of information; and binary (Boolean) discretization, in particular. We introduce a new discretization environment that is realized by means of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and data clustering implemented by the K-Means algorithm. The underlying structure of the network is optimized by invoking a combination of the PSO and the mechanisms of conventional gradient-based learning. We discuss various optimization strategies by considering Boolean as well as fuzzy data coming as the result of discretization of original experimental data and then involving several learning strategies. We elaborate on the interpretation aspects of the network and show how those could be strengthened through efficient pruning. We also show how the interpreted network leads to a simpler and more accurate logic description of the experimental data. A number of experimental studies are included. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A transcriptomic computational analysis of mastic oil-treated Lewis lung carcinomas reveals molecular mechanisms targeting tumor cell growth and survival	BMC MEDICAL GENOMICS			English	Article							NF-KAPPA-B; LENTISCUS VAR. CHIA; PISTACIA-LENTISCUS; DIETARY PHYTOCHEMICALS; CANCER-CELLS; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; SIGNALING PATHWAY; PTEN EXPRESSION; DOWN-REGULATION; IN-VITRO	Background: Mastic oil from Pistacia lentiscus variation chia, a blend of bioactive terpenes with recognized medicinal properties, has been recently shown to exert anti-tumor growth activity through inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and inflammatory response. However, no studies have addressed its mechanisms of action at genome-wide gene expression level. Methods: To investigate molecular mechanisms triggered by mastic oil, Lewis Lung Carcinoma cells were treated with mastic oil or DMSO and RNA was collected at five distinct time points (3-48 h). Microarray expression profiling was performed using Illumina mouse-6 v1 beadchips, followed by computational analysis. For a number of selected genes, RT-PCR validation was performed in LLC cells as well as in three human cancer cell lines of different origin (A549, HCT116, K562). PTEN specific inhibition by a bisperovanadium compound was applied to validate its contribution to mastic oil-mediated anti-tumor growth effects. Results: In this work we demonstrated that exposure of Lewis lung carcinomas to mastic oil caused a time-dependent alteration in the expression of 925 genes. GO analysis associated expression profiles with several biological processes and functions. Among them, modifications on cell cycle/proliferation, survival and NF-kappa B cascade in conjunction with concomitant regulation of genes encoding for PTEN, E2F7, HMOX1 (up-regulation) and NOD1 (down-regulation) indicated some important mechanistic links underlying the anti-proliferative, proapoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects of mastic oil. The expression profiles of Hmox1, Pten and E2f7 genes were similarly altered by mastic oil in the majority of test cancer cell lines. Inhibition of PTEN partially reversed mastic oil effects on tumor cell growth, indicating a multi-target mechanism of action. Finally, k-means clustering, organized the significant gene list in eight clusters demonstrating a similar expression profile. Promoter analysis in a representative cluster revealed shared putative cis-elements suggesting a common regulatory transcription mechanism. Conclusions: Present results provide novel evidence on the molecular basis of tumor growth inhibition mediated by mastic oil and set a rational basis for application of genomics and bioinformatic methodologies in the screening of natural compounds with potential cancer chemopreventive activities.

J	Charalampidis, D; Muldrey, B				Charalampidis, Dimitrios; Muldrey, Barry			Clustering using multilayer perceptrons	NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-THEORY METHODS & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Clustering; Multilayer perceptrons; Neural networks	ALGORITHM	In this paper we present a multilayer perceptron-based approach for data clustering. Traditionally, data clustering is performed using either exemplar-based methods that employ some form of similarity or distance measure, discriminatory function-based methods that attempt to identify one or several cluster-dividing hyper-surfaces, point-by-point associative methods that attempt to form groups of points in a pyramidal manner by directly examining the proximity between pairs of points or groups of points, and probabilistic methods which assume that data are sampled from mixture distributions. Commonly, in exemplar-based methods, each cluster is represented by a multi-dimensional centroid. In this paper, we explore the function approximation capabilities of multilayer perceptron neural networks in order to build exemplars which are not simply points but curves or surfaces. The proposed technique aims to group data points into arbitrary-shaped point clouds. The proposed approach may exhibit problems similar to other traditional exemplar-based clustering techniques such as k-means, including convergence to local minimum solutions with respect to the cost function. However, it is illustrated in this work that approaches such as split-and-merge can be appropriately adjusted and employed in the proposed technique, in order to alleviate the problem of reaching poor local minimum solutions.

If we can make a portable AFib monitoring system, it will be helpful to many old people because we cannot predict when a patient will have a spasm of AFib. Methods: We analyzed heart beat variability from inter-beat intervals obtained by a wavelet-based detector. We made a Poincare plot using the inter-beat intervals. By analyzing the plot, we extracted three feature measures characterizing AFib and non-AFib: the number of clusters, mean stepping increment of inter-beat intervals, and dispersion of the points around a diagonal line in the plot. We divided distribution of the number of clusters into two and calculated mean value of the lower part by k-means clustering method. We classified data whose number of clusters is more than one and less than this mean value as non-AFib data. In the other case, we tried to discriminate AFib from non-AFib using support vector machine with the other feature measures: the mean stepping increment and dispersion of the points in the Poincare plot. Results: We found that Poincare plot from non-AFib data showed some pattern, while the plot from AFib data showed irregularly irregular shape. In case of non-AFib data, the definite pattern in the plot manifested itself with some limited number of clusters or closely packed one cluster. In case of AFib data, the number of clusters in the plot was one or too many. We evaluated the accuracy using leave-one-out cross-validation. Mean sensitivity and mean specificity were 91.4% and 92.9% respectively. Conclusions: Because pulse beats of ventricles are less likely to be influenced by baseline wandering and noise, we used the inter-beat intervals to diagnose AFib. We visually displayed regularity of the inter-beat intervals by way of Poincare plot. We tried to design an automated algorithm which did not require any human intervention and any specific threshold, and could be installed in a portable AFib monitoring system.

Control of High-Temperature Supersonic Impinging Jets Using Microjets	AIAA JOURNAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	AIAA 46th Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit	JAN 07-10, 2008	Reno, NV	Amer Inst Aeronaut & Astronaut			OSCILLATIONS; IMPINGEMENT; PLATES	The flowfield associated with supersonic impinging jets has been of interest to both engineers and researchers for some time due to its wide range of practical applications and its complex nature from a fundamental fluid dynamic point of view. An example of supersonic impinging jets occurs in short takeoff and vertical landing aircraft, for which the highly oscillatory flowfield and the associated acoustic loads are also accompanied by a dramatic loss in lift during hover, severe ground erosion of the landing surface, and hot gas ingestion into the engine inlets. Another characteristic feature of this flowfield is an intensive heat transfer between the jet and the impingement surface. In the past we have examined impinging jets and their control using microjets at cold conditions; the present study is a step toward examining this flowfield and the effectiveness of microjet control at increasingly realistic thermal conditions. An ideally expanded, Mach 1.5 primary jet issuing from an axisymmetric nozzle was heated up to a stagnation temperature of similar to 500 K. Mean and unsteady temperature and pressure measurements were obtained on a lift plate representative of the undersurface of an aircraft and on the ground plane over a range of nozzle-to-plate distances (representing aircraft hover conditions). In addition, near-field noise was also measured using a microphone. The velocity field of the impinging jet for both cold and hot conditions was mapped using particle image velocimetry. Our results show that the temperature recovery factor at the stagnation point on the ground plane is strongly dependent on the temperature ratio and nozzle-to-plate distance, similar to observations in subsonic impinging jets. The hover lift loss for hot jets is much higher than for cold jets, nearly 75% of the primary jet thrust at small nozzle-to-plate distances. The pressure fluctuations generated by hot impinging jets are also substantially higher than their cold counterparts. As in cold jets, pressure and noise spectra for hot jets show discrete, high-amplitude acoustic tones (generally known as impinging tones) at frequencies varying with jet temperature. The activation of microjet control shows a substantial reduction in pressure fluctuations both in terms of overall sound pressure levels (up to 20 dB on the ground plane and 15 dB on the lift plate) and the attenuation of discrete, high-amplitude impinging tones (up to 32 dB). High-temperature peaks were observed in the temperature spectra at frequencies corresponding to impingement tones in the pressure and noise spectra; these were also substantially attenuated with microjet control. As much as 50% of the lift loss was recovered by using control for hot,jets at smaller nozzle-to-plate distances. In general, the results provide evidence of the feasibility of using this active control approach under increasingly realistic conditions to achieve desired reductions in noise, unsteady pressures, and thermal loads.

J	Han, SJ; Oh, SY				Han, Seong-Joo; Oh, Se-Young			A new paradigm for real-time parallel storage and recognition of patterns based on a hierarchical organization of associative memories utilizing Walsh function encoding	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Parallel storage and recognition; Walsh function; Parallel memory; Hierarchical associative memory; Optimal memory allocation	FACE RECOGNITION; INFORMATION; RECALL	A new hierarchical Walsh memory which can store and quickly recognize any number of patterns is proposed. A Walsh function based associative memory was found to be capable of storing and recognizing patterns in parallel via purely a software algorithmic technique (namely, without resorting to parallel hardware) while the memory itself only takes a single pattern space of computer memory, due to the Walsh encoding of each pattern. This type of distributed associative memory lends itself to high speed pattern recognition and has been reported earlier in a single memory version. In this paper, the single memory concept has first been extended to a parallel memory module and then to a tree-shaped hierarchy of these parallel modules that are capable of storing and recognizing any number of patterns for practical large scale data applications exemplified by image and speech recognition. The memory hierarchy was built by successively applying k-means clustering to the training data set. In the proposed architecture, the clustered data subsets are stored respectively into a parallel memory module where the module allocation is optimized using the genetic algorithm to realize a minimal implementation of the memory structure. The system can recognize all the training patterns with 100% accuracy and further, can also generalize on similar data. In order to demonstrate its efficacy with large scale real world data, we stored and recognized over 500 faces while at same time, achieving much reduced recognition time and storage space than template matching.

Every clustering algorithm is composed of several solutions for specific sub-problems in the clustering process. These solutions are linked together in a clustering algorithm, and they define the process and the structure of the algorithm. Frequently, many of these solutions occur in more than one clustering algorithm. Mostly, new clustering algorithms include frequently occurring solutions to typical sub-problems from clustering, as well as from other machine-learning algorithms. The problem is that these solutions are usually integrated in their algorithms, and that original algorithms are not designed to share solutions to sub-problems outside the original algorithm easily. We propose a way of designing cluster algorithms and to improve existing ones, based on reusable components. Reusable components are well-documented, frequently occurring solutions to specific sub-problems in a specific area. Thus we identify reusable components, first, as solutions to characteristic sub-problems in partitioning cluster algorithms, and, further, identify a generic structure for the design of partitioning cluster algorithms. We analyze some partitioning algorithms (K-means, X-means, MPCK-means, and Kohonen SOM), and identify reusable components in them. We give examples of how new cluster algorithms can be designed based on them.

Characterisation of single particles from in-port ship emissions	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Ship emissions; Atmospheric particle composition; Air quality; Port cities	MASS-SPECTRAL SIGNATURES; PARTICULATE MATTER; VEHICLE EMISSIONS; IDENTIFICATION	Emissions from shipping traffic may impact severely upon air quality in port cities. In this study, the size and composition of freshly emitted individual ship exhaust particles has been investigated using an aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ATOFMS) co-located with a suite of real-time instrumentation at a site in the Port of Cork, Ireland. The collected spectra were clustered using the K-means algorithm and a unique ship exhaust class containing internally mixed elemental and organic carbon, sodium, calcium, iron, vanadium, nickel and sulfate was identified. Over twenty sharp emission events were observed for this particle type during the three week measurement period in August 2008. Coincident increases in mass concentrations of sulfate, elemental carbon and particles below 2.5 mu m in diameter (PM(2.5)) were also observed during these events. Simultaneous scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) measurements indicate that the vast majority of freshly emitted ship exhaust particles lie in the ultrafine mode (<100 nm diameter). A second particle class consisted of internally mixed organic carbon, elemental carbon, ammonium and sulfate, and is tentatively attributed to aged or regionally transported ship exhaust. The results suggest that ATOFMS single particle mass spectra, when used in conjunction with other air quality monitoring instrumentation, may be useful in determining the contribution of local shipping traffic to air quality in port cities.

Differential gene expression profiles of hepatocellular carcinomas associated or not with viral infection	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Hepatocellular carcinoma; Molecular biomarkers; Viral infection; Oligo-microarrays	TUMOR PROGRESSION; CHRONIC HEPATITIS; INTERFERON-ALPHA; CDNA MICROARRAY; PIVOTAL ROLE; CANCER; HEPATOCARCINOGENESIS; SIGNATURE; PROTEIN; CELLS	Chronic hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) virus infections are the most important factors associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but tumor prognosis remains poor due to the lack of diagnostic biomarkers. In order to identify novel diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets, the gene expression profile associated with viral and non-viral HCC was assessed in 9 tumor samples by oligo-microarrays. The differentially expressed genes were examined using a z-score and KEGG pathway for the search of ontological biological processes. We selected a non-redundant set of 15 genes with the lowest P value for clustering samples into three groups using the non-supervised algorithm k-means. Fisher's linear discriminant analysis was then applied in an exhaustive search of trios of genes that could be used to build classifiers for class distinction. Different transcriptional levels of genes were identified in HCC of different etiologies and from different HCC samples. When comparing HBV-HCC vs HCV-HCC, HBV-HCC/HCV-HCC vs non-viral (NV)-HCC, HBC-HCC vs NV-HCC, and HCV-HCC vs NV-HCC of the 58 non-redundant differentially expressed genes, only 6 genes (IKBK beta, CREBBP, WNT10B, PRDX6, ITGAV, and IFNAR1) were found to be associated with hepatic carcinogenesis. By combining trios, classifiers could be generated, which correctly classified 100% of the samples. This expression profiling may provide a useful tool for research into the pathophysiology of HCC. A detailed understanding of how these distinct genes are involved in molecular pathways is of fundamental importance to the development of effective HCC chemoprevention and treatment.

METHODS: Gene expression profiling and advanced significance analyses were performed on 50 histologically unequivocal benign and malignant tumors, and a list of 61 differentially expressed genes was generated. By using this 61-gene list, unsupervised hierarchical and K-means cluster analyses were performed on 40 additional tumors, including 15 histologically borderline tumors, 11 benign tumors, and 14 PTCs. RESULTS: Analysis revealed 3 distinct tumor groups-benign, malignant, and intermediate. Tumors in the intermediate group (n=15) were mostly histologic borderline tumors and had an expression profile overlapping with the benign and malignant groups. Twenty-seven genes were expressed differentially between the benign and intermediate groups, including the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein/p300-interactivator with glutamic acid/aspartic acid-rich carboxy-terminal domain 1 or CITED1 gene and the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 or FGFR2 gene. Fourteen genes were expressed differentially between the intermediate group and malignant tumors, notably overexpression of the met proto-oncogene and of the high-mobility group adenine/thymine-hook 2 or HMGA2 gene in malignancies. Mutations of the v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 or BRAF gene were identified in 4 of 14 malignant tumors but not in benign or intermediate tumors. Patients who had either histologically or molecularly borderline tumors did not have metastasis or recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression profiling supported the finding that encapsulated thyroid follicular lesions with partial nuclear features of PTC are biologically borderline tumors that are distinct molecularly from benign and malignant tumors.

U937 cells, a human myelomonocytic lymphoma cell line, were treated with hyperthermia at 42 degrees C for 90 min and cultured at 37 degrees C. Apoptotic cells (similar to 15%) were seen 6 h after hyperthermic treatment, and elevated expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) including Hsp27, Hsp40, and Hsp70 was detected, following the activation of heat shock factor-1. Of the 54,675 probe sets analyzed, 1334 were upregulated and 4214 were downregulated by >2.0-fold in the cells treated with hyperthermia. A non-hierarchical gene clustering algorithm, K-means clustering, demonstrated 10 gene clusters. The gene network U1 or U2 that was obtained from up-regulated genes in cluster I or IX contained HSPA1B, DNAJB1, HSPH1, and TXN or PML, LYN, and DUSP1, and were mainly associated with cellular compromise, and cellular function and maintenance or death, and cancer, respectively. In the decreased gene cluster II, the gene network D1 including CCNE1 and CEBPE was associated with the cell cycle and cellular growth and proliferation. These findings will provide a basis for understanding the detailed molecular mechanisms of apoptosis induced by hyperthermia at 42 degrees C in cells.

J	Gao, ZK; Jin, ND				Gao Zhong-Ke; Jin Ning-De			Complex network analysis in inclined oil-water two-phase flow	CHINESE PHYSICS B			English	Article						two-phase flow; complex networks; community structure; nonlinear dynamics	TIME-SERIES; DYNAMICS; MODEL; ORGANIZATION; VELOCITY; PIPE	Complex networks have established themselves in recent years as being particularly suitable and flexible for representing and modelling many complex natural and artificial systems. Oil-water two-phase flow is one of the most complex systems. In this paper, we use complex networks to study the inclined oil-water two-phase flow. Two different complex network construction methods are proposed to build two types of networks, i.e. the flow pattern complex network (FPCN) and fluid dynamic complex network (FDCN). Through detecting the community structure of FPCN by the community-detection algorithm based on K-means clustering, useful and interesting results are found which can be used for identifying three inclined oil-water flow patterns. To investigate the dynamic characteristics of the inclined oil-water two-phase flow, we construct 48 FDCNs under different flow conditions, and find that the power-law exponent and the network information entropy, which are sensitive to the flow pattern transition, can both characterize the nonlinear dynamics of the inclined oil-water two-phase flow. In this paper, from a new perspective, we not only introduce a complex network theory into the study of the oil-water two-phase flow but also indicate that the complex network may be a powerful tool for exploring nonlinear time series in practice.

J	Jayanti, S; Kalyanaraman, Y; Ramani, K				Jayanti, Subramaniam; Kalyanaraman, Yagnanarayanan; Ramani, Karthik			Shape-based clustering for 3D CAD objects: A comparative study of effectiveness	COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN			English	Article						Shape-based clustering; Clustering effectiveness; Shape	RETRIEVAL	3D shape retrieval and clustering is of current interest in several different fields, including mechanical engineering. Several new shape representations for 3D objects are continuing to emerge. Most shape representations are embedded in a variety of feature spaces. However, some of the recently reported shape representations are embedded in arbitrary metric spaces, i.e. distance spaces, rather than in multidimensional feature space. For such representations, the only operations available on the data objects are distance calculations between the objects. In addition, some of the view-based representations are embedded in non-metric spaces where the representations and the corresponding distances do not follow the triangle inequality. For shape clustering applications, most existing algorithms assume the shape representations either to be embedded in a multi-dimensional feature space or a metric distance space, making it difficult to evaluate several shape representations that do not conform to these assumptions. Therefore, two different approaches were evaluated for using the distance features of a shape to obtain clustering results. In the first method, the original distances are transformed into feature space using a multi-dimensional scaling approach for use with K-means clustering. The second approach directly uses the original distances with a distance-based clustering algorithm. We compared the clustering effectiveness of these two approaches using a classified benchmark database of 3D models. The effect of using different shape descriptors and number of clusters was studied using four measures of clustering effectiveness. Several statistical methods, including the Rand Index and Mutual Information Index, were used to objectively evaluate the clustering efficacy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Survey data. collected in 1999 from 3.051 Finnish forest owners, includes information oil objectives for ownership as well as annual harvest volumes between 1994 and 1998. Ownership objectives are identified using principal component analysis, and five forest ownership objective groups are generated using K-means clustering: multiobjective owners, investors. self employed owners, recreationists, and indifferent owners. Along with stumpage price, reforestation costs and forest and owner characteristics, including the above objective groups, are used is explanatory variables in estimating the Supply equation. A consistent estimation method allowing for heteroscedasticity and non-normality is used. Statistically significant elasticity of the unconditional mean harvest with respect to timber price is 1.3 Recreationists and indifferent forest owners, ceteris paribus, harvest about 2 m(3)/ha/year less than multiobjective owners and self-employed owners. whereas investors and indifferent owners are more price-responsive than the other groups.

For all taxonomic groups we found a hierarchical structure in the community assemblage using distinct scales of lake clustering (number of k-means groups) based on species composition similarity (Hellinger distance). We determined the optimal partition in assemblage types (i.e. number of lake clusters) for each taxonomic group by maximising the sum of the taxon indicative value (IndVal) and performed discriminant analyses, using environmental variables not conditioned by geographical patterns. Relevant environmental variables differed among and within taxonomic groups. Therefore the assemblages respond to a complex environmental mosaic, with the exception of diatom assemblages, which followed an acid-base gradient. The significant environmental variables could be grouped into four general factors: lake size, tropho-dynamic status, acid-base balance and ice-cover duration (i.e., altitudinal gradient). Lake size was significant for the highest number of assemblage types; however, the most significant factor differed among taxonomic groups: acid-base balance for diatoms, lake size for rotifers, ice-cover duration for chydorids and planktonic crustaceans and tropho-dynamic status for chironomids. No single environmental typology accounted for the assemblage structure of all taxonomic groups. However, defining ecological thresholds as values within environmental gradients at which the rate of change in assemblages is accelerated relative to points distant from that threshold, we were able to find specific threshold values for each of the four main general environmental factors identified, which were relevant across several taxonomic groups: 3 ha for lake area; 0.6 mg L-1 for dissolved organic carbon; 190 days for ice-cover duration and 200 mu eq L-1 for acid neutralising capacity. Above and below these values ecosystem organisation change substantially. They have direct applications in establishing lake typologies for environmental quality and biodiversity conservation programmes, and in improving predictions about global change impacts.

To this end, fMRI activation patterns elicited during the processing of words from different semantic categories were categorized using k-means cluster algorithms. Results showed a distributed pattern of inferiorfrontal, superiortemporal, and fusiforrn activation shared by different word categories. This shared activation contrasted with patterns of category-specific semantic activation in widely distributed neural systems. Clustering revealed congruent functional specificity of focal area activations in frontal and temporal cortex; thus suggesting a correspondence between functional partitionings of frontocentral mirror neuron systems and those of inferiortemporal lexical and semantic circuits. Action words related to the face, arms, and legs specifically activated the motor system in a somatotopic manner, whereas form-related words activated prefrontal areas. Similar functional specificity was evident in temporal cortex, where a different semantic topography emerged for form- and action-related words. Results were replicated in a separate data set, therefore recommending fMRI cluster analysis as a reliable method for scrutinizing the brain basis of lexical, semantic, and conceptual systems in humans. As focal modules do not explain the distributed character of functionally specific clusters and their distinct topographies are at variance with general distributed processing accounts, the functionally-homogenous distributed clusters specific to semantic types are best explained by specifically-distributed cortical circuits which, similar to Hebbian cell assemblies, represent functional units with specific roles in cognitive processing, especially in lexical and semantic access and memory.

J	Contin, A; Pastore, S				Contin, Alfredo; Pastore, Stefano			Classification and Separation of Partial Discharge Signals by Means of their Auto-correlation Function Evaluation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DIELECTRICS AND ELECTRICAL INSULATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Dielectric Liquids	JUN, 2008	Poitiers, FRANCE	IEEE		Partial Discharges; signal classification; diagnostics; solid insulation	MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON TECHNIQUE; PD PATTERN-RECOGNITION; ON-FIELD MEASUREMENTS; POWER TRANSFORMERS; INSULATION SYSTEMS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; SURFACE CONDUCTIVITY; TURBINE GENERATORS; ELECTRICAL TREES; NOISE REJECTION	This paper describes a K-Means Clustering classification algorithm for the separation of Partial Discharge (PD) signals and pulsating noise due to multiple sources occurring in practical objects. It is based on the comparison of the Auto-Correlation Function (ACF) of the recorded signals assuming that the same source can generate signals having similar ACF while ACF differ when signals with different shapes are compared. The ACF has been selected for its capability of well summarize both time- and frequency-dependent features of the signals. A correlation index that presents the best compromise between strong and weak discrimination among pulses, has been selected out of different distance measurements. The final result of the algorithm is a set of classes containing signals having similar shape which can be processed successively for signal source identification. Meaningful applications of the proposed algorithm are also reported. Improvements in separation effectiveness can enhance the clearness of the PD patterns and, consequently, the quality of the defect identification.

It aims at simultaneously solving the following three different issues: 1) estimation of the class statistical parameters; 2) detection of the best discriminative bands without requiring the a priori setting of their number by the user; and 3) estimation of the number of data classes characterizing the considered image. It is formulated within a multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) framework and is guided by three different optimization criteria, which are the log-likelihood function, the Bhattacharyya statistical distance between classes, and the minimum description length (MDL). A detailed experimental analysis was conducted on both simulated and real hyperspectral images.

Given a set of sensors whose readings evolve over time, we want to maintain the k-means of the readings continuously. The optimization goal is to reduce the reporting cost in the network, that is, let as few sensors as possible report their current readings to the data center in the course of maintenance. To tackle the problem, we propose the reading reporting tree, a hierarchical data collection, and analysis framework. Moreover, we develop several reporting cost-effective methods using reading reporting trees in continuous k-means monitoring. First, a uniform sampling method using a reading reporting tree can achieve good quality approximation of k-means. Second, we propose a reporting threshold method which can guarantee the approximation quality. Last, we explore a lazy approach which can reduce the intermediate computation substantially. We conduct a systematic simulation evaluation using synthetic data sets to examine the characteristics of the proposed methods.

First, two anchoring values are obtained using the double-anchoring theory. Second, we use the two values to formulate the compressing operator, which can achieve the aim of tone mapping directly. A new method based on accelerated K-means for the decomposition of HDR images into groups (frameworks) is proposed. Most importantly, a group of piecewise-overlap linear functions is put forward to define the belongingness of pixels to their locating frameworks. Experiments show that our algorithm is capable of achieving dynamic range compression, while preserving fine details and avoiding common artifacts such as gradient reversals, halos, or loss of local contrast.

J	Peters, G; Tagg, R				Peters, Georg; Tagg, Roger			Intelligent Concepts for the Management of Information in Workflow Systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Intelligent Concepts; Soft Computing; Degree of Information; Information Management; Workflow Management	ROUGH K-MEANS; SETS	Workflow systems are commonly used in industry, commerce and government. They provide computerized support for owners of repetitive, highly standardized business processes, with a means of controlling the execution of instances of those processes according to predefined process templates. However, many real-life business processes are characterized by various forms of unpredictability and uncertainty. For workflow systems to be applicable in these environments therefore, they must incorporate methods of addressing uncertainty, vagueness, variability, exceptional cases and missing information. Methods that have been previously been applied include dynamic instance adaptation, partial completion and case handling - not to mention manual over-riding in the case of exceptions. Intelligent approaches have included stochastic and fuzzy Petri Nets. In this paper, we discuss the further potential of intelligent concepts, in particular rough set theory, for the support of the management of information in workflow systems. Since its introduction in the beginning of the nineteen eighties, rough set theory has gained increasing attention and has established itself as a useful intelligent concept and an important method within soft computing. We show how rough sets can be utilized to set up an early warning system in cases where information is missing in the workflow system. We also show the potential of rough sets to detect excessive or redundant information in a workflow management system's design.

J	Wattanachon, U; Lursinsap, C				Wattanachon, Ureerat; Lursinsap, Chidchanok			SPSM: A NEW HYBRID DATA CLUSTERING ALGORITHM FOR NONLINEAR DATA ANALYSIS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Data clustering; unsupervised learning algorithm; data analysis	TREE	Existing clustering algorithms, such as single-link clustering, k-means, CURE, and CSM are designed to find clusters based on predefined parameters specified by users. These algorithms may be unsuccessful if the choice of parameters is inappropriate with respect to the data set being clustered. Most of these algorithms work very well for compact and hyper-spherical clusters. In this paper, a new hybrid clustering algorithm called Self-Partition and Self-Merging (SPSM) is proposed. The SPSM algorithm partitions the input data set into several subclusters in the first phase and, then, removes the noisy data in the second phase. In the third phase, the normal subclusters are continuously merged to form the larger clusters based on the inter-cluster distance and intra-cluster distance criteria. From the experimental results, the SPSM algorithm is very efficient to handle the noisy data set, and to cluster the data sets of arbitrary shapes of different density. Several examples for color image show the versatility of the proposed method and compare with results described in the literature for the same images. The computational complexity of the SPSM algorithm is O(N(2)), where N is the number of data points.

J	Park, DC				Park, Dong-Chul			CENTROID NEURAL NETWORK WITH WEIGHTED FEATURES	JOURNAL OF CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS			English	Article						Centroid neural network; clustering; feature; image compression; k-means	IMAGE COMPRESSION; CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM; SELF-ORGANIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; MAP	A Centroid Neural Network with Weighted Features (CNN-WF) is proposed and presented in this paper. The proposed CNN-WF is based on a Centroid Neural Network (CNN), an effective clustering tool that has been successfully applied to various problems. In order to evaluate the importance of each feature in a set of data, a feature weighting concept is introduced to the Centroid Neural Network in the proposed algorithm. The weight update equations for CNN-WF are derived by applying the Lagrange multiplier procedure to the objective function constructed for CNN-WF in this paper. The use of weighted features makes it possible to assess the importance of each feature and to reject features that can be considered as noise in data. Experiments on a synthetic data set and a typical image compression problem show that the proposed CNN-WF can assess the importance of each feature and the proposed CNN-WF outperforms conventional algorithms including the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and CNN in terms of clustering accuracy.

J	Malinverni, ES; Fangi, G				Malinverni, Eva Savina; Fangi, Gabriele			Comparative cluster analysis to localize emergencies in archaeology	JOURNAL OF CULTURAL HERITAGE			English	Article						Remote sensing; Quickbird; K-means; Fuzzy classification; Open source; Archaeology		In the Northwestern Peru, near the city of Trujillo, an Italian Archaeological Mission (MIPE), in close collaboration with the National Institute of Culture (INC) of Peru, is working on the site of Chan Chan, the widest archaeological complex in the world for the constructions in raw earth. The mission is carrying out a multidisciplinary survey with the purpose to study a methodology for the site maintenance and the creation of a local center of documentation. Inside this project we want to explain a step of the research by means of a remote sensing analysis based on a Quickbird high-resolution image. By applying some image classification techniques, it has been possible to investigate the whole archaeological site, with the aim of a better definition of its general features and of a contribution to the exploitation of the surroundings. This analysis was carried out in open source environment implementing and performing two different classification algorithms and comparing the final results. As we had at our disposal no set of reliable ground truth of the study area it was necessary to follow an unsupervised classification approach. The off-line clustering techniques have been: K-means and Fuzzy K-means. Both approaches rely on minimizing a cost function of dissimilarity (distance) measure. We have overcome the problem of data group overlapping in a hard classification testing a fuzzy approach where each observation belongs to a cluster with a fuzzy membership degree. The resulted classification clearly separates the central archaeological site from the areas intensively cultivated and besides puts in evidence the coastal band, characterized by a reduced parceling and by the presence of damp zones. Another purpose of this research has been also to individualize the principal features of the Chan Chan site, possibly, by putting in evidence some archaeological emergencies and discovering new mark and signs. We performed every phase by the software Integrated Land and Water Information System (ILWIS) 3.4 developed by the ITC of Enschede and open source from July 2007. All collected information are useful to organize a master plan in a GIS, dedicated to the conservation of the archaeological complex. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The proposed method took gray-levels as an input. The similarity of gray-levels relating to two pixels at the corresponding position for bi-tempord images was obtained through similarity operator. Then the global threshold value of similarity was got, which was used to control the joint-classifier based on K-means to classify the bi-temporal images. Finally, The change-detection map was produced by comparing with both classified images. Experimental results confirm that the proposed method not only improves the precision of classification for single image but also accurately classifies the unchanged geographical information in different temporal images into the same class. The proposed method reduces the influence of the cumulative error and improves the performance of change detection.

We tested the hypothesis that "fibromyalgia syndrome" is a biopsychosocial continuum disorder. Methods. A cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of the Get-man general population with persons 2: 14 years of age was conducted based on face-to-face contacts. Physical distress was measured by the regional pain scale (RPS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire 15 (PHQ-15), psychological distress by the PHQ-9, and social distress by the Oslo Social Support Scale. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was measured by the 12-item form of the Medical Outcome Study Short Form Health Survey. A k-means clustering procedure with 2-8 clusters preset was used to classify the scores of the RPS, PHQ-9. and PHQ-15. The number Of Clusters retained was based on the stability and interpretability of the clusters. The Cluster analysis was first performed with a randomly selected half of the sample and then cross-validated on the second half of the total sample. Results. A 4-cluster solution produced the most stable and meaningful results. Cluster I was very low on all symptom scores. Cluster 2 was low on pain sites, somatic symptoms, and depression. Cluster 3 was high on pain scores, moderate on somatic symptoms, and low on depression. Cluster 4 was high on all symptom scores. The centroids of cluster 4 met the survey criteria of fibromyalgia syndrome. Cluster 4 reported a lower HRQOL and less social support compared to the other 3 groups. Conclusion. A cluster within the continuum of biopsychosocial distress can be labeled fibromyalgia syndrome.

The results show that the toxic equivalency (TEQ) concentration in the flue gas of GS and RW averaged 0.090 and 0.044 ng international toxic equivalents (I-TEQ)/N.m(3), respectively. The TEQ concentration in the flue gas of PW averaged 0.050 ng I-TEQ/N.m(3). All PCDD/Fs concentrations from the stack flue gas are lower than the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration emission standard. Furthermore, the mean I-TEQ concentration in the ambient atmosphere ranged from approximately 0.019 to 0.165 pg I-TEQ/N.m(3), much lower than the environmental quality standards for dioxins in Japan (0.6 pg TEQ/N.m(3)). This work classified all sampling sites into three clusters according to k-means cluster analysis. The result shows a probable direct correlation between the GS incinerator and site C. Although the concentration from the PW plant did not exceed the emission standard, it was much higher than that in Fernandez-Martinez's study. For proper environmental management of dioxins, establishing a complete emission inventory of PCDD/Fs is necessary. The government of Taiwan should particularly pay more attention to power plants to address the information shortage.

We propose Wilks' lambda as a criterion to be minimized with respect to variable weights w(1),..., w(m). This criterion, that is the ratio of the determinant of the within-cluster sums of squares and cross products matrix and that of the between clusters sums of squares and cross products matrix, is equivalent to the D-optimality criterion in the optimal design theory and related to minimization of the volume of the simultaneous confidence region of the cluster means. We will present the computing algorithm for such K-means clustering and numerical examples, among which one is simulated, two are real and the other one is the real data set augmented with additional simulated noise variables.

Prognostically distinct clinical patterns of systemic lupus erythematosus identified by cluster analysis	LUPUS			English	Article						cluster analysis; disease patterns; mortality; systemic lupus erythematosus	IMMUNOLOGICAL FEATURES; REVISED CRITERIA; CHINESE PATIENTS; DISEASE; COHORT; ONSET; MANIFESTATIONS; CLASSIFICATION; ANTIBODIES; SUBSETS	The objective of this study was to evaluate the patterns of clinical manifestations and their mortality in a large cohort of Chinese patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. The cumulative clinical manifestations of a large group of Chinese systemic lupus erythematosus patients who fulfilled at least four American College of Rheumatology criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus were studied. Patients were divided into distinct groups by using the K-mean cluster analysis. Clinical features, prevalence of proliferative lupus nephritis (World Health Organization class III, IV), autoantibody profile, and treatment data were compared and the standardized mortality ratios were calculated for each cluster of patients. There were 1082 patients included in the study (mean age at systemic lupus erythematosus diagnosis 30.5 years; mean systemic lupus erythematosus duration 10.3 years). Three distinct groups of patients were identified. Cluster 1 (n = 347) was characterized predominantly by mucocutaneous manifestations (malar rash, discoid rash, photosensitivity, oral ulcer) and arthritis but having the lowest prevalence of serositis, hematologic manifestations (hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia), and proliferative lupus nephritis. Patients in cluster 2 (n = 409) had mainly renal and hematological manifestations but having the lowest prevalence of mucocutaneous manifestations. Pulmonary and gastrointestinal manifestations were significantly more frequent in cluster 2 than the other clusters. Cluster 3 patients (n = 326) had the most heterogeneous features. Besides having a high prevalence of mucocutaneous manifestations, serositis and hematologic manifestations, renal involvement, and proliferative lupus nephritis was also most prevalent among the three clusters. Patients in cluster 2 had a much higher standardized mortality ratio [standardized mortality ratio 7.23 (6.7-7.7), p < 0.001] than those in cluster 3 [standardized mortality ratio 1.27 (1.1-1.5), p = 0.005] and cluster 1 [standardized mortality ratio 0.95 (0.5-1.7), p = 0.86]. In conclusion, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus could be clustered into prognostically distinct patterns of clinical manifestations. Lupus (2009) 18, 1267-1275.	[To, C. H.; Mok, C.

This method only considers the fluid part of the cyst, even when there are several fluid intensities (fluid-fluid levels) or the cyst is multi-loculated. The nonhomogeneity phenomenon inherent in MRI was handled by a A means clustering algorithm that classified all of the voxels corresponding to the cyst fluid as the same voxel intensity. Level-set segmentation was expanded into the whole Cyst Volume and the resulting segmented Volume provided the measured Cyst volume. The semiautomatic method was compared with the usual manual method (manual Contour tracing) in terms of its ability to measure a known volume of water (gold standard) as well as the volume of 29 bone cysts. Both methods were equivalent with regards to the gold standard, but the semiautomatic method was more accurate. In terms of the experimental measurements, the semiautomatic method was more repeatable and reproducible, and less time-consuming and fastidious than the manual method. Out semiautomatic method uses only freeware and can be used routinely whenever measurement of a bone Cyst volume is needed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

NMR metabolic analysis of samples using fuzzy K-means clustering	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN CHEMISTRY			English	Article						fuzzy clustering; sample classification; metabolomics; metabolic profiling; mixture analysis; sample subtypes; (1)H NMR; phenotype analysis	CANCER CELL-LINES; H-1-NMR METABONOMICS; C-MEANS; DISEASE; CLASSIFICATION; ASSOCIATION; GUILT	The global analysis of metabolites can be used to define the phenotypes of cells, tissues or organisms. Classifying groups of samples based on their metabolic profile is one of the main topics of metabolomics research. Crisp clustering methods assign each feature to one cluster, thereby omitting information about the multiplicity of sample subtypes. Here, we present the application of fuzzy K-means clustering method for the classification of samples based on metabolomics 1D (1)H NMR fingerprints. The sample classification was performed on NMR spectra of cancer cell line extracts and of urine samples of type 2 diabetes patients and animal models. The cell line data set included NMR spectra of lipophilic cell extracts for two normal and three cancer cell lines with cancer cell lines including two invasive and one non-invasive cancers. The second data set included previously published NMR spectra of urine samples of human type 2 diabetics and healthy controls, mouse wild type and diabetes model and rat obese and lean phenotypes. The fuzzy K-means clustering method allowed more accurate sample classification in both data sets relative to the other tested methods including principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering (HCL) and K-means clustering. In the cell line samples, fuzzy clustering provided a clear separation of individual cell lines, groups of cancer and normal cell lines as well as non-invasive and invasive tumour cell lines. In the diabetes data set, clear separation of healthy controls and diabetics in all three models was possible only by using the fuzzy clustering method.

Viable Tumor Tissue Detection in Murine Metastatic Breast Cancer by Whole-Body MRI and Multispectral Analysis	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						multispectral analysis; whole-body; tumor; diffusion; metastasis; splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis	DIFFUSION; QUANTIFICATION; ACQUISITION; CARCINOMA; IMAGES; PET/CT; MODEL	Whole-body MRI combined with a semiautomated hierarchical multispectral image analysis technique was evaluated as a method for detecting viable tumor tissue in a murine model of metastatic breast cancer (4T1 cell line). Whole-body apparent diffusion coefficient, T(2), and proton density maps were acquired in this study. The viable tumor tissue segmentation included three-stage k-means clustering of the parametric maps, morphologic operations, application of a size threshold, and reader discrimination of the segmented objects. The segmentation results were validated by histologic evaluation, and the detection accuracy of the technique was evaluated at three size thresholds (15, 100, and 500 voxels). The accuracy was 88.9% for a 500-voxel size threshold, and the area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.84. The regions of segmented viable tumor tissue within the primary tumors were found mostly on the periphery of the tumors in agreement with the histologic findings. The presented technique was found capable of detecting metastases and segmenting the viable tumor from necrotic regions within tumors found in this model. It offers a noninvasive, whole-body, viable tumor tissue detection method for preclinical and potentially clinical applications such as tumor screening and evaluating therapeutic efficacy.

Model-Based Blind Estimation of Kinetic Parameters in Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE)-MRI	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						pharmacokinetic modeling; Tofts-Kety model; blind estimation; DCE-MRI; perfusion imaging; arterial input function	ARTERIAL INPUT FUNCTION; REFERENCE REGION MODEL; DCE-MRI DATA; QUANTIFICATION; DISPERSION	A method to simultaneously estimate the arterial input function (AIF) and pharmacokinetic model parameters from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI data was developed. This algorithm uses a parameterized functional form to model the AIF and k-means clustering to classify tissue time-concentration measurements into a set of characteristic curves. An iterative blind estimation algorithm alternately estimated parameters for the input function and the pharmacokinetic model. Computer simulations were used to investigate the algorithm's sensitivity to noise and initial estimates. In 12 patients with sarcomas, pharmacokinetic parameter estimates were compared with "truth" obtained from model regression using a measured AIF. When arterial voxels were included in the blind estimation algorithm, the resulting AIF was similar to the measured input function. The "true" K(trans) values in tumor regions were not significantly different than the estimated values, 0.99 +/- 0.41 and 0.86 +/- 0.40 min(-1), respectively, P = 0.27. "True" k(ep) values also matched closely, 0.70 +/- 0.24 and 0.65 +/- 0.25 min(-1), P = 0.08. When only tissue curves free of significant vascular contribution are used (v(p) < 0.05), the resulting AIF showed substantial delay and dispersion consistent with a more local AIF such as has been observed in dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging in the brain.

The proposed methods consist of more than one weak learner, which are trained in parallel or sequentially. In Bagging, the weak learners are trained in parallel by using randomly selected data from a given data set. The output for Bagging is given as the average among the weak learners. In AdaBoost, the weak learners are sequentially trained. The first weak learner is trained by using randomly selected data from a given data set. For the second and later weak learners, the probability distribution of learning data is modified so that each weak learner focuses on data involving higher error for the previous weak one. The output for AdaBoost is given as the weighted average among the weak learners. The presented simulation results show that the proposed methods can achieve a good performance in shorter learning times than conventional ones such as K-means and NG. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Because of its broad natural range, in the horizontal as well as in the vertical sense (from California to British Columbia and from sea level up to all altitude of 1500 in), a variety of its provenances has been differentiated. European foresters, thanks to their insight into Douglas fir productivity and usage in its native country, initiated at the beginning of the 19(th) century the establishment of provenance tests and research on the success of individual provenances outside their natural distribution. In the framework of the IUFRO programme, numerous European countries, among them Croatia, started provenance tests with the aim of reseal-ching the adaptability of this valuable species. In several bioclimatic localities ill Croatia (Istria, North-West, Central and Eastern Croatia) different provenances have shown good success. The importance of Douglas fir is becoming increasingly evident in conditions of a changing climate and when the possible application of Douglas fir ill the establishment of forest cultures is tal en into consideration. Douglas fir call be established oil uncovered forest and non-forest areas for wood supply or as a potential renewable energy source. The exploitation of wood and biomass from forest cultures enables the conservation of biodiversity and the survival of our natural forest ecosystems. Material and Methods: This paper is based on research conducted on a Douglas fir provenance trial in the locality of "Kontija" in Istria. The trial, in which ten Douglas fir provenances were included, started in 1969. On the trial plots, dendrometric parameters such as DBH and tree heights were measured oil the basis of which wood volume was calculated. Descriptive statistics were made for all analysed variables (DBH h, V The differences between the provenances for the investigated variables were tested with all analysis of variance (ANOVA). Provenances which differ between themselves were determined using the Tukey post hoc test. According to data oil the survival rate for all provenances, the average survival Rate inside the trial was estimated and tested With a test of proportion to determine which provenances differ statistically from the average survival rate. Using a non-hierarchical (k-means) cluster analysis, provenances were grouped according to standardised variables (N, DBH, h, V). In the same way, the species' health condition was determined, as was the resistance of provenances to forest pests. Results and Conclusion: The average survival rate of all provenances in the trial amounts to 64.8% (ranging from 52% for the provenance PE ALL to 77% for the provenance ELMA). The best height growth was identified ill the provenance SHELTON which originates from lower altitudes ill Washington while the provenance SHADE COVE from higher areas of Oregon shows lowest growth. High volume is evidenced in the provenance PE ALL. The results of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) shoot, that there is a statistically significant difference for all analysed variables for the investigated provenance. A k-means cluster analysis grouped Douglas fir provenances in four clusters. In cluster 1, only the provenance SHADY COVE is included with a high number of trees with lower heights and smaller DBH and volume. Provenances from cluster 3 (PE ALL and YELM) have, in a small number of trees, higher DBH and volume. The rest of the provenances are grouped in two clusters (cluster 2 and cluster 4) with similar values but with the difference that the provenances SHELTON CORVALIS, ELMA and HVIDILDE (cluster 2) have higher values than average for the analysed parameters, While the provenances SIPKA BUZET and CASTLE ROCK (cluster4) have lower than average values. In general, all the provenances in the trial are vital and show a good health condition without any determined pests.

The objective of this study was to develop and compare different methods of delineating management zones (MZs) in a field of winter wheat. Soil and yield samples were collected, and five main crop nutrients were analyzed: total nitrogen (TN), nitrate nitrogen (NN), available phosphorus (AP), extractable potassium (EP) and organic matter (OM). At the wheat heading stage, a scene of Quickbird imagery was acquired and processed, and the optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) was determined. A fuzzy k-means clustering algorithm was used to define MZs, along with fuzzy performance index (FPI), and modified partition entropy (MPE) for determining the optimal number of clusters. The results showed that the optimal number of MZs for the present study area was three. The MZs were delineated in three ways; based on soil and yield data, crop RS information and the combination of soil, yield and RS information. The evaluation of each set of MZs showed that the three methods of delineating zones can all decrease the variance of the crop nutrients, wheat spectral parameters and yield within the different zones. Considering the consistent relationship between the crop nutrients, wheat yield and the wheat spectral parameters, satellite remote sensing shows promise as a tool for assessing the variation in soil properties and yield in arable fields. The results of this study suggest that management zone delineation using RS data was reliable and feasible.

J	Chiu, CY; Douglas, JA; Li, XD				Chiu, Chia-Yi; Douglas, Jeffrey A.; Li, Xiaodong			Cluster Analysis for Cognitive Diagnosis: Theory and Applications	PSYCHOMETRIKA			English	Article						cluster analysis; cognitive diagnosis; latent class analysis	K-MEANS; MONTE-CARLO; MODELS	Latent class models for cognitive diagnosis often begin with specification of a matrix that indicates which attributes or skills are needed for each item. Then by imposing restrictions that take this into account, along with a theory governing how subjects interact with items, parametric formulations of item response functions are derived and fitted. Cluster analysis provides an alternative approach that does not require specifying an item response model, but does require an item-by-attribute matrix. After summarizing the data with a particular vector of sum-scores, K-means cluster analysis or hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis can be applied with the purpose of clustering subjects who possess the same skills. Asymptotic classification accuracy results are given, along with simulations comparing effects of test length and method of clustering. An application to a language examination is provided to illustrate how the methods can be implemented in practice.

J	Ersoz, F				Ersoz, Filiz			Comparison of the Selected Health Indicators of OECD Member Countries with Cluster and Discriminant Analysis	TURKIYE KLINIKLERI TIP BILIMLERI DERGISI			Turkish	Article						Cluster analysis; discriminant analysis; health status indicators; health expenditures		Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the usefulness of clustering and discriminant analysis to compare selected health indicators of OECD countries and common features among them. Material and Methods: The most significant variables among health indicators in 2004-health expenditures per capita, life expectation at birth and death number per 1000 births-were used in the analysis. Three methods were used for comparison during the clustering procedure, the hierarchical method and two non-hierarchical methods, the K-means and Medoid clustering method. The number of clusters was decided to be 3 according to the hierarchical clustering method. Results: According to the K-means analysis, all four health indicators were effective among the selected indicators of 30 countries (p<0.05). The Medoid clustering method revealed that the shadow statistics was 0.51, which meant that "there was acceptable clustering structure among the units". The separating analysis used for testing the accuracy of the clustering analysis revealed a high mean value, low Wilk's Lambda and high cononic correlation values. The study showed that the first 20 countries to join the OECD were developed with high incomes, transferring adequate amount of money to health expenses and Turkey was among the second ten countries to join the OECD with health indicators similar to the countries with above average income. Conclusion: In conclusion, according to hierarchical clustering, Turkey clusters with Poland, Slovak Republic, Czech Republic, Hungary, Mexico, Korean Republic, according to non-hierarchical (K-means) clustering, with Portugal, Poland, Slovak Republic, Hungary, Czech Republic, Mexico, and Korean Republic and according to Medoid clustering, only with Mexico.

The energy profiles of atomic conformational transition intermediates of adenylate kinase	PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						adenylate kinase; CHARMM force-field; elastic networks; conformational transitions; transition intermediates; coarse-grained models; transition pathways; combinatorial extension	ELASTIC NETWORK MODEL; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; SINGLE-PARAMETER; PROTEIN DYNAMICS; FOLDED PROTEINS; SIMULATION; MOTIONS; DOMAIN; MACROMOLECULES; POTENTIALS	The elastic network interpolation (ENI) (Kim et al., Biophys J 2002;83:1620-1630) is a computationally efficient and physically realistic method to generate conformational transition intermediates between two forms of a given protein. However it can be asked whether these calculated conformations provide good representatives for these intermediates. In this study, we use ENI to generate conformational transition intermediates between the open form and the closed form of adenylate kinase (AK). Based on C(alpha)-only intermediates, we construct atomic intermediates by grafting all the atoms of known AK structures onto the C(alpha) atoms and then perform CHARMM energy minimization to remove steric conflicts and optimize these intermediate structures. We compare the energy profiles for all intermediates from both the CHARMM force-field and from knowledge-based energy functions. We find that the CHARMM energies can successfully capture the two energy minima representing the open AK and closed AK forms, while the energies computed from the knowledge-based energy functions can detect the local energy minimum representing the closed AK form and show some general features of the transition pathway with a somewhat similar energy profile as the CHARMM energies. The combinatorial extension structural alignment (Shindyalov et al., 1998;11:739-747) and the k-means clustering algorithm are then used to show that known PDB structures closely resemble computed intermediates along the transition pathway.

The set of observable parameters includes structural parameters, spectroscopically determined Lick indices and radial velocities from the literature. The optimum set of parameters for this type of analysis is selected through a modified technique of principal component analysis, which differs from the classical one in the sense that it takes into consideration the effects of outliers present in the data. Then a mixture model based approach has been used to classify the GCs into groups. The efficiency of the techniques used is tested through the comparison of the misclassification probabilities with those obtained using the K-means clustering technique. On the basis of the above classification scheme three coherent groups of GCs have been found. We propose that the clusters of one group originated in the original cluster formation event that coincided with the formation of the elliptical galaxy, and that the clusters of the two other groups are of external origin, from tidally stripped dwarf galaxies on random orbits around NGC 5128 for one group, and from an accreted spiral galaxy for the other.

Three communities were identified by using a fuzzy clustering algorithm to experimental observations (macrophytobenthos and macrozoobenthos data), and interpreted from a biological perspective by considering their indicator and dominant taxa. The results showed that the lagoon can be divided in areas dominated by a 'marine', an 'intermediate' and a 'confined' benthic community. Some differences in the extension of the three communities between the two years of monitoring were observed and related to significant differences in environmental parameters. The relationships between benthic communities' membership grades and a set of water quality, hydrodynamics and sediment composition parameters were then modelled by means of an artificial neural network model, using a back-propagation algorithm. Furthermore, the model was used to assess the relative contribution of predictors on membership grades of different communities, and to understand the relationships between cluster membership grades and predictors with highest relative contribution. Several responses of benthic communities to environmental parameters were non-linear and complex, which confirmed the advantage of using neural networks instead of other, more traditional statistical methods. The benthic community showed mainly 'marine' characteristics with low temperature, silt percentage in sediments and POC concentration in water. The 'confined' characteristics were pronounced in areas of low PO(4) and high DOP concentrations in water, low water energy and on wooden substrates. The 'intermediate' community was that predicted worst and was related mainly to high water salinity and temperatures around 16 degrees C. Finally, the model was used as a tool for the detection of anomalies, i.e., cases in which the predicted community was different from that observed. The anomalies were inspected and related to possible causes, such as a not optimal substrate, very low-bottom depth, complex local morphology, human disturbances, and slow adaptation of communities to changing abiotic characteristic.

Functional Clustering of Neurons in Motor Cortex Determined by Cellular Resolution Imaging in Awake Behaving Mice	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							IN-VIVO; BARREL CORTEX; VISUAL-CORTEX; ARM MOVEMENTS; ORGANIZATION; OPTIMIZATION; BRAIN; MICROSTIMULATION; STIMULATION; DIRECTION	Macroscopic (millimeter scale) functional clustering is a hallmark characteristic of motor cortex spatial organization in awake behaving mammals; however, almost no information is known about the functional micro-organization (similar to 100 mu m scale). Here, we optically recorded intracellular calcium transients of layer 2/3 neurons with cellular resolution over similar to 200-mu m-diameter fields in the forelimb motor cortex of mobile, head-restrained mice during two distinct movements (running and grooming). We showed that the temporal correlation between neurons was statistically larger the closer the neurons were to each other. We further explored this correlation by using two separate methods to spatially segment the neurons within each imaging field: K-means clustering and correlations between single neuron activity and mouse movements. The two methods segmented the neurons similarly and led to the conclusion that the origin of the inverse relationship between correlation and distance seen statistically was twofold: clusters of highly temporally correlated neurons were often spatially distinct from one another, and (even when the clusters were spatially intermingled) within the clusters, the more correlated the neurons were to each other, the shorter the distance between them. Our results represent a direct observation of functional clustering within the microcircuitry of the awake mouse motor cortex.

On Evolutionary Spectral Clustering	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA			English	Article						Algorithms; Experimentation; Measurement; Theory		Evolutionary clustering is an emerging research area essential to important applications such as clustering dynamic Web and blog contents and clustering data streams. In evolutionary clustering, a good clustering result should fit the current data well, while simultaneously not deviate too dramatically from the recent history. To fulfill this dual purpose, a measure of temporal smoothness is integrated in the overall measure of clustering quality. In this article, we propose two frameworks that incorporate temporal smoothness in evolutionary spectral clustering. For both frameworks, we start with intuitions gained from the well-known k-means clustering problem, and then propose and solve corresponding cost functions for the evolutionary spectral clustering problems. Our solutions to the evolutionary spectral clustering problems provide more stable and consistent clustering results that are less sensitive to short-term noises while at the same time are adaptive to long-term cluster drifts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methods provide the optimal solutions to the relaxed versions of the corresponding evolutionary k-means clustering problems. Performance experiments over a number of real and synthetic data sets illustrate our evolutionary spectral clustering methods provide more robust clustering results that are not sensitive to noise and can adapt to data drifts.

As a result, bulk measurements can be misleading even when particular care has been taken to isolate a single cell type. and measurements averaged over multiple cell populations in a tissue can be as misleading as the average height at an elementary school. There is a growing need for experimental techniques that can provide a combination of single cell resolution, large cell populations, and the ability to track cells over multiple time points. In this article, a microwell array cytometry platform was developed to meet this need and investigate the heterogeneity and stochasticity of cell behavior on a single cell basis. The platform consisted of a microfabricated device with high-density, arrays of cell-sized microwells and custom software for automated image processing and data analysis. As a model experimental system, we used primary hepatocytes labeled with fluorescent probes sensitive to mitochondrial membrane potential and free radical generation. The cells were exposed to oxidative stress and the responses were dynamically monitored for each cell. The resulting data was then analyzed using bioinformatics techniques such as hierarchical and k-means clustering to visualize the data and identify interesting features. The results showed that clustering of the dynamic data not only enhanced comparisons between the treatment groups but also revealed a number of distinct response patterns within each treatment group. Heat-maps with hierarchical clustering also provided a data-rich complement to survival curves in a dose response experiment. The microwell array cytometry platform was shown to be powerful easy to use, and able to provide a detailed picture of the heterogeneity, present in cell responses to oxidative stress.

QSAR for the toxicity of diverse aromatic compounds to Tetrahymena pyriformis using chemometric tools	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						QSAR; QSTR; ETA; Tetrahymena pyriformis; Chemometric tools	FUNCTIONAL ACYCLIC COMPOUNDS; MOLECULAR-FIELD ANALYSIS; TAU-INDEXES; ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; PHENYLSULFONYL CARBOXYLATES; THERMOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; SUBSTITUTED BENZENES; CONNECTIVITY CONCEPT; PART I; QSPR	We have developed QSTR models for the toxicity of 384 diverse aromatic compounds to Tetrahymena pyriformis with recently introduced extended topochemical atom (ETA) indices and compared the ETA models with those derived from various non-ETA topological descriptors and also combined set of descriptors encompassing the ETA and non-ETA parameters. The data set was split into test (25% compounds of total data points) and training (remaining 75%) sets based on K-mean clustering technique. Different statistical analyses (factor analysis followed by multiple linear regression (FA-MLR), stepwise regression and partial least squares (PLS)) were performed with the training set compounds to develop QSTR models using the topological descriptors. All the developed models were cross-validated using leave-one-out (LOO) technique. The best models were selected on the basis of predicted R 2 values for test set compounds. The best models (based on external validation) developed from different techniques came from the combined set of descriptors. The above results indicate that the use of ETA descriptors with non-ETA descriptors improved the statistical quality of the non-ETA models. From the best models involving ETA parameters, it is observed that functionality of halogen atoms (hydrophobicity), volume parameter (bulk) and nitrogen containing functionalities (polarity) are important for developing QSTR models for the current data set. This study suggests that ETA parameters are sufficient power to encode chemical information contributing significantly to the toxicity of diverse aromatic compounds to T. pyriformis.

Text document clustering based on neighbors	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Document clustering; Text mining; k-means; Bisecting k-means; Performance analysis	K-MEANS; ALGORITHM	Clustering is a very powerful data mining technique for topic discovery from text documents. The partitional clustering algorithms, such as the family of k-means, are reported performing well on document clustering. They treat the clustering problem as an optimization process of grouping documents into k clusters so that a particular criterion function is minimized or maximized. Usually, the cosine function is used to measure the similarity between two documents in the criterion function, but it may not work well when the clusters are not well separated. To solve this problem, we applied the concepts of neighbors and link, introduced in [S. Guha, R. Rastogi, K. Shim, ROCK: a robust clustering algorithm for categorical attributes, Information Systems 25 (5) (2000) 345-366], to document clustering. If two documents are similar enough, they are considered as neighbors of each other. And the link between two documents represents the number of their common neighbors. Instead of just considering the pairwise similarity, the neighbors and link involve the global information into the measurement of the closeness of two documents. In this paper, we propose to use the neighbors and link for the family of k-means algorithms in three aspects: a new method to select initial cluster centroids based on the ranks of candidate documents; a new similarity measure which uses a combination of the cosine and link functions; and a new heuristic function for selecting a cluster to split based on the neighbors of the cluster centroids. Our experimental results on real-life data Sets demonstrated that our proposed methods can significantly improve the performance of document clustering in terms of accuracy without increasing the execution time much.

In this work, a computational strategy is introduced to define homogeneous areas at risk and the main factors acting as determinants of LD. The procedure consists of three steps and is applied to a set of ten environmental indicators available at the municipality scale in Latium, central Italy. A principal component analysis extracting latent patterns and simplifying data complexity was carried out on the original data matrix. Subsequently, a k-means cluster analysis was applied on a restricted number of meaningful, latent factors extracted by PCA in order to produce a classification of the study area into homogeneous regions. Finally, a stepwise discriminant analysis was performed to determine which indicators contributed the most to the definition of homogeneous regions. Three classes of "risky" regions were identified according to the main drivers of LD acting at the local scale. These include: (i) soil sealing (coupled with landscape fragmentation, fire risk, and related processes), (ii) soil salinization due to agricultural intensification, and (iii) soil erosion due to farmland depopulation and land abandonment in sloping areas. Areas at risk for LD covered 56 and 63% of the investigated areas in 1970 and 2000, respectively.

J	Xing-Zhi, W; Zheng, Y; Qian-Tu, R; Wei, W				Xing-Zhi, Wang; Zheng, Yan; Qian-Tu, Ruan; Wei, Wang			A kernel-based clustering approach to finding communities in multi-machine power systems	EUROPEAN TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL POWER			English	Article						clustering; data mining; kernel k-means; power system security; transient stability	NETWORK; ENERGY	When a power system is subjected to a large disturbance, effective identification of vulnerable bus and generator groupings in the complex power grid contributes to the analysis of power system dynamic behavior. Also, computationally simple and reliable identification of clusters is of primary importance in the successful application of hybrid transient stability assessment methods. In the paper, a kernel-based clustering approach is proposed to finding communities of power grids and generators, using data clustering and multi-machine equivalent concept. The calculation of the cluster analysis is simple and fast, as only the network topology and generator dynamic parameters along the post-fault trajectory are required. Case studies using different scale test systems are given to illustrate the validity of the proposed method. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Many segmentation algorithms have been developed for various applications. Unsatisfactory results have been encountered in some cases, for many existing segmentation algorithms. In this paper, we introduce three modified versions of the conventional moving k-means clustering algorithm called the fuzzy moving k-means, adaptive moving k-means and adaptive fuzzy moving k-means algorithms for image segmentation application. Based on analysis done using standard images (i.e. original bridge and noisy bridge) and hard evidence on microscopic digital image (i.e. segmentation of Sprague Dawley rat sperm), our final segmentation results compare favorably with the results obtained by the conventional k-means, fuzzy c-means and moving k-means algorithms. The qualitative and quantitative analysis done proved that the proposed algorithms are less sensitive with respect to noise. As such, the occurrence of dead centers, center redundancy and trapped center at local minima problems can be avoided. The proposed clustering algorithms are also less sensitive to initialization process of clustering value. The final center values obtained are located within their respective groups of data. This enabled the size and shape of the object in question to be maintained and preserved. Based on the simplicity and capabilities of the proposed algorithms, these algorithms are suitable to be implemented in consumer electronics products such as digital microscope, or digital camera as post processing tool for digital images.
