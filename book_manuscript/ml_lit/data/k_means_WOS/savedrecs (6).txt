An Efficient Character Recognition Scheme Based on K-Means Clustering	2013 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODELING, SIMULATION AND APPLIED OPTIMIZATION (ICMSAO)			English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Modeling, Simulation and Applied Optimization (ICMSAO)	APR 28-30, 2013	Hammamet, TUNISIA				HANDWRITTEN DIGIT RECOGNITION	Handwritten character recognition has been an active area of research. However, because of the recent advancements in mobile devices with limited amount of memory and computational power, efficient and simple algorithms for both online and offline character recognition have become more appealing. In this work, an efficient character recognition systems is proposed using LDA Analysis followed by a Bayesian discriminator function based on the Mahalonobis distance. Since LDA is tailored for Gaussian distributed data and the samples dimensionality is high, a couple of preprocessing steps have been applied to reduce dimensionality and cluster the data into semi-Gaussian subclasses. In the first step, affine transformations are applied to the training samples in order to make the scheme robust against distortion. Scaling and Rotation are among those popular distortions which have been considered in this work. Inactive pixels are cut off using a simple algorithm in the next step. Then, principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering are applied. The results from preprocessing showed a great potential in dimensionality reduction using transformations that can preserve useful information. Numerical results on the MNIST dataset reached 3% error rate which is lower than the other linear approaches. The proposed linear techniques are discussed in a way that make it easier to have a much clearer understanding of the method and why it works compared to the other classification methods.

Method for Evaluating k-Means Clustering for Increased Reliability in Cognitive Radio Networks	2013 IEEE 7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE SECURITY AND RELIABILITY (SERE)	International Conference on Software Security and Reliability		English	Proceedings Paper	7th IEEE International Conference on Software Security and Reliability (SERE)	JUN 18-20, 2013	Gaithersburg, MD	IEEE, Natl Inst Stand & Technol, IEEE Reliabil Soc, IEEE Comp Soc		adaptive; hopset; k-means clustering; radio environment map		The radio frequency (RF) spectrum is a limited resource. Spectrum allotment disputes stem from this scarcity as many radio devices are confined to a fixed frequency or frequency sequence. One alternative is to incorporate cognition within a reconfigurable radio platform, therefore enabling the radio to adapt to dynamic RF spectrum environments. In this way, the radio is able to actively sense the RF spectrum, decide, and act accordingly, thereby sharing the spectrum and operating in more flexible manner. This paper presents a novel method for determining clustering configurations for various network topologies and RF spectrum environments. Using the k-means clustering software testbed provided by the University of Maryland, we demonstrate through MATLAB simulation that it is possible and feasible to implement k-means clustering in a cognitive radio network. This resulting network configuration is resistant to interference via commonality between observed RF spectra. We also propose a new metric, Intra-Cluster Spectrum Similarity (ICSS), as the means for evaluating clustering effectiveness. We show that our method, when validated using ICSS, has great potential for improving cognitive radio network reliability in a dynamic spectrum environment.

Some groups have used clustering algorithms, like k-means, to use multimodal distributions in different modifications of EDA. Most proposals use a fixed number of groups or clusters, and other works use heuristic approaches to find the right number of clusters in the search space without any previous information. The heuristic methods, however, lack the mathematical rigor required in the inference of a probability distribution's parameters. In this work, we propose the use of the Nonparametric Bayesian Model known as Dirichlet Process to fit the number of clusters given the data in a modified Population Based Incremental Learning (PBIL) model. We compare our approach with similar techniques that also use multimodal probability distributions to enhance the quality of the search in other EDA approaches. Our approach shows improvements by reducing the number of generations needed to find good results that are comparable to the state of the art in clustered EDA.

Over the last few years, clustering that seeks the continuity of data (in opposition to classical centroid-based approaches) has attracted an increasing research interest. It is a challenging problem with a remarkable practical interest. The most popular continuity clustering method is the Spectral Clustering algorithm, which is based on graph cut: it initially generates a Similarity Graph using a distance measure and then uses its Graph Spectrum to find the best cut. Memory consuption is a serious limitation in that algorithm: The Similarity Graph representation usually requires a very large matrix with a high memory cost. This work proposes a new algorithm, based on a previous implementation named Genetic Graph-based Clustering (GGC), that improves the memory usage while maintaining the quality of the solution. The new algorithm, called Multi-Objective Genetic Graph-based Clustering (MOGGC), uses an evolutionary approach introducing a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm to manage a reduced version of the Similarity Graph. The experimental validation shows that MOGGC increases the memory efficiency, maintaining and improving the GGC results in the synthetic and real datasets used in the experiments. An experimental comparison with several classical clustering methods (EM, SC and K-means) has been included to show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

A large amount of smart metering data and other supporting data are available, enabling the development of new, intelligent data-driven fashions for recognising and modelling loads. However, it is a challenge to extract useful information from this massive, often aggregated data in a reliable and understandable fashion. In this paper we present a data-driven approach, for recognising and modelling of controllable heating loads of small customers. Main computational methods used include self-organizing map (SOM), k-means algorithm and support vector regression (SVR). The approach consists of two major stages, namely (i) the recognition of customers that have electrical heating using clustering based on extracted behavioural features and (ii) the predictive regression modelling of controllable heating loads in recognised customer segment. One year of hourly metered electricity consumption data from 525 customers having heterogeneous heating systems, combined with available hourly measured outdoor temperatures and site-specific building information, were used as the base data in the model development and validation.

We use the Bag-of-Features and a local part model approach for bare hand dynamic gesture recognition from video. We use a dense sampling to extract local 3D multiscale whole-part features. We adopted three-dimensional histograms of a gradient orientation (3D HOG) descriptor to represent features. The K-means++ method was applied to cluster the visual words. Dynamic hand gesture classification was conducted by using a Bag-of-features (BOF) and non-linear support vector machine (SVM) methods. As the BOF does not track the order of events we use a multiscale local part model to preserve temporal context. Initial experimental results show a higher level of recognition. A voice recognition system is then used to translate voice commands complementing the hand gesture commands for the human-intuitive control of a personal service android robot for smart home or long-term healthcare environment applications.

A vector space model of the documents based on their key phrases are formed and called sparse matrix which contains many zero values. A sparse dimensional reduction and several methods of clustering include K-means, Self Organizing and Non-negative Matrices Factorization (NMF) are applied to the data, then the results are compared. Sparse method in dimensional reduction step using Arnoldi Method provides a better result of clustering validity twice more than standard dimensional reduction result.

The proposed method can classify the pathological cell and the normal cell to two cluster memberships and the disturbances can also be eliminated from the image. In addition, by morphological image processing and Sobel edge algorithm, the pathological cell image can be segmented accurately from the image with pathological cell and normal cell. Finally, some images are illustrated to demonstrate the proposed method is superior to K-means and DBSCAN.

It is known that data clustering SOM is one of the most popular neural networks used for image segmentation. The interpretation of SOM output has to be further processed for obtaining segmented image. In the proposed method the SOM is used with extracted features data and the output is analyzed to obtain the best match units (BMU). The highest winners of BMU's are considered as a cluster representative. In the second stage the winner BMU's are filtered to derive the best cluster representative based on number of clusters and predefined Euclidean distance between the winners. Finally the clustering labeling is carried out with reference to cluster representative. This method has been tested with Berkeley's database and preliminary results are promising. The results have also been compared with FCM and K Means algorithms.

The different looking fragments of the same object impose the main challenge of producing a good segmentation. This leads to consider the high-level semantics of an image as well as the low-level visual features which require computationally intensive operations. This demands to optimize the computations as much as possible in order to reduce both computational and communication complexity. This paper proposes a framework which can be used to perform segmentation for a particular object by incorporating optimization in subsequent steps. The algorithm proposes an optimized K-means algorithm for image segmentation followed by balance calculations in multiple instance learning and topological relations with relative positions to identify OOI regions. Finally, a bayesian network is incorporated to contain the learned information about the model of the OOI. The preliminary experimental results suggest a significant drop in the complexity.

In order to separate different gestures from gesture sequences a novel method utilizing depth information, oriented gradients and supervised learning techniques is proposed in this paper. The temporal segmentation task is modeled as a two-class problem and histogram oriented gradients of the gesture boundary and non-boundary sample frames are incorporated in the feature table as positive and negative training vectors, respectively. The classification task is carried out using both Euclidean Distance based and Support Vector Machine classifiers. A clustering algorithm is employed thereafter to finally locate the temporal boundaries of gestures. Through extensive experimentation it is shown that, the proposed method can provide a high degree of accuracy in temporal gesture segmentation in comparison to a number of recent methods.

The model design is therefore complex for large database classification problems. In this article, two effective PNN reduction procedures are introduced. In the first approach, the PNN's pattern layer neurons are reduced by means of a k-means clustering procedure. The second method uses a support vector machines algorithm to select pattern layer nodes. Modified PNN networks are compared with the original model in medical data classification problems. The prediction ability expressed in terms of the 20% test set error for the networks is assessed. By means of the experiments, it is shown that the appropriate pruning of the pattern layer neurons in the PNN enhances the performance of the classifier.

However, an analysis of one of the Galaxy Zoo morphological classification data sets has shown that a significant majority of all classified galaxies are, in fact, labelled as "Uncertain". This has driven us to conduct experiments with data obtained from the SDSS database using each galaxy's right ascension and declination values, together with the Galaxy Zoo morphology class label, and the k-means clustering algorithm. This paper identifies the best attributes for clustering using a heuristic approach and, accordingly, applies an unsupervised learning technique in order to improve the classification of galaxies labelled as "Uncertain" and increase the overall accuracies of such data clustering processes. Through this heuristic approach, it is observed that the accuracy of classes-to-clusters evaluation, by selecting the best combination of attributes via information gain, is further improved by approximately 10-15%. An accuracy of 82.627% was also achieved after conducting various experiments on the galaxies labelled as "Uncertain" and replacing them back into the original data set. It is concluded that a vast majority of these galaxies are, in fact, of spiral morphology with a small subset potentially consisting of stars, elliptical galaxies or galaxies of other morphological variants.

Three clustering algorithms: K-means, K-medoids and Minimum Entropy Clustering (MEC) are compared. Preliminary partitioning of the data set is performed with help of immune based optimisation. Some time series representations and different clustering quality indices are considered. It is shown that clustering is able to reveal existing natural division. Moreover, it gives an opportunity to learn the issues of processing large number of multidimensional data and to identify potential problems which may occur in automatic classification of signed expressions. Results of ten-fold cross-validation tests for nearest neighbour classification are also given.

The determination of this parameter is necessary for many clustering algorithms to define the naturally existing clusters correctly. In the presented method the idea of the agglomerative hierarchical clustering has been used, and the modified RS cluster validity index has been applied. In the first phase of the method, clusters are created due to the idea of hierarchical clustering. Then, for the optimal number of clusters the k-means algorithm is performed. The method has been used for multidimensional data, and the received results confirm very good performances of the proposed method.

Clustering is one of the popular methods in this field. The purpose of clustering is to use a database and group together its items with similar characteristics. Application of clustering in many fields of science and engineering problems like Pattern recognition, data retrieval, bio-informatics, machine learning and the Internet cause to have significantly developed in the last decades. A rapid growth in the volume of information in databases revealed weakness of traditional methods like K-means in facing with huge data. In this paper a new clustering method based on the Inclined Planes system Optimization algorithm was proposed and evaluate on a series of standard datasets. Comparison study revealed a significant superiority over other similar clustering algorithms.

To address this problem, we extend MIH framework with a context-awareness module. More specifically, we present a clustering based context-aware mechanism for predicting stability of wireless links in our framework. Unlike existing works, which require prior knowledge on network environment and user mobility pattern, our proposed mechanism can automatically be aware of environmental interference, user location, user handover policy, and user mobility. A K-mean clustering method is adopted to process the classification of user context, and then the link stability is predicted with contidional probability according to different classifications. Experimental results show that our proposed context-aware prediction can well guide the mobile user to obtain a stable wireless link.

It implements the fingerprint technique to realize indoor navigation. The fingerprinting technique which employs the KNN algorithm has to make use of RSS (Received Signal Strength) from the Access Points (APs) without any classification. However, not all of the APs provide the contributions but interference, which will not only burden the positioning system but also results in poor positioning accuracy. To increase the positioning accuracy and decrease the computation cost of Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), a novel algorithm is proposed by implementing the KNN algorithm and Information Gain Theory to bridge the gap between the Access Point selection and positioning accuracy. The experiment results indicates that, the positioning accuracy is improved by 4.76% within 2m, and meanwhile the time for positioning is decreased by 23.81%, which means the proposed algorithm successfully achieves higher positioning accuracy with less computational cost. Besides, it is also proved in this paper that contrary to the traditional concept, more APs do not always mean higher positioning accuracy; on the opposite, in our experimental environment, a relatively small scale of APs can achieve higher positioning accuracy than that of large scale of APs.

We implement two feature selection techniques to rank the effectiveness of the features and select the "best" among them. Once the "best" feature(s) is (are) selected, a minimum distance classifier is used to classify the actigraphy signals into different types of activity. The minimum distance classifier uses class prototypes generated using either k-means or max-min clustering algorithm. Correct classification rates of 95%-100% were achieved using only 1-5 features.

The methodology analyzed uses K-means clustering and a linear support vector machine (SVM) to classify images using raw pixel data from the individual images. We explore improvement of classification accuracy through feature augmentation, use of alternatives to K-means clustering, and modifications to the SVM. In particular, we analyze potential classification accuracy improvements of feature augmentation via the addition of data generated by feature detection algorithms, the use of clustering methods which automatically calculate the number of centroids, and the effect of different types of kernels on the over classification accuracy. In our experiments, classification of the CIFAR-10 dataset is used to measure performance changes.

Existing OCR algorithms and tools produce good results from high resolution, good quality, document images. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based super resolution framework for low resolution document image OCR. Two main techniques are used in our proposed approach: a document page segmentation algorithm and a modified K-means clustering algorithm. Using this approach, by exploiting coherence in the document, we reconstruct from a low resolution document image a better resolution image and improve OCR results. Experimental results show substantial gain in low resolution documents such as the ones captured from video.

With this massive amount of information over the web from different social networks like Twitter, Facebook, Blogs, etc, there has to be an automatic tool that can determine the topics that people are talking about and what are there sentiments about these topics. The goal of the research described in this paper was to develop a prototype that can "feel" the pulse of the Arabic users with regards to a certain hot topic. Our experience in extracting Arabic hot topics from Twitter is presented in this paper. The unigram words that occurred more than 20 times in the whole corpus were used as features for clustering the tweets using bisecting k-mean clustering algorithm. This has resulted in purity of 0.704 and entropy of 0.275. The score generated for the quality of the generated topic was 72.5%.

In this article we propose and evaluate a method for computing aggregate thoughts of arguments on individual arguments, which represents individual thoughts, in an argumentation tree and further classifying arguments based on relationships between its aggregate thoughts and individual thoughts. A novel approach is developed to derive collective determination of an argument based on total support and attack that an argument receives in the argumentation tree. The collective determination value and the strength of an argument are used to analyze the relationship between aggregate thought and individual thought of arguments and cluster the arguments. The decision maker will be able to review clusters of arguments with opposing collective thoughts and supporting collective thoughts versus their individual thoughts. We have carried out an experiment to evaluate the proposed method, and the experimental results show that the proposed method is effective.

Texture instances from different classes are sharing regions in the feature hyperspace, which results in ill-defined classification configurations. In this work, we detect rotation-covariant visual concepts using steerable Riesz wavelets and bags of visual words. In a first step, K-means clustering is used to detect visual concepts in the hyperspace of the energies of steerable Riesz wavelets. The coordinates of the clusters are used to construct templates from linear combinations of the Riesz components that are corresponding to visual concepts. The visualization of these templates allows verifying the relevance of the concepts modeled. Then, the local orientations of each template are optimized to maximize their response, which is carried out analytically and can still be expressed as a linear combination of the initial steerable Riesz templates. The texture classes are learned in the feature space composed of the concatenation of the maximum responses of each visual concept using support vector machines. An experimental evaluation using the Outex_TC_00010 test suite allowed a classification accuracy of 97.5%, which demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed approach. An optimal number K = 20 of clusters is required to model the visual concepts, which was found to be fewer than the number of classes. This shows that higher-level classes are sharing low level visual concepts. The importance of rotation-covariant visual concept modeling is highlighted by allowing an absolute gain of more than 30% in accuracy. The visual concepts are modeling the local organization of directions at various scales, which is in accordance with the bottom up visual information processing sequence of the primal sketch in Marr's theory on vision.

We aim at finding suitable configuration for efficiently analyzing large data set in limited amount of time. Our implementation applied Hadoop for large-scale log analysis with data set from KDD'99 competition as test data. With the distributed system framework, we can analyze a whole data set of KDD'99 by first applying our preprocessing. In addition, we use an anomaly detection model for log analysis. A key challenge is to make anomaly detection work more accurately. For the K-means algorithm, a key challenge is to set the appropriate number of the initial cluster (K). Moreover, we discuss whether the number of entries in log files affects the accuracy and detection rate of the system or not. Therefore, our implementation and experimental results describe the appropriate number of cluster and the proper amount of entries in log files. Finally, we show the result of our experiments with accuracy rate and number of initial cluster (K) graph, ROC curve and detection rate and false alarm rate table.

Variance and gradient variance, as main texture feature, are compressed based on PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to get initial classifications of clusters via K-means algorithm in the image frame. The cluster-kernel of each class, the nucleus as we defined, is figured out through shifting the sampling area in each cluster. Based on the nucleus, the policy of cell expansion as we designed is operated to merge different classes into one object which turns the work from feature level into object level. All potential objects and cells of the objects are detected and labeled in the frame. The descriptors of each object are employed as hypothesis for the next frames object-classification. Our results demonstrate that it is possible and fast to recognize multi-objects without and training model or labeled data. The process of learning could be operated with initial clustering and automatic updating with information of the new classification.

An array of isotropic antennas investigates a scenario with cylindrical targets buried in a dielectric soil. The targets are in the near field of the array, and a Sub-Array Processing (SAP) approach is adopted: the array is partitioned into subarrays, and Direction of Arrival (DoA) algorithms are used to process the electromagnetic field received by each subarray and estimate the dominant arrival direction of the signal. By triangulating all the estimated DoAs, a crossing pattern is obtained. It is filtered by a Poisson-based procedure and subsequently elaborated by the k-means clustering method in order to distinguish between targets and background, estimate the number of targets, and find their position. Several simulations have been performed to compare different DoA algorithms and to test the localization method in the presence of two buried cylinders. Different values of the permittivity of the involved dielectric materials have been considered; the target positions and size have also been varied. The proposed procedure can be useful for ground-penetrating radar applications, near-surface probing, and for the detection and localization of defects in a hosting medium.

Although this approach can improve the clustering accuracies, it often gains the unstable clustering results because some random samples are employed for the initial centers. In this paper, an initialization method based on the core clusters is used for the locality sensitive k-means clustering. The core clusters can be formed by constructing the sigma-neighborhood graph and their centers are regarded as the initial centers of the locality sensitive k-means clustering. To investigate the effectiveness of our approach, several experiments are done on three datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method can improve the clustering performance compared to the previous locality sensitive k-means clustering.

Because the kernel technique is used, this approach can appear preferable to the traditional k-means clustering. Clustering ensemble method can combine several divisions of all unlabeled data into a single clustering to gain the better clustering results. In this paper, the clustering ensemble method is applied to the clustering algorithm based one-class support vector machines.

Although the k-harmonic means clustering is insensitive to the initial centers, this initialization method cannot improve clustering performance. In this paper, a novel k-harmonic means clustering based on multiple initial centers is proposed. The number of the initial centers is more than the number of clusters in this new method. The new method with multiple initial centers can divide the whole data set into multiple groups and combine these groups into the final solution. Experiments show that the presented algorithm can increase the better clustering accuracies than the traditional k-means and k-harmonic methods.

Most traditional salient region detectors utilize variable information and ignore spatial information. So we propose a novel salient region detection method based on color-complexity and color-spatial features and create excellent saliency maps. The color-complexity feature is described by histogram in a quantized color space, which can effectively describe the color variation of the pixels in an image. The color-spatial feature is extracted by k-means to represent the pixel color distributions in an image. Our method is tested on a publicly available dataset and experimental results clearly demonstrate that our method integrating these two features obtains higher accuracy and efficiency than some state-of-the-art methods despite its simplicity.

Traditional population structure of the original PSO is adjusted. A particle in MAPSO, being regarded as an agent, represents a candidate route. All agents live in a lattice-like environment, with each agent fixed on a lattice-point. By this means, the speed of information passing among particles is optimized. Moreover, K -means clustering algorithm is introduced to form spatial distinct subpopulations. As a result of all the efforts, an effective way to plan multiple routes is found. Using it, an emulator is designed and some experiments are done. The results prove the feasibility and suitability of the novel method for multiple routes planning issue.

In some real world applications, we face huge amounts of unstructured textual data with no organization. In these situations, clustering is a primitive operation that needs to be done to help future e-commerce tasks. Clustering can be used to enhance different e-commerce applications like recommender systems, customer relationship management systems or personal assistant agents. In this paper we propose a new method for text clustering, by constructing a term correlation graph, and then extracting topic word sets from it and finally, categorizing each document to its related topic with the help of a classification algorithm like SVM. This method provides a natural and understandable description for clusters by their topic word sets, and it also enables us to decide the cluster of documents only when needed and in a parallel fashion, thus significantly reducing the offline processing time. Our clustering method also outperforms the well-known k-means clustering algorithm according to clustering quality measures.

Energy dissipation required by sensor nodes to transmit data depends on the distance between sensor nodes and cluster heads or a base station. Clustering is one of the best techniques for reducing energy consumption and extending sensor network lifetimes. Desirable features of the proposed clustering algorithm include: adaptation to changes in sensor distribution; energy efficiency; localized and distributed data aggregation and decision making; immunity to partial damage; and self-recovery. It employs a smallest disc covering algorithm to achieve a minimum of the maximum distance between a cluster head and sensor nodes compared to k-means clustering. Lawson's multiplicative rule is used for the smallest disc covering algorithm. Our simulation demonstrates that the proposed algorithm takes 50.8% fewer iterations to converge for cluster formation, with 33.9% and 23.2% shorter maximum and average intra-cluster distances versus k-means clustering. Performance is also improved.

The proposed methodology is a combination of data mining tools for market segmentation and MADM tools for evaluation and selection of the best market. More precisely, clustering is used to divide a whole market into different segments. Two MADM tools including, step-wise weight assessment ratio Analysis (SWARA) and complex proportional assessment of alternatives with grey relations (COPRAS-G), were applied for market segment evaluation and selection. The most desirable features influencing the choice of a market segment evaluation and selection are identified based on literature study. Grey relation analysis allows incorporating the vague and imprecise information in to the decision model. A real-world data on a laptop market is put forward to illustrate the performance of the proposed methodology. The proposed model could help companies to segment, evaluate and select the best market.

There are two typical data mining processes that support to reduce the energy consumption of WSNs is clustering and data summarization. Several energy aware, communication aware, coverage aware, data dissemination and data aggregation/sensor fusion protocols and algorithms have been specifically designed for WSN to reduce the power consumption. One of the primary goals of Node clustering in WSN is in-network preprocessing that aims to obtain qualified information and to limit the energy consumed. A clustering algorithm is composed of three parts first electing cluster head (CH), selection of cluster membership and transferal data from members to CH.CH relays only one of the aggregated or compressed data packet to base station or sink In this paper a brief comparative study is made from different research proposals, which suggests different cluster head selection approaches for data aggregation. The algorithms under study are Data relay K-means clustering algorithm, Fuzzy C- means clustering algorithms and Voronoi based Genetic clustering algorithm. Significant factors for evaluating and comparing these algorithms are defined, analyzed and summarized. It has been assumed that the sensor nodes are randomly distributed and are not mobile, the coordinates of the base station (BS) and the dimensions of the sensor field are known.

The purpose of this paper is to develop a system that applies data mining techniques to study air quality distribution of Chennai, a metro city in India using vehicular networking and map the distribution to geographic locations for effective policy making. Three different hybrid clustering methods are analyzed for grouping sites into non-overlapping, contiguous and homogeneous regions. This paper also validates homogeneity of the regions formed and suggests future lines of research for improving these methods.

However, these environments require accurate representation of knowledge about learner to provide suitable guidance. Based on the behavior and performance, the traces of learners are captured and categorized to provide appropriate guidance in the learning environment. The learner networks in E-Learning environment are normally of prodigious, and it is quite difficult to give guidance to each. Thus learners are clustered using traces. When the number of users in the environment increases, scalability comes into an issue. The issue has been solved as organizing the data instances in a way, so that unsupervised clustering algorithm will able to create dusters for 'n' number of learners. The edges rather than nodes have been taken as data instances. The proposed ECC (Edge centric clustering), treats each edge as one data instance and the connected nodes are the corresponding features. The variance of K-means is applied over the extracted edges, to partition the edges into disjoint sets. This paper contributes to achieve scalable clustering using sparse dimensions. The proposed algorithm has been implemented for the data gathered from VPL integrated with Moodle in Java using Eclipse IDE. The result shows that the proposed approach can efficiently handle huge network while compared to K-means.

Basically, the main role of image segmentation is to cluster pixels into prominent image regions i.e. the regions which are corresponding to individual surfaces, objects or natural parts of the objects. The moment is an invariant feature which has been used for object recognition as a descriptor. Additionally, color map can also be used for clustering pixels in corresponding region. In this paper color map is used as a feature for clustering purpose. Color map is obtained by finding out labels in an image. For each possible window representation of each pixel in an image, statistical moment values are computed. Now feature vector of each pixel is then classified using k-means clustering method. Quantitative analysis is done to show the accuracy of the used feature vector i.e. moments and color-map.

This paper presents an unsupervised learning based Neural Network technique for the classification of the magnetic resonance human brain images. Brain tumour diagnosis requires a detailed histological analysis, which involves invasive surgery that can be painful and can cause discomfort to patients. In this paper, the brain tumour diagnostic procedure is divided into the following phases. The first phase comprises of image pre-processing which includes histogram equalization, edge detection, noise iltering, thresholding etc. In second phase, the features of the MR brain image are extracted using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). In third phase, brain tumour diagnosis is performed using Self Organized Map (SOM). Finally, a K-means clustering algorithm is applied to segment the brain into different tissue. Classification results on a variety of MR images for different pathologies indicate this technique to be promising.

An Efficient Dictionary Learning Algorithm For 3d Medical Image Denoising Based On Sadct	2013 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION COMMUNICATION AND EMBEDDED SYSTEMS (ICICES)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Information Communication and Embedded Systems (ICICES)	FEB 21-22, 2013	Chennai, INDIA			Dictionary learning; k-means clustering; multiple-selection strategy; sparse representation; 3-D medical image denoising	SPARSE REPRESENTATION	Signal denoising is the process of removing noise signals from a noisy image. But still, it remains as an important issue for the biomedical engineering. Due to the highly controlled imaging environment, the imaging process often creates noise, which seriously affects the analysis of the medical image. To solve the issues of the denoising in biomedical engineering efficient learning algorithms are used, for sparse representations of the data. Sparse representations are representations that account for most or all information of a signal with linear combination of small number elementary signals. At present algorithm such as Dictionary learning algorithm is exploited for spare representation of the data and this algorithm can be applied to 3 D Medical Image Denoising. The learning approach is involves two main parts: sparse coding and dictionary updating. Denoising of 3-D medical image that involves large number of slices is to denoise each single slice using separately learned dictionaries. In 3-D medical image denoising fixed square patches are applied into denoising method. This leads to computational complexity and also no good approximation of image can be constructed. So instead of adopting the fixed square patches, shape-adaptive patches can be applied as in the SA-DCT into the denoising method. Furthermore SA-DCT algorithm is proposed for image filtering. Such adaptation strategy enables accurate preservation and reconstruction of image details and structures and yields estimates with a very good visual quality.

AN EFFICIENT APPROACH TO PREDICT TUMOR IN 2D BRAIN IMAGE USING CLASSIFICATION TECHNIQUES	2013 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION COMMUNICATION AND EMBEDDED SYSTEMS (ICICES)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Information Communication and Embedded Systems (ICICES)	FEB 21-22, 2013	Chennai, INDIA					The Brain is one of the most important organs in human body. The brain controls everything : sight, hearing, taste, touch, emotions etc. In medical field, brain plays an important role in every aspect. In the last decade one of the dangerous diseases is brain tumour and also prediction of tumour in brain is very difficult process. This proposed system explains how to find the brain tumour in patient's body using some data mining techniques such as segmentation and classification. Images are considered as one of the most important medium of conveying information. Understanding images and extracting the information from them such that the information can be used for other tasks is an important aspect of Machine learning. One of the first steps in direction of understanding images is to segment them and find out different objects in them. For segmentation we are using K-means clustering algorithm. In the second step we perform classification of MRI brain image using decision tree and SVM classification algorithms and predict which is better classification technique and extract tumour parts in brain. The proposed technique is used to find diseased brain image of patient to match with the database tumour image.	[Deepak, K.

Detection and tracking of gas plumes in LWIR hyperspectral video sequence data	ALGORITHMS AND TECHNOLOGIES FOR MULTISPECTRAL, HYPERSPECTRAL, AND ULTRASPECTRAL IMAGERY XIX	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Algorithms and Technologies for Multispectral, Hyperspectral, and Ultraspectral Imagery XIX	APR 29-MAY 02, 2013	Baltimore, MD	SPIE		Hyperspectral; data analysis; midway equalization; Ginzburg-Landau; MBO; image processing; video processing		Automated detection of chemical plumes presents a segmentation challenge. The segmentation problem for gas plumes is difficult due to the diffusive nature of the cloud. The advantage of considering hyperspectral images in the gas plume detection problem over the conventional RGB imagery is the presence of non-visual data, allowing for a richer representation of information. In this paper we present an effective method of visualizing hyperspectral video sequences containing chemical plumes and investigate the effectiveness of segmentation techniques on these post-processed videos. Our approach uses a combination of dimension reduction and histogram equalization to prepare the hyperspectral videos for segmentation. First, Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimension of the entire video sequence. This is done by projecting each pixel onto the first few Principal Components resulting in a type of spectral filter. Next, a Midway method for histogram equalization is used. These methods redistribute the intensity values in order to reduce flicker between frames. This properly prepares these high-dimensional video sequences for more traditional segmentation techniques. We compare the ability of various clustering techniques to properly segment the chemical plume. These include K-means, spectral clustering, and the Ginzburg-Landau functional.

J	Macharia, J; Collins, R; Sun, T				Macharia, John; Collins, Ray; Sun, Tim			Value-based consumer segmentation: the key to sustainable agri-food chains	BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL			English	Article						Consumer behaviour; Segmentation; Supply chain; Developing countries; Supply chain management; Food industry; Kenya	DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; SUPPLY CHAIN; URBAN; MANAGEMENT; QUALITY; POLICY; HORTICULTURE; SUPERMARKETS; VEGETABLES; INSIGHTS	Purpose The final consumer has the exclusive right to define what constitutes value in a product or service. Under increasing pressures of globalization and urbanization, a consumer-focused approach to performance improvement in supply chains can lead to more satisfied consumers and improved returns to growers and retailers. This paper aims to demonstrate that such an orientation, though lacking in agri-food supply chains in developing countries, can mitigate threats to food safety, consumer health and environmental quality. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through random survey intercepts (n = 418) at different retail outlets for fresh vegetables in Nairobi, Kenya in 2010. Multi-step cluster analysis (Ward Method, K-means) was used to classify fresh vegetable consumers, in terms of their product, production and marketing process preferences. Findings Four heterogeneous segments in terms of value preferences, behaviour and personal profiles (p < 0.05) were derived. They were labelled Prestigious Shoppers (25 per cent), Market Enthusiasts (18 per cent), Ethics Crusaders (41 per cent) and Safety Sceptics (16 per cent). All segments expressed high or moderate preferences for product quality. In addition, the Prestigious Shoppers expressed a moderate preference for customer service. Market Enthusiasts attached the highest values to market conditions and customer service. Ethics Crusaders most highly preferred customer service, while Safety Sceptics most highly preferred safe production. Research limitations/implications Since it is difficult to predict consumer behaviour precisely, these findings may be contextual. Yet, the segments have unique value preferences despite actors treating them as homogeneous. Ignoring these differences can lead to unsustainable attempts to improve chain practice and policies. Originality/value This paper is the first of its kind. It advocates for use of universal value profiles as a basis for development of consumer-focused strategies for sustainable performance improvement in agri-food chains in developing countries.

Diagnosis is currently based on visual inspection, biopsies and collection of samples from the wound surface. This is often time consuming, expensive and to some extent subjective procedures. Hyperspectral imaging has been shown to be a promising modality for optical diagnostics. The main objective of this study was to identify a suitable technique for reproducible classification of hyperspectral data from a wound and the surrounding tissue. Two statistical classification methods have been tested and compared to the performance of a dermatologist. Hyperspectral images (400-1000 nm) were collected from patients with venous leg ulcers using a pushbroom-scanning camera (VNIR 1600, Norsk Elektro Optikk AS). Wounds were examined regularly over 4 - 6 weeks. The patients were evaluated by a dermatologist at every appointment. One patient has been selected for presentation in this paper (female, age 53 years). The oxygen saturation of the wound area was determined by wavelength ratio metrics. Spectral angle mapping (SAM) and k-means clustering were used for classification. Automatic extraction of endmember spectra was employed to minimize human interaction. A comparison of the methods shows that k-means clustering is the most stable method over time, and shows the best overlap with the dermatologist's assessment of the wound border. The results are assumed to be affected by the data preprocessing and chosen endmember extraction algorithm. Results indicate that it is possible to develop an automated method for reliable classification of wounds based on hyperspectral data.

The recent generation of thermal cameras provides a sensitivity of less than mK. This high sensitivity in conjunction with non-invasive, label-free and radiation-free monitoring makes thermography a promising tool for intrasurgical diagnostics. In brain surgery, time-resolved thermography can be employed to distinguish between normal and anomalous tissue. In this study, we investigated and discussed the potential of time-resolved thermography in neurosurgery for the intraoperative detection and demarcation of tumor borders. Algorithms for segmentation, reduction of movement artifacts and image fusion were developed. The preprocessed image stacks were subjected to discrete wavelet transform to examine individual frequency components. K-means clustering was used for image evaluation to reveal similarities within the image sequence. The image evaluation shows significant differences for both types of tissue. Tumor and normal tissues have different time characteristics in heat production and transfer. Furthermore, tumor could be highlighted. These results demonstrate that time-resolved thermography is able to support the detection of tumors in a contactless manner without any side effects for the tissue. The intraoperative usage of time-resolved thermography improves the accuracy of tumor resections to prevent irreversible brain damage during surgery.

Many real life applications require to find overlapping clusters in order to fit the data set structures such as clustering of films where each film can have different genres. This paper presents an overlapping k-means method refereed as Restricted-OKM (Restricted Overlapping k-means) that generalizes the well known k-means algorithm to detect overlapping clusters. The proposed method produces restricted overlapping boundaries between clusters and improves clustering accuracy to make the method adapted for clustering data with small overlaps. The proposed method is extended to control sizes of overlaps between clusters with respect to user expectations. Experiments, performed on overlapping data sets, show that proposed methods outperform OKM (Overlapping k-means) and fuzzy c-means in terms of clustering accuracy and produce clusters with small overlapping boundaries.

There is number of matrices defined that uses the software faults to estimate the software quality. When we have a large software system with thousands of class modules, then it is not easy to apply the software matrices on each module of software system. The present work is the solution of the defined problem. This paper aims at comparing different models based on clustering techniques: k-means (KM), fuzzy c-means (FCM) and hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) for building software quality estimation system. We propose quality measure of partition clustering technique (KM, FCM) in order to evaluate the results and we comparatively analyze the obtained results on two case studies. This paper focuses on clustering with very large datasets and very many attributes of different types.

It is a major issue to retrieve good websites from the larger collections of websites. As the number of available Web pages grows, it is become more difficult for users finding documents relevant to their interests. Clustering is the classification of a data set into subsets (clusters), so that the data in each subset share some common trait - often proximity according to some defined distance measure. By clustering we improve the quality of websites by grouping similar websites in groups. This paper addresses the applications of data mining tool Weka by applying k means clustering to find clusters from huge data sets and find the attributes that govern optimization of search engines.

A self-organising map (SOM) and the k-means algorithm were used, partitioning the input data into nine clusters. The resulting clusters were then analysed using Gene Ontology (GO) data, obtaining results that suggest that SOM clusters could be more homogeneous than those obtained by the k-means technique.

Diagnosis, care and treatment of pressure ulcers can result in extremely expensive costs for health systems. A reliable diagnosis supported by precise wound evaluation is crucial in order to success on the treatment decision and, in some cases, to save the patient's life. However, current evaluation procedures, focused mainly on visual inspection, do not seem to be accurate enough to accomplish this important task. This paper presents a computer-vision approach based on image processing algorithms and supervised learning techniques to help detecting and classifying wound tissue types which play an important role in wound diagnosis. The system proposed involves the use of the k-means clustering algorithm for image segmentation and a standard multilayer perceptron neural network to classify effectively each segmented region as the appropriate tissue type. Results obtained show a high performance rate which enables to support ulcer diagnosis by a reliable computational system.

Gabor filters produce outputs which are notably distinct for the different textured regions. Detecting the discontinuity in the filters output and their statistical properties help in segmenting and classifying a given image with different texture regions. Feature calculation for every pixel in the image reduces the computational cost for color based segmentation. In this proposed method, firstly image texture segmentation is performed by using Gabor filter and the result obtained from Gabor filter differentiates the textures with a variety of colors as different textures, and these similar colors are extracted as different images by color-based segmentation with K-means clustering and finally the features are extracted by using first and second order statistical methods. The features extracted from first and second order statistical methods are given to PNN classifier. Using this methodology, it is found that texture and color segmentation followed by gray level co-occurrence matrix feature extraction method gives higher accuracy rate of 95.5% when compared with other feature extraction methods.

J	Tao, CB; Liu, GD				Tao, Chongben; Liu, Guodong			A Multilayer Hidden Markov Models-Based Method for Human-Robot Interaction	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							ACTIVITY RECOGNITION; SENSOR; HOME	To achieve Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) by using gestures, a continuous gesture recognition approach based on Multilayer Hidden Markov Models (MHMMs) is proposed, which consists of two parts. One part is gesture spotting and segment module, the other part is continuous gesture recognition module. Firstly, a Kinect sensor is used to capture 3D acceleration and 3D angular velocity data of hand gestures. And then, a Feed-forward Neural Networks (FNNs) and a threshold criterion are used for gesture spotting and segment, respectively. Afterwards, the segmented gesture signals are respectively preprocessed and vector symbolized by a sliding window and a K-means clustering method. Finally, symbolized data are sent into Lower Hidden Markov Models (LHMMs) to identify individual gestures, and then, a Bayesian filter with sequential constraints among gestures in Upper Hidden Markov Models (UHMMs) is used to correct recognition errors created in LHMMs. Five predefined gestures are used to interact with a Kinect mobile robot in experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed method not only has good effectiveness and accuracy, but also has favorable real-time performance.

The orientation of myofibers decides the effects of the stress distribution and the whole heart deformation. It is important to image and quantitatively extract these orientations for understanding the cardiac physiological and pathological mechanism and for diagnosis of chronic diseases. Ultrasound has been wildly used in cardiac diagnosis because of its ability of performing dynamic and noninvasive imaging and because of its low cost. An extraction method is proposed to automatically detect the cardiac myofiber orientations from high frequency ultrasound images. First, heart walls containing myofibers are imaged by B-mode high frequency (>20 MHz) ultrasound imaging. Second, myofiber orientations are extracted from ultrasound images using the proposed method that combines a nonlinear anisotropic diffusion filter, Canny edge detector, Hough transform, and K-means clustering. This method is validated by the results of ultrasound data from phantoms and pig hearts.

It is very important to treasure this great wealth by maintaining complete details of all types of plant which will help in understanding the aspect of their survival. A leaf plays an important role in the identification of plant. Edge details of a leaf are detected using edge detection algorithms and can be stored in the form of feature vectors. Hence to improve the effectiveness of identification of leaf, we are hereby proposing to generate Clustered Database. This paper introduces an approach of Clustering based on Eccentricity. For clustering database, K-means algorithm is used. Experimental results show the effectiveness of forming clusters by calculating entropy and purity. From experimental results, it was found that the proposed approach of clustering is quite effective and would enhance the retrieval efficiency.

In K Clustering, we know the number of clusters or K. In other category of clustering, K in unknown. In this paper we have considered the first category only. We can broadly classify features within a data set into continuous and categorical. Here we have considered data set with continuous features only. Clustering can be done by all features or by relevant features only. Researches had commonly used some feature selection techniques to select relevant features for clustering and then did clustering by some clustering algorithm. Here we have used Multi Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) for simultaneous feature selection and clustering. Here, K-means is hybridized with GA. We have used hybridized GA to combine global searching abilities of GA with local searching abilities of K-means. Considering context sensitivity, we have used a special crossover operator called "pairwise crossover" and "substitution". Elimination of redundant, irrelevant features increases clustering performance, reflected in MOGA_Feature_Selection (H, S) compared with MOGA (H, S). The main contribution of this paper is simultaneous dimensionality reduction and optimization of objectives using MOGA.

We investigated using distance measures other than Euclidean type for improving the performance of clustering. We also developed an improved point symmetry-based distance measure and proved its efficiency. We developed a k-means algorithm with a novel distance measure that improves the performance of the classical k-means algorithm. The proposed algorithm does not have the worst-case bound on running time that exists in many similar algorithms in the literature. Experimental results shown in this paper demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. We compared the proposed algorithm with the classical k-means algorithm. We presented the proposed algorithm and their performance results in detail along with avenues of future research.

Many attempts have been put into practice to increase the conventional fuzzy c-means (FCM) performance. In this paper, the sensitivity of the soft membership function of the FCM algorithm to the outlier is considered and the new exponent operator on the Euclidean distance is implemented in the membership function to improve the outlier rejection characteristics of the FCM. The comparative quantitative and qualitative studies are performed among the conventional k-means (KM), moving KM, and FCM algorithms; the latest state-of-the-art clustering algorithms, namely the adaptive fuzzy moving KM, adaptive fuzzy KM, and new weighted FCM algorithms; and the proposed outlier rejection FCM (ORFCM) algorithm. It is revealed from the experimental results that the ORFCM algorithm outperforms the other clustering algorithms in various evaluation functions.

However earlier work on clustering focused on only categorical data which is based on attribute values for grouping similar kind of data items thus will leads to convergence problem of clustering process. This proposed work is to enhance the existing k-means clustering process based on the categorical and mixed data types in efficient manner. The goal is to use integrated clustering approach based on high dimensional categorical data that works well for data with mixed continuous and categorical features. The experimental results of the proposed method on several data sets are suggest that the link based cluster ensemble algorithm integrate with proposed k-means algorithm to produce accurate clustering results. In this proposed algorithm prove the convergence property of clustering process, thus will improve the accuracy of clustering results. The scope of this proposed work is used to provide the accurate and efficient results, whenever the user wants to access the data from the database.	[Kalaivani, K.; Raghavendra, A. P.

It has been widely used in data mining, image processing, machine learning, bioinformatics, marketing and other fields. Clustering discern the objects into groups called clusters, based on certain criteria. The similarity of objects is high within the clusters, but low between the clusters. In this work, we investigate a hybridization of the gravitational search algorithm (GSA) and big bang-big crunch algorithm (BB-BC) on data clustering. In the proposed approach, namely GSA-BB, GSA is used to explore the search space for finding the optimal locations of the clusters centroids. Whenever GSA loses its exploration, BB-BC algorithm is used to diversify the population. The performance of the proposed method is compared with GSA, BB-BC and K-means algorithms using six standard and real datasets taken from the UCI machine learning repository. Experimental results indicate that there is significant improvement in the quality of the clusters obtained by the proposed hybrid method over the non-hybrid methods.

Automatic Extraction of Forests from Historical Maps Based on Unsupervised Classification in the CIELab Color Space	GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SCIENCE AT THE HEART OF EUROPE	Lecture Notes in Geoinformation and Cartography		English	Proceedings Paper	16th AGILE Conference on Geographic Information Science	MAY 14-17, 2013	Leuven, BELGIUM	AGILE, ESRI, Intergraph, Geosparc, Natl Geograph Inst, Arenberg Doctoral Sch, Google			TOPOGRAPHIC MAPS; THEMATIC MAPS; GIS; SEGMENTATION; COVER	In this chapter, we describe an automatic procedure to capture features on old maps. Early maps contain specific informations which allow us to reconstruct trajectories over time and space for land use/cover studies or urban area development. The most commonly used approach to extract these elements requires a user intervention for digitizing which widely limits its utilization. Therefore, it is essential to propose automatic methods in order to establish reproducible procedures. Capturing features automatically on scanned paper maps is a major challenge in GIS for many reasons: (1) many planimetric elements can be overlapped, (2) scanning procedure may conduct to a poor image quality, (3) lack of colors complicates the distinction of the elements. Based on a state of art, we propose a method based on color image segmentation and unsupervised classification (K-means algorithm) to extract forest features on the historical 'Map of France'. The first part of the procedure conducts to clean maps and eliminate elevation contour lines with filtering techniques. Then, we perform a color space conversion from RGB to L*a*b color space to improve uniformity of the image. To finish, a post processing step based on morphological operators and contextual rules is applied to clean-up features. Results show a high global accuracy of the proposed scheme for different excerpt of this historical map.

Future work deals with meta-clustering, an improved way to group objects using the aggregation of the results of minimum three number of clustering techniques.

J	Nilsen, G; Borgan, O; Liestol, K; Lingjaerde, OC				Nilsen, Gro; Borgan, Ornulf; Liestol, Knut; Lingjaerde, Ole Christian			Identifying clusters in genomics data by recursive partitioning	STATISTICAL APPLICATIONS IN GENETICS AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						cluster analysis; gene expression; genomics; recursion; subclusters	DATA SET; NUMBER; VALIDATION; TUMORS	Genomics studies frequently involve clustering of molecular data to identify groups, but common clustering methods such as K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering do not determine the number of clusters. Methods for estimating the number of clusters typically focus on identifying the global structure in the data, however the discovery of substructures within clusters may also be of great biological interest. We propose a novel method, Partitioning Algorithm based on Recursive Thresholding (PART), that recursively uncovers distinct subgroups in the groups already identified. Outliers are common in high-dimensional genomics data and may mask the presence of substructure within a cluster. A crucial feature of the algorithm is the introduction of tentative splits of clusters to isolate outliers that might otherwise halt the recursion prematurely. The method is demonstrated on simulated as well as a wide range of real data sets from gene expression microarrays, where the correct clusters were known in advance. When subclusters are present and the variance is large or varies between the clusters, the proposed method performs better than two established global methods on simulated data. On the real data sets the overall performance of PART is superior to the global methods when used in combination with hierarchical clustering. The method is implemented in the R package clusterGenomics and is freely available from CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network).

A Computationally Efficient and Adaptive Approach for Online Embedded Machinery Diagnosis in Harsh Environments	ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; CONDITION-BASED MAINTENANCE; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; ROTATING MACHINERY; VIBRATION DATA; MODEL; TRANSFORM; SCHEME	Condition-based monitoring (CBM) has advanced to the stage where industry is now demanding machinery that possesses self-diagnosis ability. This need has spurred the CBM research to be applicable in more expanded areas over the past decades. There are two critical issues in implementing CBM in harsh environments using embedded systems: computational efficiency and adaptability. In this paper, a computationally efficient and adaptive approach including simple principal component analysis (SPCA) for feature dimensionality reduction and K-means clustering for classification is proposed for online embedded machinery diagnosis. Compared with the standard principal component analysis (PCA) and kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), SPCA is adaptive in nature and has lower algorithm complexity when dealing with a large amount of data. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is firstly validated using a standard rolling element bearing test dataset on a personal computer. It is then deployed on an embedded real-time controller and used to monitor a rotating shaft. It was found that the proposed approach scaled well, whereas the standard PCA-based approach broke down when data quantity increased to a certain level. Furthermore, the proposed approach achieved 90% accuracy when diagnosing an induced fault compared to 59% accuracy obtained using the standard PCA-based approach.

Data-based modelling and environmental sensitivity of vegetation in China	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							TERRESTRIAL CARBON-CYCLE; SPECIES GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS; WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; GLOBAL VEGETATION; CO2; FUTURE; NICHE; FORESTS; MAXIMUM	A process-oriented niche specification (PONS) model was constructed to quantify climatic controls on the distribution of ecosystems, based on the vegetation map of China. PONS uses general hypotheses about bioclimatic controls to provide a "bridge" between statistical niche models and more complex process-based models. Canonical correspondence analysis provided an overview of relationships between the abundances of 55 plant communities in 0.1 degrees grid cells and associated mean values of 20 predictor variables. Of these, GDD(0) (accumulated degree days above 0 degrees C), Cramer-Prentice alpha (an estimate of the ratio of actual to equilibrium evapotranspiration) and mGDD(5) (mean temperature during the period above 5 degrees C) showed the greatest predictive power. These three variables were used to develop generalized linear models for the probability of occurrence of 16 vegetation classes, aggregated from the original 55 types by k-means clustering according to bioclimatic similarity. Each class was hypothesized to possess a unimodal relationship to each bioclimate variable, independently of the other variables. A simple calibration was used to generate vegetation maps from the predicted probabilities of the classes. Modelled and observed vegetation maps showed good to excellent agreement (kappa = 0.745). A sensitivity study examined modelled responses of vegetation distribution to spatially uniform changes in temperature, precipitation and [CO2], the latter included via an offset to alpha (based on an independent, data-based light use efficiency model for forest net primary production). Warming shifted the boundaries of most vegetation classes northward and westward while temperate steppe and desert replaced alpine tundra and steppe in the southeast of the Tibetan Plateau. Increased precipitation expanded mesic vegetation at the expense of xeric vegetation. The effect of [CO2] doubling was roughly equivalent to increasing precipitation by similar to 30 %, favouring woody vegetation types, particularly in northern China. Agricultural zones in northern China responded most strongly to warming, but also benefited from increases in precipitation and [CO2]. These results broadly conform to previously published findings made with the process-based model BIOME4, but they add regional detail and realism and extend the earlier results to include cropping systems. They provide a potential basis for a broad-scale assessment of global change impacts on natural and managed ecosystems.	[Wang, H.; Prentice, I.

First, according to the traditional GrowCut method, a pretreatment process using K-means algorithm is conducted to reduce the running time. Then, the segmentation result of our improved GrowCut approach is used as an initial contour for the future precise segmentation based on Snakes model. At last, several experiments are carried out to demonstrate the performance of our proposed approach and some comparisons are conducted between the traditional GrowCut algorithm. Experimental results show that the improved approach not only has a better robustness and precision but also is more efficient than the traditional GrowCut method.

However, this classic approach may be ineffective for analysing morphologically indistinguishable tumour subtypes. As such, microarray technology emerges as the promising alternative. Despite a large number of microarray studies, the actual clinical application of gene expression data analysis remains limited owing to the complexity of generated data and the noise level. Recently, the integrative cluster analysis of both clinical and gene expression data has been shown to be an effective alternative to overcome the above-mentioned problems. This paper presents a novel method for using cluster ensembles that is accurate for analysing heterogeneous biological data. Evaluation against real biological and benchmark data sets suggests that the quality of the proposed model is higher than many state-of-the-art cluster ensemble techniques and standard clustering algorithms.

J	Borner, V; Johnston, DJ; Graser, HU				Boerner, Vinzent; Johnston, David J.; Graser, Hans-Ulrich			Genetic relationships between live animal scan traits and carcass traits of Australian Angus bulls and heifers	ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE			English	Article						age; beef cattle; carcass; genetic parameter; ultrasound live-scan	MEAT QUALITY TRAITS; ADAPTED BEEF BREEDS; PHENOTYPIC CHARACTERIZATION; CATTLE; ULTRASOUND; PARAMETERS; TEMPERATE; MODELS	Genetic parameters of four ultrasound live-scan traits and five carcass traits of Australian Angus cattle were examined with regard to sex and age of the scanned individuals. Live-scans were subdivided according to whether the observation was obtained from a bull or a heifer. In addition, two age subset ('young' and 'old') within sex were formed by k-means clustering around two centres within sex according to the age at scanning. REML estimates for heritabilities, genetic, residual and phenotypic correlations for each trait and trait combination were derived from a series of uni-, bi- and tri-variate analysis. Statistically significant age effects could be found for heritablities of scan intra-muscular fat content in heifers and scan fat depth at P8 site and scan rib fat depth in bulls, and for genetic correlations between the scan traits fat depth at P8 site, rib fat depth and eye muscle area. However, differences in heritablities between age sets within sex did not exceed 0.05, and genetic correlations between scan traits of 'young' and 'old' animals were at least 0.9. Differences between genetic correlations of abattoir carcass traits and 'young' and 'old' live-scan traits, respectively, were not significant due to high standard errors but up to 0.44. The larger of these differences were found for combinations of scan-traits and non-target carcass traits and not for combination of scan-traits and their actual carcass target traits. Thus, although some results suggest an age effect on the genetic parameters of scan traits, the extent of this effect is of limited impact on breeding value accuracy and genetic gain of scan traits. Furthermore, a possible age effect on correlations to economically important carcass traits need to be underpinned by more carcass traits observations in order to get unambiguous results allowing to draw consequences of scanning younger individuals for accuracy of breeding values and genetic gain in carcass traits.

However, several issues remain, including the large scale of benchmark datasets, serious imbalance of data, and discovery of new gene families. In this paper, we employ the machine learning approach based on a novel ensemble classifier to predict cytokines. We directly selected amino acids sequences as research objects. First, we pretreated the benchmark data accurately. Next, we analyzed the physicochemical properties and distribution of whole amino acids and then extracted a group of 120-dimensional (120D) valid features to represent sequences. Third, in the view of the serious imbalance in benchmark datasets, we utilized a sampling approach based on the synthetic minority oversampling technique algorithm and K-means clustering undersampling algorithm to rebuild the training set. Finally, we built a library for dynamic selection and circulating combination based on clustering (LibD3C) and employed the new training set to realize cytokine classification. Experiments showed that the geometric mean of sensitivity and specificity obtained through our approach is as high as 93.3%, which proves that our approach is effective for identifying cytokines.

Evaluating fusion techniques for multi-sensor satellite image data	GEOSPATIAL INFOFUSION III	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Geospatial InfoFusion III	MAY 02-03, 2013	Baltimore, MD	SPIE		Image fusion; synthetic aperture radar; Brovey; IHS; PCA; K-means		Satellite image data fusion is a topic of interest in many areas including environmental monitoring, emergency response, and defense. Typically any single satellite sensor cannot provide all of the benefits offered by a combination of different sensors (e.g., high-spatial but low spectral resolution vs. low-spatial but high spectral, optical vs. SAR). Given the respective strengths and weaknesses of the different types of image data, it is beneficial to fuse many types of image data to extract as much information as possible from the data. Our work focuses on the fusion of multi-sensor image data into a unified representation that incorporates the potential strengths of a sensor in order to minimize classification error. Of particular interest is the fusion of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images into a single, multispectral image of the best possible spatial resolution. We explore various methods to optimally fuse these images and evaluate the quality of the image fusion by using K-means clustering to categorize regions in the fused images and comparing the accuracies of the resulting categorization maps.

G.; Lee, Neil Chueh-An			Using power regimes to explore perceived environmental uncertainty	INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS			English	Article						Supply chain management; Environmental uncertainty; Power regimes; Strategic planning; Cluster analysis	SUPPLY CHAINS; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; INDUSTRY; CONSTRUCTS; DEPENDENCE; ALLIANCES; CHANNELS; COSTS; NORMS	Purpose - This paper aims to explore and gain a better understanding of the relationship between power circumstances and the environmental uncertainty perceived by managers. Design/methodology/approach - This paper conducted a survey of 1,000 manufacturing firms selected randomly from the Top 5000 largest firms in Taiwan. The responding firms were clustered by K-means into four groups of power circumstances. The paper then applied MANOVA and ANOVA to test the differences among the three types of supply chain uncertainty across the four groups. Findings - The results show that power circumstances are associated with managers' perceptions of environmental uncertainty in terms of demand, technology, and supply. This paper finds that managers of buying firms in dominant positions perceive a lower demand uncertainty while managers facing higher supplier power perceive greater uncertainty in technology. For buying firms under ambiguous power circumstances, their managers tend to perceive higher supply uncertainty. The paper then put forth six power-based propositions on the basis of their results. Research limitations/implications - Given that the data are from large-sized firms, the generalizability of their findings to smaller firms may be limited. Practical implications - When developing strategies to tackle environmental uncertainties, managers should consider their firm's power circumstances because these tend to influence the managers' interpretation and decisions and thereby their subsequent strategies. Originality/value - Although environmental uncertainty has been addressed extensively in various management fields, how the environmental uncertainty perceived by a firm's managers is related to the power the firm holds has never been empirically examined. This study clarifies this issue.	[Wang, Eric T.

The coastal region detection is critical to home land security and ship defense. Detected coastal region information can be used to the design of target detector such as moving target detection and threshold setting. We can detect coastal regions robustly by combining the infrared image segmentation and sensor line-of-sight (LOS) information. The K-means-based image segmentation can provide initial region information and the sensor LOS information can predict the approximate horizon location in images. The evidence of coastal region is confirmed by contour extraction results. The experimental results on remote coasts and near coasts validate the robustness of the proposed coastal region detector.

In this paper, we aim to quantify the performance gains of dynamic parallelism. The newest version of CUDA, CUDA 5, introduces dynamic parallelism, which allows GPU threads to create new threads, without CPU intervention, and adapt to its data. This effectively eliminates the superfluous back and forth communication between the GPU and CPU through nested kernel computations. The change in performance will be measured using two well-known clustering algorithms that exhibit data dependencies: the K-means clustering and the hierarchical clustering. K-means has a sequential data dependence wherein iterations occur in a linear fashion, while the hierarchical clustering has a tree-like dependence that produces split tasks. Analyzing the performance of these data-dependent algorithms gives us a better understanding of the benefits or potential drawbacks of CUDA 5's new dynamic parallelism feature.

In this paper, according to color crops image characteristics, we firstly transform the color space of image from RGB to HIS, and then select proper initial clustering center and cluster number in application of mean-variance approach and rough set theory followed by clustering calculation in such a way as to automatically segment color component rapidly and extract target objects from background accurately, which provides a reliable basis for identification, analysis, follow-up calculation and process of crops images. Experimental results demonstrate that improved k-means clustering algorithm is able to reduce the computation amounts and enhance precision and accuracy of clustering.

This paper proposes a gait recognition method based on Continuous Hidden Markov Model with Mixture of Gaussians(G-CHMM). First, we initialize a Gaussian mix model for training image sequence with K-means algorithm, then train the HMM parameters using a Baum-Welch algorithm. These gait feature sequences can be trained and obtain a Continuous HMM for every person, therefore, the 7 key frames and the obtained HMM can represent each person's gait sequence. Finally, the recognition is achieved by Front algorithm. The experiments made on CASIA gait databases obtain comparatively high correction identification ratio and comparatively strong robustness for variety of bodily angle.

In a wooded GPS-denied environment, it is difficult to identify the location of unmanned ground vehicles and it is also difficult to properly recognize the environment in which these vehicles move. In this study, using the point cloud data obtained via 3D LADAR, a method to extract the features of humans, trees, and other objects within an environment was implemented and verified through the processes of segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. First, for the segmentation, the radially bounded nearest neighbor method was applied. Second, for the feature extraction, each segmented object was divided into three parts, and then their geometrical and statistical features were extracted. A human was divided into three parts: the head, trunk and legs. A tree was also divided into three parts: the top, middle, and bottom. The geometric features were the variance of the x-y data for the center of each part in an object, using the distance between the two central points for each part, using K-mean clustering. The statistical features were the variance of each of the parts. In this study, three, six and six features of data were extracted, respectively, resulting in a total of 15 features. Finally, after training the extracted data via an artificial network, new data were classified. This study showed the results of an experiment that applied an algorithm proposed with a vehicle equipped with 3D LADAR in a thickly forested area, which is a GPS-denied environment. A total of 5,158 segments were obtained and the classification rates for human and trees were 82.9% and 87.4%, respectively.

This method is important because the mammary gland is the Region of Interest for pathological diagnosis. Five different pre-processing methods that enhance the transition areas or remove the speckle of the ultrasound images were selected: Non-linear diffusion, Speckle Reducing Anisotropic Diffusion, Entropy filter, Laplacian filter and Homomorphic filter. The results of these processing methods define the features that are used as descriptors for a K-Means and SVM classifier or as weak classifiers by an Adaboost classifier. The pixel classification resultes in a rough tissue segmentation. A new method is proposed to interpolate the classification results into an accurate tissue separation line, using graph theory. This step overcomes the problem of the discontinuities between the different classified areas. The developed segmentation method was applied to a database with 61 images, 34 without masses and 27 with masses collected using digital support, and segmented by an experienced medical oncologist in Centro Hospitalar da Cova da Beira in Portugal. The presented results were obtained using cross-validation.

Automated artery and vein detection in 4D-CT data with an unsupervised classification algorithm of the time intensity curves	MEDICAL IMAGING 2013: IMAGE PROCESSING	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Medical Imaging - Image Processing	FEB 10-12, 2013	Lake Buena Vista, FL	SPIE, Aeroflex Inc, Univ Cent Florida, CREOL Coll Opt & Photon, DQE Instruments Inc, Medtronic Inc, PIXELTEQ		Perfusion CT; Vessel segmentation; clustering; unsupervised; perfusion; arterial input function; stroke	DYNAMIC COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; PERFUSION; SEGMENTATION	In this work a fully automated detection method for artery input function (AIF) and venous output function (VOF) in 4D-computer tomography (4D-CT) data is presented based on unsupervised classification of the time intensity curves (TIC) as input data. Bone and air voxels are first masked out using thresholding of the baseline measurement. The TICs for each remaining voxel are converted to time-concentration-curves (TCC) by subtracting the baseline value from the TIC. Then, an unsupervised K-means classifier is applied to each TCC with an area under the curve (AUC) larger than 95% of the maximum AUC of all TCCs. The results are three clusters, which yield average TCCs for vein and artery voxels in the brain, respectively. A third cluster generally represents a vessel outside the brain. The algorithm was applied to five 4D-CT patient data who were scanned on the suspicion of ischemic stroke. For all five patients, the algorithm yields reasonable classification of arteries and veins as well as reasonable and reproducible AIFs and VOF. To our knowledge, this is the first application of an unsupervised classification method to automatically identify arteries and veins in 4D-CT data. Preliminary results show the feasibility of using K-means clustering for the purpose of artery-vein detection in 4D-CT patient data.	[Laue, H. O. A.; Chen, L.; Kompan, I. N.; Hahn, H.

The goal of this research is to create a smart phone based wound image analysis system for people with diabetes to track the healing process of chronic ulcers and wounds. This system has been implemented on an Android smart phone in collaboration with a PC (or embedded PC). The wound image is captured by the smart phone camera and transmitted to the PC via Wi-Fi for image processing. The PC converts the JPEG image to bitmap format, then performs boundary segmentation on the wound in the image. The segmentation is done with a particular implementation of the level set algorithm, the distance regularized level set evolution (DRLSE) method, which eliminates the need for re-initialization of level set function. Next, an assessment of the wound healing is performed with color segmentation within the boundaries of the wound image, by applying the K-Mean color clustering algorithm based on the red-yellow-black (RYB) evaluation model Finally, the results are re-formatted to JPEG, transmitted back to the smart phone and displayed. To accelerate the wound image segmentation, we have implemented the DRLSE method on the GPU & CPU cooperative hardware platform in data-parallel mode, which has greatly improved the computational efficiency. Processing wound images acquired from UMASS Medical Center has demonstrated that the wound image analysis system provides accurate wounds area determination and color segmentation. For all wound images of size around 640 x 480, with complicated wound boundaries, the wound analysis consumed max 3s, which is 5 times faster than the same algorithm running on the CPU alone.

This algorithm is adapted to a bivariate analysis to investigate zoning based on both yield and protein responses in an eastern Australian wheat field. The intention is to provide a zone-by-zone interpretation of the agronomic response to nitrogen (N). The segmentation algorithm provided management zone results comparable with the more widely used k-means classification. The algorithm is still under development but allows expert-knowledge to be incorporated into the zone delineation process.	[Taylor, J.

Agronomic significance of the zones defined within vineyards early in the season using NDVI and fruit load information	PRECISION AGRICULTURE '13			English	Proceedings Paper	9th European Conference on Precision Agriculture	JUL 07-11, 2013	Lleida, SPAIN	John Deere, AGCO, SAME DEUTZ FAHR, Infaimon Specim, Force A, GRUP cassa, Sprinter, Field Copter		viticulture; zoning; fuzzy k-means; grape quality		Wine quality is known to be highly dependent on grape quality and, therefore, wineries aiming to produce premium wines are concerned with obtaining top quality grapes. However, since grape quality is not uniform within a vineyard sometimes it is necessary to evaluate which zones within a single vineyard are producing the best grapes in order to segregate them at harvest. The aim of this work was to compare the performance of two methods to delineate zones within vineyards: (1) expert knowledge (ExpZ); and (2) fuzzy k-means analysis (FuzZ) using NDVI and fruit load as information sources, procedures that were applied to 4 adjacent vineyards located in Villamanta, (Madrid, Spain). Both methodologies were suitable to delineate parts of a vineyard with differences in grape composition, although FuzZ provided a more significant zoning than ExpZ from an oenological point of view.

Classification of fish schools based on acoustic features associated with tilt angle	2013 IEEE INTERNATIONAL UNDERWATER TECHNOLOGY SYMPOSIUM (UT)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Underwater Technology Symposium (UT)	MAR 05-08, 2013	Tokyo, JAPAN	IEEE			SPECIES IDENTIFICATION; BAND	It is required to monitor fish species and amount in order to save marine resources. In the current study, broadband split-beam echo sounder was used to survey fish resources. The echo sounder was useful to track individual fish in schools because individual fish echoes in the schools could be separately measured and three dimensional positions of the echoes could be accurately estimated. It is well known that the acoustic features of fish echoes are closely related to the body length and the apparent tilt angle of a fish. The tilt angle could be estimated by individual tracking. Echoes from fish schools were measured for several hours in the ocean. Echo signals were gathered into one block within a certain depth and a period of time and analyzed to track individual fish in the schools. Target strength was calculated from the individual fish echo and associated with the tilt angle, which was estimated by the individual tracking result. The feature in each block was statistically calculated by averaging target strengths based on the tilt angles. The blocks of the signals were classified by K-means method with the features and divided into some clusters. As a result of the clustering, fish schools in the blocks could be classified. The distribution of the clusters was dependent on both time and depth.

The effect of sintering temperature on the microstructure of CFs was investigated. The results showed that the reaction between CFs and TaC particles was controlled by solid diffusion. When the temperature was lower than 1773 K, mainly carbon diffused into TaC. However, Ta diffused into the CFs while carbon diffused into TaC particles and then precipitated as graphite when the sintering temperature was above 2123 K. During the process, the structure of TaC was not influenced. The preferential crystalline orientation of the graphite precipitated from TaC particles increased with the increase of sintering temperature. The R value determined by Raman spectra decreased from 0.12 to 0 as the temperature increased from 2123 to 2823 K, meaning the formation of perfect graphite crystallites.

The problem is occurred might due to new users or new items (music) are added into the system. In this paper, the meaning of the cold-start is narrowed to that the systems do not understand the new user's preferences. Therefore, systems can not recommend the music to users. Although many recommendation systems have a solution to reduce the cold-start, e.g., general systems utilize random to select songs. The systems random select some music works to user so that systems will know the user's preferences after they rated the music works. However, systems may cost much time to collect the necessary information when the new user is interesting in some special types of music. Therefore, if systems select various type of music initially, the user's preferences will be extracted more quickly. That is the cold-start problem can be reduced when the types of initial recommended music are various. In our approach, we utilize SUM to select some music from clusters. According to experiment, SUM selects type of music more average than k-means and random selection. Therefore, SOM can improve the cold-start problem and increase the precision of recommendation results.

SURF-KMs combines the advantages of SURF algorithm with a cluster analysis of K-means method. First, feature points are collected and then they generate the matching template vectors based on the SURF algorithm. Second, the feature points and the center of the target are estimated by using the K-means method to determine the target's cluster scope and update the tracking window. Finally, a self-adapting updating strategy for matching template is also proposed in order to track moving target automatically. Experimental results indicate that SURF-KMs is mostly able to achieve a stable tracking while with the monitored target rotating, scale changing, and also the environment illumination glittering. Moreover, it can satisfy the system requirements of tracking stability, higher precision and anti-jamming.

Spectroscopic optical coherence tomography with graphics processing unit based analysis of three dimensional data sets	BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS OF LIGHT SCATTERING VII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Biomedical Applications of Light Scattering VII	FEB 02-04, 2013	San Francisco, CA	SPIE		Optical Coherence Tomography; Spectroscopy		Spectroscopic optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an extension of the standard backscattering intensity analysis of OCT. It enables depth resolved monitoring of molecular and structural differences of tissue. One drawback of most methods to calculate the spectroscopic data is the long processing time. Also systematic and stochastic errors make the interpretation of the results challenging. Our approach combines modern signal processing tools with powerful graphics processing unit (GPU) programming. The processing speed for the spectroscopic analysis is nearly 3 mega voxel per second. This allows us to analyze multiple B-Scans in a few seconds and to display the results as a three dimensional data set. Our algorithm contains the following steps in addition to the conventional processing for frequency domain OCT: a quality map to exclude noisy parts of the data, spectral analysis by short time Fourier transform, feature reduction by Principal Component Analysis, unsupervised pattern recognition with K-means and rendering of the gray scale backscattering OCT data which is superimposed with a color map that is based on the results of the pattern recognition algorithm. Our set up provides a spectral range from 650-950nm and is optimized to suppress chromatic errors. In a proof-of-principle attempt, we already achieved additional spectroscopic contrast in phantom samples including scattering microspheres of different sizes and ex vivo biological tissue. This is an important step towards a system for real time spectral analysis of OCT data, which would be a powerful diagnosis tool for many diseases e. g. cancer detection at an early stage.

Instead, NS focuses selective pressure on the search for novel solutions. NS has produced intriguing results in specialized domains, but has not been applied in most machine learning areas. The key component of NS is that each individual is described by the behavior it exhibits, and this description is used to determine how novel each individual is with respect to what the search has produced thus far. However, describing individuals in behavioral space is not trivial, and care must be taken to properly define a descriptor for a particular domain. This paper applies NS to a mainstream pattern analysis area: data clustering. To do so, a descriptor of clustering performance is proposed and tested on several problems, and compared with two control methods, Fuzzy C-means and K-means. Results show that NS can effectively be applied to data clustering in some circumstances. NS performance is quite poor on simple or easy problems, achieving basically random performance. Conversely, as the problems get harder NS performs better, and outperforming the control methods. It seems that the search space exploration induced by NS is fully exploited only when generating good solutions is more challenging.

Additionally, we can also make many other judgments about material properties (e.g., hardness, rigidity, colorfulness). Although these two types of judgment (classification and inferring material properties) have different requirements, they likely facilitate one another. We conducted two experiments to investigate the interactions between material classification and judgments of material qualities in both the visual and semantic domains. In Experiment 1, nine students viewed 130 images of materials from 10 different classes. For each image, they rated nine subjective properties (glossiness, transparency, colorfulness, roughness, hardness, coldness, fragility, naturalness, prettiness). In Experiment 2, 65 subjects were given the verbal names of six material classes, which they rated in terms of 42 adjectives describing material qualities. In both experiments, there was notable agreement between subjects, and a relatively small number of factors (weighted combinations of different qualities) were substantially independent of one another. Despite the difficulty of classifying materials from images (Liu, Sharan, Adelson, & Rosenholtz, 2010), the different classes were well clustered in the feature space defined by the subjective ratings. K-means clustering could correctly identify class membership for over 90% of the samples, based on the average ratings across subjects. We also found a high degree of consistency between the two tasks, suggesting subjects access similar information about materials whether judging their qualities visually or from memory. Together, these findings show that perceptual qualities are well defined, distinct, and systematically related to material class membership.

Functional modalities play a continuously increasing role in these efforts. Image segmentation algorithms which enable automatic, accurate tumor visualization and quantification on noisy positron emission tomography (PET) images would significantly improve the quality of treatment planning processes and in turn, the success of treatments. In this work a novel multistep method has been applied in order to identify tumor regions in 4D dynamic [F-18] fluorothymidine (FLT) PET studies of patients with locally advanced breast cancer. In order to eliminate the effect of inherently detectable high inhomogeneity inside tumors, specific voxel-kinetic classes were initially introduced by finding characteristic FLT-uptake curves with K-means algorithm on a set of voxels collected from each tumor. Image voxel sets were then split based on voxel time-activity curve (TAC) similarities, and models were generated separately on each voxel set. At first, artificial neural networks, in comparison with linear classification algorithms were applied to distinguish tumor and healthy regions relying on the characteristics of TACs of the individual voxels. The outputs of the best model with very high specificity were then used as input seeds for region shrinking and growing techniques, the application of which considerably enhanced the sensitivity and specificity (78.65% +/- 0.65% and 98.98% +/- 0.03%, respectively) of the final image segmentation model.

Ischemic stroke often connects to brain ventricle, therefore, ventricular segmentation is an important and difficult task when stroke is present, and is the topic of this study. We first corrected inclination angle of brain by aligning midline of brain with the vertical centerline of a slice. We then estimated the intensity range of the ventricles by use of the k-means method. Two segmentation of the ventricle were obtained by use of thresholding technique. One segmentation contains ventricle and nearby stroke. The other mainly contains ventricle. Therefore, the stroke regions can be extracted and removed using image difference technique. An adaptive template-matching algorithm was employed to identify objects in the fore-mentioned segmentation. The largest connected component was identified and considered as the ventricle. We applied our method to 25 unenhanced CT scans with stroke. Our method achieved average Dice index, sensitivity, and specificity of 95.1%, 97.0%, and 99.8% for the entire ventricular regions. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method has great potential in detection and quantification of stroke and other neurologic diseases.

Detection of apoptosis caused by anticancer drug paclitaxel in MCF-7 cells by Confocal Raman Microscopy	NANOSCALE IMAGING, SENSING, AND ACTUATION FOR BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS X	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Nanoscale Imaging, Sensing, and Actuation for Biomedical Applications X	FEB 06-07, 2013	San Francisco, CA	SPIE		Apoptosis; Raman microscopy; Paclitaxel; K-mean cluster; correlation coefficient; living cell	SPECTROSCOPY	Confocal Raman microscopy, a non-invasive, label free imaging technique is used to study apoptosis in living MCF-7 cells. The images are based on Raman spectra of cells components. K-mean clustering was used to determine mitochondria position in cells and cytochrome c distribution inside the cells was based on correlation analysis. Cell apoptosis is defined as cytochrome c diffusion in cytoplasm. Co-localization of cytochrome c is found within mitochondria after three hours of incubation with 10 mu M paclitaxel. Our results demonstrate that the presence of paclitaxel at this concentration in the culture media for 3 hours does not induce apoptosis of MCF7 cells via a caspase independent pathway.

First, an original RBF-NN that superposes each center to a training set point is built and the network is trained to obtain the potential relationships between the input and output variables. Next, Rough K-Means is employed to optimize the structure and weights of the RBF-NN by clustering the output from the hidden layer that is due to the cluster uncertainty of the hidden output. Further, RBF-NN with Rough K-Means and K-Means, respectively, are employed to develop naphtha dry point soft sensors. The results show that the Rough K-Means is more effective in handling uncertainty and that RBF-NN with Rough K-Means is superior to RBF-NN with K-Means.

In the TK-means detection mechanism, when the threshold is lower than zero, it is judged that selfish behavior happens in network; In the presence of selfish behaviors, the data set is divided into K groups composed by a number of similar object, which have high similarity in the same groups and low similarity in different groups to distinguish normal nodes and selfish nodes. Simulation results from NS2 show that the TK-means algorithm can effectively detect the selfish behaviors generated by one selfish node or multiple selfish nodes in the WSN.

For this task, probabilistic models to estimate the frequency and intensity of rainfall are available, but require inputs from the target location. Hydrological monitoring networks, however, do not cover all places of interest and therefore a tool capable of transferring the information from the monitored location to that of interest is necessary. This can be accomplished by index-flood regionalization methodology, which permits to estimate quantiles, evaluate the homogeneity of a region and identify discordant stations. The study focuses on the state of Parana, Brazil, using monthly rainfall in 227 stations during 31 years (1976-2006). The study reviews various clustering methods, both hierarchical and nonhierarchical, and presents methods to validate the classifications using measures of both discordance for stations belonging to a particular cluster and homogeneity of the obtained regions. Hierarchical methodologies used were: centroid, single, average, complete and Ward linkages. Nonhierarchical methodology used was k-means. Also was utilized a hybrid form between nonhierarchical and hierarchical methodologies. Optimized number of groups was found utilizing the cophenetic correlation coefficient, Davies-Bouldin and Dunn indexes. Each group of optimum repartition was evaluated with respect their homogeneity and outlier stations. The best repartition of rainfall stations was found with hybrid form between Ward and k-means methodologies, because elimination of outlier stations allowed forming homogeneous regions with respect to L-moments. Other point observed was the effect of outlier stations in homogeneity of studied region, as well as, group's number of stations. Finally, gamma distribution was tested with two or three parameters and showing satisfactory results.

The main piece of information we use to discriminate among different types of interactions is provided by proxemics cues acquired by a tracker, and used to distinguish between intentional and casual interactions. The proxemics information has been acquired through the analysis of two different metrics: on the one hand we observe the current distance between subjects, and on the other hand we measure the O-space synergy between subjects. The obtained values are taken at every time step over a temporal sliding window, and processed in the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) domain. The features are eventually merged into an unique array, and clustered using the K-means algorithm. The clusters are reorganized using a second larger temporal window into a Bag Of Words framework, so as to build the feature vector that will feed the SVM classifier.

Our algorithm applies to both a printer model and a model for the human visual system (HVS). In this algorithm, the improved K-means clustering method is used to segment an image several regions. In the halftone process, each clustering uses the weighted least-squares model-based(WLSMB) algorithm by use of direct binary search iterative method to obtain halftone image. Analysis and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm produces better gray-scale halftone image quality when we increase the number of clustering with a certain range and outperforms least-squares model-based algorithm in the PSNR(Peak Signal Noise Ratio), WSNR(Veighted Signal Noise Ratio)criteria.

However, a single extracellular electrode can capture spikes from more then one cell. The process of sorting these spikes is typically made in some steps: detection, alignment, feature extraction and clustering. For the crucial feature extraction step, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Wavelet Transform are the most used methods. In this work we propose to use of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for feature extraction associated with K-means, Fuzzy C-means (FCM) or Self Organizing Maps (SOM) in the clustering step. Our results demonstrate that using ICA as preprocessing gives better cluster of spikes separation than the other feature extraction methods, which yields a better final sorting accuracy using simulated data.

J	Sobiech, J; Dierking, W				Sobiech, Jennifer; Dierking, Wolfgang			Observing lake- and river-ice decay with SAR: advantages and limitations of the unsupervised k-means classification approach	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY			English	Article							SHALLOW LAKES; SEA-ICE; MODEL; DEPENDENCE; SIGNATURES; ALASKA	Large parts of the Arctic are covered by water bodies. Ice covers on lakes and rivers prohibit the exchange of heat and water vapor between the water body and the atmosphere. With melt onset, the ecosystem is subjected to changes, making it important to monitor the ice decay. As ground-based monitoring of these vast uninhabited areas is expensive and thus restricted to a few locations, remote-sensing techniques need to be applied. Here we evaluate the performance of the unsupervised k-means classification for dividing ice and water fractions on lakes and river channels from spaceborne radar data in comparison to threshold-based methods. The analysis is based on six TerraSAR-X and three RADARSAT-2 images, obtained during spring 2011 over the central Lena Delta in northern Siberia. The performance of the k-means classification is found to be similar to a fixed-threshold approach. As the k-means classification does not need prior statistical backscatter analyses to account for the radar configuration and ice conditions, it is easier to use than the threshold method. In addition, we found that the application of a low-pass filter prior to the classification of river channels and a closing filter on the classification results of lakes strongly improves the overall classification results.

However, this is a multi-layered problem. Therefore a lung cancer risk prediction system is here proposed which is easy, cost effective and time saving. Materials and Methods: Initially 400 cancer and non-cancer patients' data were collected from different diagnostic centres, pre-processed and clustered using a K-means clustering algorithm for identifying relevant and non-relevant data. Next significant frequent patterns are discovered using AprioriTid and a decision tree algorithm. Results: Finally using the significant pattern prediction tools for a lung cancer prediction system were developed. This lung cancer risk prediction system should prove helpful in detection of a person's predisposition for lung cancer. Conclusions: Most of people of Bangladesh do not even know they have lung cancer and the majority of cases are diagnosed at late stages when cure is impossible. Therefore early prediction of lung cancer should play a pivotal role in the diagnosis process and for an effective preventive strategy.

Interest in border studies has increased with recent changes in geographical locations of the border or the fluctuation of the permeability of the border between some countries, such as in the European Union. Whether the nations are trying to increase traffic flow of the border or to implement stricter border control, having appropriate information of the border is crucial for effective policymaking. The objective of this research was to identify areas of high porosity, or high permeability, for pedestrians along the southern national border region in Carinthia, Austria using terrain, land use, and road data along with geocomputational methods. Two unsupervised classification methods, the fuzzy K-means clustering and the Self-Organizing Map, were applied to segment the border into homogeneous zones according to topographic and infrastructural attributes. The fuzzy K-means clustering method was chosen for its ability to allow for a continuous approach to classification. With this method, an object can belong, with different degrees of membership, to multiple classes, which is a more realistic reflection of the natural world than discrete clustering, where each object can only belong to one class. However, the fuzzy K-means clustering method does have disadvantages, i.e. the user must determine the number of classes and the input parameters are required to be in continuous format. The second classification method, the Self-Organizing Map, is a type of artificial neural network and was chosen for its ability to automatically determine the number of classes and handle categorical data. The Self-Organizing Map is unique because it can transform high dimensional data into low dimensional display while preserving the topology and spatial distribution of the input parameters. The results of the two classification methods suggest that the fuzzy K-means classification is more effective than the Self-Organizing Map for this situation. However, more research is needed to determine the fit of these algorithms for particular spatial data classification tasks. The results obtained from this research provide an insight into the permeability of the border region of Carinthia, Slovenia, and Italy to pedestrian traffic and can be potentially useful for decision making processes for tourism development and road transportation management in that region. Furthermore, the approach presented in this article can be applied to other national borders to identify zones permeable to pedestrian traffic.

They not only reduce human power, but also make surveillance in real time. In this paper, we propose a robust and efficient anomaly-detection algorithm in traffic surveillance system. The proposed method consists of two parts: (1) scene modeling part, and (2) anomaly detection part. First part, to systemically collect trajectories of moving objects, we apply the sparse optical flow method to foreground regions extracted by a conventional background modeling method. These collected trajectories are represented as 3-dimensional feature vectors whose components are x and y coordinates and moving direction, and they are clustered by k-means clustering method. After this process, all feature vectors are assigned clustering labels, and then we construct a trajectory histogram based on cells whose mean grid with a particular size to make the scene model. Then we apply the entropy concept to generated histograms in order to handle some regions where the uncertainty of motion pattern is high. In the anomaly detection part, we get features of objects in a image and track them with the same way in the scene modeling part. At this time, they are classified by nearest neighborhood method. From this result of classification, we can detect anomalies in the traffic video by comparing it with the scene model. Experimental results demonstrate that the anomaly detection rate of the proposed method is very high, and the processing speed is almost real time.

Three hundred and eighty genotypes of tomato were investigated for genetic diversity for nine seedling traits and considerable genetic variation was observed for all the traits except pubescence. Only two genotypes (19901 and 6836-9) were glabrous, whereas all others had hair on the hypocotyl. Eight clusters were observed based on k-means clustering with average distance ranging from 0.47 (cluster 6) to 0.79 (cluster 8). Some of the discrete traits did not exhibit variation within individual cluster that could be one of the bases for clustering pattern. The scatter diagram partially indicated the clustering pattern and the clusters 3, 4 and 5 intermixed. Sub clustering of individual clusters revealed 5 sub clusters of cluster 1, three of cluster 2 and 5 in each case, six in cluster 3, 4 and 7 and cluster 6 and 8 had 4 each The cluster 2, 3, 4 and 6 joined at higher genetic linkage with induction of single genotype in the cluster 2, 4 and 6, whereas in cluster 3, two main groups joined at higher distance including one group comprising of the 41 genotypes and the second comprising 19 genotypes, which joined at 80% linkage distance. The data on seedling traits along with other data will be utilized for establishment of core set and the genotypes with maximum genetic distance from individual clusters along with representative samples from low distance groups are likely to be chosen for core set.

Based on the dominance of cloud effect on solar irradiance and the advantage of the high spatial resolution of a geostationary satellite, a novel method is presented for optimizing the location of UV measuring sites. The k-means algorithm is used for cluster analysis and the validation of the clustering method reveals that the variability of surface solar UV irradiance due to cloudiness over Greece could be sufficiently monitored with the establishment of 23-28 ground-based instruments.

Mammogram Image Feature Selection using Unsupervised Tolerance Rough Set Relative Reduct Algorithm	2013 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION, INFORMATICS AND MEDICAL ENGINEERING (PRIME)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Pattern Recognition, Informatics and Mobile Engineering (PRIME)	FEB 21-22, 2013	Salem, INDIA		Periyar Univ, Dept Comp Sci	Rough Set Theory; Unsupervised Feature Selection; Tolerance Rough Set; Tolerance Quick Reduct; PSO - Relative Reduct; Mammography		Feature Selection (FS) aims to determine a minimal feature subset from a problem domain while retaining a suitably high accuracy in representing the original features. Rough set theory (RST) has been used as such a tool with much success. In the supervised FS methods, various feature subsets are evaluated using an evaluation function or metric to select only those features which are related to the decision classes of the data under consideration. However, for many data mining applications, decision class labels are often unknown or incomplete, thus indicating the significance of unsupervised feature selection. However, in unsupervised learning, decision class labels are not provided. The problem is that not all features are important. Some of the features may be redundant, and others may be irrelevant and noisy. In this paper, a novel unsupervised feature selection in mammogram image, using tolerance rough set based relative reduct is proposed. And also, compared with Tolerance Quick Reduct and PSO - Relative Reduct unsupervised feature selection methods. A typical mammogram image processing system generally consists of mammogram image acquisition, pre-processing of image segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection and classification. The proposed method is used to reduce features from the extracted features and the method is compared with existing unsupervised features selection methods. The proposed method is evaluated through clustering and classification algorithms in K-means and WEKA.	[Aroquiaraj, I.

Proteins are required for the structure, function, and regulation of the body's cells, tissues, and organs and each protein has unique functions. Localization sites of proteins are identified by the mechanism and moved to its corresponding organelles. In this paper, we introduce the method clustering and its type's K-Means and K-Medoids. The clustering algorithms are improved by implementing the two initial centroid selection methods instead of selecting centroid randomly. K-Means algorithm can be improved by implementing the initial cluster centroids are selected by the two proposed algorithms instead of selecting centroids randomly, which is compared by using Davie Bouldin index measure, hence the proposed algorithm1 overcomes the drawbacks of selecting initial cluster centers then other methods. In the yeast dataset, the defective proteins (objects) are considered as outliers, which are identified by the clustering methods with ADOC (Average Distance between Object and Centroid) function. The outlier's detection method and performance analysis method are studied and compared, the experimental results shows that the K-Medoids method performs well when compare with the K-Means clustering.

In Bioinformatics, data mining enables researchers to meet the challenge of mining large amount of biomolecular data to discover real knowledge. Major research efforts done in the area of bioinformatics involves sequence analysis, protein structure prediction and gene finding. Proteins are said to be prominent molecules in our cells. They involve virtually in all cell functions. The activities and functions of proteins can be determined by protein sequence motifs. These protein motifs are identified from the segments of protein sequences. All segments may not be important to produce good motif patterns. The generated sequence segments do not have classes or labels. Hence, unsupervised segment selection technique is adopted to select significant segments. Therefore Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) entropy method is adopted to select significant sequence segments. In this proposed work, weighted K-Means and Adaptive Fuzzy C-Means have been applied to the selected segments to generate granules, since large amount of segments cannot be grouped or clustered as such. Each granules generated by weighted K-Means algorithm are further clustered by using the K-Means algorithm and granules generated by Adaptive Fuzzy C-Means algorithm are clustered by using Weighted K-Means. The two proposed models are compared with K-Means granular computing model. The experimental results show that Adaptive Fuzzy C-Means with Weighted K-Means technique produces better results than K-Means and weighted K-Means granular computing methods.

It is a general term for a process which aims to separate foreground objects from a relatively stationary background. It should be processed in real time. It is obtained in human detection system by computing the variation, pixel-by-pixel, between the current frame and the image of the background, followed by an automatic threshold. This paper proposed a K means based background subtraction for real time video processing in video surveillance. We have analyzed and evaluate the performance of the proposed method, with standard K-means and other background subtractions algorithms. The experimental results showed that the proposed method provides better output.	[Kumar, A.

Clustering in agricultural soil datasets is a relatively novel research field. This research paper aims to study the Characterization of Chemical Properties of Soil Surface Data of Bhanapur Micro watershed of Koppal District, Karnataka using K-means algorithm. This work computed average silhouette width which provides an evaluation of clustering validity, and might be used to select an appropriate number of clusters in the soil dataset. Soil dataset clustered by using K-means two clustering with Euclidean distance which provides average silhouette value is 0.7736. And this work also proved high intra-class similarity: cohesive within clusters and low inter-class similarity: distinctive between clusters in the soil dataset by K-means which reassigns points among clusters to decrease the sum of point-to-centroid distances, and then recomputed cluster centroids for the new cluster assignments. K-means clustering with Euclidean distance total sum of distance is 1.14402 based on the number of reassign soil data. By default, K-means begins the clustering process using a randomly selected set of initial centroid locations. K-means repeats the clustering process starting from different randomly selected centroids. The sum of distances within each cluster for that best solution is 1.1440 with Euclidean distance. K-means three clustering solution with Euclidean distance which provides average silhouette value is 0.6052. K-means three clustering solution with Cosine distance average silhouette value is 0.6219. Hierarchical Clustering dendrogram with Euclidean distance measure is 0.7935. Hierarchical Clustering dendrogram with Cosine distance measure is 0.6678. The results from hierarchical clustering dendrogram with Cosine distance are qualitatively similar to results from K-Means using three clusters. K-means cluster analysis with Euclidean and Cosine distance measures compared with Hierarchical clustering dendrogram.

A tag is any user-generated word or phrase that helps to organize web 2.0 content. The current hype around web 2.0 applications, poses several important challenges for future data and web mining methods. An important challenge of Web 2.0 is the fact that a large amount of data has been generated over a short period. Clustering the tag data is very tedious since the tag space is very large in several social book marking web sites. So, instead of clustering the whole tag space of Web 2.0 data, some tags frequent enough in the tag space can be selected for clustering by applying feature selection techniques. The goal of feature selection is to determine a marginal bookmarked URL subset from a Web 2.0 data while retaining a suitably high accuracy in representing the original bookmarks. Tag clustering is the process of grouping similar tags into the same cluster and is important for the success of collaborative tagging services. In this paper, Unsupervised Quick Reduct feature selection algorithm is applied to find a set of most commonly tagged bookmarks and then clustering techniques such as Soft rough fuzzy clustering and Rough K-Means algorithms are applied for clustering of user generated tags and the performance of these clustering approaches are illustrated in this paper.

All the genes may not be biologically significant in diagnosing the disease. In this paper, a novel approach has been proposed to select significant genes of leukemia cancer using K-Means clustering algorithm. It is an unsupervised machine learning approach, which is being used to identify the unknown patterns from the huge amount of data. The proposed K-Means algorithm has been experimented to cluster the genes for K=5,10 and 15. The significant genes have been identified through the best accuracy obtained from the clusters generated. The accuracy of the clusters are determined again by using K-Means algorithm compared with ground truth values.

Montaz			An investigation of K-means clustering to high and multi-dimensional biological data	KYBERNETES			English	Article						Cluster analysis; Programming and algorithm theory; Data management; Clustering; Dimensionality; Categorical data; Silhouette validity index; Bioinformatics; Computational intelligence	EXPRESSION DATA	Purpose - The K-means clustering algorithm has been intensely researched owing to its simplicity of implementation and usefulness in the clustering task. However, there have also been criticisms on its performance, in particular, for demanding the value of K before the actual clustering task. It is evident from previous researches that providing the number of clusters a priori does not in any way assist in the production of good quality clusters. The authors' investigations in this paper also confirm this finding. The purpose of this paper is to investigate further, the usefulness of the K-means clustering in the clustering of high and multi-dimensional data by applying it to biological sequence data. Design/methodology/approach - The authors suggest a scheme which maps the high dimensional data into low dimensions, then show that the K-means algorithm with pre-processor produces good quality, compact and well-separated clusters of the biological data mapped in low dimensions. For the purpose of clustering, a character-to-numeric conversion was conducted to transform the nucleic/amino acids symbols to numeric values. Findings - A preprocessing technique has been suggested. Originality/value - Conceptually this is a new paper with new results.	[Baridam, Barilee B.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Comp Sci, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Ali, M.

Are You Using the Right Approximate Nearest Neighbor Algorithm?	2013 IEEE WORKSHOP ON APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTER VISION (WACV)	IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)	JAN 15-17, 2013	Clearwater, FL	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE BioMetr Council				Many computer vision tasks such as large-scale image retrieval and nearest-neighbor classification perform similarity searches using Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) indexes. These applications rely on the quality of ANN retrieval for success. Popular indexing methods for ANN queries include forests of kd-trees (KDT) and hierarchical k-means (HKM). The dominance of these two methods has led to implementations in many popular computer vision tool kits, perhaps leading some to assume that ANN indexing is a solved problem. This paper introduces a new method, the Proximity Forest, which is based on a forest of randomized metric trees. We present evidence that forests of metric trees significantly outperform KDT and HKM when evaluated on real-world data, controlling for dimensionality, data set size, distance function, and the number of neighbors returned by the query. Randomized metric trees are simple to implement, are generic in regards to the chosen distance function, and can be applied to a wider class of data representations.

Intrusion Detection Technique by using K-means, Fuzzy Neural Network and SVM classifiers	2013 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER COMMUNICATION AND INFORMATICS			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics (ICCCI)	JAN 04-06, 2013	Coimbatore, INDIA	Sri Shakthi Inst Engn & Technol, Govt India, Minist Sci & Technol, Dept Sci & Technol, IEEE Madras Sect, Council Sci & Ind Res (CSIR), IEEE		Intrusion Detection System; Neuro-fuzzy; Radial Support Vector Machine; K-Means Clustering		With the impending era of internet, the network security has become the key foundation for lot of financial and business web applications. Intrusion detection is one of the looms to resolve the problem of network security. Imperfectness of intrusion detection systems (IDS) has given an opportunity for data mining to make several important contributions to the field of intrusion detection. In recent years, many researchers are using data mining techniques for building IDS. Here, we propose a new approach by utilizing data mining techniques such as neuro-fuzzy and radial basis support vector machine (SVM) for helping IDS to attain higher detection rate. The proposed technique has four major steps: primarily, k-means clustering is used to generate different training subsets. Then, based on the obtained training subsets, different neuro-fuzzy models are trained. Subsequently, a vector for SVM classification is formed and in the end, classification using radial SVM is performed to detect intrusion has happened or not. To illustrate the applicability and capability of the new approach, the results of experiments on KDD CUP 1999 dataset is demonstrated. Experimental results shows that our proposed new approach do better than BPNN, multiclass SVM and other well-known methods such as decision trees and Columbia model in terms of sensitivity, specificity and in particular detection accuracy.

The grid environment is dynamic and it allows the clusters to move around freely. Grid acts as a supercomputer to the users by handling voluminous data. So proper allocation of the available resources is important. Hence resource discovery and scheduling of jobs is a challenging area in grid. This paper presents a new approach for scheduling jobs in grid using Bee Colony algorithm and the discovered resources are advancely reserved for future. Bee Colony is a recently popular heuristic algorithm used for optimization. Grid consists of many clusters which contains the resources. Clusters are formed using K-means algorithm. K-means is a partitioning method for cluster formation. The results shows that performance of resource discovery is greatly improved using this algorithm and total throughput is increased with advance reservation of resources.	[Kaladevi, A.

Recently, most of the researches and study are concentrated on optimization of clustering process using different optimization methods. The commonly used optimizing algorithms such as Particle swarm optimization, Ant Colony Algorithm and Genetic Algorithms have given some significant contributions for optimizing the clustering results. In this paper, we have proposed two new approaches by enhancing the traditional Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, the first approach uses ABC algorithm with K means operator and second approach uses ABC algorithm with FCM operator for optimizing the clustering process.

Most of the term frequency based clustering techniques consider the documents as bag-of-words and ignore the important relationships between the words in the document. Phrase based clustering techniques also capture only the order in which the words occur in a sentence rather than the semantics behind the words. Hence a concept based clustering technique is proposed in this paper. It uses Medical Subject Headings MeSH ontology for concept extraction and concept weight calculation based on the identity and synonymy relationships. K-means algorithm is used for clustering the documents based on the semantic similarity and the results are analyzed.

K-means clustering algorithm is used to find the natural grouping that exists within the cricket players using player's batting average, strike rate, bowling average, economy etc. as input features - in this case players are grouped into 3 groups. Further separate probability density models are fitted for batsmen, bowlers and all-rounding players using appropriate player's performance metrics as input features and using these models, outstanding players are identified. Similar method is used to identify match winning players, where the differences between player's performance metrics and team's average performance metrics are used as input features. The results obtained from this study seem to correlate with expert generated results where they used point based system to rank the players. This kind of statistical analysis of sports data plays a vital role in team planning and exploiting opponents' weakness.

A clustering criterion based on a linear combination of order statistics is proposed. The asymptotic behavior of the point at which the observations are split into two clusters is examined. The results obtained can then be utilized to construct an interval estimate of the point which splits the data and develop tests for bimodality and presence of clusters.

The system consists of thermal cables, data acquisition unit, and data processing unit. As the thermal cables emit heats, the distributed DS18B20 digital temperature sensors record temperature information over time. The scour-induced exposure and free spanning can be identified by analyzing the temperature curves. Pipeline exposure and free-spanning experiments were carried out in laboratory, whose results show that the system is able to give overall information about the development of pipeline scour. Difference values analysis reveals the changing patterns of heat transfer behavior for line heat source in sediment and water scenarios. Two features, magnitude and temporal instability, are extracted from temperature curves to better differentiate sediment and water scenarios. Based on these two features, K-means clustering algorithm is adopted for pattern classification of the system, which was implemented in MATLAB and facilitated the automatic detection of the scour monitoring sensor network system. The proposed sensor network has the advantages of low cost, high precision and construction flexiblility, providing a promising approach for offshore pipeline scour monitoring, especially suitable for nearshore environment.

We propose a fast and effective algorithm of kernel K-means clustering. The idea of the algorithm is that we firstly map the data from their original space to a high dimensional space (or kernel space) where the data are expected to be more separable. Then we perform K-means clustering in the high dimensional kernel space. Meanwhile we improve speed of the algorithm by using a new kernel function---conditionally positive definite kernel (CPD). The performance of new algorithm has been demonstrated to be superior to that of K-means clustering algorithm by our experiments on artificial and real data.

Raman spectroscopic mapping for the analysis of solar radiation induced skin damage	ANALYST			English	Article							STRATUM-CORNEUM LIPIDS; INDUCED CELL-DEATH; OXIDATIVE DNA-DAMAGE; SUNBURN CELL; CONCENTRATION PROFILES; WAVELENGTH DEPENDENCE; PERMEABILITY BARRIER; SIMULATED RADIATION; WATER CONCENTRATION; UVB IRRADIATION	The effects of simulated solar irradiation of an artificial skin model have been examined using Raman spectroscopy and the results are compared with cytotoxicological and histological profiling. Samples exposed for times varying between 30 minutes and 240 minutes were incubated post exposure for a period of 96 hours. The cytotoxicological response as measured by the MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] assay demonstrated a similar to 50% loss of viability of the artificial tissue after 120 minutes exposure. Histological staining of tissue sections showed considerable loss of cellular content in the epidermal layer at this endpoint. Raman spectroscopic mapping of tissue sections, coupled with K-means cluster analysis (KMCA) clearly identified the dermal and stratum corneum layers and differentiated further substructures of the epidermis. Post irradiation, a significant loss of DNA features in the basal layer was apparent in the results of the KMCA. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of layers identified by the KMCA post exposure compared with controls indicated a significant increase in the lipidic signatures of the stratum corneum. In the dermal layer, little photodamage was observed, but a similar increase in lipidic signatures in the basal layer was accompanied by a decrease in DNA and protein contributions. The spectral profiles of the photodamage to the basal layer as identified by PCA are consistent over the exposure periods of 30-240 minutes, but an examination of the evolution of features associated with specific biochemical components indicated DNA damage and loss of lipidic signatures at the early exposure times, whereas changes in protein signatures appeared to evolve over longer periods. In comparison to the cytotoxicological responses, the study demonstrates that Raman spectroscopy can identify biochemical changes as a result of solar exposure at time points significantly earlier than changes in tissue viability are observed.

Here, Fourier transform infrared microscopic images were collected from 22 brain metastasis tissue sections of bladder carcinoma, lung carcinoma, mamma carcinoma, colon carcinoma, prostate carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. The scope of this study was to distinguish the infrared spectra of carcinoma from normal tissue and necrosis and to use the infrared spectra of carcinoma to determine the primary tumor of brain metastasis. Data processing follows procedures that have previously been developed for the analysis of Raman images of these samples and includes the unmixing algorithm N-FINDR, segmentation by k-means clustering, and classification by support vector machines (SVMs). Upon comparison with the subsequent hematoxylin and eosin stained tissue sections of training specimens, correct classification rates of the first level SVM were 98.8% for brain tissue, 98.4% for necrosis and 94.4% for carcinoma. The primary tumors were correctly predicted with an overall rate of 98.7% for FTIR images of the training dataset by a second level SVM. Finally, the two level discrimination models were applied to four independent specimens for validation. Although the classification rates are slightly reduced compared to the training specimens, the majority of the infrared spectra of the independent specimens were assigned to the correct primary tumor. The results demonstrate the capability of FTIR imaging to complement histopathological tools for brain tissue diagnosis.

By comparing the attributes of contexts and JANs, our findings indicate that our model can accumulate the JANs, whose attributes are similar with the user's contexts, together. By applying the KaM_CLU algorithm and Centre rank strategy into the KaM_CRK model, the model boosts a significant promotion on the accuracy of provision of user's knowledge. By analyzing the users' behaviors, the dynamic coefficient Behavior F is first presented in KaM_CLU. Compared to traditional approaches of K means and DBSCAN, the KaM_CLU algorithm does not need to initialize the number of clusters. Additionally, its synthetic results are more accurate, reasonable, and fit than other approaches for users. It is known from our evaluation through real data that our strategy performs better on time efficiency and user's satisfaction, which will save by 30% and promote by 5%, respectively.

Wavelet neural networks (WNNs), which were developed based on the wavelet theory, are a variant of ANNs. During the training phase of WNNs, several parameters need to be initialized; including the type of wavelet activation functions, translation vectors, and dilation parameter. The conventional k-means and fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms have been used to select the translation vectors. However, the solution vectors might get trapped at local minima. In this regard, the evolutionary harmony search algorithm, which is capable of searching for near-optimum solution vectors, both locally and globally, is introduced to circumvent this problem. In this paper, the conventional k-means and fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms were hybridized with the metaheuristic harmony search algorithm. In addition to obtaining the estimation of the global minima accurately, these hybridized algorithms also offer more than one solution to a particular problem, since many possible solution vectors can be generated and stored in the harmony memory. To validate the robustness of the proposed WNNs, the real world problem of epileptic seizure detection was presented. The overall classification accuracy from the simulation showed that the hybridized metaheuristic algorithms outperformed the standard k-means and fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms.

Characterisation of potential aquaculture pond effluents, and physico-chemical and microbial assessment of effluent-receiving waters in central Ghana	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE			English	Article						aquaculture-environment interaction; earthen ponds; effluent characterisation; K-means clustering; tilapia; water quality	CHANNEL CATFISH; FISH; SYSTEM	An understanding of specific aquaculture systems and the impacts of their management practices leads to sound and cost-effective policies to protect the aquatic environment. Water samples were collected in 2009 from fish ponds, streams that receive effluents directly from ponds and reference streams in Ghana to assess potential environmental impacts of pond aquaculture. Although relatively dilute, fish ponds had higher levels of all physico-chemical variables measured compared to those of locations upstream and downstream of farms, and to reference locations. Total nitrogen and BOD5 were most clearly statistically significant. Of 292 earthen fish ponds surveyed in central Ghana, approximately 92% were used for either Oreochromis monoculture or Oreochromis-Clarias polyculture. These had similar pond water (i.e. potential effluent) quality but different management practices. The study ponds had the potential to pollute effluent-receiving streams, but their actual impacts will depend on how pond effluents are managed. Conventional treatment of effluents from these small-scale, low-volume operations, which discharge relatively dilute effluents infrequently, might not be cost-effective.	[Ansah, Y. B.; Frimpong, E.

A novel method is proposed for feature extraction by the combination of R-transform, principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA). R-transform is used for periodic, scale, and translation invariant feature extraction. PCA is used for dimensions reduction and ICA is used for independent features extraction. The features are processed by k-means to get observation sequences which are used by hidden Markov model for HAR. The dataset consisting of six abnormal activities (backward fall, forward fall, chest pain, headache, vomit, and faint) and three normal activities (walk, raise one hand, and raise both hands) from the view angles (90 degrees, -90 degrees, 45 degrees, -45 degrees, and 0 degrees) is produced. Experimental results show average recognition rate of 86.86% for abnormal and normal activities from different view angles by our proposed system using (R-transform + PCA + ICA) as compared to R-transform, PCA, and ICA methods.

Hyperspectral imaging of tissue mimicking phantoms: principal component analysis	OPTICAL INTERACTIONS WITH TISSUE AND CELLS XXIV	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Optical Interactions with Tissue and Cells XXIV	FEB 04-05, 2013	San Francisco, CA	SPIE		Hyperspectral imaging; spectroscopy in turbid media; micro-machined angular filters; principal component analysis; trans-illumination imaging	OPTICAL PROJECTION TOMOGRAPHY; ANGULAR DOMAIN; SCATTERING; MEDIA	Angular domain spectroscopic imaging (ADSI) is a hyperspectral imaging technology that combines both optical spectroscopy and optical imaging into a single platform. The technique employs an array of micro-channels to perform angular filtration, whereby quasi-ballistic photons traversing a turbid sample are accepted, and scattered photons (image-degrading) are rejected. The aim of the work reported here was to evaluate the effectiveness of an ADSI system at identifying targets buried within tissue-mimicking phantoms. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to spectral data-cubes to extract the main spectral features from the images. Targets of various absorption levels (indocyanine green), depths beneath the phantom surface, and background scattering levels were evaluated. Principal components were analyzed with k-means clustering. The extracted features were grouped and classified. Then, the sensitivity and specificity of the ADSI system were estimated. Angular domain spectroscopic imaging with PCA provided clear separation of targets of different absorber concentration and depth. The results led us to conclude that the technique holds potential for characterizing tissue specimens obtained during surgery.	[Wong, Philip; Vasefi, Fartash; Brackstone, Muriel; Carson, Jeffrey J.

Penalized unsupervised learning with outliers	STATISTICS AND ITS INTERFACE			English	Article						Robust; Group lasso; Clustering; Principal components analysis; M-estimation	VARIABLE SELECTION; GROUPED VARIABLES; ORACLE PROPERTIES; MODEL SELECTION; K-MEANS; REGRESSION; LASSO; DISCRIMINANT; SHRINKAGE; PATTERNS	We consider the problem of performing unsupervised learning in the presence of outliers - that is, observations that do not come from the same distribution as the rest of the data. It is known that in this setting, standard approaches for unsupervised learning can yield unsatisfactory results. For instance, in the presence of severe outliers, K-means clustering will often assign each outlier to its own cluster, or alternatively may yield distorted clusters in order to accommodate the outliers. In this paper, we take a new approach to extending existing unsupervised learning techniques to accommodate outliers. Our approach is an extension of a recent proposal for outlier detection in the regression setting. We allow each observation to take on an "error" term, and we penalize the errors using a group lasso penalty in order to encourage most of the observations' errors to exactly equal zero. We show that this approach can be used in order to develop extensions of K-means clustering and principal components analysis that result in accurate outlier detection, as well as improved performance in the presence of outliers. These methods are illustrated in a simulation study and on two gene expression data sets, and connections with M-estimation are explored.

When applying an iterative processing over methods such as the k-means algorithm or the related k-medoids approach to determine the optimum k, the computational effort can be higher than solving the original problem instance directly. This is particularly the case if the optimum k is small, which happens most likely in urban environments where the user density and the number of cells are high. In this paper, we propose a graph-based method using minimum cut operations to partition a planning instance automatically into an appropriate number of k sub-problems. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach by numerical evaluation of exemplary application to the problem of planning LTE cell site locations in an urban environment.

These characteristics make the cloud a good fit for hosting e-commerce web sites. Cloud providers deploy their cloud in their data centers. However, cloud providers usually have a limited number of data center locations around the world. Thus, e-commerce web sites in the cloud may be far away from their customers. Long client-perceived response latency may cause e-commerce web sites to lose business. To solve this problem, we propose a virtual proxy solution to reduce the response latency of the e-commerce site in the cloud. In our approach, a virtual proxy platform is designed to cache applications and data of e-commerce sites. A k-means based table partitioning algorithm is designed to select frequently used data from the database in the cloud. We have used an industrial e-commerce benchmark TPC-W to evaluate the performance of our approach. The experimental results show that our approach can significantly reduce the client-perceived response time.

Our algorithm applies to both a printer model and a model for the human visual system (HVS). The method strives to minimize the perceived error between the continuous original image and the halftone image. First, the gray image is partitioned into two, three and four regions using K-means image segmentation method, whose performance depends on the selection of distance metrics. Next, the statistics of average gray value of each clustering is calculated. Each clustering uses the least-squares model-based(Lsmb) algorithm to obtain halftone image. Finally, analysis and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm produces better gray-scale halftone image quality when we increase the number of clustering with a certain range. A performance measure for halftone images is used to evaluate our algorithm. The value of MSEv, WSNR and PSNR for two partitions is almost the same as that of the Lsmb algorithm, but for three and four partitions that the proposed algorithm achieves consistently better values of MSEv, WSNR and PSNR than the Lsmb algorithm.

Thus, many methods have been proposed and applied to quantify sensory attributes of food products. In this paper we proposed a methodology, using Kohonen's Self-Organizing Maps and K-means algorithm, to classify food samples through the responses, provided by human evaluators, for their attributes such as aroma, flavor, appearance and texture. Conducted experiments in sensory analysis to determine the acceptance of new gelatins produced from chicken feet and new wines produced from spares of Acai and Caja. confirm that proposed methodology is suitable for the investigated purpose.

The performance of sample clustering is concerned in the OC-SVM with multi-sphere. In previous work, the K-means was mainly used to create such multi-sphere by clustering. But the traditional K-means depends on initial clustering centers and ended local minimum value. So, to improve the clustering performance of K-means, the SA is employed into the scheme, which can create more reasonable multi-sphere by finding global optimum solutions in the clustering process. Simulation results with the chosen feature set and well-known steganographic techniques indicated that our approach was able to afford reasonable accuracy to distinguish between covers and stego images.			haibinyang@163.com; duntaoguo@163.com; peng.luo0208@gmail.com					Avcibas I, 2001, P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS, V4314, P523, DOI 10.1117/12.435436; Celik M., 2009, P SPIE ELECT IMAGING, V5306, P467; Farid H., 2002, LECT NOTES COMPUTER, V2578, P340; Harmsen J.

These phenomena are studied using data clustering models continuously obtained throughout the endless data gathering process, whose set of dynamical properties, i.e., behavior, evolves over time. In order to cope with data streams characteristics, researchers have developed clustering techniques with low time-complexity requirements. However, pre-defined and static parameters (thresholds, number of clusters and learning rates) commonly found in current techniques still limit the application of clustering to data streams. These limitations to adapt clustering process to behavior changes motivated this paper to propose an on-line and adaptive approach to detect changes and modify parameters. The proposed approach is based on the traditional k-means algorithm to update cluster prototypes and the statistical model of Markov chains to represent behavior. Behavior changes are detected by testing the isomorphism of Markov chains over time under the grounds of Dynamical Systems Theory. The results have confirmed the advantages of the approach when compared with current techniques.

J	Covoes, TF; Hruschka, ER; Ghosh, J				Covoes, Thiago F.; Hruschka, Eduardo R.; Ghosh, Joydeep			A study of K-Means-based algorithms for constrained clustering	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Constrained clustering; K-means; semi-supervised clustering	SETS	The problem of clustering with constraints has received considerable attention in the last decade. Indeed, several algorithms have been proposed, but only a few studies have (partially) compared their performances. In this work, three well-known algorithms for k-means-based clustering with soft constraints - Constrained Vector Quantization Error (CVQE), its variant named LCVQE, and the Metric Pairwise Constrained K-Means (MPCK-Means) - are systematically compared according to three criteria: Adjusted Rand Index, Normalized Mutual Information, and the number of violated constraints. Experiments were performed on 20 datasets, and for each of them 800 sets of constraints were generated. In order to provide some reassurance about the non-randomness of the obtained results, outcomes of statistical tests of significance are presented. In terms of accuracy, LCVQE has shown to be competitive with CVQE, while violating less constraints. In most of the datasets, both CVQE and LCVQE presented better accuracy compared to MPCK-Means, which is capable of learning distance metrics. In this sense, it was also observed that learning a particular distance metric for each cluster does not necessarily lead to better results than learning a single metric for all clusters. The robustness of the algorithms with respect to noisy constraints was also analyzed. From this perspective, the most interesting conclusion is that CVQE has shown better performance than LCVQE in most of the experiments. The computational complexities of the algorithms are also presented. Finally, a variety of (more specific) new experimental findings are discussed in the paper - e.g., deduced constraints usually do not help finding better data partitions.

The findings are based on the analysis of 30527 incidents of anti-social behavior along 17 types of crime, 14 types of land uses and their permutations, and 676 streets. Thus, the paper steps well beyond the frameworks, typical to the related previous research, and contributes to the reduction of the gap between theoretical insights and empirical evidence. The data became subject to k-means cluster analysis, descriptive statistical analysis and qualitative comparative analysis. Ad finem, the findings reveal significant patterns, which had long been shaded before, and recommendations are provided, thus enlivening innovative urban planning and the emergence of smart cities.

We examine whether the soil profile descriptions collected merely by field methods fit into the statistical DSM tools and if they provide pedologically meaningful results for an erosion-affected area. Soil texture, colour, carbonates, stoniness and genetic qualifiers were estimated for a total of 111 soil profiles using conventional field methods. The data were digitized along semi-quantitative scales in 10-cm depth intervals to express the relative differences, and afterwards classified by the FKM method into four classes A-D: (i) Luvic Phaeozems (Anthric), Haplic Phaeozems (Anthric, Calcaric, Pachic), Calcic Cutanic Luvisols, and (iv) Haplic Regosols (Calcaric). To parameterize regression-kriging, membership values (MVs) to the above A-D class centroids were regressed against PCA-transformed terrain variables using the multiple linear regression method (MLR). MLR yielded significant relationships with R-2 ranging from 23% to 47% (P < 0.001) for classes A, B and D, but only marginally significant for Luvisols of class C (R-2 = 14%, P < 0.05). Given the results, Luvisols were then mapped by ordinary kriging and the rest by regression-kriging. A "leave-one-out" cross-validation was calculated for the output maps yielding R-2 of 33%, 56%, 22% and 42% for Luvic Phaeozems, Haplic Phaeozems, Luvisols and also Regosols, respectively (all P < 0.001). Additionally, the pixel-mixture visualization technique was used to draw a synthetic digital soil map. We conclude that the DSM model represents a fully formalized alternative to classical soil mapping at very fine scales, even when soil profile descriptions were collected merely by field estimation methods. Additionally to conventional soil maps it allows to address the diffuse character in soil cover, both in taxonomic and geographical interpretations.

We propose a hierarchical solution for real-time billboard trademark recognition in various sports video, billboard frames are detected in the first level, fuzzy decision tree with easily-computing features are employed to accelerate the process, while in the second level, color and regional SIFT features are combined for the first time to describe the appearance of trademarks, and the shared nearest neighbor (SNN) clustering with x(2) distance is utilized instead of traditional K-means clustering to construct the SIFT vocabulary, at last, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) based SIFT vocabulary matching is performed on the template trademark and the candidate regions in billboard frame. The preliminary experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the hierarchical solution, and real time constraints are also met by our solution.

Assessment of shallow subsurface characterisation with non-invasive geophysical methods at the intermediate hill-slope scale	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							SOIL-WATER CONTENT; ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION SURVEYS; ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE; WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; LANDSLIDE; PATTERNS; TOMOGRAMS; ZONATION; MODELS	Hill-slopes of several hectares in size represent a difficult scale for subsurface characterisation, as these landscape units are well beyond the scope of traditional point-scale techniques. By means of electromagnetic induction (EMI) and gamma-ray spectroscopy, spatially distributed soil proxy data were collected from a heterogeneous hill-slope site. Results of EMI mapping using the EM38DD showed that soil electrical conductivity (ECa) is highly variable at both temporal and spatial scales. Calibration of the integral ECa signal to a specific target like soil moisture is hampered by the ambiguous response of EMI to the clay-rich hill-slope underground. Gamma-ray results were obtained during a single survey, along with EMI measurements and selected soil sampling. In contrast to ECa, a noticeable correlation between Total Count and K emission data and soil-water content seemed to be present. Relevant proxy variables from both methods were used for k means clustering in order to distinguish between hill-slope areas with different soil conditions. As a result, we obtained a suitable partition of hill-slope that was comparable with a previously obtained zonation model based on ecological factors.

J	Nassif, LFD; Hruschka, ER				da Cruz Nassif, Luis Filipe; Hruschka, Eduardo Raul			Document Clustering for Forensic Analysis: An Approach for Improving Computer Inspection	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY			English	Article						Clustering; forensic computing; text mining	ALGORITHMS; DATASETS	In computer forensic analysis, hundreds of thousands of files are usually examined. Much of the data in those files consists of unstructured text, whose analysis by computer examiners is difficult to be performed. In this context, automated methods of analysis are of great interest. In particular, algorithms for clustering documents can facilitate the discovery of new and useful knowledge from the documents under analysis. We present an approach that applies document clustering algorithms to forensic analysis of computers seized in police investigations. We illustrate the proposed approach by carrying out extensive experimentation with six well-known clustering algorithms (K-means, K-medoids, Single Link, Complete Link, Average Link, and CSPA) applied to five real-world datasets obtained from computers seized in real-world investigations. Experiments have been performed with different combinations of parameters, resulting in 16 different instantiations of algorithms. In addition, two relative validity indexes were used to automatically estimate the number of clusters. Related studies in the literature are significantly more limited than our study. Our experiments show that the Average Link and Complete Link algorithms provide the best results for our application domain. If suitably initialized, partitional algorithms (K-means and K-medoids) can also yield to very good results. Finally, we also present and discuss several practical results that can be useful for researchers and practitioners of forensic computing.

However, the existing text clustering approaches require that each document has to be partitioned to one and only one cluster. This is not reasonable in some cases for there exist some documents which should not used to constitute topics. This paper firstly models a text document set as a network and designs a method for decomposing such a network, and then proposes a truly original text clustering algorithm for topic detection, called a network decomposition-based text clustering algorithm for topic detection (NDTCATD). The proposed algorithm ensures that meaningless documents can not be used to constitute topics. Experimental results show that NDTCATD is much better than bisecting k-means algorithm in terms of overall similarity and average cluster similarity. Therefore the proposed algorithm is reasonable and effective and is especially suitable for topic detection.

Two biometric characteristics are considered in this study: iris and fingerprint. Multimodal biometric system needs an effective fusion scheme to combine biometric characteristics derived from one or more modalities. The score level fusion is used to combine the characteristics from different biometric modalities. Fusion at the score level is a new technique, which has a high potential for efficient consolidation of multiple unimodal biometric matcher outputs. Support vector machine and extreme learning techniques are used in this system for recognition of biometric traits. In this, the Fingerprint-Iris system provides better performance and comparison of support vector machine and extreme learning machine based on score-level fusion methods is obtained In score-level fusion, ELM provides better performance as compare to the SVM It reduces the classification time of current system. This work is valuable and makes an efficient accuracy in such applications. This system can be utilized for person identification in several applications.

Variation in retinal blood vessel thickness, secretion of Exudates which is a protein leakage in the retina, Hemorrhages are some of the symptoms of Diabetic Retinopathy. It is a kind of disorder which occurs due to high blood sugar level. Since Optic Disk appears as a bright spot in the retinal image, which resembles exudates, it has to be removed from the image. Hence detection of Optic Disk is an essential parameter in retinal analysis. In this paper, an automatic and efficient method to detect Optic Disk and exudates are proposed The real time retinal images are obtained from various eye hospitals. The retinal images are pre-processed using the technique of LAB color space image. The preprocessed color retinal images are segmented using Line operator and Fuzzy C Means Clustering technique in order to detect Optic Disk The outputs are compared and the best method is determined The exudates are extracted using K-means clustering and finally the classification is done using SVM.

Improvement of Traditional K-means Algorithm through the Regulation of Distance Metric Parameters	7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND CONTROL (ISCO 2013)			English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control (ISCO)	JAN 04-05, 2013	Coimbatore, INDIA	Karpagam Coll Engn, Univ Sains Malaysia (USM), IEEE Madras Sect, Govt India, Minist New & Renewable Energy (MNRE), Minist Def, Dept Def Res & Dev Org (DRDO), Comp Soc India (CSI), IEEE		Data Mining; k-Means; Canberra; Chebyshev; Gene Expression Data; Kernel; Manhattan; Supremum		This paper discusses in detail the behavior of the basic k-means algorithm with four more new algorithms with varied distance measures on gene expression data. In data mining, k-means clustering is a method which aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. The traditional k-means is one of the most popular clustering methods for analyzing gene expression data. However, it suffers from major shortcomings. It is sensitive to initial partitions and it is only applicable to data with spherical-shape clusters. The results of the present study show that the performances of the new algorithms are extremely well when compared to the traditional k-means and also emphasizes that through the regulation of distance metric parameters, one can achieve better clustering effects then the traditional k-means, and has an advantage in sensitivity, specificity and run time. Finally it is found that Canberra k-means performs extremely well.	[Srimani, P.

This algorithm is based on the dynamic fuzzy clustering method (DFCM). The algorithm has a number of advantages compared to the traditional method based on k-means. For example, it does not need to know the number of the hidden nodes and to predicts more accurately. Due to these advantages, this method proves to be suitable for developing models for complex nonlinear systems.

To solve these problems, a new method based on the interactive visualization technology was proposed in this paper. First, the entropy-weight was adopted to determine the main attributes and how to arrange them. Every data was described in an improved radar chart in which polar radius stood by attribute values and polar angles stood by the attribute weights. Then the points in the radar chart were clustered through applying an improved k-means algorithm. The number of clusters was not given before. And initial centers were optimized according to the point density and their distance. Finally, the experiment showed that the improved radar chart reflected the distribution of the data better and that the improved k-means algorithm was more efficient and accuracy.

It has obtained satisfactory results. But it need to determine the initial cluster class center before executing the k-means algorithm, and the choice of the initial cluster class center has a direct impact on the final clustering results. A selection algorithm is proposed, which based on figure node most magnanimous to determine the initial cluster class center of K-means clustering algorithm.

Quantitative measurements of these attributes could thus provide useful tool for diagnosing the severity of several diseases. However, it is still unclear how best to represent the attribute values of multiple vessels in a single image. Graphical user interface (GUI) is a promising step towards the development of a semi-automated computer assisted tool. The objective of this study is to develop a GUI for effective observation and robust retinal blood vessels analysis by ophthalmologists and to comprehend the distribution of vessels attributes. Blood vessels from 45 digital fundus images of infant retina are extracted, its centerline is delineated and tortuosity is analyzed from different putative and proposed techniques to provide reliable and comprehensive information for the retinal vasculature. K means clustering technique is used for classification analysis of different tortuosity metrics and its performance is evaluated based on sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The results are validated by comparing with expert ophthalmologists' ground truths. Among the various proposed tortuosity metrics, one of our tortuosity indexes attains the highest classification accuracy of 91.42% with sensitivity and specificity of 86.36% and 97.82% respectively.

Enterprises can retain valuable customers by the correct prediction of valuable customers. In the literature, many data mining and machine learning techniques have been applied to develop CLV models. Specifically, hybrid techniques have shown their superiorities over single techniques. However, it is unknown which hybrid model can perform the best in customer value prediction. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to compares two types of commonly-used hybrid models by classification + classification and clustering + classification hybrid approaches, respectively, in terms of customer value prediction. Design/methodology/approach - To construct a hybrid model, multiple techniques are usually combined in a two-stage manner, in which the first stage is based on either clustering or classification techniques, which can be used to pre-process the data. Then, the output of the first stage (i.e. the processed data) is used to construct the second stage classifier as the prediction model. Specifically, decision trees, logistic regression, and neural networks are used as the classification techniques and k-means and self-organizing maps for the clustering techniques to construct six different hybrid models. Findings - The experimental results over a real case dataset show that the classification + classification hybrid approach performs the best. In particular, combining two-stage of decision trees provides the highest rate of accuracy (99.73 percent) and lowest rate of Type errors (0.22 percent/0.43 percent). Originality/value - The contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that hybrid machine learning techniques perform better than single ones.

A clustering analysis of eddies' spatial distribution in the South China Sea	OCEAN SCIENCE			English	Article							UPPER-LAYER CIRCULATION; MESOSCALE EDDIES; TOPEX/POSEIDON ALTIMETRY; VARIABILITY; KUROSHIO; WINTER	Spatial variation is important for studying the mesoscale eddies in the South China Sea (SCS). To investigate such spatial variations, this study made a clustering analysis on eddies' distribution using the K-means approach. Results showed that clustering tendency of anticyclonic eddies (AEs) and cyclonic eddies (CEs) were weak but not random, and the number of clusters were proved greater than four. Finer clustering results showed 10 regions where AEs densely populated and 6 regions for CEs in the SCS. Previous studies confirmed these partitions and possible generation mechanisms were related. Comparisons between AEs and CEs revealed that patterns of AE are relatively more aggregated than those of CE, and specific distinctions were summarized: (1) to the southwest of Luzon Island, AEs and CEs are generated spatially apart; AEs are likely located north of 14 degrees N and closer to shore, while CEs are to the south and further offshore. (2) The central SCS and Nansha Trough are mostly dominated by AEs. (3) Along 112 degrees E, clusters of AEs and CEs are located sequentially apart, and the pairs off Vietnam represent the dipole structures. (4) To the southwest of the Dongsha Islands, AEs are concentrated to the east of CEs. Overlaps of AEs and CEs in the northeastern and southern SCS were further examined considering seasonal variations. The northeastern overlap represented near-concentric distributions while the southern one was a mixed effect of seasonal variations, complex circulations and topography influences.

This paper presents study of Chroma-key method and proposes a hardware architecture for Chroma-key effect in real-time. Based on K-means algorithm, we propose an improved method namely Coarse and Fine Filter, which is more robust on segmentation and more appropriate for hardware design thanks to usage of small buffer. A VLSI architecture for the proposed method is implemented on the Altera DE2 FPGA board. Experimental results show that the proposed design can perform Chroma-key effect with pleasing quality in real-time.

The proposed algorithm works by determining those time series whose class labels are vague and further partitions them into different clusters over time. The main advantage of this approach compared with other existing algorithms is that the property of some time series belonging to different clusters over time can be partially revealed. Results from simulation-based experiments on geographical data demonstrate the excellent performance and the desired results have been obtained. The proposed algorithm can be applied to solve other clustering problems in data mining.

This diagnostic system consists of signal processing, feature extraction, and the IEMMC algorithm for clustering of ECG arrhythmias. First, raw ECG signal is processed by an adaptive ECG filter based on wavelet transforms, and waveform of the ECG signal is detected; then, features are extracted from ECG signal to cluster different types of arrhythmias by the IEMMC algorithm. Three types of performance evaluation indicators are used to assess the effect of the IEMMC method for ECG arrhythmias, such as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Compared with K-means and iterSVR algorithms, the IEMMC algorithm reflects better performance not only in clustering result but also in terms of global search ability and convergence ability, which proves its effectiveness for the detection of ECG arrhythmias.

ECOCLIMAP-II/Europe: a twofold database of ecosystems and surface parameters at 1 km resolution based on satellite information for use in land surface, meteorological and climate models	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							GLOBAL VEGETATION MODEL; COVER CLASSIFICATION; AVHRR DATA; PRODUCTS; MODIS; HETEROGENEITY; IMPROVEMENT; VALIDATION; ALGORITHM; AFRICA	The overall objective of the present study is to introduce the new ECOCLIMAP-II database for Europe, which is an upgrade for this region of the former initiative, ECOCLIMAP-I, already implemented at global scale. The ECOCLIMAP programme is a dual database at 1 km resolution that includes an ecosystem classification and a coherent set of land surface parameters that are primarily mandatory in meteorological modelling (notably leaf area index and albedo). Hence, the aim of this innovative physiography is to enhance the quality of initialisation and impose some surface attributes within the scope of weather forecasting and climate related studies. The strategy for implementing ECOCLIMAP-II is to depart from prevalent land cover products such as CLC2000 (Corine Land Cover) and GLC2000 (Global Land Cover) by splitting existing classes into new classes that possess a better regional character by virtue of the climatic environment (latitude, proximity to the sea, topography). The leaf area index (LAI) from MODIS and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from SPOT/Vegetation (a global monitoring system of vegetation) yield the two proxy variables that were considered here in order to perform a multi-year trimmed analysis between 1999 and 2005 using the K-means method. Further, meteorological applications require each land cover type to appear as a partition of fractions of 4 main surface types or tiles (nature, water bodies, sea, urban areas) and, inside the nature tile, fractions of 12 plant functional types (PFTs) representing generic vegetation types - principally broadleaf forest, needleleaf forest, C3 and C4 crops, grassland and bare land - as incorporated by the SVAT model ISBA (Interactions Surface Biosphere Atmosphere) developed at Meteo France. This landscape division also forms the cornerstone of a validation exercise. The new ECOCLIMAP-II can be verified with auxiliary land cover products at very fine and coarse resolutions by means of versatile land occupation nomenclatures.	[Faroux, S.; Tchuente, A. T.

J	Zaccardi, JM; Le Berr, F				Zaccardi, Jean-Marc; Le Berr, Fabrice			Analysis and choice of representative drive cycles for light duty vehicles - case study for electric vehicles	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART D-JOURNAL OF AUTOMOBILE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Real world drive cycles; electric vehicle; correlation analysis; clustering	HONG-KONG	Since the homologation drive cycles are not all entirely representative of real everyday driving conditions, additional cycles must be used to properly quantify the energy consumption of electric vehicles. Three methodologies have been developed to objectively determine a limited number of additional drive cycles. The first methodology is based upon a simple comparison of velocity profiles expressed on the same time scale. The second is based on a correlation analysis of various statistical criteria defined for each cycle. Finally, the third methodology is based on an automatic clustering technique (K-means algorithm). These three methodologies have been used to analyse 18 drive cycles including official homologation cycles used in Europe (NEDC), Japan (JC08) and in the US (FTP72), and transient non-official cycles representing real world driving patterns (Artemis, Hyzem and Eurev cycles). When applied to these cycles, all these approaches allow the identification of a reduced number of five representative cycles enabling an efficient characterization in terms of the performance of electric vehicles in urban, extra-urban and highway conditions.

A comparison of Raman, FTIR and ATR-FTIR micro spectroscopy for imaging human skin tissue sections	ANALYTICAL METHODS			English	Article							HIGH-SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; IN-VITRO; INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY; OPTICAL DIAGNOSIS; CANCER-DIAGNOSIS; STRATUM-CORNEUM; MIE SCATTERING; CELL CARCINOMA; LIVING CELLS; MICROSPECTROSCOPY	Raman and infrared absorption spectroscopies are compared for the analysis of human hand skin tissue sections. The tissue sections have been formalin fixed and paraffin processed, and subsequently dewaxed. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra are preprocessed using the resonant Mie-extended multiplicative scattering algorithm to remove spectral artefacts. FTIR images of resolution 4 cm(-1), analysed using K-means cluster analysis, reveal the double layer structure of the dermis and epidermis, but no further layer differentiation is achieved using the higher spatial resolution of the Attenuated Total Reflection imaging or improved spectral resolution of 2 cm(-1). At comparable spectral and spatial resolutions and measurement on the same samples, Raman scattering produces spectra of significantly higher spectral detail and can differentiate the stratum corneum from the underlying epithelial layer, and, in the absence of melanin in an artificial skin model, can further differentiate the basal layer from the overlying epithelium. The differences in the performance of the techniques are therefore not instrumentational and are discussed in terms of the technological and fundamental differences between the two complementary techniques.

J	Wang, PP; Shi, LP; Zhang, Y; Han, L				Wang Panpan; Shi Liping; Zhang Yong; Han Li			A Hybrid Simplex Search and Modified Bare-bones Particle Swarm Optimization	CHINESE JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Bare-bones particle swarm optimization; Nelder-Mead simplex method; Inactive particle; K-means clustering		In order to enhance global convergence capability of particle swarm optimization, this paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm, called SM-MBBPSO, based on the Nelder-Mead Simplex method (SM) and a Modified bare-bones particle swarm optimization (MBBPSO). In this algorithm, a new strategy based on K-means clustering is proposed to combine the powerful global search capability of MBBPSO and the high accurate local search capability of SM. This makes the proposed algorithm achieve a nice balance between exploitation and exploration capability. Meanwhile, an adaptive reinitialization strategy on inactive particles is proposed to help the swarm get away from local optimal positions. Finally, simulation results on benchmark functions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Bitter Taste Perception and Dietary Intake Patterns in Irish Children	JOURNAL OF NUTRIGENETICS AND NUTRIGENOMICS			English	Article						TAS2R38; PROP taster status; Dietary patterns; Food intake	GENETIC SENSITIVITY; FOOD PREFERENCES; ENERGY-INTAKE; VEGETABLE INTAKE; 6-N-PROPYLTHIOURACIL PROP; FAT PERCEPTION; 24-HOUR RECALL; ORAL SENSATION; YOUNG-CHILDREN; RECEPTOR GENE	Background/Aims: Variations in bitter receptor gene TAS2R38 affect the perception of bitter-tasting compound 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP). The perception of PROP has been associated, in some reports, with the perception of fat and sweet tastes, and various food preferences and intakes. The aim was to investigate nutrient intakes and food patterns in a group of Irish children, using K-means cluster analysis, and compare these with TAS2R38 genotype and PROP taster status. Methods: Dietary intake was measured via a 3-day diet history in 483 children aged 7-13 years. Children were genotyped for TAS2R38 variation, and PROP taster status was assessed. Anthropometric and socioeconomic data were also obtained. Results: No differences were observed in macronutrient, micronutrient, or food group consumption between the TAS2R38 genotype and PROP taster groups. K-means cluster analysis identified two distinct dietary patterns, termed 'more healthful' and 'less healthful' clusters. The clusters did not differ in frequencies of TAS2R38 genotype nor PROP taster status groups, suggesting that dietary patterns are not influenced by bitter taste perception. Conclusion: Bitterness perception, as measured by either TAS2R38 genotype or PROP taster status, does not appear to exert a significant effect on patterns of dietary intakes. Copyright (c) 2013 S.

To characterize the spatial geostatistical methods were used. Proven spatial dependence was prepared thematic maps through kriging. For delineation of management zones based on maps of variability was interpolated using the Fuzzy K-means algorithm and to define the optimal number of classes was determined Fuzzy performance index and entropy of the partition changed. The variables used for defining management zones were altitude, the electrical conductivity at 20 cm and 40 cm depth and organic matter. From these seven variables were generated maps of management zones, and later by the Kappa test was analyzed the correlation between the maps generated by the management zones and maps of the physical and chemical properties of soil. As a result there was an optimum number of classes equal to two, with the attributes related to soil texture management zone maps from organic matter or electrical conductivity and the chemical zone management from maps of organic matter or organic matter and altitude showed better results in their classification. The management zones defined from the electrical conductivity at 20 cm allowed us to detect significant differences between the average yield of soybean.

As the fast food industry is not an exception and has a competitive environment, analyzing customers' behavior helps bridge this gap. Data mining techniques help to segment customers as well as to drive improved customer relationship management. This paper seeks to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This study proposes a new model based on RFM model for defining customers' value as well as using K-means algorithm to segment restaurants' customers. In addition, the authors combine a new category in the account portfolio analysis in order to analyze the behavior of each cluster. Findings - A real dataset of an Iranian fast food restaurant chain is employed to show the procedure of the authors' model. The customers are segmented into four clusters. The clusters are analyzed and named based on categories in the account portfolio analysis. The result of this analysis shows that there is no significant difference between the behavior of the most valuable customer and customers who have left the restaurant. Therefore, restaurant managers should seek other reasons for detecting churn behavior. Originality/value - This paper helps managers in the fast food industry to readily analyze their customer behavior in order to understand their needs and establish strong relationships.

SQL based cardiovascular ultrasound image classification	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DATA MINING AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						echocardiographic image; Naive-Bayesian; K-means; OLAP-SQL; active contour	SEGMENTATION	This paper proposes a novel method to analyze and classify the cardiovascular ultrasound echocardiographic images using Naive-Bayesian model via database OLAP-SQL. Efficient data mining algorithms based on tightly-coupled model is used to extract features. Three algorithms are proposed for classification namely Naive-Bayesian Classifier for Discrete variables (NBCD) with SQL, NBCD with OLAP-SQL, and Naive-Bayesian Classifier for Continuous variables (NBCC) using OLAP-SQL. The proposed model is trained with 207 patient images containing normal and abnormal categories. Out of the three proposed algorithms, a high classification accuracy of 96.59% was achieved from NBCC which is better than the earlier methods.	[Nandagopalan, S.; Sudarshan, T. S.

Cardiovascular ischaemic diseases are one of the main causes of death all over the world. In this class of pathologies, a quick diagnosis is essential for a good prognosis in reperfusive treatment. In particular, an automatic classification procedure based on statistical analysis of teletransmitted electrocardiograph (ECG') traces would be very helpful for an early diagnosis. This work presents an analysis of ECG traces, either physiological or pathological, of patients whose 12-lead prehospital ECG has been sent to the 118 Dispatch Center in Milan by life-support personnel. The statistical analysis starts with a preprocessing step, where functional data are reconstructed from noisy observations and biological variability is removed by a non-linear registration procedure. Then, a multivariate functional k-means clustering procedure is carried out on reconstructed and registered ECGs and their first derivatives. Hence, a new semi-automatic diagnostic procedure, based solely on the ECG morphology, is proposed to classify ECG traces; finally, the performance of this classification method is evaluated.

A tri-stage cluster identification model for accurate analysis of seismic catalogs	NONLINEAR PROCESSES IN GEOPHYSICS			English	Article							EARTHQUAKE CATALOGS; COMPLETENESS; DEFORMATION; AFTERSHOCKS; CALIFORNIA; MAGNITUDE; RELEASE; SPACE	In this paper we propose a tri-stage cluster identification model that is a combination of a simple single iteration distance algorithm and an iterative K-means algorithm. In this study of earthquake seismicity, the model considers event location, time and magnitude information from earthquake catalog data to efficiently classify events as either background or mainshock and aftershock sequences. Tests on a synthetic seismicity catalog demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model in terms of accuracy percentage (94.81% for background and 89.46% for aftershocks). The close agreement between lambda and cumulative plots for the ideal synthetic catalog and that generated by the proposed model also supports the accuracy of the proposed technique. There is flexibility in the model design to allow for proper selection of location and magnitude ranges, depending upon the nature of the mainshocks present in the catalog. The effectiveness of the proposed model also is evaluated by the classification of events in three historic catalogs: California, Japan and Indonesia. As expected, for both synthetic and historic catalog analysis it is observed that the density of events classified as background is almost uniform throughout the region, whereas the density of aftershock events are higher near the mainshocks.

Organic particle types by single-particle measurements using a time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer coupled with a light scattering module	ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES			English	Article							HIGH-RESOLUTION; IDENTIFICATION; INSTRUMENT; COOKING; AMBIENT; SIZE; QUANTIFICATION; SPECTROSCOPY; PERFORMANCE; COMPONENTS	Chemical and physical properties of individual ambient aerosol particles can vary greatly, so measuring the chemical composition at the single-particle level is essential for understanding atmospheric sources and transformations. Here we describe 46 days of single-particle measurements of atmospheric particles using a time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer coupled with a light scattering module (LS-ToF-AMS). The light scattering module optically detects particles larger than 180 nm vacuum aerodynamic diameter (130 nm geometric diameter) before they arrive at the chemical mass spectrometer and then triggers the saving of single-particle mass spectra. 271 641 particles were detected and sampled during 237 h of sampling in single-particle mode. By comparing timing of the predicted chemical ion signals from the light scattering measurement with the measured chemical ion signals by the mass spectrometer for each particle, particle types were classified and their number fractions determined as follows: prompt vaporization (46 %), delayed vaporization (6 %), and null (48 %), where null was operationally defined as less than 6 ions per particle. Prompt and delayed vaporization particles with sufficient chemical information (i.e., more than 40 ions per particle) were clustered based on similarity of organic mass spectra (using k-means algorithm) to result in three major clusters: highly oxidized particles (dominated by m/z 44), relatively less oxidized particles (dominated by m/z 43), and particles associated with fresh urban emissions. Each of the three organic clusters had limited chemical properties of other clusters, suggesting that all of the sampled organic particle types were internally mixed to some degree; however, the internal mixing was never uniform and distinct particle types existed throughout the study. Furthermore, the single-particle mass spectra and time series of these clusters agreed well with mass-based components identified (using factor analysis) from simultaneous ensemble-averaged measurements, supporting the connection between ensemble-based factors and atmospheric particle sources and processes. Measurements in this study illustrate that LS-ToF-AMS provides unique information about organic particle types by number as well as mass.	[Liu, S.; Russell, L.

J	Yu, P; Lee, JH				Yu, Peng; Lee, Jang Hee			Optimal technology selection considering input levels of resource	INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS			English	Article						Product technology; Production planning and control; Technology selection; Data envelopment analysis-assurance region; Analytic hierarchy process rating method; K-means clustering; Input levels of resource	DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; ANALYTIC HIERARCHY; PERFORMANCE; MODEL; EFFICIENCY; EVALUATE; DEA/AHP; TAIWAN	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose an optimal technology selection (OTS) method considering technology alternatives' required input levels of resource, to help companies select an optimal technology. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed method clustered technology alternatives according to their required input levels of resource. After that, in each cluster, the proposed method used data envelopment analysis-assurance region (DEA-AR) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) rating method to evaluate the efficiencies and priorities of the technology alternatives, respectively. Finally, combined scores of the technology alternatives were calculated. A company can choose a proper technology cluster, and then select the technology alternative with the highest combined score within the selected cluster as the optimal technology. Findings - The results showed that the OTS method cannot only select suitable technology which accords with a company's actual input capabilities, but also provide a more accurate selection result. Originality/value - Traditionally, technologies are evaluated without considering the technologies' required input levels, and simply ranked for selection. However, there are differences between a company's actual resource levels and a selected technology's required input levels of resource. This study proposes an integrated method to evaluate technology systematically and provides a more reasonable selection process for selecting optimal technology.

The use on wavelet-based similarity measures, since wavelets are well suited for identifying highly discriminant local time and scale features. The multiresolution aspect of the wavelet transform provides a time-scale decomposition of the signals allowing to visualize and to cluster the functional data into homogeneous groups. For each input function, through its empirical orthogonal wavelet transform the first strategy uses the distribution of energy across scales to generate a representation that can be sufficient to make the signals well distinguishable. Our new similarity measure combined with an efficient feature selection technique in the wavelet domain is then used within more or less classical clustering algorithms to effectively differentiate among high-dimensional populations. The second strategy uses a similarity measure between the whole time-scale representations that is based on wavelet-coherence tools. The clustering is then performed using a k-centroid algorithm starting from these similarities. Practical performance is illustrated through simulations as well as daily profiles of the French electricity power demand.

It also uses all ensembles to get covariance matrix, even though they have different permeability field each other, resulting in filter divergence. The proposed method suggests the concept of clustered covariance by grouping initial ensembles using a distance-based method. Hausdorff distance is used for calculating similarity between permeability fields and they are separated by k-means clustering. When EnKF is applied to a 2D channel field, it shows overshooting problem and mismatches the true production data. The proposed method gives better history matching and future performance prediction without overshooting problems. Furthermore, it shows stable results for sensitivity analyses over the number of total ensembles. The more accurate covariance is calculated by clustering, the better results are obtained.

The system is a comprehensive of four stages: In the first stage, combination of wavelet transforms and Gabor filter is applied to extract sharpened edges and textural features of a given input image. In the second stage, the resultant Gabor output image is grouped into three clusters to classify the background, foreground and the true text pixels using K-means clustering algorithm. In the third stage of the system, morphological operations are performed to obtain connected components, then after a concept of linked list approach is in turn used to build a true text line sequence. In the final stage, wavelet entropy is imposed on an each connected component sequence, in order to determine the true text region of an input image. Experiments are conducted on 101 video images and on standard ICDAR 2003 database. The proposed method is evaluated by testing the 101 video images as well with the ICDAR 2003 database. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to detect a text of different size, complex background and contrast. Withal, the system performance outreaches the existing method in terms of detection accuracy.	[Aradhya, V. N.

J	Karadag, AA				Karadag, Aybike Ayfer			The effects of shopping malls on using urban parks: The case of Ankara, Turkey	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Shopping mall; urban park; recreation; motivation; Ankara	PREFERENCES	Urban parks and shopping malls are some of the important recreation sources of our present cities. Dense rush-hours of cities and time varying life styles affect the recreation need, choices and recreation source usage of urban people. In this study, the effects of shopping malls, which have become important part of the present urban life, on using urban parks were examined. During the process of determining the mentioned effect, 25 motivation items that direct the recreational preferences were questioned. The items were evaluated in the processes of "preference of urban parks and shopping malls'' and "choice between an urban park and a shopping mall". The study was carried out with the users of Ankamall, Cepa, Kent Park and Armada shopping malls in Ankara, Turkey. Within the scope of the study, questionnaire forms were used to gain data. The questionnaire was conducted to 492 participants with the techniques of random choice and face-to-face interview between May 2011-May 2012 on Saturdays and Sundays, when user density was high. The data was analysed with descriptive statistics, K-means cluster analysis and paired sample t-test. The results of the analysis showed that 25 motivation items had different levels of effect on the preference of urban parks and shopping malls. However, 15 motivation items were detected in the choice between urban parks and shopping malls. Among these criteria, bringing "easy transportation, cultural contributions, food-drink facility, accessible places and ergonomic outfits", which direct the users to the shopping malls, in the urban parks will be effective on attracting the users to the urban park. Along with that, user satisfaction and preference will be increased in urban park choice by developing some motivation items of different effect levels.

The basic assumption of classification is that the objects that are spatially close in data space tend to have the same label, which is quite similar to the objective of clustering, i.e. grouping similar objects into the same cluster. Based on this fact, several researchers have proposed to build classifiers by using the K-means type algorithms to partition the data sequentially, which are named as decision cluster classifiers. While it is wellknown that the performance of K-means type algorithms relies on the locations of initial centers and the selections of number of clusters, it is necessary to deal with both issues well such that the clustering performance is good enough to build such classifiers. In this paper, we propose to build decision cluster classifiers by using the agglomerative fuzzy K-means because of its three good properties: (1) the clustering algorithm is insensitive to initial centers; (2) the algorithm can automatically determine the number of clusters combined with cluster validation techniques; (3) the algorithm can control the density level of clusters identified. The experimental results on UCI benchmark data sets have shown the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

J	Nouri, H; Hong, TS				Nouri, Hossein; Hong, Tang Sai			Development of bacteria foraging optimization algorithm for cell formation in cellular manufacturing system considering cell load variations	JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Cellular manufacturing system; Cell formation; Cell load variations; Bacteria foraging optimization algorithm	GENETIC ALGORITHM; DESIGN	The cellular manufacturing system (CMS) is considered as an efficient production strategy for batch type production. The CMS relies on the principle of grouping machines into machine cells and grouping machine parts into part families on the basis of pertinent similarity measures. The bacteria foraging optimization (BFO) algorithm is a modern evolutionary computation technique derived from the social foraging behavior of Escherichia coli bacteria. Ever since Kevin M. Passino invented the BFO, one of the main challenges has been the employment of the algorithm to problem areas other than those of which the algorithm was proposed. This paper investigates the first applications of this emerging novel optimization algorithm to the cell formation (CF) problem. In addition, for this purpose matrix-based bacteria foraging optimization algorithm traced constraints handling (MBATCH) is developed. In this paper, an attempt is made to solve the cell formation problem while considering cell load variations and a number of exceptional elements. The BFO algorithm is used to create machine cells and part families. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with a number of algorithms that are most commonly used and reported in the corresponding scientific literature such as K-means clustering, the C-link clustering and genetic algorithm using a well-known performance measure that combined cell load variations and a number of exceptional elements. The results lie in favor of better performance of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2012 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The main source of data used for the analysis was the information gathered through the author's own studies conducted on a group of 1000 randomly chosen people. Statistical analysis of the researched material comprised the summary statistical measurements, the non-parametric chi(2) test and the cluster analysis (k-means clustering). As results from the conducted analysis, the inhabitants of rural areas in Poland are characterized by the average level of knowledge and financial skills. The level of financial competences represented by rural dwellers is conditioned both by the economic and non-economic factors. Three groups of citizens were distinguished on the basis of the conducted investigations. The group which requires special educational measures comprises of women, elderly and less educated persons, households with lower incomes, families of annuitants and old-age pensioners, but also persons using financial tools in a lower degree, not using banking services or living in the areas with a worse access to the banking infrastructure.

This paper presents a novel approach which integrates fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and COPRAS-G method for market segment evaluation and selection. Fuzzy AHP is used to calculate the weight of each criterion, and COPRAS-G method is proposed to prioritize market segments from the best to the worst ones. The application of fuzzy set theory allows incorporating the vague and imprecise linguistic terms into the decision process. This study can be used as a pattern for market segment selection and future researches. A case study on a chair manufacturing company is put forward to illustrate the performance of the proposed methodology.

J	Karabatak, E; Guo, YH; Sengur, A				Karabatak, Ebru; Guo, Yanhui; Sengur, Abdulkadir			Modified neutrosophic approach to color image segmentation	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING			English	Article							UNSUPERVISED SEGMENTATION; MEAN-SHIFT	We improved an image segmentation algorithm based on neutrosophic set (NS) and extended the modified method into color image segmentation. The original NS image segmentation approach transformed the images into NS domain, which is described using three membership sets: T, I, and F. Then two operations, a-mean and beta-enhancement operations were employed to reduce the set indeterminacy. Although this method was quite successful in image segmentation application, some drawbacks still exist, such as over-segmentation and fixed alpha and beta parameters. Thus, a new algorithm is proposed to overcome these limitations of the NS-based image segmentation algorithm. Then, the new modified method is extended into color image segmentation. The NS-based image segmentation algorithm is applied to each color channel independently. Then each channel is moved to a matrix column, respectively, to construct the input matrix to the gamma-K-means clustering.

Initially, Niche Particle Swarm Optimization (NPSO) with pseudo/quasi-random distribution is used for splitting the data into number of cluster centers by satisfying Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC). Themain objective is to search and locate the best possible number of cluster and its centers. NPSO which highly depends on the initial distribution of particles in search space is not been exploited to its full potential. In this study, we have compared more uniformly distributed quasi-random with pseudo-random distribution with NPSO for splitting data set. Here to generate quasi-random distribution, Faure method has been used. Performance of previously proposed methods namely K-means, Mean Shift Clustering (MSC) and NPSO with pseudo-random is compared with the proposed approach - NPSO with quasi distribution(Faure). These algorithms are used on synthetic data set and multi-spectral satellite image (Landsat 7 thematic mapper). From the result obtained we conclude that use of quasi-random sequence with NPSO for hierarchical clustering algorithm results in a more accurate data classification.	[Senthilnath, J.; Omkar, S.

Automatic detection of Tubules in Breast Histopathological Images	PROCEEDINGS OF SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIO-INSPIRED COMPUTING: THEORIES AND APPLICATIONS (BIC-TA 2012), VOL 2	Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA 2012)	DEC 14-16, 2012	Madhya Pradesh, INDIA		ABV Indian Inst Informat Technol & Management Gwalior	Breast histopathology; tubules; cancer grading and segmentation	CANCER; SEGMENTATION	Histopathological examination of tissues enables pathologists to quantify the morphological features and spatial relationships of the tissue components. This process aids them in detecting and grading diseases, such as cancer. Quite often this system leads to observer variability and therefore affects patient prognosis. Hence quantitative image-analysis techniques can be used in processing the histopathology images and to perform automatic detection and grading. This paper proposes a segmentation algorithm to segment all the objects in a breast histopathology image and identify the tubules in them. The objects including the tubules and fatty regions are identified using K-means clustering. Lumen belonging to tubules is differentiated from the fatty regions by detecting the single layered nuclei surrounding them. This is done through grid analysis and level set segmentation. Identification of tubules is important because the percentage of tubular formation is one of the parameters used in breast cancer detection and grading.

In this paper, we study and propose two-stage unsupervised feature selection methods to determine a subset of relevant features to improve accuracy of the underlying algorithm. We experiment with hybrid approach of feature selection-feature selection (FS-FS) and feature-selection feature extraction (FS-FE) methods. Initially, each feature in the document is scored on the basis of its importance for the clustering using two different feature selection methods individually Mean-Median (MM) and Mean Absolute Difference (MAD),In the second stage, in two different experiments, we hybridize them with a feature selection method absolute cosine (AC) and a feature extraction method principal component analysis (PCA) to further reduce the dimensions in the feature space. We perform comprehensive experiments to compare FS, FS-FS and FS-FE using k-mean clustering on Reuters-21578 dataset. The experimental results show that the two-stage feature selection methods are more effective to obtain good quality results by the underlying clustering algorithm. Additionally, we observe that FS-FE approach is superior to FS-FS approach.

Among the several clustering algorithms, k-means is the one of most extensively used clustering techniques in addition to fuzzy k-means clustering. The performance of both k-means and fuzzy k-means clustering is influenced by the initial cluster centers and might converge to local optimum. In addition, the performance of any data mining algorithm is influenced by the significant feature subset. This paper attempts to augment the performance of both k-means and fuzzy k-means clustering using two stages. As part of first stage, this paper investigates the use of wrapper approach of feature selection for clustering, where Genetic algorithm (GA) is used as a random search technique for subset generation, wrapped with k-means clustering. In the second stage of projected work, GA and Entropy based fuzzy clustering (EFC) are used to find the initial centroids for both k-means and fuzzy k-means clustering. Investigations have been directed using standard medical dataset namely Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (PIDD). Experimental results confirm markable decline of almost 7% in the classification error of both k-means and fuzzy k-means clustering with GA nominated significant features and GA identified initial centroids when compared to randomly selected centroids with all features.

A User-oriented Content Based Recommender System Based on Reclusive Methods and Interactive Genetic Algorithm	PROCEEDINGS OF SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIO-INSPIRED COMPUTING: THEORIES AND APPLICATIONS (BIC-TA 2012), VOL 1	Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Bio-Inspired Computing: Theories and Applications (BIC-TA 2012)	DEC 14-16, 2012	Madhya Pradesh, INDIA		ABV Indian Inst Informat Technol & Management Gwalior	Recommender Systems; Content-based Filtering; Reclusive Methods; Fuzzy Theoretic Approach; Interactive Genetic Algorithm	TRUST	Due to the unprecedented proliferation of textual contents such as blog articles, news, research papers and other things like movies, books and restaurants etc. on the web in recent years, the development of content-based recommender systems (CB-RSs) has become an important research area which aims to provide personalized suggestions about items to users while interacting with the large spaces on the web using items' contents and users' preferences. However, item representation and responds to changing user preferences are still major concerns. In our work, we have employed Reclusive Methods (RMs) to deal with the uncertainty associated with item representation and Interactive Genetic Algorithm (IGA) is used to adapt the system with changing user preferences. First of all, a fuzzy theoretic approach to content based recommender system (FCB-RS) is designed to generate initial population for IGA using reclusive methods. Second, K-means algorithm is employed for clustering the items in order to handle the time complexity of IGA algorithm. Thereafter, a user-oriented content based recommender system (UCB-RS) is developed by incorporating IGA into FCB-RS through user evaluation.

Bicycle commuting market analysis using attitudinal market segmentation approach	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Bicycle; Commuting; Market segmentation; Attitude; Policy	MODE CHOICE; CAR USE; BEHAVIOR; WORK	The market segmentation analysis for bicycle commuting can help identify distinct bicycle market segments and develop specific policies or strategies for increasing the bicycle usage in each segment. This study aims to use the approach of attitudinal market segmentation for identifying the potential markets of bicycle commuting. To achieve the research objective, the household survey is conducted to obtain the travelers' attitudes towards their commuting travels. The factor analysis is used to explore the latent attitudes. The structural equation modeling (SEM) simultaneously estimates the correlations between the attitudinal factors. The K-means clustering is conducted to segment the bicycle commuting market into several submarkets. Finally, six segments of bicycle commuting market with distinct attitudes are identified by four dividing factors including the willingness to use bicycle, need for fixed schedule, desire for comfort, and environmental awareness. The attitudinal characteristics, socioeconomic features, and actual bicycle choices in each market segment are analyzed and compared. The policy implications that best serve the needs of each submarket are discussed to promote the bicycle commuting. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Papalexakis, EE; Sidiropoulos, ND; Bro, R				Papalexakis, Evangelos E.; Sidiropoulos, Nicholas D.; Bro, Rasmus			From K-Means to Higher-Way Co-Clustering: Multilinear Decomposition With Sparse Latent Factors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Co-clustering; compressed sensing; factor analysis; k-means; multi-way analysis; sparsity; tensor decomposition; triclustering; unsupervised clustering	NONNEGATIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION; LASSO; CONSTRAINTS; ALGORITHMS; SELECTION; PARAFAC	Co-clustering is a generalization of unsupervised clustering that has recently drawn renewed attention, driven by emerging data mining applications in diverse areas. Whereas clustering groups entire columns of a data matrix, co-clustering groups columns over select rows only, i.e., it simultaneously groups rows and columns. The concept generalizes to data "boxes" and higher-way tensors, for simultaneous grouping along multiple modes. Various co-clustering formulations have been proposed, but no workhorse analogous to K-means has emerged. This paper starts from K-means and shows how co-clustering can be formulated as a constrained multilinear decomposition with sparse latent factors. For three-and higher-way data, uniqueness of the multilinear decomposition implies that, unlike matrix co-clustering, it is possible to unravel a large number of possibly overlapping co-clusters. A basic multi-way co-clustering algorithm is proposed that exploits multilinearity using Lasso-type coordinate updates. Various line search schemes are then introduced to speed up convergence, and suitable modifications are proposed to deal with missing values. The imposition of latent sparsity pays a collateral dividend: it turns out that sequentially extracting one co-cluster at a time is almost optimal, hence the approach scales well for large datasets. The resulting algorithms are benchmarked against the state-of-art in pertinent simulations, and applied to measured data, including the ENRON e-mail corpus.

Enhancing safety based on automatic tracking of surgical instrument position to prevent inadvertent harmful events such as tissue perforation or instrument collisions could be a meaningful augmentation to current robotic surgical systems. A vision-based instrument tracking scheme as a core algorithm to implement such functions was developed in this study. An automatic tracking scheme is proposed as a chain of computer vision techniques, including classification of metallic properties using k-means clustering and instrument movement tracking using similarity measures, Euclidean distance calculations, and a Kalman filter algorithm. The implemented system showed satisfactory performance in tests using actual robot-assisted surgery videos. Trajectory comparisons of automatically detected data and ground truth data obtained by manually locating the center of mass of each instrument were used to quantitatively validate the system. Instruments and collisions could be well tracked through the proposed methods. The developed collision warning system could provide valuable information to clinicians for safer procedures.

The essential oils consisted mainly of monoterpenes, a-pinene (27.459.2%) and 1,8-cineole (6.134.3%) being the major components. They were also characterized by the absence of myrtenyl acetate. The compositions of the 55 oils were submitted to k-means partitioning and principal component analysis, which allowed the distinction of two groups within the oil samples, which could be subdivided into two subgroups each. Groups I (78% of the samples) and II were differentiated on the basis of the contents of a-pinene, linalool, and linalyl acetate. Subgroups IA and IB could be distinguished by their contents of a-pinene and 1,8-cineole. Subgroups IIA and IIB differed substantially in their contents of 1,8-cineole and limonene. All the samples contained 3,3,5,5,8,8-hexamethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.3.0]non-1(6)-ene-2,4-dione (up to 4.9%).

Automated extraction of tree and plot-based parameters in citrus orchards from aerial images	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Tree extraction; Plot-based; Image analysis; Remote sensing; Agricultural database; Hough transform	RESOLUTION IMAGERY; CROWN DETECTION; DELINEATION	A plot-based approach is proposed to detect fruit trees from high spatial resolution aerial images and extract tree and plot-based parameters, such as fraction of tree cover, number of trees, and planting patterns. Each plot image, defined by the boundaries or polygons obtained from a cadastral database, is analyzed independently. The methodology is based on image processing methods: an unsupervised classification with the k-means algorithm is applied, followed by the automatic identification of the classes representing trees. Once extracted, each tree is individualized using a morphological process applied on the binary image of the trees. A set of parameters is calculated at tree and plot levels that produces a comprehensive description of the spectral and morphological aspects of the trees, as well as their spatial distribution in each plot. The methodology was tested on 0.5 m/pixel spatial resolution aerial images of 300 citrus orchard plots which included the three citrus tree typologies found in the Valencia region (Spain). The accuracy of the fruit tree extraction and the parameters calculated was evaluated by comparison with reference data obtained by manual delineation of the images. The automatically extracted fraction of tree cover was significantly related to the reference tree cover area (R-2 = 0.96). In the case of the number of detected trees, the R-2 values were always higher than 0.90 for the three typologies. Tree location was estimated with an average positional error of 40 cm. The error obtained in the characterization of the planting pattern was less than 50 cm. The proposed methodology may be applied to large agricultural databases, and the derived information combined with precision agricultural techniques could improve the efficiency of various irrigation and agricultural management tasks - such as handling per-plot water requirements and distribution.

J	Giannella, CR; Liu, K; Kargupta, H				Giannella, Chris R.; Liu, Kun; Kargupta, Hillol			Breaching Euclidean distance-preserving data perturbation using few known inputs	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Euclidean distance; Privacy; Data mining; Data perturbation	PRIVACY; ALGORITHMS; DATABASES; ANONYMITY	We examine Euclidean distance-preserving data perturbation as a tool for privacy-preserving data mining. Such perturbations allow many important data mining algorithms (e.g. hierarchical and k-means clustering), with only minor modification, to be applied to the perturbed data and produce exactly the same results as if applied to the original data. However, the issue of how well the privacy of the original data is preserved needs careful study. We engage in this study by assuming the role of an attacker armed with a small set of known original data tuples (inputs). Little work has been done examining this kind of attack when the number of known original tuples is less than the number of data dimensions. We focus on this important case, develop and rigorously analyze an attack that utilizes any number of known original tuples. The approach allows the attacker to estimate the original data tuple associated with each perturbed tuple and calculate the probability that the estimation results in a privacy breach. On a real 16-dimensional dataset, we show that the attacker, with 4 known original tuples, can estimate an original unknown tuple with less than 7% error with probability exceeding 0.8.

Since NIPF landowners are a heterogeneous group who value their forests for varying reasons, outreach efforts targeted to them should consider this diversity. This study uses a market segmentation approach to separate Michigan's NIPF owners into meaningful subgroups based on their ownership reasons. Four landowner segments were identified in the northeastern Michigan study region. The use of communication materials and their preference for the future is then analyzed for each landowner subgroup. Given that outreach and extension services have limited resources, audience segmentation and tailoring outreach materials and methods specific to target audience could be an effective approach for reaching landowners.

In particular, recent heuristic approaches have proposed to incorporate restrictions on the size of the clusters, while striving to minimize a measure of dissimilarity within them. Such size constraints effectively constitute a way to exploit prior knowledge, readily available in many scenarios, which can lead to an improved performance in the clustering obtained. In this paper, we build upon a modification of the celebrated k-means method resorting to a similar alternating optimization procedure, endowed with additive partition weights controlling the size of the partitions formed, adjusted by means of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. We propose several further variations on this modification, in which different kinds of additional information are present. We report experimental results on various standardized datasets, demonstrating that our approaches outperform existing heuristics for size-constrained clustering. The running-time complexity of our proposal is assessed experimentally by means of a power-law regression analysis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Maternal dietary patterns and associated nutrient intakes during each trimester of pregnancy	PUBLIC HEALTH NUTRITION			English	Article						Pregnancy; Dietary pattern; Cluster analysis	CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; WOMEN; LIFE; DISEASE	Objective: To determine the main dietary patterns of pregnant women during each of the three trimesters of pregnancy and to examine associated nutrient intakes. Design: Participants completed a 3d food diary during each trimester of pregnancy. Thirty-six food groups were created and dietary patterns were derived using k-means cluster analysis. Setting: National Maternity Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. Subjects: Two hundred and eighty-five healthy pregnant women aged between 20 and 41 years. Results: Two dietary patterns were identified at each time point. They were labelled 'Unhealthy' (n 143, 150 and 155 at trimester 1, 2 and 3, respectively) and 'Health Conscious' (n 142, 135 and 130 at trimester 1, 2 and 3, respectively). Women in the 'Health Conscious' cluster were significantly older, had lower BMI and were higher educated than those in the 'Unhealthy' cluster. Of those in the 'Unhealthy' cluster in the first trimester (n 143), 103 (72.0%) continued in this dietary pattern into trimester 2 and eighty-one (56.6%) continued into trimester 3. Of those in the 'Health Conscious' cluster in trimester 1 (n 142), ninety-five (66.9%) continued in this dietary pattern into trimester 2 and sixty-nine (48.6%) continued into trimester 3. Conclusions: Cluster analysis produced two clearly defined dietary patterns at each stage of pregnancy. Knowledge of maternal dietary patterns is important for the development of pregnancy-specific dietary guidelines. Identifying women with an 'Unhealthy' dietary pattern in early pregnancy affords the opportunity for a dietary intervention which may positively impact both maternal and infant health.

J	Lu, ZM; Zhang, Q				Lu ZhiMao; Zhang Qi			Clustering by data competition	SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						data mining; clustering analysis; partitional clustering; data competition	ALGORITHM	Clustering analysis is an unsupervised method to find out hidden structures in datasets. Most partitional clustering algorithms are sensitive to the selection of initial exemplars, the outliers and noise. In this paper, a novel technique called data competition algorithm is proposed to solve the problems. First the concept of aggregation field model is defined to describe the partitional clustering problem. Next, the exemplars are identified according to the data competition. Then, the members will be assigned to the suitable clusters. Data competition algorithm is able to avoid poor solutions caused by unlucky initializations, outliers and noise, and can be used to detect the coexpression gene, cluster the image, diagnose the disease, distinguish the variety, etc. The provided experimental results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed schemes and show that the proposed approach of data competition algorithm is simple, stable and efficient. The experimental results also show that the proposed approach of data competition clustering outperforms three of the most well known clustering algorithms K-means clustering, affinity propagation clustering, hierarchical clustering.

In this paper, a hybrid recognition approach is presented that classifies radar emitter signals by exploiting the different separability of samples. The proposed approach comprises two steps, namely the primary signal recognition and the advanced signal recognition. In the former step, a novel rough k-means classifier, which comprises three regions, i.e., certain area, rough area and uncertain area, is proposed to cluster the samples of radar emitter signals. In the latter step, the samples within the rough boundary are used to train the relevance vector machine (RVM). Then RVM is used to recognize the samples in the uncertain area; therefore, the classification accuracy is improved. Simulation results show that, for recognizing radar emitter signals, the proposed hybrid recognition approach is more accurate, and presents lower computational complexity than traditional approaches.

Common approaches that sum or average responses across different illness components must be unidimensional and have small unique variances to avoid aggregation bias and misinterpretation of clinical data. This study sought to evaluate the unidimensionality of the IBS Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS) and to explore person-centered cluster analytic methods for characterizing multivariate-based patient profiles. Methods: Ninety-eight Rome-diagnosed patients with IBS completed the IBS-SSS and a single, global item of symptom severity (UCLA Symptom Severity Scale) at pretreatment baseline of a clinical trial funded by the National Institutes of Health, k-means cluster analyses were performed on participants' symptom severity scores. Results: The IBS-SSS was not unidimensional. Exploratory cluster analyses revealed four common symptom profiles across five items of the IBS-SSS. One cluster of patients (25%) had elevated scores on pain frequency and bowel dissatisfaction, with less elevated but still high scores on life interference and low pain severity ratings. A second cluster (19%) was characterized by intermediate scores on both pain dimensions but more elevated scores on bowel dissatisfaction. A third cluster (18%) had elevated scores across all IBS-SSS subcomponents. The fourth and the most common cluster (37%) had relatively low scores on all dimensions except bowel dissatisfaction and life interference due to IBS symptoms. Conclusions: Patient-reported outcome end points and research on IBS more generally relying on multicomponent assessments of symptom severity should take into account the multidimensional structure of symptoms to avoid aggregation bias and to optimize the sensitivity of detecting treatment effects.

J	Polikovsky, S; Kameda, Y; Ohta, Y				Polikovsky, Senya; Kameda, Yoshinari; Ohta, Yuichi			Facial Micro-Expression Detection in Hi-Speed Video Based on Facial Action Coding System (FACS)	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						facial motion analysis; high speed camera; video descriptor	RECOGNITION; EMOTION	Facial micro-expressions are fast and subtle facial motions that are considered as one of the most useful external signs for detecting hidden emotional changes in a person. However, they are not easy to detect and measure as they appear only for a short time, with small muscle contraction in the facial areas where salient features are not available. We propose a new computer vision method for detecting and measuring timing characteristics of facial micro-expressions. The core of this method is based on a descriptor that combines pre-processing masks, histograms and concatenation of spatial-temporal gradient vectors. Presented 3D gradient histogram descriptor is able to detect and measure the timing characteristics of the fast and subtle changes of the facial skin surface. This method is specifically designed for analysis of videos recorded using a hi-speed 200 fps camera. Final classification of micro expressions is done by using a k-mean classifier and a voting procedure. The Facial Action Coding System was utilized to annotate the appearance and dynamics of the expressions in our new hi-speed micro-expressions video database. The efficiency of the proposed approach was validated using our new hi-speed video database.

J	Triantafilis, J; Gibbs, I; Earl, N				Triantafilis, John; Gibbs, Issac; Earl, Nina			Digital soil pattern recognition in the lower Namoi valley using numerical clustering of gamma-ray spectrometry data	GEODERMA			English	Article						Fuzzy k-means (FKM) classification; Digital soil classification; Remote sensing; Gamma spectrometry; Soil management classes; Geomorphology	FUZZY K-MEANS; PARTICLE-SIZE FRACTIONS; SPATIAL PREDICTION; COMPOSITIONAL DATA; ALLUVIAL PLAIN; LAYER CLASSES; SIGNAL DATA; CLASSIFICATION; AUSTRALIA; MODELS	Digital soil mapping involves the use of ancillary data (e.g. proximal and remotely sensed) as surrogates for soil information to produce maps of soil type or classes. Two of the most popularly used sources of ancillary data are the proximally sensing electromagnetic (EM) induction instruments and remotely sensed digital elevation model data (DEM). However, these data have limitations at the catchment level and are of limited use on predominantly flat alluvial landscapes, respectively. Another option is the use of remotely sensed gamma-ray (gamma-ray) spectrometry data which has successfully been used to map the regolith. In this paper, the use of gamma-ray spectrometry data (i.e. potassium-K, uranium-U, thorium-Th and total count-TC), coupled with a numerical clustering algorithm (i.e. fuzzy k-means (FKM) algorithm) is explored in order to identify geological and geomorphological units at the district and soil mapping units at a broader catchment level. We do this by using the Euclidean distance and the measures of fuzziness performance index (FPI) and normalized classification entropy (NCE) to identify k = 11 classes and a fuzziness exponent (phi) = 2.0 for interpretation. The k = 11 classes produce contiguous classes, which are consistent with geological and geomorphological interpretations of an eroded landscape, alluvial lands and dust-mantled alluvial lands at the district level. At the sub-catchment level the k = 11 classes also match broad soil mapping units and also elucidate subtle differences of the alluvial lands which characterise the agriculturally significant parts of the lower Namoi valley. Fuzzy canonical analysis shows that K and TC contribute most to the discrimination of the classes associated with the trachyte rich parts of the eroded landscape, the alluvial lands and most of the dust-mantled alluvial lands, whilst U and Th discriminate the basaltic outliers and other geomorphological units of the eroded lands. We conclude that the approach allows soil management and landscape units to be identified with the information used as a first approximation to determine where soil sample locations need to be collected to validate the map units identified. In order to better incorporate and characterise subsoil properties the inclusion of EM signal data (e.g. EM38 or DUALEM-1) may also be appropriate. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The objective of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular responses to mild hyperthermia (MHT) in normal human fibroblastic (NHF) cells. Materials and methods: Cells were treated with MHT (41 degrees C, 30 min) and then cultured at 37 degrees C. Gene expression was determined by the GeneChip (R) system and bioinformatics tools. Results: Treatment of the NHF cell lines, Hs68 and OUMS-36, with MHT did not affect the cell viability or cell cycle. In contrast, many probe sets were differentially expressed by >1.5-fold in both cell lines after MHT treatment. Of the 1,196 commonly and differentially expressed probe sets analysed by k-means clustering, three gene clusters, Up-I, Down-I and Down-II, were observed. Interestingly, two gene networks were obtained from the up-regulated genes in cluster Up-I. The gene network E contained DDIT3 and HSPA5 and was mainly associated with the biological process of endoplasmic reticulum stress, while the network S contained HBEGF and LIF and was associated with the biological process of cell survival. Eighteen genes were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, consistent with the microarray data, in four kinds of NHF cells. Conclusions: Common genes that were differentially expressed and/or acted within a gene network in response to MHT in NHF cells were identified. These findings provide the molecular basis for a further understanding of the mechanisms of the MHT response in NHF cells.

J	Van Tuyckom, C				Van Tuyckom, Charlotte			Six sporting worlds. A cluster analysis of sports participation in the EU-25	QUALITY & QUANTITY			English	Article						Cluster analysis; Sport participation; Eurobarometer	INEQUALITIES; MORTALITY; STATES	The aim of this study was to identify clusters of European nations grouped by sports participation outcomes (organizational context and intensity of sports participation), in order to provide sensible groupings for international comparisons. Sports participation data for the EU-25 were distracted from the 2004 Eurobarometer survey. Both a hierarchical as a K-means clustering method was used to identify groupings of countries that are homogeneous in terms of sports participation profiles. Six clusters of countries could be identified: (i) non to average fitness countries; (ii) active club countries; (iii) average non-organized countries; (iv) average school countries; (v) active multi-context countries; and (vi) very active countries. Considerable differences in sports participation profiles between European countries are made clearer when viewed across clusters of countries grouped by actual outcomes. This empirically derived taxonomy has advantages over ad hoc systems for comparing sports participation and for deciding which countries appear to have the most comparable participation profiles. Moreover, it shows that policy strategies to increase sports participation in European countries need a differentiated approach and have to take account for the fact that the provision and intensity of sport is at a quite different level in all six sporting clusters.

J	Hofmans, J; Mullet, E				Hofmans, Joeri; Mullet, Etienne			Towards unveiling individual differences in different stages of information processing: a clustering-based approach	QUALITY & QUANTITY			English	Article						Judgment; Information Integration Theory; Functional measurement; Individual differences; Cluster analysis; K-means	HEALTH-PROFESSIONALS; DECISION-MAKING; LAY PEOPLE; CHOICE; PROBABILITY; SCALES; WIFE	Information Integration Theory (IIT) is a theory of judgment in daily life. Its principal aim is to study the cognitive rules that people use to integrate information when they make a judgment. Traditionally, the identification of individual differences in these qualitatively different integration rules requires individual designs. It also requires the grouping of individuals according to their integration rule, which can be a challenging task, particularly when the data are noisy or when the pattern involves many factors. This paper builds on the cluster analysis tradition for developing a series of clustering procedures that can be implemented for studying, not only individual differences in integration rules, but also individual differences in other stages of information processing. These procedures are intended to simplify the identification of differences in (a) the subjective valuation of information, (b) the integration of the subjective values, and (c) general attitudes before judging.

Two-Stage Rejection Algorithm to Reduce Search Space for Character Recognition in OCR	ADVANCES IN COMPUTING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, VOL 2	Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Advances in Computing and Informaiton Technology (ACITY 2012)	JUL 13-15, 2012	Chennai, INDIA			Optical Character Recognition; Feature Extraction; K-means		Optical Character Recognition converts text in images into a form that the computer can manipulate. The need for faster OCRs stems from the abundance of such text. This paper presents a Two-Stage Rejection Algorithm for reducing the search space of an OCR. It is tacit that the reduction in search space expedites an OCR. Preprocessing operations are applied on the input and features are extracted from them. These feature vectors are clustered and the Two-Stage Rejection Algorithm is applied for character recognition. With about the same character recognition rate as other OCRs, an OCR reinforced with the Two-Stage Rejection Algorithm is considerably faster.	[Mandipati, Srivardhini; Asisha, Gottumukkala; Raj, S.

One of challenges in classification of cancer using high-dimensional gene expression data is to select a minimal number of relevant genes which can maximize classification accuracy. Because of the distinct characteristics inherent to specific cancerous gene expression profiles, developing flexible and robust gene identification methods is extremely fundamental. Many gene selection methods as well as their corresponding classifiers have been proposed.

The Role of Appraisals and Emotions in Understanding Experiences of Workplace Incivility	JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						workplace incivility; appraisal theory; affect events theory; workplace emotions	CORE RELATIONAL THEMES; ORGANIZATIONAL WITHDRAWAL; SEXUAL-HARASSMENT; JOB-SATISFACTION; AFFECTIVE STATES; GENERAL SCALE; WORK; ATTITUDES; BEHAVIOR; MODEL	Theoretically grounded in both the cognitive motivational relational theory of emotions and affect events theory, the present research used multiple analytic techniques and positioned appraisals and emotions as key variables in understanding the experience of incivility at work. Data consisted of survey responses from a stratified random sample of 522 U.S. working adults. K-means cluster analyses revealed interindividual differences in cognitive/emotional responding to workplace incivility experiences. In addition, multiple mediation analyses revealed that optimism and emotionality may play important roles in showing why the experience of incivility is related to job-related outcomes. The results help to advance workplace mistreatment research and suggest possible strategies for organizations to maintain civil working environments.

In favor of the lumper-side of the debate, clusters should differ only on the overall severity of the somatic complaints that were assessed. According to the splitters view, clusters should differ in symptom-specific patterns. Methods: Three-hundred ninety four subjects with functional somatic symptoms were clustered based on their scores on 47 somatic symptoms. Three cluster solutions (k=2,3, and 4 clusters) were compared on overall symptom severity, symptom patterns, and psychological distress. Results: Results showed that in all three solutions the clusters were defined by increasing total symptom scores and increasing psychological distress. Cluster-specific symptom patterns where evident only when more clusters (three or four) were allowed. The best fit index was found for a 2-cluster solution. Conclusion: The finding of symptom specific patterns in clusters which could not be differentiated on overall symptom severity is in favor of the splitters' view. The finding that all other clusters could be discriminated on overall symptom severity and that the 2-cluster solution had the best fit is in favor of the lumpers' view. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

It achieves lower distortion error than k-means and has shown very good performance in the clustering of complex data sets, using various metrics or kernels. While very effective, it does not scale for large data sets which is even more severe in case of kernels, due to a dense prototype model. In this paper, we propose a novel soft-competitive learning algorithm using core-sets, significantly accelerating the original method in practice with natural sparsity. It effectively deals with very large data sets up to multiple million points. Our method provides also an alternative fast kernelization of soft-competitive learning. In contrast to many other clustering methods the obtained model is based on only few prototypes and shows natural sparsity. It is the first natural sparse kernelized soft competitive learning approach. Numerical experiments on synthetical and benchmark data sets show the efficiency of the proposed method.

We found out a correlation between weather conditions and the speech quality. The GSM technology is the most widely utilized communication standard which it is now coming to its bandwidth limitation especially in big cities and densely populated areas. Under such circumstances, even a minor weather change and rain could be a decisive factor causing changes in the quality of service. We have obtained both meteorological data and Mean Opinion Score value specifying the current speech quality in the GSM network. Those data are evaluated and compiled via statistical methods, whose accomplishment is dataset competent to be utilized by more advanced data mining methods. According to space distribution and fragmentation, our team has chosen set of suitable methods used to find data-mining, data analysis and correlation. As a computation result, our team found out the correlation between current rain density and the speech quality.

In contrast to hard clustering, when the data are divided into distinct clusters and each data point belongs to exactly one cluster, in fuzzy clustering the observations can belong to more than one cluster. The strength of the association to each cluster is measured by a vector of membership coefficients. Usually, an observation is assigned to a cluster with the highest membership coefficient. On the other hand, the refinement of the hard membership coefficients enables to consider also the possibility of assigning to another cluster according to prior knowledge or specific data structure of the membership coefficients. The aim of the paper is to introduce a methodology to reveal the real data structure of multivariate membership coefficient vectors, based on the logratio approach to compositional data, and show how to display them in presence of outlying observations using loadings and scores of robust principal component analysis.

Correlated wind-power production and electric load scenarios for investment decisions	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Clustering; Correlated scenarios; Electric load; Investment; Stochastic programming; Wind-power		Stochastic programming constitutes a useful tool to address investment problems. This technique represents uncertain input data using a set of scenarios, which should accurately describe the involved uncertainty. In this paper, we propose two alternative methodologies to efficiently generate electric load and wind-power production scenarios, which are used as input data for investment problems. The two proposed methodologies are based on the load- and wind-duration curves and on the K-means clustering technique, and allow representing the uncertainty of and the correlation between electric load and wind-power production. A case study pertaining to wind-power investment is used to show the interest of the proposed methodologies and to illustrate how the selection of scenarios has a significant impact on investment decisions.

J	Shi, YH; Gao, Y; Wang, RL; Zhang, Y; Wang, D				Shi, Yinghuan; Gao, Yang; Wang, Ruili; Zhang, Ying; Wang, Dong			Transductive cost-sensitive lung cancer image classification	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Lung cancer image classification; Transductive; Cost-sensitive	MEDICAL DECISION-SUPPORT; BREAST-CANCER; SYSTEM; DIAGNOSIS; PROGNOSIS; MODEL	Previous computer-aided lung cancer image classification methods are all cost-blind, which assume that the misdiagnosis (categorizing a cancerous image as a normal one or categorizing a normal image as a cancerous one) costs are equal. In addition, previous methods usually require experienced pathologists to label a large amount of images as training samples. To this end, a novel transductive cost-sensitive method is proposed for lung cancer image classification on needle biopsies specimens, which only requires the pathologist to label a small amount of images. The proposed method analyzes lung cancer images in the following procedures: (i) an image capturing procedure to capture images from the needle biopsies specimens; (ii) a preprocessing procedure to segment the individual cells from the captured images; (iii) a feature extraction procedure to extract features (i.e. shape, color, texture and statistical information) from the obtained individual cells; (iv) a codebook learning procedure to learn a codebook on the extracted features by adopting k-means clustering, which aims to represent each image as a histogram over different codewords; (v) an image classification procedure to predict labels for testing images using the proposed multi-class cost-sensitive Laplacian regularized least squares (mCLRLS). We evaluate the proposed method on a real-image set provided by Bayi Hospital, which contains 271 images including normal ones and four types of cancerous ones (squamous carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, small cell cancer and nuclear atypia). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a lower cancer-misdiagnosis rate and lower total misdiagnosis costs comparing with previous methods, which includes the supervised learning approach (kNN, mcSVM and MCMI-AdaBoost), semi-supervised learning approach (LapRLS) and cost-sensitive approach (CS-SVM). Meanwhile, the experiments also disclose that both transductive and cost-sensitive settings are useful when only a small amount of training images are available.

We studied vocal ontogeny in nests of wild green-rumped parrotlets (Forpus passerinus) in Venezuela. We identified three successive phases of vocal signaling that corresponded closely to three independently derived phases of physiological development. For each ontogenetic phase, we characterized the relative importance of anatomical constraints, motor skills necessary for responding to specific contexts of the immediate environment, and the learning of signals that are necessary for adult forms of communication. We observed shifts in the relative importance of these three factors as individuals progressed from one stage to the next; there was no single fixed ratio of factors that applied across the entire ontogenetic sequence. The earliest vocalizations were short in duration, as predicted from physical constraints and under-developed motor control. Calls became longer and frequency modulated during intermediate nestling ages in line with motor skills required for competitive begging. In the week before fledging, calls drastically shortened in accordance with the flight-constrained short durations of adult contact calls. The latter constraints were made evident by the demonstrated links between wing-assisted incline running, a widespread prelude to avian flight, just before the shift from long-duration begging calls to short-duration contact calls. At least in this species, the shifting emphases of factors at different ontogenetic stages precluded the morphing of intermediate-stage begging calls into adult contact calls; as shown previously, the latter are influenced by sample templates provided by parents.

In total 25,907 VSEs from 10 adult fish were classified into 4 clusters using a k-means method. VSEs in a specific cluster (cluster-S) characterised by accelerated vertical swimming were identified as possible spawning events. Both the descent (0.43 +/- 0.22 body length s(-1)) and ascent rates (0.43 +/- 024 body length s(-1)) of VSEs in cluster-S were more than 4 times faster than in any other VSE. Our analyses indicated that 4 individuals exhibited the spawning events during the recording periods. The estimated spawning frequency ranged from 0.74 to 0.90 events day(-1). These values were comparable to those obtained in other field and laboratory studies. The spawning condition of fish at the time of recapture was confirmed by separate histological and anatomical observations, which supported the cluster analysis results. These results suggest that a clustering technique can be successfully applied to identify spawning behaviour from time-depth data of free-swimming flatfishes that exhibit vertical swimming movements.

In vivo measurement of gadolinium diffusivity by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI: A preclinical study of human xenografts	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI; tracer kinetics modeling; diffusion; Fick's law	MODEL	Compartmental tracer kinetic models currently used for analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI data yield poor fittings or parameter values that are unphysiological in necrotic regions of the tumor, as these models only describe microcirculation in perfused tissue. In this study, we explore the use of Fick's law of diffusion as an alternative method for analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI data in the necrotic regions. Xenografts of various human cancer cell lines were implanted in 14 mice that were subjected to dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI performed using a spoiled gradient recalled sequence. Tracer concentration was estimated using the variable flip angle technique. Poorly perfused and necrotic tumor regions exhibiting delayed and slow enhancement were identified using a k-means clustering algorithm. Tracer behavior in necrotic regions was shown to be consistent with Fick's diffusion equation and the in vivo gadolinium diffusivity was estimated to be 2.08 (+/- 0.88) x 10-4 mm2/s. This study proposes the use of gadolinium diffusivity as an alternative parameter for quantifying tracer transport within necrotic tumor regions. Magn Reson Med, 2013.

Fuzzy Functions Support Vector Classifier, Improved Fuzzy Functions Support Vector Classifier and a novel technique that has been designed by utilizing Particle Swarm Optimization and Radial Basis Function Networks (PSO-RBFN) have been studied. The classification performances of the techniques are compared on standard EEG datasets that are publicly available and used by brain-computer interface (BCI) researchers. In addition to the standard EEG datasets, the proposed classifier is also tested on non-EEG datasets for thorough comparison. Within the scope of this study, several data clustering algorithms such as Fuzzy C-means, K-means and PSO clustering algorithms are studied and their clustering performances on the same datasets are compared. The results show that PSO-RBFN might reach the classification performance of state-of-the art classifiers and might be a better alternative technique in the classification of EEG signals for real-time application. This has been demonstrated by implementing the proposed classifier in a real-time BCI application for a mobile robot control.

This includes the popular k-means clustering algorithm. The clustering noise benefit follows from the general noise benefit for the expectation-maximization algorithm because many clustering algorithms are special cases of the expectation-maximization algorithm. Simulations show that noise also speeds up convergence in stochastic unsupervised competitive learning, supervised competitive learning, and differential competitive learning. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Subtypes in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome associated with behaviour and neurofacial morphology	RESEARCH IN DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES			English	Article						Velo-cardio-facial syndrome (VCFS); 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS); DiGeorge syndrome; Cluster analysis; k-Means; Subtype; Behavioural phenotype	CARDIO-FACIAL-SYNDROME; STRUCTURAL BRAIN ABNORMALITIES; VELOCARDIOFACIAL SYNDROME; PSYCHOTIC SYMPTOMS; SPECTRUM DISORDER; CHROMOSOME 22Q11; MORPHOMETRY MRI; VOLUMETRIC MRI; EARLY-ONSET; CHILDREN	22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) has a complex phenotype with more than 180 characteristics, including cardiac anomalies, cleft palate, intellectual disabilities, a typical facial morphology, and mental health problems. However, the variable phenotype makes it difficult to predict clinical outcome, such as the high prevalence of psychosis among adults with 22q11DS (similar to 25-30% vs. similar to 1% in the general population). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether subtypes exist among people with 22q11DS, with a similar phenotype and an increased risk of developing mental health problems. Physical, cognitive and behavioural data from 50 children and adolescents with 22q11DS were included in a k-means cluster analysis. Two distinct phenotypes were identified: Type-1 presented with a more severe phenotype including significantly impaired verbal memory, lower intellectual and academic ability, as well as statistically significant reduced total brain volume. In addition, we identified a trend effect for reduced temporal grey matter. Type-1 also presented with autism-spectrum traits, whereas Type-2 could be described as having more 22q11DS-typical face morphology, being predominately affected by executive function deficits, but otherwise being relatively high functioning with regard to cognition and behaviour. The confirmation of well-defined subtypes in 22q11DS can lead to better prognostic information enabling early identification of people with 22q11DS at high risk of psychiatric disorders. The identification of subtypes in a group of people with a relatively homogenous genetic deletion such as 22q11DS is also valuable to understand clinical outcomes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

KmL3D: A non-parametric algorithm for clustering joint trajectories	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Longitudinal data; k-means; Cluster analysis; Non-parametric algorithm; Joint trajectories	FUNCTIONAL DATA; HYPERACTIVITY; DISORDER	In cohort studies, variables are measured repeatedly and can be considered as trajectories. A classic way to work with trajectories is to cluster them in order to detect the existence of homogeneous patterns of evolution. Since cohort studies usually measure a large number of variables, it might be interesting to study the joint evolution of several variables (also called joint-variable trajectories). To date, the only way to cluster joint-trajectories is to cluster each trajectory independently, then to cross the partitions obtained. This approach is unsatisfactory because it does not take into account a possible co-evolution of variable-trajectories. KmL3D is an R package that implements a version of k-means dedicated to clustering joint-trajectories. It provides facilities for the management of missing values, offers several quality criteria and its graphic interface helps the user to select the best partition. KmL3D can work with any number of joint-variable trajectories. In the restricted case of two joint trajectories, it proposes 3D tools to visualize the partitioning and then export 3D dynamic rotating-graphs to PDF format. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

P.; Binik, Yitzchak M.; Amsel, Rhonda; Carrier, Serge			Is a Sexual Dysfunction Domain Important for Quality of Life in Men with Urological Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome? Signs "UPOINT" to Yes	JOURNAL OF UROLOGY			English	Article						prostate; prostatitis; pain; questionnaires; erectile dysfunction	PROSTATITIS SYMPTOM INDEX; IMPROVE CORRELATION; ERECTILE DOMAIN; OUTCOME MEASURE; VALIDATION; SF-36; CLASSIFICATION; QUESTIONNAIRE; PREVALENCE; INCLUSION	Purpose: Clinical phenotyping to guide treatment for urological chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a promising strategy. The UPOINT (urinary, psychosocial, organ specific, infection, neurological/systemic and tenderness of the pelvic floor) phenotyping system evaluates men and women on 6 domains. However, this study focused on men only. Due to the high prevalence of sexual dysfunction in men with urological chronic pelvic pain syndrome, debate exists about the usefulness of adding an (S) (sexual dysfunction) domain to UPOINT. We examined the usefulness in terms of quality of life and delineated urological chronic pelvic pain syndrome subcategories using UPOINT(S) domains. Materials and Methods: We assessed 162 men using UPOINT criteria and after adding the sexual dysfunction domain. Using multiple regression analysis UPOINT(S) criteria were then compared to quality of life, as measured by the SF-36 (R) health outcome survey and Chronic Prostatitis Symptoms Index. Sample subgroups were assessed using k--means cluster analysis. Results: The total number of UPOINT(S) domains correlated with SF--36 and Chronic Prostatitis Symptoms Index scores. Using regression analysis the 2 significant predictors of SF--36 scores were the psychosocial and sexual domains. Men with sexual dysfunction had significantly worse quality of life than men without the condition. In addition, 6 potentially clinically meaningful subgroups were identified using cluster analysis. Sexual dysfunction was differentially present in these groups. Conclusions: Adding a sexual dysfunction domain to UPOINT may help improve quality of life in men treated for urological chronic pelvic pain syndrome.	[Davis, Seth N.

J	Liu, YG; Li, SZ; Wu, W; Huang, RG				Liu, Yiguang; Li, Stan Z.; Wu, Wei; Huang, Ronggang			Dynamics of a mean-shift-like algorithm and its applications on clustering	INFORMATION PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						Design of algorithms; Mean-shift algorithm; Stability; Exponential convergence; Clustering	RECOGNITION; CLASSIFIER	The Mean-Shift (MS) algorithm and its variants have wide applications in pattern recognition and computer vision tasks such as clustering, segmentation, and tracking. In this paper, we study the dynamics of the algorithm with Gaussian kernels, based on a Generalized MS (GMS) model that includes the standard MS as a special case. First, we prove that the GMS has solutions in the convex hull of the given data points. By the principle of contraction mapping, a sufficient condition, dependent on a parameter introduced into Gaussian kernels, is provided to guarantee the uniqueness of the solution. It is shown that the solution is also globally stable and exponentially convergent under the condition. When the condition does not hold, the GMS algorithm can possibly have multiple equilibriums, which can be used for clustering as each equilibrium has its own attractive basin. Based on this, the condition can be used to estimate an appropriate parameter which ensures the GMS algorithm to have its equilibriums suitable for clustering. Examples are given to illustrate the correctness of the condition. It is also shown that the use of the multiple-equilibrium property for clustering, on the data sets such as IRIS, leads to a lower error rate than the standard MS approach, and the K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means algorithms.

The documents may be web pages, blog posts, news articles, or other text files. A popular and computationally efficient clustering technique is flat clustering. Unlike hierarchical techniques, flat clustering algorithms aim to partition the document space into groups of similar documents. The cluster assignments however may be hard or soft. This paper presents our experimental work on evaluating some hard and soft flat-clustering algorithms, namely K-means, heuristic k-means and fuzzy C-means, for categorizing text documents. We experimented with different representations (tf, tf.idf, Boolean) and feature selection schemes (with or without stop word removal and with or without stemming) on some standard datasets. The results indicate that tf:idf representation and the use of stemming obtains better clustering. Moreover, fuzzy clustering obtains better results than K-means on almost all datasets, and is also a more stable method.

In order to reduce computational complexity, local feature must be extracted from a small number of keypoints with rich feature. In this paper, we present an algorithm for 3D object matching based on local feature combined with color. Keypoints should be detected first, and then calculate the quality for each keypoint, we choice these high quality keypoints to extract local features. Before finding correspondences between database and the query object in the scences, features should be projected to a PCA subspace. Color information is also considered as threshold to remove the error mathing points, each of the remaining matching points gives a transformation which aligns the object in the scences and the model. K-means algorithm is used to calculate the final correspondences between the query and database object. Experiences is also made to test and verify the method.

Using Support Vector Machines to Classify Student Attentiveness for the Development of Personalized Learning Systems	2013 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING AND APPLICATIONS (ICMLA 2013), VOL 1			English	Proceedings Paper	12th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)	DEC 04-07, 2013	Miami, FL	Assoc Machine Learning & Applicat, IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc		Support vector machines; K-means; Kinect; personalized learning systems	FACIAL EXPRESSIONS	There have been many studies in which researchers have attempted to classify student attentiveness. Many of these approaches depended on a qualitative analysis and lacked any quantitative analysis. Therefore, this work is focused on bridging the gap between qualitative and quantitative approaches to classify student attentiveness. Thus, this research applies machine learning algorithms (K-means and SVM) to automatically classify students as attentive or inattentive using data from a consumer RGB-D sensor. Results of this research can be used to improve teaching strategies for instructors at all levels and can aid instructors in implementing personalized learning systems, which is a National Academy of Engineering Grand Challenge. This research applies machine learning algorithms to an educational setting. Data from these algorithms can be used by instructors to provide valuable feedback on the effectiveness of their instructional strategies and pedagogies. Instructors can use this feedback to improve their instructional strategies; and students will benefit by achieving improved learning and subject mastery. Ultimately, this will result in the students' increased ability to do work in their respective areas. Broadly, this work can help advance efforts in many areas of education and instruction. It is expected that improving instructional strategies and implementing personalized learning will help create more competent, capable, and prepared persons available for the future workforce.

Unfortunately, each approach has significant shortcomings, such as necessary time, capital, or restrictions imposed by the method, limiting the resolution or novelty of produced tertiary structures. This work proposes the Adaptively-Branching Fuzzy Greedy K-means-Decision Forest (FGK-DF) model, which utilizes conserved sequential and structural motifs that transcend protein family boundaries, to predict the local tertiary structure of proteins with unknown structures.

In order to reduce the cost of regression testing, we propose a test case classification methodology based on k-means clustering with the purpose of classifying test cases into two groups of effective and non-effective test cases. The clustering strategy is based on Hamming distances measured over the differences between coverage information obtained for current and the previous releases of the program under test. Our empirical study shows that the clustering-based test case classification can identify effective test cases with high recall ratio and considerable accuracy percentage. The paper also investigates and compares the performance of the proposed clustering-based approach with various factors including coverage criteria and the weights factor used in measuring distances.

The estimation of the semantic similarity between words provides a valuable method to enable the understanding of texts. In the field of biomedical domains, using Ontologies have been very effective due to their scalability and efficiency. The problem of extracting knowledge from huge amount of data is recorded as an issue in the medical sector. In this paper, we aim to improve knowledge representation by using MeSH Ontology on medical theses data by analyzing the similarity between the keywords within the theses data and keywords after using the MeSH ontology. As a result, we are able to better discover the commonalities between theses data and hence, improve the accuracy of the similarity estimation which in return improves the scientific research sector. Then, K-means cluster algorithm was applied to get the nearest departments that can work together based on medical ontology. Experimental evaluations using 4,878 theses data set in the medical sector at Cairo University indicate that the proposed approach yields results that correlate more closely with human assessments than other by using the standard ontology (MeSH). Results show that using ontology correlates better, compared to related works, with the similarity assessments provided by experts in biomedicine.

Two main points are discussed in this approach: first is the application of HMM to the recognition system of human behaviors, and second is the effectiveness comparison of K-means and fuzzy C-means clustering algorithms. Three sample human behaviors are defined and the corresponded 3D data are collected using the Microsoft Kinect sensor (3D sensor). During these processing, we discuss the difference of k-means and fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms, and also we can see the results impacted by different clustering algorithms, the effectiveness of both clustering methods is shown through demonstrating the performance of our recognition system with HMM.

Therefore, facial expressions are the most important means of detecting emotions and behavioral analysis science. Although human being have ability recognize the face practically without any effort, but facial recognition system is still challenging by machine. This paper addresses the problem of detecting facial expressions of the human face through the analysis of images and subsequent application to video sequences. This work concentrates on the design of a facial expression detection system used to recognize facial emotions by focusing on the analysis of still images based on Morphological features and Minimum Distance Classifier (MDC) for classification.

This paper using multi-grid optimization and standard color-difference formulas transformed images from an initial color space to the new color space. The new working color space performance ability is tested in image segmentation, using ISODATA algorithm to get the k-means clustering algorithms best cluster number and the initial cluster center. After comparing with the exiting color spaces, the experiment results showed color attributes of the new space free of cross contamination and with maximum perceptual uniformity which can improve the image segmentation algorithms' accuracy.

Hadoop and some other cloud computing technologies make batch processing possible to process big data. Storm is like a real-time Hadoop. Storm model is easy, but it's difficult to deal with complex Topology due to the increasing inter-dependences between components. This paper proposes a novel method which simplifies the Storm Topology programming model by combining Spring with Storm. It provide a modular approach and a unified configuration model to build topologies and easy to use API for using Storm. Meanwhile, this paper propose a system to process data and realize the K-Means clustering algorithm in Storm. The practice results is shown and analyzed to prove the effectiveness of the system and model, at the same time it proves that Storm can improve the clustering algorithm processing speed.

However, its processing performance has usually encountered a bottleneck if used to deal with massive data. Since MapReduce as the most popular cloud computing parallel framework is effective to handle massive data, the researches of K-means clustering algorithm which is based on MapReduce become a focus for scholars. In this paper, an improved parallel K-means clustering algorithm is proposed based on MapReduce which improve the performance of traditional ones by decreasing the number of iterations and accelerating processing the speed of per iteration. Firstly, the authors put forward approach to decide the distance measure through comparing the Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance. And then, the authors give the method to select the initial centroids which are consistent with the distribution of the data. According to simulation, the improved parallel K-means algorithm based on MapReduce can achieve higher processing speed and stability than the traditional ones.

This paper presents an algorithm for the semiautomatic annotation of vehicle type that significantly reduces the time needed to annotate a dataset. Vehicles are automatically detected using a background subtraction GMM. The detected vehicles are classified into four main categories: car, van, bus and motorcycle. A vehicle observation vector is constructed from measurement-based features and an intensity-based pyramid HOG (histogram of orientation gradients). K-means clustering is used to initialize the labels of the collected data set. The output scores of a linear SVM classifier are used to identify low confidence samples, which are then manually annotated, significantly reducing the number of samples needing annotation. Experimental results of synthetic and real data set demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. The method is general enough so that it can be used in other classification problems and domains, e.g. pedestrian detection.

Derivation of tumor position in conventional lung tumor tracking strategies is realized via either placing external surrogates on patients or implanting internal fiducial markers in patients. Inaccurate tumor tracking and patient safety problems are often inevitable for these strategies. In this study, a novel marker-less tumor tracking strategy is presented for image-guided lung cancer radiotherapy. A fluoroscopic image is first decomposed into low-rank and sparse components based on robust-PCA via a split Bregman method. Then, a series of techniques, including K-means clustering, morphological processing, connected component analysis, etc are employed on obtained low-rank fluoroscopic images for tumor tracking. Clinical data obtained from 45 patients is incorporated for experimental evaluation. Promising results are demonstrated from the introduced strategy.

Humans are represented by a set of feature points sampled from upper bodies. The problem of appearance matching across multiple cameras is formulated as finding corresponding points in two upper bodies from different views based on dissimilarity of region signatures as well as geometric constraints between feature points. For dissimilarity of region signatures, we first use k-means clustering to describe the region around the feature point, then estimate the dissimilarity between different regions under integer optimization framework. For geometric constraints, we get the spatial information of feature points based on a scale and rotation invariant constraint method. Lastly, agglomerative clustering algorithm is used to find the correct cluster of candidate pairs. Our method is robust to both outliers and deformation, and the experimental results show promising matching results on multiple cameras.

It significantly reduces the dimensionality of represented images and shows outstanding performance even with randomly selected reference images and simple distance measure. In this paper, we improve upon existing work with two major contributions. First, we show that a more representative reference-set contributes to better classification accuracy. To this end, we carefully adapt the K-means clustering algorithm in the feature space to select a distinguished reference-set. Second, in the image classification process, we propose to represent each image by measuring its betweenness centrality in a social network composed of the representative reference-set in each class, leading to a more coherent distance measure that considers the overall connectivity between the probe image and the reference-set. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our proposed scheme achieves better performance than existing methods.

After extracting the spatio-temporal interest points (STIPs) from the visual scene through the 3D Harris detector, K-means clustering is applied to construct the visual codebook. We adopt a new feature selection procedure, called knowledge gain, based on the rough set theory to identify the most meaningful visual words in the codebook. For each video sequence, the histogram of selected visual words is used to train a multiclass SVM classifier. The algorithm is tested on two different datasets in order to demonstrate the applicability of the technique in different environmental configurations. Experimental results show that knowledge gain can improve the classification performance.	[Zhang, Bo; De Natale, Francesco G.

As a multi-category classification problem with unbalanced frequencies and variations, many machine learning approaches have been adopted with some low level features for traffic sign recognition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method using coding features for traffic sign recognition. First, we extract features(dense SIFT features, HOG features and LBP features) and encode them with a k-means generated codebook and LLC. Second, each traffic sign image is represented by the features generated by spatial pyramid matching (SPM). Then, all the image representations from each kind of features are concatenated together as the final image representation. Finally, we show that a linear SVM classifier trained with this image representation can achieve the state-of-the-art recognition rate of 99.67% on the well-known German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark.

Despite its popularity, however, application developers face numerous challenges in using the Hadoop framework, which stem from them having to effectively manage the resources of a Map Reduce cluster, and configuring the framework in a way that will optimize the performance and reliability of MapReduce applications running on it. This paper addresses these problems by presenting the Profiling and Performance Analysis-based System (PPABS) framework, which automates the tuning of Hadoop configuration settings based on deduced application performance requirements. The PPABS framework comprises two distinct phases called the Analyzer, which trains PPABS to form a set of equivalence classes of MapReduce applications for which the most appropriate Hadoop configuration parameters that maximally improve performance for that class are determined, and the Recognizer, which classifies an incoming unknown job to one of these equivalence classes so that its Hadoop configuration parameters can be self-tuned. The key research contributions in the Analyzer phase includes modifications to the well-known k - means + + clustering and Simulated Annealing algorithms, which were required to adapt them to the MapReduce paradigm. The key contributions in the Recognizer phase includes an approach to classify an unknown, incoming job to one of the equivalence classes and a control strategy to self-tune the Hadoop cluster configuration parameters for that job. Experimental results comparing the performance improvements for three different classes of applications running on Hadoop clusters deployed on Amazon EC2 show promising results.

The algorithm presented in this work uses level set Chan-Vese formulation, to establish the corresponding boundaries of the buildings. Level set segmentation tends to be sensitive on initialization, thus proper initialization can yield better segmentation results. In this work an effective procedure is performed using K-mean classifier in order to design and develop the initial level set contours. Morphological features are incorporated for refining the obtained outlines. Finally, the coordinates of each and every building are extracted along with additional information for the processed scene, like the number of buildings, as well as the center and area of each building.

Due to their simple control flow and inherent fine-grain parallelism, K-means algorithms are well suited for hardware implementations, such as on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), to accelerate the computationally intensive calculation. However, the available hardware resources in massively parallel implementations are easily exhausted for large problem sizes. This paper presents an FPGA implementation of an efficient variant of K-means clustering which prunes the search space using a binary kd-tree data structure to reduce the computational burden. Our implementation uses on-chip dynamic memory allocation to ensure efficient use of memory resources. We describe the trade-off between data-level parallelism and search space reduction at the expense of increased control overhead. A data-sensitive analysis shows that our approach requires up to five times fewer computational FPGA resources than a conventional massively parallel implementation for the same throughput constraint.

Based on the K-means algorithm, an automatic sample selection method is developed-while moving, the vehicle automatically selects new road samples and takes cluster analysis at a specified time interval to get the latest road features. Verified by experiments on campus roads, the proposed method is adaptive to the changes of road conditions. The influence of illumination, shadow, and road texture to the detection results is effectively reduced. Much less manual operations are needed compared to the traditional approaches based on learning algorithms.

But the ESPRIT algorithm can't be directly used for the wideband signal. The ESPRIT algorithm based on K-means introduces K-means algorithm to the wideband signal processing, which makes the ESPRIT algorithm can be directly used for estimating the wideband signal DOA. This method takes advantage of sub-band decomposition technique in wideband signal, then estimates DOA in each band by using the ESPRIT method, and finally uses the K-means method to get the DOA of broadband signal by clustering the results of each band. The ESPRIT algorithm based on K-means not only has a small measure error and a small amount of computing but also could estimate the DOA without knowing the signal's prior knowledge. Theoretical analysis and simulation show that the procedural validity of the algorithm.

The FPGA implements a compute node that uses partial dynamic reconfiguration to implement hardware accelerators that process data streaming from the SSD. Using K-means clustering as a representative data analytics workload, we show that a RASSD node is 1.3 -15.2 times faster than a commodity, multi-core, computer, and consumes 9.4 -201.9 times less energy. This suggests that using RASSD nodes in contemporary data centers can have a significant impact on performance and energy efficiency.

Cloud's Infrastructure as Service allows users to use hardware infrastructure (Compute, Network and Storage) and deploy their applications over a computing node as per demand. Users of High Performance Computing applications can take advantages of elasticity of cloud for their compute and data intensive HPC applications without deploying actual physical infrastructure. But virtualization technology degrades the performance of HPC applications. Most of the HPC applications distribute its workload among specified compute resources. To achieve better performance for an application, it is desirable to have homogeneity among the compute resources. Since in cloud environment the virtual machines are created dynamically as per customer needs, it is difficult to find homogeneous environment. In this work we are proposing a method to form cluster of heterogeneous compute resources for HPC base applications on cloud. Proposed method not only considers compute power also bandwidth among the resources. We observed homogeneity among the resources of the best cluster chosen by our method.	[Ashwini, J.

In the past few years, bag-of-visual-words model has been proven to be effective and efficient in multiple multimedia tasks including object retrieval, object detection and scene classification. The existing codebook constructing methods, like k-means or approximate k-means, suffer from information loss in vector quantization, and limit the retrieval performance. We try to improve the existing methods in both time efficiency and retrieval accuracy. By performing principal component analysis in initialization, clustering can start with a quasi-optimal solution. A leader clustering scheme is also proposed to reduce quantization loss, which leads to a compact and discriminative codebook. Our experiment showed that, the proposed method requires less training time and yields better performance in large-scale object retrieval.

These images can be categorized and ranked based on their relevant topics. In this paper, we present and compare candidate schemes for mining salient images related to a specific topic or object among a large number of images from a blogosphere. Identifying salient images consists of several steps: calculating the similarity between images, k-means clustering images, and ranking images. In each step, we propose a set of alternatives and as a result, present an optimal combination scheme by conducting an empirical comparison of the performance of each scheme. Furthermore, to address scalability, we also present a distributed version of the schemes and experimental results based on MapReduce on top of a Hadoop environment.

Clustering is an unsupervised classification technique that is used to group data on the basis of similarity measures. K-Means clustering is one of the methods which is used to classify given dataset in number of groups on the basis of Euclidean distance of data points in Cartesian system. On the basis of similarity and dissimilarity the data points are divided into multiple clusters which do not have identification labels. K means clustering can given a broadened insight into the data if the resulting groups bear some identification. A unique method for labeling unsupervised classes by using correlation analysis and frequent membership function is proposed. The method is applied to custom world energy dataset and divided world nations into five labeled clusters which increased the opportunities for energy sector to derive valuable patterns for guided decisions. The results showed minor deviations from the real energy scenario because of the factors discussed in the paper.

Image databases usually contain images with different characteristics, thus determining an optimal parameter setting of an algorithm is a challenging task. To overcome this problem we cluster the image databases. For each cluster an optimal parameter setting is determined for the same algorithm. We extract Haralick features from the image, and apply k-means clustering to obtain the clusters. We tested our approach on a publicly available database, where the proposed approach improved the performance of a state-of-the-art exudate detector.

However these methods need a wise technique to encode local features to make a global representation for video. For this, some methods use K-means vector quantization to histogram each video as a bag of word. Pooling is a way used for global representation of an image. This method pools the local image feature over some image neighborhood. In this paper we extend pooling method called 3D pooling for global representation of video. 3D pooling represents each video by concatenating pooled feature vectors achieved from 8 equal regions of video. We also applied stacked convolutional ISA as local feature extractor. We evaluated our method on KTH data set and got our best result using max pooling. It improves the performance of highly demanded earlier methods.

In order to overcome this shortcoming, this paper proposes a gray image segmentation method based on gray level histogram and AP clustering algorithm, named GLHAP. In the proposed algorithm, in order to decrease the input data of algorithm AP, only several high frequency gray values as the input data of the image are first obtained from the gray level histogram, and after processing the results of AP, image segmentation results can be obtained. Finally, the experiment results show that the proposed algorithm GLHAP is more effective and efficient than the compared with algorithms FCM and K-means.

In this piece of work, through the problem of image denoising, we are making a fair comparison between the usability of SGK and K-SVD.

In this paper, we first divide remote sensing image into 3 classes by GMM-MRF texture segmentation model, and then extract road by fuzzy connectedness. Finally, we use shape features and mathematical morphology to do the post-processing to remove false alarm area. Since fuzzy connectedness lacks regional structure factors, it can not accurately describe the pixel similarity. By introducing image texture feature to the concept of fuzzy connectedness, we can establish texture fuzzy connectedness concept to make it more accurate description of the degree of association among pixels, which reflects the characteristics of the local and regional pixel similarity. Besides, our method choose only one road seed point and can achieve better road extraction effectiveness than fuzzy connectedness without using segmentation algorithms, which usually needs more than 15 seed points. Experiments show that the proposed method can effectively eliminate the non-road areas that whose characteristics are similar to road, and it can obtain better performance for road extraction from high resolution remote sensing image compared with fuzzy c-means and mathematical morphology.

Spikes initiation and propagation in dendrites with stochastic ion channels contained rich nonlinear dynamic properties. In contrast to the differences of complexity between non-homologous spikes, high-dimensional features were extracted based on approximate entropy firstly. Then, the features were selected and the spikes were projected to the two-dimensional feature space. Finally, K-means cluster method was used to realize the pattern classification of spikes. The results of simulation and experiment show that the features extracted by approximate entropy as the classification basis is utility to discriminate between non-homologous spikes.

Control mechanisms such as the one regulating the heart rate can be deeply affected during epileptic seizures. This effect of epilepsy can be measured in the ECG signal. In this paper, ECG segments of 35 children suffering from refractory epilepsy are studied. The goal is to determine whether pre-ictal, ictal or post-ictal tachycardia is present in partial and generalized seizures. A new set of features extracted from the ECG is proposed. These features are derived by means of principal component analysis (PCA) of a matrix formed by consecutive QRS-complexes, and they measure the heterogeneity of the QRS along the ECG. This new set of features together with the RR interval series is used to detect seizure onsets. Three approaches are implemented, namely thresholding, k-means and kernel spectral clustering (KSC). The best positive predictive value (PPV) was 85.7% for partial seizures, and 57.3% for generalized seizures.

This work aims to automatically detect MA hinge points combining information of intra-cardiac local context and location relationships. The method includes the following steps: (1) segment left ventricle (LV) by prior shape and local histogram fitting based Active Contour Model (ACM); (2) design the local context features for training and classification of MA hinge points; (3) utilize additive min kernel based Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier for fast computation to obtain MA candidates; (4) estimate MA hinge points by K-means algorithm under the location constraint of LV and MA. Our method was tested on echocardiographic four chamber image sequence of 10 pediatric patients (6 boys, 4 girls, 7.6 +/- 3.4 years). Compared with the manual annotations, the automatically detected MA results are reliable with reasonable accuracy, for lateral point (2.0 +/- 1.9, 1.8 +/- 1.2) pixels and for septal point (2.9 +/- 2.6, 1.2 +/- 1.0) pixels.

Since performance of constrained clustering depends on a set of constraints to use, we need a method to select good constraints that are expected to promote clustering performance. In this paper, we propose such a method, which actively selects data pairs to be constrained by using variance of clustering iteration. This method consists of a boosting based cluster ensemble algorithm that integrates a set of clusters produced by a constrained k-means with controlled data assignment order. Experimental results show that our method outperforms clustering with random sampling method.

In this paper we derive the pseudo-granulometry and morphological covariance through a recent approach of multivariate mathematical morphology. We also discuss two issues arisen when applying these measures to color images i.e. the pertinence of the morphological opening operation for color images and the computation of the color image volume. We apply the proposed measures using a k-means classifier for the segmentation of color images of psoriasis lesions. We present our results and perform a comparison with other approaches.

Human activities include land usage, deforestation and wars. To study the impacts of wars we have to identify changes to land cover on the earth's surface. For this purpose, remote sensing technology has played a significant role to monitor land cover changes. This study conducted to examine the impacts of wars on land cover in the Halabja city in the northern part of Iraq (study area) using remote sensing technology. During the last thirty years, Iraq has been immensely influenced by several wars, including the Iran-Iraq War (1980 to 1988), the Gulf War and Early Sanctions (1990 to 1993), and Operation Iraqi freedom OIF (2008 to 2011). These wars have caused huge losses in life and economic and left an aftermath of physical devastation to the land. To study these changes along the study area, the Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ data acquired in 1990 and 2000 were used. A post-classification technique base on hybrid classification was utilized. After preprocessing an unsupervised K-means classification was carried out first on six reflective bands with the assistance of ancillary data for two images individually followed by maximum likelihood supervised classification to classify all images into five land cover classes; water bodies, vegetation fields, forests, built-up areas and bare lands. The ground truth information collected from Google earth images, visual interpretation and expert knowledge of the area were used to assess the accuracy of the classification images. The overall accuracy was measured to be 91 and 95% with Kappa Coefficient 0.8 and 0.9 for 1990 and 2000 respectively. Post-classification change detection technique was used to produce change image through cross-tabulation to assess changes between different land cover classes. During 1990-2000, cross-tabulation highlight that 54% of water bodies, 25% of forests, 26% of built-up areas and 5% of bare lands decreased whilst, the vegetation fields increased about 90%.

In this article, we present a new method of recognizing human actions by using Microsoft Kinect sensor, k-means clustering and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Kinect is able to generate human skeleton information from depth images; in addition, features representing specific body parts are generated from the skeleton information and are used for recording actions. Then k-means clustering assigns the features into clusters and HMMs analyze the relationship between these clusters. By doing this, we achieved action learning and recognition. According to our experimental results, the average accuracy was 91.4 %.

OBJECTIVE ASSESMENT OF DIFFERENT SEGMENTATION ALGORITHM FOR UNDERWATER IMAGES	2013 FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING, COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING TECHNOLOGIES (ICCCNT)			English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)	JUL 04-06, 2013	Tiruchengode, INDIA			Image segmentation; thresholding; edge detection; K-means; FCM; FCMT		the quality of underwater images is directly affected by water medium, atmosphere medium, pressure and Temperature. This emphasizes the necessity of image segmentation, which divides an image into parts that have strong correlations with objects to reflect the actual information collected from the real world. Image segmentation is the most practical approach among virtually all automated image recognition systems. Feature extraction and recognition have numerous applications on telecommunication, weather forecasting, environment exploration and medical diagnosis. Different segmentation techniques are available in the literature for segmenting or simplifying the underwater images. The performance of an image segmentation algorithm depends on its simplification of image. In this paper, different segmentation algorithms namely, edge based image segmentation, adaptive image thresolding, K-means segmentation, Fuzzy c means(FCM), and Fuzzy C Means with thresholding (FCMT) are implemented for underwater images and they are compared using objective assesment parameter like Energy, Discrete Entropy, Relative Entropy, Mutual Information and Redundancy. Out of the above methods the experimental results show that Fuzzy C means with Thresholding (FCMT) algorithm performs better than other methods in processing underwater images.

In this paper, we introduce the clustering method called soft clustering and its type Fuzzy C-Means. The clustering algorithms are improved by implementing the two different membership functions. The Fuzzy C-Means algorithm can be improved by implementing the Fuzzification parameter values from 1.25 to 2.0 and compared with different datasets using Davis Bouldin Index. The Fuzzification parameter 2.0 is most suitable for Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm than other Fuzzification parameter. The Fuzzy C-Means and K-Means clustering algorithms are implemented and executed in Matlab and compared with Execution speed and Iteration Count Methods. The Fuzzy C-Means clustering method achieve better results and obtain minimum DB index for all the different cluster values from different datasets. The experimental results shows that the Fuzzy C-Means method performs well when compare with the K-Means clustering.

It is a way of grouping data samples together that is similar in some way, according to some criteria that you pick. Swarm intelligence (SI) is a collective behavior of social systems like insects such as ants (ant colony optimization, ACO), fish schooling, honey bees (bee algorithm, BA) and birds (particle swarm optimization, PSO). In this paper, a hybrid Swarm Intelligence based technique for data clustering is proposed using Particle Swarm Optimization and Bee Algorithm. Recent studies have shown that hybridization of K-means and PSO are more suitable for clustering large data sets. As the k-means algorithm tends to converge faster than PSO algorithm but usually trapped in a local optimal area. A new way of integrating BA with PSO proposed in this paper.	[Dhote, C.

It is not one specific algorithm, but a general task to be solved which can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their notion of what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them. However the clustering is not easy task especially for the complex datasets like text mining where the information does not depends only on terms frequency. This paper presents an effective approach for dealing with similar problems. The proposed algorithm is a category dependent weighted seeds affinity clustering algorithm. The advantage of the proposed algorithm is that clusters can be easily modified according to the field of interest of the user. The superiority of the proposed algorithm is also validated by the simulation results comparison using Reuters-21578 dataset.

Verification and Validation of MapReduce Program model for Parallel K-Means algorithm on Hadoop Cluster	2013 FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING, COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING TECHNOLOGIES (ICCCNT)			English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Computing, Communications and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)	JUL 04-06, 2013	Tiruchengode, INDIA			Machine learning; Hadoop; MapReduce; k-means; wordcount; grep; terasort		With the development of information technology, a large volume of data is growing and getting stored electronically. Thus, the data volumes processing by many applications will routinely cross the petabyte threshold range, in that case it would increase the computational requirements. Efficient processing algorithms and implementation techniques are the key in meeting the scalability and performance requirements in such scientific data analyses. So for the same here, we have p analyzed the various MapReduce Programs and a parallel clustering algorithm (PKMeans) on Hadoop cluster, using the Concept of MapReduce. Here, in this experiment we have verified and validated various MapReduce applications like wordcount, grep, terasort and parallel K-Means Clustering Algorithm. We have found that as the number of nodes increases the execution time decreases, but also some of the interesting cases has been found during the experiment and recorded the various performance change and drawn different performance graphs. This experiment is basically a research study of above MapReduce applications and also to verify and validate the MapReduce Program model for Parallel K-Means algorithm on Hadoop Cluster having four nodes.

As the number of web users through mobile devices is increasing day by day, it is very challenging for the search engines to provide the specific result in response to user query. We present a clustering algorithm which is based on decision tree structure in order to improve the clustering results and visualize only the relevant results to the user. In this paper, the objective is to integrate domain ontology as background knowledge and study the clustering performance. We have computed multiple clusters using standard K - means based on various similarity metrics as well. Our results are compared with previous baseline approaches to find the performance and overheads. The experimental results show that more refinement to be done in the clustering technique to retrieve documents with fewer navigations and less data traffic, which is important especially for mobile devices.

Subsequently, reduction in plant diseases by early diagnosis results in substantial improvement in quality of the product. Erroneous diagnosis of disease and its severity leads to inappropriate use of pesticides. The goal of proposed work is to diagnose the disease using image processing and artificial intelligence techniques on images of grape plant leaf. In the proposed system, grape leaf image with complex background is taken as input. Thresholding is deployed to mask green pixels and image is processed to remove noise using anisotropic diffusion. Then grape leaf disease segmentation is done using K-means clustering. The diseased portion from segmented images is identified. Best results were observed when Feed forward Back Propagation Neural Network was trained for classification.

Detection of objects with regular geometry, such as circles from an image uses strict feature based detection. Using region based segmentation techniques such as K-Means has the inherent disadvantage of knowing the number of classes apriori. Contour based techniques such as Active contour models, sometimes used in remote sensing also has the problem of knowing the approximate location of the region and also the noise will hinder its performance. A template based approach is not scale and rotation invariant with different resolutions and using multiple templates is not a feasible solution. This paper proposes a methodology for object detection based on mean shift segmentation and non-parametric clustering. Mean shift is a non-parametric segmentation technique, which in its inherent nature is able to segment regions according to the desirable properties like spatial and spectral radiance of the object. A prior knowledge about the shape of the object is used to extract the desire object. A hierarchical clustering method is adopted to cluster the objects having similar shape and spatial features. The proposed methodology is applied on high resolution EO images to extract circular objects. The methodology found to be better and robust even in the cluttered and noisy background. The results are also evaluated using different evaluation measures.			sushmaleela@gmail.com					CHENG YZ, 1995, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V17, P790; Comaniciu Dorin, 2002, IEEE T PATTERN RECOG, V24; Dey V., 2010, ISPRS A, VXXXVIII; Karantzalos K, 2009, PHOTOGRAMM ENG REM S, V75, P667; Michel J., 2008, MULTISCALE SEGMENTAT; Michel J., 2008, QUALITATIVE SPATIAL; Yang M., 2008, PATTERN RECOGN, P43; Zhang Jun, 2008, ISPSR P JUL 4; Zhang K, 2005, PROC CVPR IEEE, P1001	9	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	2372-658X		978-1-4799-1588-0	NAT CONF COMPUT VIS			2013												4	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology	Computer Science; Engineering; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology	BC4GJ	WOS:000352485900120

High performance implementations of data mining algorithms; 2. Distributed data mining		Data mining (DM) techniques have developed in tandem with the telecommunications market. They are designed to analyze communication behaviors to enable personalized services and reduce customer churn. The major DM process uses data exploration technology to extract data, create predictive models using decision trees, and test and verify the stability and effectiveness of the models. The K-means method segments customers into clusters based on billing, loyalty and payment behaviors to create decision tree-based models. Determining the number of k clusters in a data set with limited prior knowledge of the appropriate value is a common problem that is distinct from solving data clustering issues. Several method categories exist to decide the value of k, but the optimal choice will maximally compress the data inside a single cluster and accurately assign each observation its own cluster. This paper presents a parallel approach for accelerating the determination of k in n observations. We introduce two methods for selecting the initial centroids that save computation iterations in K-means clustering: 1) Carrying centroids forward; 2) Minimum impact. Both approaches are designed to expedite K-means computing and the identification of k.

However, extant studies on document clustering still suffer from the problems of high dimensionality, scalability and accuracy. In this paper, we will present a novel association link network (ALN) based document clustering method, which is an adaptive iteration splitting process to discover core events on the web. In the iteration, we first detect community structures from ALN; then, map documents to the associated community based on words relations in ALN; finally rebuild communities using the mapped documents.

The proposed algorithm first presents a novel support vector machine based clustering approach, namely SVM-C, which uses the margin between two canonical hyperplanes for classification instead of using the Euclidean distance between two centroids of reference locations. After creating the clusters of fingerprints by SVM-C, our positioning system embeds the classification mechanism into a positioning task and compensates for the large database searching problem. The proposed algorithm assigns the matched cluster surrounding the test sample and locates the user based on the corresponding cluster's fingerprints to reduce the computational complexity and remove estimation outliers. Experimental results from realistic Wi-Fi test-beds demonstrated that our approach apparently improves the positioning accuracy. As compared to three existing clustering-based methods, K-means, affinity propagation, and support vector clustering, the proposed algorithm reduces the mean localization errors by 25.34%, 25.21%, and 26.91%, respectively.

Downloading a web page by a browser, instant messaging or file sharing generate huge amount of network traffic that carry valuable information on the most relevant topics that raise interest in individual users, user groups or the entire society. However, the analysis of this huge amount of unstructured textual data poses many challenges, especially if it is not possible to store the data off-line and real-time clustering is needed. In this paper, we propose a framework for real-time textual content clustering of different sources called documents over the Internet, including posts on Twitter and Facebook, blogs, web sites or other textual contents. To support real-time processing, we extend the spherical on-line K-means clustering algorithm with heuristic improvements: an adaptive dimension reduction technique is introduced to keep the dimension of the document space on a reasonable level, and the ability to open new and remove old clusters according to the actual demand is also added. The performance of our improved algorithm called ASKM (Adaptive Streaming K-Means) has been analyzed on a ground truth data set based on the catalog of Open Directory Project. Furthermore, we also consider a much more realistic scenario where only some parts of the Internet documents are available because of practical limitations of traffic capturing, resulting incomplete textual documents to be clustered. We also show that the proposed method can achieve reasonable good accuracy even in this practical case.

The prediction is based on decision factors derived from a historical movie database, followers count from Twitter, and sentiment analysis of YouTube viewers' comments. We label the prediction in three classes, Hit, Neutral and Flop, using Weka's K-Means clustering tool. Interesting patterns for prediction are generated by Weka's J48. Since our prediction is for movies yet to be released in summer 2013, the performance of the final results will be validated by a follow-up study.

In this paper, the concept of learner classification is considered on learning behavior and performance. There are two main processes for generating the classification model as follows: 1) Applying K-means clustering to analyze learning behaviors of each learner based on learner's profile from e-learning system; and 2) Applying a decision tree classifier to generate the learner classification model based on the learning behaviors and student's performance. The experimental results show that the learner classification model is achieved in 83.8% of precision, 85.4% of recall and 85.5% of F-measure.

Cluster analysis techniques, such as K-means can be used for large datasets distributed across several machines. The accuracy of K-means depends on the selection of seed centroids during initialization. K-means++ improves on the K-means seeder, but suffers from problems when it is applied to large datasets: (a) the random algorithm it employs can produce inconsistent results across several analysis runs under the same initial conditions; and (b) it scales poorly for large datasets. In this paper we describe a new Competitive K-means algorithm we developed that addresses both of these problems. We describe an efficient MapReduce implementation of our new Competitive K-means algorithm that we found scales well with large datasets. We compared the performance of our new algorithm with three existing cluster analysis algorithms and found that our new algorithm improves cluster analysis accuracy and decreases variance. Our results show that our new algorithm produced a speedup of 76 +/- 9 times compared with the serial K-means++ and is as fast as the Streaming K-means. Our work provides a method to select a good initial seeding in less time, facilitating accurate cluster analysis over large datasets in shorter time.

A distributed file system provides a global name space and stores data persistently, but it also introduces significant overhead. Several recent systems use DRAM to store data and tremendously improve the performance of cloud computing systems. However, both our own experience and related work indicate that a simple substitution of distributed DRAM for the file system does not provide a solid and viable foundation for data storage and processing in the datacenter environment, and the capacity of such systems is limited by the amount of physical memory in the cluster. To overcome the challenge, we construct VOLUME (Virtual On-Line Unified Memory Environment), a distributed virtual memory to unify the physical memory and disk resources on many compute nodes, to form a system-wide data substrate. The new substrate provides a general memory-based abstraction, takes advantage of DRAM in the system to accelerate computation, and, transparent to programmers, scales the system to handle large datasets by swapping data to disks and remote servers. The evaluation results show that VOLUME is much faster than Hadoop/HDFS, and delivers 6-11x speedups on the adjacency list workload. VOLUME is faster than both Hadoop/HDFS and Spark/RDD for in-memory sorting. For k-means clustering, VOLUME scales linearly to 160 compute nodes on the TH-1/GZ supercomputer.

While this phenomenon has a direct impact on the Quality of Service provided to customers, it also changes the patterns of resource utilization and reduces the amount of work per Watt consumed. Unfortunately, there has been only limited research into how performance interference affects energy-efficiency of servers in such environments. In reality, there is a highly dynamic and complicated correlation among resource utilization, performance interference and energy-efficiency. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis that quantifies the negative impact of performance interference on the energy-efficiency of virtualized servers. Our analysis methodology takes into account the heterogeneous workload characteristics identified from a real Cloud environment. In particular, we investigate the impact due to different workload type combinations and develop a method for approximating the levels of performance interference and energy-efficiency degradation. The proposed method is based on profiles of pair combinations of existing workload types and the patterns derived from the analysis. Our experimental results reveal a non-linear relationship between the increase in interference and the reduction in energy-efficiency as well as an average precision within +/-5% of error margin for the estimation of both parameters. These findings provide vital information for research into dynamic trade-offs between resource utilization, performance, and energy-efficiency of a datacenter.

Recent advances in educational technology has hinted at a means to measure learning efficiency, in terms of personalization of learner competency and capacity in terms of adaptability of observed practices, using raw data observed from study experiences of learners as individuals and as contributors in social networks. While accurate computational models that embody learning efficiency remain a distant and elusive goal, big data learning analytics approaches this goal by recognizing competency growth of learners, at various levels of granularity, using a combination of continuous, formative and summative assessments. This study discusses a method to continuously capture data from students' learning interactions. Then, it analyzes and clusters the data based on their individual performances in terms of accuracy, efficiency and quality by employing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm.

In this paper, we address the sensor clustering problem in the design of an autonomous MANET (aMANET) for energy-efficient data collection in wireless sensor networks. In the aMANET context, we formulate the network energy optimization as a weighted K-means clustering problem, and present a distributed technique called MADSEC (Mobility-Assisted Distributed SEnsor Clustering) for sensor clustering and data collection. MADSEC allows the mobile nodes to dynamically run a distributed clustering algorithm to reposition themselves and organize energy-efficient sensor clusters. Extensive NS-2 simulation results indicate that the proposed distributed clustering strategy is as effective as a theoretical centralized K-means clustering technique. Furthermore, MADSEC can at least double the network lifetime of LEACH, a well-known static clustering method.

CaSRA: An Algorithm for Cognitive Tethering in Dense Wireless Areas	2013 IEEE GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE (GLOBECOM)	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (Globecom)		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)	DEC 09-13, 2013	Atlanta, GA	IEEE				This paper investigates the performance gain obtained by creating a hotspot-slave configuration of nodes in densely populated areas. In doing so, a semi-distributed algorithm, referred to as CaSRA (Clustering and Spectrum assignment and Resource Allocation), that allows the hotspots to tether over locally available white-spaces is proposed. CaSRA, performs in three-steps: 1) clusters the nodes based on the K-means clustering algorithm, 2) assigns white-space spectrum to each cluster based on a distributed graph-coloring approach to maximize spectrum reuse, and 3) allocates physical layer resources to individual users based on local channel information. Unlike small cells (femtocells, relays, and WiFi networks), this approach does not require any additions to the existing infrastructure, but allows the nodes, themselves, to act as hotspots. Simulation results show that given fixed amount of network resources, the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the overall performance of network users.

Meanwhile, kernel methods have found common-place usage due to their nonlinear expressive power and elegant optimization formulation. Based on recent progress in learning high-level, class-specific features in unlabeled data, we improve upon the result by combining nonlinear kernels and multi-layer (deep) architecture, which we apply at scale. In particular, our experimentation is based on k-means with an RBF kernel, though it is a straightforward extension to other unsupervised clustering techniques and other reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. With the proposed method, we discover features distilled from unorganized images. We augment high-level feature invariance by pooling techniques.

By using pattern discovery and pattern synthesis on protein family sequences, conserved protein segments can be represented by Aligned Pattern Clusters (APC), which is more knowledgerich in statistical association comparing to probabilistic models. Such representation enabled us to exploit their co-occurrence on the same protein sequence to identify functional regions. In this paper, we developed an efficient algorithm to identify the frequently co-occurring patterns using only homologous protein sequences as input. We applied our algorithm to triosephosphate isomerase and ubiquitin for a detailed study. We found that the discovered co-occurring patterns are close in spatial distance in most cases, by comparing to corresponding 3D structures. We also found that the co-occurrence of patterns are biologically significant. Residues which play important and co-operative roles in the glycolytic pathway of triosephosphate isomerase and residues which are responsible for ubiquitination and ubiquitinbinding of ubiquitin are all covered in our co-occurring APCs. These results demonstrate the power of our algorithm to reveal the concurrent distant functional and structural relation of proteins sequences based on co-occurrence clusters of APCs.

To evaluate these resultant clusters for finding optimal number of clusters, properties such as cluster density, size, shape and separability are typically examined by some cluster validation methods. Mainly the aim of clustering analysis is to find the overall compactness of the clustering solution, for example variance within cluster should be a minimum and separation between the clusters should be a maximum. In this study, for k-means clustering we have developed a new method to find an optimal value of k number of clusters, using the features and variables inherited from datasets. The new proposed method is based on comparison of movement of objects forward/back from k to k+1 and k+1 to k set of clusters to find the joint probability, which is different from the other methods and indexes that are based on the distance. The performance of this method is also compared with some existing methods through two simulated datasets.

Proteins in nature have multiple classes according to the functions they perform. Many efforts have been made to cast the protein function prediction into a multi-label learning problem. This paper proposes a novel Cluster Tree based Multi-label Learning algorithm (CTML) for protein function prediction. The main idea is to compute a set of predictive labels associated at each node for multi-label prediction by using the k-means clustering techniques and the predictive functions via the learning data at the nodes. With the propagation of the predictive labels from the root node to the leaf node, the correlations between labels can be preserved. Experimental results on benchmark data (genbase and yeast datasets) show that the proposed CTML algorithm is effective in predicting protein functions. Moreover, the classification performance of the CTML algorithm is competitive against the other baseline multi-label learning algorithms.

A traffic characterization, called Digital Signature for Network Segment using Flow Analysis (DSNSF) is important to help Network Management in avoiding these problems. We propose two methods to generate a digital signature capable of describing the traffic behavior. For this purpose, we used the statistical method Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the clustering algorithm K-Means. The resulting DSNSFs are then submitted to testing with real data to evaluate its precision.

In the particular scenario of learning from unlabeled traffic data, some classic unsupervised clustering algorithms (e.g. K-Means and EM) have been applied but the reported results are unsatisfactory in terms of low accuracy. This paper presents a novel approach for the task, which performs clustering based on Random Forest (RF) proximities instead of Euclidean distances. The approach consists of two steps. In the first step, we derive a proximity measure for each pair of data points by performing a RF classification on the original data and a set of synthetic data. In the next step, we perform a K-Medoids clustering to partition the data points into K groups based on the proximity matrix. Evaluations have been conducted on real-world Internet traffic traces and the experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is more accurate than the previous methods.

First, using a cutoff rate analysis, we show that higher order constellations significantly improve the throughput performance of DCP in comparison with the binary constellation considered in past work. However, using a higher order constellation in the DCP setting requires estimation of the composite channel from the sensors at the Fusion Center (FC), which is not available in current DCP schemes. We propose two blind algorithms for channel estimation, namely, a power method and a modified K-means algorithm. In particular, the latter is computationally efficient and converges significantly faster and more accurately than the conventional K-means algorithm. We derive closed-form expressions for the probability of symbol error and study the performance of DCP both analytically and through simulations. Our simulation results show that even at moderate to low SNRs, the modified K-means algorithm achieves a probability of error comparable to that achievable with a perfect channel estimate at the FC. The proposed DCP and blind channel estimation schemes are thus a promising technique for energy-efficient data fusion in wireless sensor networks.

Throughout the years several techniques like k-means clustering, watershed segmentation and quad tree segmentation have been devised to properly segment an image into well-defined classes. Segmentation techniques can be broadly classified as thresholding techniques, edge detection techniques, clustering, region based and matching. Image segmentation may be the ultimate output desired and may also be a penultimate step in the algorithm. In either case it becomes essential to get an accurately segmented image which is often not the case with the existing algorithms since each algorithm has its own drawback. In our paper we have proposed a novel segmentation technique that is bio-inspired from the behavioral nature of ants and is hence called the Ant Weight Lifting (AWL) segmentation algorithm. Our segmentation algorithm has generated optimum results on a wide range of test cases imposed by us with a high correlation factor between the original and segmented image and also an added perk in the form of a low time complexity.

There are many image segmentation methods in use but most of the prevalent techniques are not very efficient. In our current work, a method is proposed to segment images using multi-threaded programming and k-means clustering. Parts of images are used as a thread and k-means clustering is used to segment them on every thread. An efficient image segmentation technique using the multi-threaded program is done in this paper. These results are compared with segmentation results without multi-threading. The obtained results are very much encouraging.

It is a conceptualization of domain and its terms and relationships. The technique of ontology finds its application in almost every area, some of which includes medicine, e-commerce, chemistry, education etc. Concept clustering is the foremost step in construction of ontology. Concept clustering is usually a manual process involves labor and time intensive task. Hence there is a need for automatic grouping of concepts for ontology construction. In this paper, automatic concept clustering is attempted through data mining clustering techniques. The training set for the concepts formation of ontology structure is obtained from zoo dataset in UCI Machine Learning Repository. The clustering techniques are implemented through Weka 3.7.6, an open source data mining tool. Performance of clustering techniques viz., EM, Farthest First and K-Means are analyzed. It is found that Farthest-First clustering technique yielded the best performance with an accuracy of 93.0693 %. The methodology proposed in this paper can be adopted for any other case study also.

PSO is used to minimize the following error functions in a nested form (i) Mean squared error between the covariance matrix of the set of complete records and the covariance matrix of the set of total records including imputed ones. (ii) Absolute difference between the determinants of the two covariance matrices. The algorithm is designed to stop only when these two errors become very small across two consecutive iterations. The proposed method was tested on several regression, classification and banking datasets using 10 fold cross validation. The quality of the imputation is tested by using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) value. We compared the results of the proposed method with that of a hybrid data imputation method based on K-means and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP). We observed that while the the proposed preserves the covariance structure of the data, it achieved better imputation in most of the datasets as evidenced by the Wilcoxon signed rank test to test the statistical significance of the results.

Iterative clustering with K-Means has more Execution time. To avoid such, A Parallel Partitioning of enhanced K-Means algorithm using OpenMP is proposed to handle the outliers with optimized execution time without affecting the accuracy. The experiments are performed on diabetes, soya beans and supermarket by considering multi-core systems with 768, 683 and 4627 instances respectively. The proposed method outperforms with an accuracy of 74.76% for diabetes dataset with an execution time of 56secs, soya beans datasets with an accuracy of 82.34% with an execution time 54secs and supermarket datasets with an accuracy of 80.45% with 54secs of execution time.

In data mining, a cluster is a set of data objects that are similar to one another with in a cluster and are different to the entities in the former clusters. Clustering is the efficient method in data mining in order to process huge data sets. The core methodology of clustering is used in many domains like academic result analysis of institutions. Also, the methods are very well suited in machine learning, clustering in medical dataset, pattern recognition, image mining, information retrieval and bioinformatics. The clustering algorithms are categorized based upon different research phenomenon. Varieties of algorithms have recently occurred and were effectively applied to real-life data mining problems. This survey mainly focuses on partition based clustering algorithms namely k-Means, k-Medoids and Fuzzy c-Means In particular, they applied mostly in medical data sets.

When the number of descriptors is large, as is often the case, computing these distances can be extremely time consuming. In this paper we propose the SIFTpack: a compact way of storing SIFT descriptors, which enables significantly faster calculations between sets of SIFTs than the current solutions. SIFTpack can be used to represent SIFTs densely extracted from a single image or sparsely from multiple different images. We show that the SIFTpack representation saves both storage space and run time, for both finding nearest neighbors and for computing all distances between all descriptors.

Finding the center/average of a population of such matrices is a common theme in many algorithms such as clustering, segmentation, principal geodesic analysis, etc. The center of a population of such matrices can be defined using a variety of distance/divergence measures as the minimizer of the sum of squared distances/divergences from the unknown center to the members of the population. It is well known that the computation of the Karcher mean for the space of SPD matrices which is a negatively-curved Riemannian manifold is computationally expensive. Recently, the LogDet divergence-based center was shown to be a computationally attractive alternative. However, the LogDet-based mean of more than two matrices can not be computed in closed form, which makes it computationally less attractive for large populations. In this paper we present a novel recursive estimator for center based on the Stein distance - which is the square root of the LogDet divergence - that is significantly faster than the batch mode computation of this center. The key theoretical contribution is a closed-form solution for the weighted Stein center of two SPD matrices, which is used in the recursive computation of the Stein center for a population of SPD matrices. Additionally, we show experimental evidence of the convergence of our recursive Stein center estimator to the batch mode Stein center. We present applications of our recursive estimator to K-means clustering and image indexing depicting significant time gains over corresponding algorithms that use the batch mode computations. For the latter application, we develop novel hashing functions using the Stein distance and apply it to publicly available data sets, and experimental results have shown favorable comparisons to other competing methods.

First, we propose hyper-pooling strategies that encode the frame descriptors into a representation of the video sequence in a stable manner. Our best choices compare favorably with regular pooling techniques based on k-means quantization. Second, we introduce a technique to improve the ranking. It can be interpreted either as a query expansion method or as a similarity adaptation based on the local context of the query video descriptor. Experiments on public benchmarks show that our methods are complementary and improve event retrieval results, without sacrificing efficiency.

The image boundaries are first extracted via superpixels as likely cues for background templates, from which dense and sparse appearance models are constructed. For each image region, we first compute dense and sparse reconstruction errors. Second, the reconstruction errors are propagated based on the contexts obtained from K-means clustering. Third, pixel-level saliency is computed by an integration of multi-scale reconstruction errors and refined by an object-biased Gaussian model. We apply the Bayes formula to integrate saliency measures based on dense and sparse reconstruction errors. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against seventeen state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision and recall. In addition, the proposed algorithm is demonstrated to be more effective in highlighting salient objects uniformly and robust to background noise.

J	Liu, LQ; Wang, L			IEEE	Liu, Lingqiao; Wang, Lei			A Scalable Unsupervised Feature Merging Approach to Efficient Dimensionality Reduction of High-dimensional Visual Data	2013 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION (ICCV)	IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)	DEC 01-08, 2013	Sydney, AUSTRALIA	IEEE, CVF, IEEE Comp Soc, APRS, Australiasn Natl Univ, NICTA, FACE++, Natl Robot Engn Ctr, Google, Disney Res, nVIDIA, Raytheon BBN Technologies, Facebook, Adobe, Kitware, OMRON, SRI Int				To achieve a good trade-off between recognition accuracy and computational efficiency, it is often needed to reduce high-dimensional visual data to medium-dimensional ones. For this task, even applying a simple full-matrix-based linear projection causes significant computation and memory use. When the number of visual data is large, how to efficiently learn such a projection could even become a problem. The recent feature merging approach offers an efficient way to reduce the dimensionality, which only requires a single scan of features to perform reduction. However, existing merging algorithms do not scale well with high-dimensional data, especially in the unsupervised case. To address this problem, we formulate unsupervised feature merging as a PCA problem imposed with a special structure constraint. By exploiting its connection with k-means, we transform this constrained PCA problem into a feature clustering problem. Moreover, we employ the hashing technique to improve its scalability. These produce a scalable feature merging algorithm for our dimensionality reduction task. In addition, we develop an extension of this method by leveraging the neighborhood structure in the data to further improve dimensionality reduction performance. In further, we explore the incorporation of bipolar merging - a variant of merging function which allows the subtraction operation - into our algorithms. Through three applications in visual recognition, we demonstrate that our methods can not only achieve good dimensionality reduction performance with little computational cost but also help to create more powerful representation at both image level and local feature level.

An inverted file is built by a quantizer such as k-means or a tree structure. It has been found that multiple inverted files, obtained by multiple independent random quantizers, are able to achieve practically good recall and speed. Instead of computing the multiple quantizers independently, we present a method that creates them jointly. Our method jointly optimizes all codewords in all quantizers. Then it assigns these codewords to the quantizers. In experiments this method shows significant improvement over various existing methods that use multiple independent quantizers. On the one-billion set of SIFT vectors, our method is faster and more accurate than a recent state-of-the-art inverted indexing method.

In order to detect the background color, K-means clustering in YCbCr color space is firstly used to classify the background colors into a limited number of clusters. Then the spatial information is further used to refine the background and minimize the unknown regions. In this case, an image can be automatically segmented into three hard regions: foreground, background and unknown regions. For transitional (unknown) regions, the alpha matting based on Wang's robust matting algorithm is utilized to refine the accuracy of the separation results. By combining an automatical background determination metric and Wang's robust matting, the proposed matting method can handle images with single-colored or gridded background. The required user input is significantly simplified compared to conventional alpha matting schemes which require users to provide a hard image segmentation manually.

In this paper, we make full use of the polarization characteristics of SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data to detect urban construction area. First, circular polarization correlation coefficient characteristics, entropy characteristics based on the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and the dihedral angle scattering characteristics using the Pauli decomposition are extracted to distinguish among urban area, forest area and other manmade targets. And then we adopt the three kinds of characteristic to form feature vector and complete urban area detection based on k-means clustering analysis. The experimental result has proved the efficiency of this method.

These difficulties do not concede to its necessity for almost all kinds of modeling approaches using point-cloud. However, the criteria to justify the quality of a clustering result are not much studied. In this paper, we first propose a point-cloud segmentation algorithm using adapted k-means to cluster normal vectors obtained from tensor voting. Then we concentrate on how to use a non-parametrical criterion to validate the clustering results, which is an approximation of the information introduced by the clustering process. Compared with other approaches, we use noisy point-cloud obtained from moving laser range finders directly, instead of reconstruction of 3d grid-cells or meshing. Moreover, the criterion does not rely on the assumption of distributions of points. We show the distinguishable characteristics using the proposed criteria, as well as the better performance of the novel clustering algorithm against other approaches.

This paper proposed a method of obstacle detection, taking use of the four-line laser radar. This algorithm combined the improved DBSCAN with K-Means and overcame DBSCAN's defect that it couldn't divide obstacles with similar density. At the same time, this method can eliminate noise points effectively. Based on clustering, obstacle's information can be acquired, such as angle, distance and size, to achieve the task of obstacle detection. The algorithm is applied to obstacle detection in intelligent vehicle. The test proved that it is consistent and reliable, which complies with the requirement of intelligent vehicle's autonomous driving.

Object localization searches and segments the region of interest of license plate automatically and eases the subsequent recognition phase where each character of the license plate can be identified accurately. Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) and Bag-of Words (BoW) feature descriptors are combined and clustered by using K-means clustering to form a novel way of localizing the license plate's region in an image. The proposed work has been tested on Malaysian license plate datasets in both of off-line and on-line modes, where the offline mode denoted by stand-still image test captured in out-door environment, while the online mode denoted by the video and webcam tests. The obtained results showed that the proposed method can achieve up to 90.69%, 90.32% and 98% of accuracy rates for the license plate localization in standstill image, video and webcam tests subsequently. The results also demonstrate that the proposed method is more promising than the standard SURF.

In parallel, the input data set is classified by Support Vector Machines (SVM). Furthermore, the result of the segmentation and clustering steps are combined with the result of SVM through majority voting within each object. The final classification map is made by using majority voting between three produced classification maps. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can significantly improve SVM and other studied methods in terms of accuracies.	[Ghamisi, P.; Benediktsson, J.

Because the different clusters are contained in different subspace of the same hyper-dimensional data, the clustering processing in different subspace is conducted by genetic K-means algorithm (KGA). The clustering results from different subspace can be combined into decision string. The proposed subspace clustering based on decision fusion strategy is conducted on decision string. Considering the selection of subspace, the decision results may be inaccurate. So by the majority voting processing for different subspace, the steady subspace combination can be determined. Finally, the weighted strategy is introduced into SCDFS algorithm to evaluate the distance of different decision string, and determine the fusion clustering result.

Firstly, we obtain water segmentation image by combining the bottom-up and the top-down visual attention mechanisms. Secondly, we detect ship targets based on bottom-up the visual attention mechanism. The interested regions are extracted by measuring the visual conspicuity of each water regions. Then, the ships targets are detected in the interested regions by the k-means clustering algorithm. Finally, real SAR image is used to test our algorithm. Besides, we analysis the ship detection results using different band. The experiment results indicate that our algorithm can effectively detect ship targets from SAR images and C-band is superior to L-band in SAR image ship detection.

The states of the Hidden Markov Model and codebook symbols are computed without a priori knowledge thanks to K-means algorithms. The system is tested on database signals from the Marel-Carnot station that registers water characteristics at high frequency resolution. The experiments show that, when the states are set to two, these correspond to phytoplankton productive and non-productive periods. Moreover, when states are set to five, these correspond to the dynamics of phytoplankton blooms.

In this paper, we propose a novel topic model based on sparse coding for segmenting different kinds of land covers. Different from conventional topic models which generally assume each local feature descriptor is related to only one visual word of the codebook, our method utilizes sparse coding to characterize the potential correlation between the descriptor and multiple words. Therefore each descriptor can be represented by a small set of words. Furthermore, in this paper probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) is applied to learn the latent relation among word, topic and document due to its simplicity and low computational cost. Experimental results on remote sensing image segmentation demonstrate the excellent superiority of our method over k-means clustering and conventional pLSA model.

Most of the research effort is adapted to the specific application requirements and available datasets. In this paper we present a comparative analysis of different classification techniques for building block extraction. Our dataset includes aerial orthophotos (with spatial resolution 20cm), a DSM generated from LiDAR (with spatial resolution 1m and elevation resolution 20 cm) and DTM (spatial resolution 2m) from an area of Athens, Greece. The classification methods tested are unsupervised (K-Means, Mean Shift), and supervised (Feed Forward Neural Net, Radial-Basis Functions, Support Vector Machines). We evaluated the performance of each method using a subset of the test area. We present the classified images, and statistical measures (confusion matrix, kappa coefficient and overall accuracy). Our results demonstrate that the top unsupervised method is the Mean Shift that performs similarly to the best supervised methods.

To address this, recent work utilizes random point process theory to develop a probabilistic theory of clustering. The theory fully parallels Bayes decision theory for classification: given a known underlying processes and specified cost function there exist Bayes clustering operators with minimum expected error. Clustering is hence transformed from a subjective activity to an objective operation. In this work, we present conditions under which the optimization function utilized in classical k-means clustering is optimal in the new Bayes clustering theory, and thus begin to understand this algorithm objectively.

Histopathological Prostate Tissue Glands Segmentation for Automated Diagnosis	2013 IEEE JORDAN CONFERENCE ON APPLIED ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES (AEECT)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Jordan Conference on Applied Electrical Engineering and Computing Technologies (AEECT)	DEC 03-05, 2013	Amman, JORDAN	IEEE Jordan Sect	Univ Jordan, Fac Engn & Technol	Prostate tissue; Gleason grading; gland segmentation; Naive Bayes classifier		In this work, we propose a methodology for segmenting glands automatically in digitized images of histopathological prostate tissue for grade classification. Gleason grading describes the abnormality of cancer cells and their degree of aggressiveness by using numerical scale from grade 1 that represents benign tissues through grade 5 for tissues characterized as advanced stage cancer. The special characteristics of glands in prostate tissue for each grade play a significant role in discriminating Gleason grades. Therefore, lumen objects and tissue glands were segmented as the major regions of interest for tissue grading. Lumen objects were segmented by an empirical thresholding technique. Since we are mainly concerned with the inner regions of the glands consisting of the lumen, cytoplasm and the inner boundary of the cell nuclei, a k-means clustering approach was employed to the a* color channel of the L* a* b* color model for each of the tissue images. This was followed by statistical and morphological features extraction for the segmented lumen objects and glands. Finally, a naive Bayes classifier was used to classify tissue images to the correct grade. The efficiency of the automated segmentation method was evaluated, and classification results achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 91.66%, 96.66%, and 95.00%, respectively. These results indicate that our automated methodology could serve as an adjunct to histopathologists and would have a positive impact when integrated with conventional histopathological diagnosis procedures.

The disease is caused by the bacterial pathogen Xylella fastidiosa. Spread of the disease may lead to early fall and determinate growth of the trees. The symptoms of the disease may first appear on branches and leaves and it spreads to other parts of the plant on a later stage. So detection of the infected areas of the plant leads to early analysis and elimination of disease spread and saves the plant from disease spread. Proposed scheme uses a novel approach to detect the infected areas of the plant by segmenting the plant leaves by clustering. K-means clustering is performed for different cluster centres to obtain different cluster groups of the region of interest (ROI).

Current researches are mainly based on the simply assumption that the values of uncertain object meets some conventional distribution, such as Gaussian distribution. However, the statistical distribution of sensor data streams cannot be described accurately in many cases. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for probability density fitting about continuous uncertain sensor data streams, which based on GMM. Experiments show that this algorithm can meet the time requirement of actual sensing application and improve the fitting effect on the probability density of the value uncertain object.

From cloud computing to cloud services, "cloud" has led an industrial revolution, and various cloud services emerge endlessly. The cloud computing technology and service innovation in China is in rapid development and areas across the country are advancing corresponding cloud computing and cloud service plans. But with the continued growth of cloud service type and quantity, users are faced with the challenge of how to choose the best cloud services. Based on the analysis of the cloud service, this paper introduces the concept of user community, and combining the collaborative filtering of classical recommendation algorithm and improved K-Means clustering algorithm, it puts forward a new cloud service recommendation algorithm CSRA. A lot of experiments show that under different matrix density and scale of data sets, the mean absolute error of CSRA is smaller than that of UPCC and IPCC, and it has more efficient service to recommend.

On the other side, the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) has seen much enthusiastic development as a device for general-purpose intensive parallel computation. In this paper we propose a framework which combines both approaches and evaluates the relevance of having nodes in a distributed processing cluster that make use of GPU units for further fine-grained parallel processing. We have engineered parallel and distributed versions of two data mining problems, the naive Bayes classifier and the k-means clustering algorithm, to run on the framework and have evaluated the performance gain. Finally, we also discuss the requirements and perspectives of integrating GPUs in a distributed processing cluster, introducing a fully distributed heterogeneous computing cluster.

The complexity is reduced by reducing the size of the image to 1 by 4. Discrete Wavelet Transform is applied to face images and divided into four blocks and the energy of each block is calculated. Block energy is maximized and enhanced image is obtained. In this paper K Means clustering algorithm is used to cluster the pixels in face image obtained from preprocessing step. Binary threshold is applied in the clusters. The performance of the proposed method is tested using Fuzzy K Nearest Neighbour classifier and face recognition accuracy rate is computed. Testing is done using ORL face database.

Energy efficient data collection method is very important to operate wireless sensor networks for a long time. This paper proposes a novel data collection method for large Wireles sensor networks and ubiquities applications. A typical data collection tour using a mobile sink starts from a sensor node nearby a base station, travels all nodes of wireless sensor network by visiting each node, returns to the base sation and uploads collected data to the base station. This method is time inefficient and each node spends battery power quickly. A novel data collection method is proposed to increase energy efficiency using a mobile sink. The simulation result shows that the proposed data collection method decreases the energy consumption level by prolonging the lifetime of wireless sensor networks to 15 percents compared with LEACH.

Although more and more 3d applications are made but they are not still enough quality and comfort viewing. There is rising demand for new algorithms to generate stereoscopic video. Stereoscopic video is an illusion effect of the human eye due to the difference in the perception of the left and right eye images which leads to stereo effect. The purpose of this work is to generate low quality of stereoscopic video from the monoscopic video. Input source video to estimate the depth map based on motion vectors (MV), K-means color quantization and segmentation map to get a stereo video which is also known as 3D video. Later fusion with depth and segmentation map is a step to get the final depth map. Filtering is applied to final depth map to avoid the clipping effect in the next step. Finally to synthesize the left-view and the right-view video using the estimated depth map, we compute the parallax value for each pixel in an video from the estimated depth map.

To control acid rain pollution and to protect the ecological environment, it is a major need to identify the occurrence of acid rains. This paper presents a methodology for identifying the occurrence of acid rain using pH values calculated from normality by applying k-means clustering and haar wavelet transform on the satellite imagery of water vapor, SO2 and NO2. If the computed pH value lies in the range of 1 <= pH <= 5, it is identified as acid rain. The resulted outcome indicates that the amount of rainfall with the concentration of SO2 and NO2 have a strong influence on the occurrence of acid rains.

It is very hard to wade through the large number of returned documents in a response to a user query. This leads to the need to organize a large set of documents into categories through clustering. There is a need of efficient clustering algorithms for organizing documents. Clustering on large dataset can be effectively done using partitional clustering algorithms. The K-means algorithm is the appropriate partitional clustering approach for handling large dataset because of its efficiency with respect to execution time. But this algorithm is highly susceptible to the selection of initial positions of cluster centers. This paper introduces a new hybrid method using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) combined with an improved K-means algorithm for document clustering. We have tested K-means, PSO, our proposed PSOK, KPSO and KPSOK algorithms on various text document collections. The document range varies from 204 to 878 in the dataset and the terms ranges from 5804 to 7454. There is clear evidence from our results that the proposed method achieves better clustering than other methods taken for study.

In general Feature based image registration techniques involves Feature detection, matching, transformation model estimation, image resampling and transformation. Very little work has been done in the area of transformation model estimation compared to wide range of techniques available in Feature Detection and matching. While RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) and LMS (Least Median of Squares) are the most commonly used methods for robust global transformation estimation in affine and perspective transformations, research is going on for the methods that would do well in the presence of a very high number of outlier data and overcome the disadvantages of these state of art techniques. This motivated us to develop a new algorithm which not only uses the spatial relations between the feature points but also make use of the image intensity profiles for robust model estimation even in presence of outliers. In current approach, first the Euclidean distances created by the matched feature points is clustered and matching error for each cluster is computed using intensity information. The feature point pairs of the cluster having minimum error are retained. Now by applying mean filtering followed by recursive least square approximation, the transformation model is estimated. The efficiency of the proposed methodology is demonstrated on different datasets under different transformations & for different areas of application. The method has shown significant improvements in accuracy compared to other existing techniques even in the presence of large number of outliers.

This mission is predominant in reconnaissance, but also in responsibilities fluctuating from the investigation of scientific data to the observing of unsurprisingly happening events, and from controlling engineering procedures to noticing human behavior. We will refer to this observing procedure with the determination of classifying remarkable manifestations, as event detection, analysis and classification. With the appearance of personal computers (PCs), a lot of efforts have been made to substitute manual investigation by a computerized manner. Data, nevertheless, have become gradually difficult, and the sizes of gathered data have become enormously bulky in latest years. Text documents, JPEG images, MP3, videos and even relational data are now regularly gathered. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for event detection, analysis and classification in machine vision. Till proposed algorithm is deliberated a significant facility, required degree of event detection cannot be achieved. Finally, we use K-means algorithm for classification of incoming events and proposed algorithm has been validated by Z Formal specification language in general. The proposed algorithm has been implemented in Matlab and results have been gathered through a data mining tool. Using the proposed algorithm, the events are easily detected, analyzed and classified in machine vision.

In the context of GIS, similar objects in a cluster share certain common characteristics such as proximity and 'importance' in relation to some purpose. We consider a special case of "spatial groups" pertaining to a common purpose in this paper. Given the data that have different densities distributed over a geographical area, how unique groups could be formed over them in order to maximize the total coverage by these groups. By maximizing the coverage, applications could be either destructive or constructive by intension; e.g. a jet fighter pilot needs to make a real- time critical decision at a split of second to locate several separate targets to hit in order to cause maximum damage, when it flies over an enemy terrain; a town planner is considering where to station certain resources (sites for schools and hospitals, security patrol routes, air-born food ration drops for humanitarian aid, etc.) for maximum effect, given a vast area of different distribution of densities for benevolent purposes. An optimized grouping algorithm developed by the authors in linear programming is compared with classical K-means, over two different case studies in this paper.

It is an essential step of knowledge discovery in databases or KDD process. One of the popular data mining techniques is Clustering in which different objects are assigned to groups (clusters) depending on their characteristics. It is a type of unsupervised learning which helps in pattern recognition so that objects in one group behave in a similar manner and are different from the other. The novelty of the paper comes from the fact that it shows a way to perform Clustering using Microsoft Excel files which are used to store the data sets. KD - trees are also used to speed up the Clustering process. A new tool is devised which has various advantages over the most widely used tool WEKA.

It is a descriptive task that aims to identify groups of similar objects based on the values of their attributes. K-mean algorithm is the most popular partitioning algorithm. As in k-mean algorithm we have to specify the number of clusters in advance. Practically which is very difficult and it also cause performance degradation. With k-mean algorithm we can not find optimal number of clusters. In this paper a new automatic k-detection algorithm(AKD) is proposed which can automatically calculate the number of cluster at run time. This algorithm use the concept of splitting and merging of clusters. For merging the clusters a threshold value is employed while for splitting the clusters standard deviation is used. This algorithm can calculate optimal number of clusters during run time. Experimental results demonstrate that automatic kdetection algorithm can calculate the value of number of clusters (k) automatically and this algorithm also reduces the sum of square error with in cluster. Automatic kdetection algorithm can generate more compact clusters as compare to k-mean algorithm.

Several studies have been carried out in data mining field to improve the capability of data analysis on huge datasets. Cancer is one of the most fatal diseases in the world. Lung Cancer with high rate of accurance is one of the serious problems and biggest killing disease in India. Prediction of occurance of the lung cancer is very difficult because it depends upon multiple attributes which could not be analyzedeasily. In this paper a real time lung cancer dataset is taken from SGPGI (Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences) Lucknow. A realtime dataset is always associated with its obvious challenges such as missing values, highly dimensional, noise, and outlier, which is not suitable for efficient classification. A clustering approach is an alternative solution to analyze the data in an unsupervised manner. In this current research work main focus is to develop a novel approach to create accurate clusters of desired real time datasets called Foggy K-means clustering. The result of the experiment indicates that foggy k-means clustering algorithm gives better result on real datasets as compared to simple k-means clustering algorithm and provides a better solution to the real world problem.

Detection of Dropped Non Protruding Objects in Video Surveillance Using Clustered Data Stream	2013 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RECENT TRENDS IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (ICRTIT)	International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology (ICRTIT)	JUL 25-27, 2013	Chennai, INDIA			Computer vision; object tracking; Object detection; Gaussian mixture model; dropped object detection; k-means method	PERIODIC MOTION	As more and more surveillance cameras are deployed in a facility or area the demand for automatic detection of suspicious objects is increasing. Most of the work in recent literature concentrated on protruding object detection in video sequences. This paper proposes a novel approach to detect protruding as well as non protruding objects in sequences of walking pedestrians based on texture of the foreground objects. Initially static background is modeled with the help of mixture of Gaussian algorithm and the foreground objects are segmented. Later object is detected frame by frame which is followed by the calculation of statistical parameters such as mean and standard deviation, in every blob, to form data streams. These parameters are clustered online using k-means methodology over data streams, in order to find the outliers (dropped objects). Here k is based on the number of objects present in the video. Finally we have implemented on a standard data set from the website Video Surveillance Online Repository [15] and also our own dataset. The experimental results show that our system performs reasonable well and can accurately detect dropped objects in video data streams.

Indian Railways is using various information technology based systems to maintain and manage its infrastructural resources, leading to generation and accumulation of voluminous data. The data captured is expected to possess hidden meaning and trend which, if properly explored and modelled, can aid in implementing the new paradigm called Predictive Maintenance and Management. The thrust to usher in the new paradigm amply manifests in its Vision 2020 statement, too. The paper aims to showcase a methodology using Clustering, a Data Mining Technique that can bring in a maintenance plan built upon the predictive behaviour exhibited by failure data. The model outlined here has been tested on actual failure data pertaining to passenger carrying vehicles of trains.	[Antony, J.

First, the mixing matrix is estimated by employing the K-means algorithm on single-source-points with higher energies. Then, the time-frequency points that incorporate one source, which can be used to approximately denote the source signals that include main information of them, are found out by employing a novel metrics transform separation algorithm. Next, the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients of these signals as well as the referenced signal are extracted respectively. And here we will get the index of the target signal which has the maximum similarity to the referenced signal. After that, we apply the metrics transform step by step to find the time-frequency points that incorporate two sources, three sources and so on. A key point is that only those points which contain the contributions of the target signal will be processed. Finally the target signal is obtained through the inverse short-time Fourier transform. Compared with existing methods, our approach can be used even for the case in which the number of mixtures is smaller than that of sources and does not need any extra process after the separating. Experimental results indicate the validity of the method.

Over 60 years old, it has been successfully used for a variety of problems. The popularity of k-means is in large part a consequence of its simplicity and efficiency. In this paper we are inspired by these appealing properties of k-means in the development of a clustering algorithm which accepts the notion of "positively" and "negatively" labelled data. The goal is to discover the cluster structure of both positive and negative data in a manner which allows for the discrimination between the two sets. The usefulness of this idea is demonstrated practically on the problem of face recognition, where the task of learning the scope of a person's appearance should be done in a manner which allows this face to be differentiated from others.

They are one of the most popular and successful approaches in cluster analysis. The mixture density estimation is generally performed by maximizing the observeddata log-likelihood by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. However, it is well-known that the EM algorithm initialization is crucial. In addition, the standard EM algorithm requires the number of clusters to be known a priori. Some solutions have been provided in [31], [12] for model-based clustering with Gaussian mixture models for multivariate data. In this paper we focus on model-based curve clustering approaches, when the data are curves rather than vectorial data, based on regression mixtures. We propose a new robust EM algorithm for clustering curves. We extend the model-based clustering approach presented in [31] for Gaussian mixture models, to the case of curve clustering by regression mixtures, including polynomial regression mixtures as well as spline or B-spline regressions mixtures. Our approach both handles the problem of initialization and the one of choosing the optimal number of clusters as the EM learning proceeds, rather than in a twofold scheme. This is achieved by optimizing a penalized loglikelihood criterion. A simulation study confirms the potential benefit of the proposed algorithm in terms of robustness regarding initialization and funding the actual number of clusters.

Kernel Spectral Clustering for dynamic data using Multiple Kernel Learning	2013 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	AUG 04-09, 2013	Dallas, TX	Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc			PCA	In this paper we propose a kernel spectral clustering-based technique to catch the different regimes experienced by a time-varying system. Our method is based on a multiple kernel learning approach, which is a linear combination of kernels. The calculation of the linear combination coefficients is done by determining a ranking vector that quantifies the overall dynamical behavior of the analyzed data sequence over-time. This vector can be calculated from the eigenvectors provided by the the solution of the kernel spectral clustering problem. We apply the proposed technique to a trial from the Graphics Lab Motion Capture Database from Carnegie Mellon University, as well as to a synthetic example, namely three moving Gaussian clouds. For comparison purposes, some conventional spectral clustering techniques are also considered, namely, kernel kmeans and min-cuts. Also, standard k-means. The normalized mutual information and adjusted random index metrics are used to quantify the clustering performance. Results show the usefulness of proposed technique to track dynamic data, even being able to detect hidden objects. 7	[Peluffo-Ordonez, D.; Garcia-Vega, S.; Castellanos-Dominguez, G.] Univ Nacl Colombia, Dept Elect Engn Elect & Comp Sci, Manizales, Colombia; [Langone, R.; Suykens, J.

Suffering from slow training convergence on large datasets, SVM online testing time can be suboptimal because SVM write the classifier hyper-plane model as a sum of support vectors that could total as much as half the datasets. Motivated to speed up SVM real time testing by reducing the number of SV, we introduce in this paper a novel local mixture based SVM (LMSVM) approach that exploits the increased separability provided by the kernel trick, while introducing a onetime computational expense. LMSVM applies kernel k-means clustering to the data in kernel space before pruning unwanted clusters based on a mixture measure for label heterogeneity. LMSVM's computational complexity and classification accuracy on four databases from UCI show promising results and motivate follow on research.

A Comparative Analysis of Dissimilarity Measures for Clustering Categorical Data	2013 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	AUG 04-09, 2013	Dallas, TX	Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc			CRITERIA	Similarity and dissimilarity (distance) between objects is an important aspect that must be considered when clustering data. When clustering categorical data, for instance, these distance (similarity or dissimilarity) measures need to address properly the real particularities of categorical data. In this paper, we perform a comparative analysis with four different dissimilarity measures used as a distance metric for clustering categorical data. The first one is the Simple Matching Dissimilarity Measure (SMDM), which is one of the simplest and the most used metric for categorical attribute. The other two are context-based approaches (DIstance Learning in Categorical Attributes -DILCA and Domain Value Dissimilarity DVD), and the last one is an extension of the SMDM, which is proposed in this paper. All four dissimilarities are applied as distance metrics in two well known clustering algorithms, k -means and agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms. In this analysis, we also use internal and external cluster validity measures, aiming to compare the effectiveness of all four distance measures in both clustering algorithms.

Monitoring the client side data allow for gathering valuable information about its behaviour. In this paper an intelligent and integrated system for user activity monitoring for both computer and internet movement is proposed. The system provides on-line and off-line monitoring and allows detecting user behaviour. On-line monitoring is carried in real time and is used to predict user actions. Off-line monitoring is carried out after user has ended his work, and is based on the analysis of statistical parameters of user behaviour. A method for the identifying the category of web sites is also presented. Our system performs clustering on the basis of URL. The URL clustering is very informative, making techniques based on it faster than that make use of text information as well.

As the main instrument for Low Earth Orbit space surveillance, ground-based radar systems are usually limited by their resolving power while tracking small, but very dense clusters of space debris. Thus, the information obtained regarding target detection and observation will be seriously compromised and overlapping, making the traditional multi-target tracking method inefficient. The traditional central group tracking can't get the information inside. Therefore, we conceived a new way to calculate the group center based on traditional group tracking model. By clustering the measurement in the echo gate of the group, the group center can be synthesized by the centers of clustering. The overall motion tendency is used to update the clustering within the group to obtain the distribution of the objects, and keep the tracking stable. Finally, the simulation of the tracking of group space objects is carried out to validate the efficiency of the proposed method.

Automatic surveillance of assembling process would enable to reduce assembling errors by giving early warning. We propose a hand tracking and trajectory analysis method from videos captured by several uncalibrated cameras with overlapping views. The proposed method consists of three modules through single-view hand tracking, consistent labeling across views, and optimal decision from multi-view temporal dynamics. The main novelties of the paper include: (a) target model learning with multiple instances through K-means clustering applied to accommodate different levels of light reflection; (b) optimal criterion for consistent labeling of tracked hands across views, based on the symmetric epipolar distance; (c) backward correction of mis-detection by combining epipolar lines with previously tracked results; (d) a multi-view voting scheme for analyzing hand trajectory using binary hand location maps. Experiments have been conducted on videos by multiple uncalibrated cameras, where a person performs assembly operations.

But the prediction of clinical AHE largely depends on the doctor's experience. It is meaningful for clinical care if we can use appropriate methods to predict the AHE in advance and automatically. In this paper, we propose a method to predict the AHE that uses the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize the initial cluster centers of K-means which extracts the features of patient's mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). Then these features extracted from K-means coupled with the average of a sequence of MAP signal are classified with the support vector machine (SVM). We classified 2863 records, and the best accuracy achieved for the prediction based on the method proposed in this work was 81.2% (sensitivity=83.2% and specificity=80.4%).

As with the Cloud Computing development, some parallel data analysis systems have been emerging. However, existing systems rarely have comprehensive function, either providing gathering service or data analysis service. Our project needs a comprehensive tool to store and analysis large scale data efficiently. In response to these challenges, a business intelligence gathering system based on Cloud computing is proposed. It supports parallel ETL process, text mining which are based on Hadoop. The demo achieves Chinese Word Segmentation, Bayesian classification algorithm and K-means algorithm in the MapReduce architecture to form the omnibearing and three-dimensional intelligence noumenon for enterprises. It can meet the needs on timeliness and pertinence of the information, or even can achieve real-time intelligence gathering and analytics.

However it's difficult to analyze the network structure of Sina microblog because of the huge amount of users. The emergence of cloud computing gives us a new approach to analyze large-scale social networks. Hadoop is a widely used cloud computing platform, several clustering algorithms such as K-means and Canopy have already been implemented on it. However, the initial cluster centers of K-means are hard to select. Canopy provides a way to choose initial centers, but it is not suitable for very large data sets, and both traditional K-means and Canopy K-means converge very slowly. This paper proposes an improved method to cluster microblog users based on their relationship. We name our method "Weight Partitioned Canopy K-means" (WPCK), implement it on Hadoop cluster, and test it along with existing methods. Experimental results show that WPCK can reduce the number of iterations by about 1/3 of traditional K-means and Canopy K-means, while their performance are almost the same.

In this paper, a optimization for the deployment and transmitting power of AP is proposed in order to save energy and reduce frequency interference. It includes green AP clustering where Fuzzy K-mean algorithm is used, AP's second selection which is aimed to use fewer APs to guarantee the whole coverage, and AP's transmitting power optimization which aims to save more energy and reduce frequency interference better. Then simulation is operated on a virtual WLAN of high-density. The simulation results shows that the optimization for the deployment and transmitting power of AP indeed can save much energy.

In most of the applications, cluster sizes are either constrained to particular values or available as prior knowledge. Unfortunately, traditional clustering methods cannot impose constrains on cluster sizes. In this paper, we propose some vital modifications to the standard k-means algorithm such that it can incorporate size constraints for each cluster separately. The modified k-means algorithm can be used to obtain clusters in preferred sizes. A potential application would be obtaining clusters with equal cluster size. Moreover, the modified algorithm makes use of prior knowledge of the given data set for selectively initializing the cluster centroids which helps escaping from local minima. Simulation results on multidimensional data demonstrate that the k-means algorithm with the proposed modifications can fulfill cluster size constraints and lead to more accurate and robust results.

Wireless sensor nodes are, in general, battery-powered devices with limited processing and transmission power. Therefore, the lifetime of WSNs heavily depends on their energy efficiency. Multiple-cluster 2-hop (MC2H) network structure is commonly used in WSNs to reduce energy consumption due to long-range communications. However, networks with the MC2H network structure are commonly associated with long data collection processes. The delay-aware data collection network structure (DADCNS) is proposed to shorten the duration of data collection processes without sacrificing network lifetime. In this paper, a k-means-based formation algorithm for the DADCNS, namely DADCNS-RK, is proposed. The proposed algorithm can organize a network into the DADCNS, while minimizing the total communication distance among connected sensor nodes by performing k-means clustering recursively. Simulation results show that, when comparing with other DADCNSs formed by different algorithms, the proposed algorithm can reduce the total communication distances of networks significantly.

Many attempts have been done by teachers to incorporate this sort of services in formal learning; however, the success of this educational usage depends on the acceptance by students. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and user satisfaction have been used separately to predict the use and adoption of technology. In this paper we integrate both approaches in a model that envision user satisfaction as a mediating variable, according to previous literature (Bhattacherjee. 2001a, b, Hayashi et al., 2004, Rai et al., 2002, Bailey and Pearson, 1983) and investigates the moderating role of Need for Cognition (NFC). The sample is composed of 203 students enrolled in Business studies in a Spanish University. The analysis was carried out in a course that used Web 2.0 tools (Facebook, Twitter, blogs and a wiki) for educational purposes integrated in a Personal Learning Environment (PLE). The model was evaluated by using structural equation model multi-group analysis. From the K-means cluster analysis, according to their Need For Cognition level, 2 groups arose: High NFC and Low NFC. Our results show significant differences that support the moderating effect of NFC in relevant paths of the proposed TAM model, mainly in the role of learning satisfaction. For instance, for low NFC students (contrariwise to High NFC), the perceived usefulness of a learning 2.0 system is not linked to the concept of learning satisfaction and this satisfaction has no impact in the intention to use again a PLE based in Web 2.0 tools.

ANALYSIS OF THE INFLUENCE OF DISTANCE ON DATA ACQUISITION INTENSITY FORESTRY TARGETS BY A LIDAR TECHNIQUE WITH TERRESTRIAL LASER SCANNER	8TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON SPATIAL DATA QUALITY	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium on Spatial Data Quality	MAY 30-JUN 01, 2013	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing		Remote sensing; Terrestrial laser scanner; k-means algorithm; LIDAR; laser intensity; radiometric calibration		The forest sciences as well as other areas of knowledge benefit from technological advances to develop their working methods and increase their knowledge of their specific field of study. New equipment and methods are continually developed to support these applications. In the last decade, laser scanning and profiling systems have been consolidated as one of the most effective technologies for geospatial data acquisition. Based on the time-of-flight and with an electromagnetic spectrum that ranges into the mid-infrared, 1535nm, the terrestrial laser systems are appropriate for correlating the intensity data with physicochemical properties. Thus, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of the distance to the target in the data acquisition intensity targets forest in order to support future studies of correlation between this variable and the physicochemical characteristics of the targets. In this study we used the Terrestrial Laser Scanner 3D Ilris with Optech operating principle based on flight time and wavelength of 1535nm spectral range from infrared magnetic medium. The data acquisition targets intensity was assessed at distances (1m a 50m) by using a target reference of 99% reflectance. The results were analysed and showed that the distance interferes with the return of intensity. From the results of this research recommend that the intensity data are calibrated in relation to distance before using them as a source for study of the physical-chemical characteristics of the targets.

One possible way to cope with this issue is to proceed to knowledge mining in a way that we could control its volume and hence make it manageable. This paper explores meta-knowledge discovery and in particular focuses on clustering induction rules for large knowledge sets. Such knowledge representation is considered for its expressive power and hence its wide use. Adapted data mining is proposed to extract metaknowledge taking into account the knowledge representation which is more complex than simple data. Besides, a new clustering approach based on multilevel paradigm and called multilevel clustering is developed for the purpose of treating large scale knowledge sets. The approach invokes the kmeans algorithm to cluster induction rules using new designed similarity measures. The developed algorithms have been implemented on four public benchmarks to test the effectiveness of the multilevel clustering approach. The numerical results have been compared to those of the simple k-means algorithm. As foreseeable, the multilevel clustering outperforms clearly the basic k-means on both the execution time and success rate that remains constant to 100 % while increasing the number of induction rules.

An exhaustive inventory of 4,504 bloomery furnaces from Saga Gorou, near Niamey, allowed us to propose a spatial analysis of catchment area of 32 km(2), representing the Sahelian landscape. The smelting sites of Bilfouda and Garbel have the highest concentrations of bloomery furnaces; each was mapped accurately from low-altitude aerial photographs. Six radiocarbon dates were obtained, ranging from the fourth to the ninth century. A spatial analysis with a series of mathematical tools (Ward's method, k-means and minimum spanning tree) showed an organization of bloomery furnaces where groups were nested. Four levels from local to global were identified: battery, cluster, site and complex. Each was defined by a number of bloomery furnaces, an area, an operating time and control of production parameters. In a battery, bloomery furnaces can be arranged in a horse-shoe shape or in a more or less straight line. This organization of bloomery furnaces could be linked to the socio-cultural context and reflects good workspace management.

It observes and learns from the actions of a known-expert heuristic on small instances, but has the advantage of producing a general heuristic that works well on other larger instances. Specifically, we generate heuristic policies for online bin packing problem by using expert near-optimal policies produced by a hyper-heuristic on small instances, where learning is fast. The "expert" is a policymatrix that defines an index policy, and the apprenticeship learning is based on observation of the action of the expert policy together with a range of features of the bin being considered, and then applying a k-means classification. We show that the generated policy often performs better than the standard best-fit heuristic even when applied to instances much larger than the training set.

The use of data mining techniques, and more precisely constrained K-means clustering method, helps to discover new grouping sets with respect to users requirements. In the context of data warehouses, PRoCK allows to adapt dimension hierarchies to the user constraints. Indeed, applied on a given dimension hierarchy instances, constrained k-means clustering method gives a new natural classification. The obtained clustering results constitute a new hierarchy level semantically richer, namely personalized level on which user may elaborate more sophisticated OLAP analysis. PRoCK is integrated inside Oracle RDBMS (Relational DataBase Management System) and we have carried out some experimentation which validated the relevance of our operator.

Each image is represented by the frequency histogram of visual words obtained by assigning each key point of the image to the closest visual word. Overall, codebook is constructed via K-means clustering. In this paper we have used unsupervised neural network algorithm, to overcome some weaknesses of K-means; the standard Self Organizing Map SOM. We evaluated our method on two public datasets. Results exceed the current state-of-art retrieval performance with the baseline BOW on Holidays dataset, with less performance on the Kentucky dataset, however. We experimentally show that the proposed soft-weighting approach shows significant improvement over the baseline BOW with a small codebook size.

The segmentation step is one of the most important ones, since its accuracy determines the eventual success or failure of a CAD system. In this paper, different kinds of algorithms for the automatic segmentation of skin lesions in dermoscopic images were implemented and evaluated, namely automatic thresholding, k-means, mean-shift, region growing, gradient vector flow (GVF), and watershed. The segmentation methods were evaluated with three distinct metrics, using as ground truth a database of 50 images manually segmented by an expert dermatologist. Among the implemented segmentation approaches, the GVF snake method achieved the best segmentation performance.

In this paper, we study the means and methods of clustering analysis that processing data partition or grouping, which is an important field in data mining. Based on the understanding of theoretical basis of clustering analysis, firstly, analyze in detail main algorithms of partitioning methods, hierarchical methods, density-based methods, grid-based methods and model-based methods. Secondly, compare performance of different clustering algorithms from scalability, the shape of cluster, sensitivity to the "noise", and sensitivity to the data input sequence, high dimension and algorithm efficiency. Finally, use MATLAB for simulating and verifying applications of the algorithms based on K-means clustering analysis and hierarchical clustering.

Yet, the mining of the user association behind the shared information is unsatisfactory. Based on static social tags, a new algorithm clustering users is proposed, which clusters users by their similarity. Firstly, relevant concepts are defined to be used in the algorithm. And then, by analyzing existing clustering algorithms, K-means is chosen to be improved. The improved K-means algorithm is proposed and the basic flow of the algorithm is represented. Next, data from a Folksonomy site is used to conduct our empirical study, comparing the clustering effects of the two algorithms by experiment. As a result, the improved K-means algorithm shows better clustering effects than that of original algorithm and is suitable for clustering users.

Both of them are influenced by customer's investment psychological characteristics and stock market return rate. For stock market return rate is a random variable, commission income also has random characteristics, deterministic models based on historical commission income does not suitable to estimate the value of brokerage customers. Using K-means cluster to segment customer with deposition effect and over confidence, stock market return rate as the random variable, a customer commission value model is given, which is based on GARCH to model every group's assets turnover rate, and a linear equation to model every group's investment return rate. Because no analytical solution can be found for this model, Monte Carlo simulation is used to find the numerical solution. The empirical results show that, relative to the deterministic model, this model can give a more accurate estimation for the long-run value of brokerage customer segment with different investment psychological characteristics, and provide a reasonable basis for enterprises to optimize their marketing and service inputs.

The used texture measures are categorized into two groups, the first group include the SAR specific textures and the second one considers the general texture measures. ffmax is selected from the first category and LISA, SRPD, Wavelet measures and fractal dimensions are used as general texture measures. For a better discrimination, all texture measures are calculated and a PCA rotation is applied to them and the first PC is multiplied by the urban inhomogeneity parameter and the obtained image is segmented. The obtained results of this procedure comparing with the K-Means clustering algorithm show the better performance of this algorithm for urban area detection.

Change detection involves the ability to quantify temporal effects using multi-temporal data sets. The available maps of the under study area is one of the most important sources for this reason. Although old data bases and maps are a great resource, it is more than likely that the training data extracted from them might contain errors, which affects the procedure of the classification; and as a result the process of the training sample editing is an essential matter. Due to the urban nature of the area studied and the problems caused in the pixel base methods, object-based classification is applied. To reach this, the image is segmented into 4 scale levels using a multi-resolution segmentation procedure. After obtaining the segments in required levels, training samples are extracted automatically using the existing old map. Due to the old nature of the map, these samples are uncertain containing wrong data. To handle this issue, an editing process is proposed according to K-nearest neighbour and k-means algorithms. Next, the image is classified in a multi-resolution object-based manner and the effects of training sample refinement are evaluated. As a final step this classified image is compared with the existing map and the changed areas are detected.

A NEW PROMPT FOR BUILDING EXTRACTION IN HIGH RESOLUTION REMOTELY SENSED IMAGERY	SMPR CONFERENCE 2013	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Sensors and Models in Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (SMPR)	OCT 05-08, 2013	Tehran, IRAN	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing	Univ Tehran	Building extraction; SRM segmentation; Shape-factors; Clustering; Remote sensing	DIGITAL-ELEVATION-MODELS	Remote sensing technology has proved a magnificent role in urban development. High resolution remotely sensed imagery provides remote sensing mapping, GIS data acquisition and automatic updates, and also supports for extraction train features such as building. In this work, a new approach for building extraction in colored high resolution remotely sensed imagery is proposed. The approach includes Statistical Region Merging (SRM) segmentation, boundary tracing and clustering based on new shape-factors. After performing SRM, the boundary tracing algorithm is carried out. Moore neighbour contour tracing algorithm is used for this purpose. New shape factors are proposed based on geometry of buildings and other terrain features. The correlation of shape factors between buildings and road features is significantly low. The shape factors are based on circularity, elongation and compactness. Afterwards K-means classifier is utilized in order to discriminate between buildings and other objects. In this step squared Euclidean distance has been opted. Two clusters have been set for separating buildings from roads and complex features. In order to evaluate the capability of this method, two images of Worldview2 sensor has been used. The fine result demonstrates the proficiency of shape factors and remarkable and satisfactory performance of the new prompt.	[Souri, A. H.; Sharifi, M.

Beside the usual partitional and hierarchical methods, evolutionary algorithms are employed for clustering as well. They are able to find good quality partitions of the dataset and successfully solve some of the shortcomings that the k-means, being one of the most popular partitional algorithms, exhibits. This paper proposes a differential evolution algorithm that includes macromutations as an additional exploration mechanism. The application probability and the intensity of the macromutations are dynamically adjusted during runtime. The proposed algorithm was compared to four variants of differential evolution and one particle swarm optimization algorithm. The experimental analysis conducted on a number of real datasets showed that the proposed algorithm is stable and manages to find high quality solutions.

Sandholm Algorithm with K-means Clustering Approach for Multi-robot Task Allocation	SWARM, EVOLUTIONARY, AND MEMETIC COMPUTING, PT II (SEMCCO 2013)	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Swarm, Evolutionary, and Memetic Computing (SEMCCO)	DEC 19-21, 2013	Chennai, INDIA		SRM Univ		COMBINATORIAL AUCTIONS	Multi-robot systems are becoming more and more significant in industrial, commercial and scientific applications. The current attempts made by the researchers concentrate only on minimizing the distance between the robots and the targets, and not much importance is given to the balancing of workloads among robots. Auction based mechanism are popularly used to allocate tasks to multiple robots. This paper attempts to develop mechanisms to address the above two issues with objective of minimizing the distance travel by 'm' robots and balancing the work load of 'N' targets between 'm' robots equally. The proposed approach has three stages, stage I bundles the 'N' targets into 'n' clusters of targets using commonly adopted K-means clustering technique with the objective of minimizing the distance between the 'n' targets and its cluster centroids, this gives the legal bundles and also reduces the search space. Stage II calculates the biding distance based of the shortest path from the current robot position to bundle or bundle combinations. In stage III bundles are allocated to the each robot using Sandholm algorithm. The performance of the proposed method is tested with small and large size bench mark problem instances.

The rapid distribution of the fire could cause many causalities and a lot of effort is required to control. To overcome this problem it is highly important to detect forest fire before it spread its wing on the surroundings. A number of popular techniques like smoke velocity distribution, usage of sensors and sounding systems have been applied in forest surveillance and found to be ineffective. In this paper, we present improved forest fire identification through the real time processing using land surface temperature satellite imagery. From these images an analysis is carried out to identify the mean wavelengths of abnormal temperature distribution when compared to the surroundings on a small region. If the mean wavelength exceeds 10.14, it is treated as forest fire. This approach uses k-mean clustering and haar wavelet, resulting an average accuracy rate of 89.5 %.

J	Saha, S; Bandyopadhyay, S				Saha, Sriparna; Bandyopadhyay, Sanghamitra			A generalized automatic clustering algorithm in a multiobjective framework	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Clustering; Multiobjective optimization (MOO); Symmetry; Relative neighborhood graph; Multi-center; Automatic determination of number of clusters	MULTIPLE DATA SETS; GENETIC ALGORITHM; VALIDITY INDEXES; STATISTICAL COMPARISONS; PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; CLASSIFICATION; OPTIMIZATION; CLASSIFIERS	In this paper a new multiobjective (MO) clustering technique (GenClustMOO) is proposed which can automatically partition the data into an appropriate number of clusters. Each cluster is divided into several small hyperspherical subclusters and the centers of all these small sub-clusters are encoded in a string to represent the whole clustering. For assigning points to different clusters, these local subclusters are considered individually. For the purpose of objective function evaluation, these sub-clusters are merged appropriately to form a variable number of global clusters. Three objective functions, one reflecting the total compactness of the partitioning based on the Euclidean distance, the other reflecting the total symmetry of the clusters, and the last reflecting the cluster connectedness, are considered here. These are optimized simultaneously using AMOSA, a newly developed simulated annealing based multiobjective optimization method, in order to detect the appropriate number of clusters as well as the appropriate partitioning. The symmetry present in a partitioning is measured using a newly developed point symmetry based distance. Connectedness present in a partitioning is measured using the relative neighborhood graph concept. Since AMOSA, as well as any other MO optimization technique, provides a set of Pareto-optimal solutions, a new method is also developed to determine a single solution from this set. Thus the proposed GenClustMOO is able to detect the appropriate number of clusters and the appropriate partitioning from data sets having either well-separated clusters of any shape or symmetrical clusters with or without overlaps. The effectiveness of the proposed GenClustMOO in comparison with another recent multiobjective clustering technique (MOCK), a single objective genetic algorithm based automatic clustering technique (VGAPS-clustering), K-means and single linkage clustering techniques is comprehensively demonstrated for nineteen artificial and seven real-life data sets of varying complexities. In a part of the experiment the effectiveness of AMOSA as the underlying optimization technique in GenClustMOO is also demonstrated in comparison to another evolutionary MO algorithm, PESA2.

J	Li, B; Wang, HW; Yang, JB; Guo, M; Qi, C				Li, Bin; Wang, Hongwei; Yang, Jianbo; Guo, Min; Qi, Chao			A belief-rule-based inference method for aggregate production planning under uncertainty	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article						aggregate production planning; uncertainty; evidential reasoning; belief-rule base; knowledge-based system	EVIDENTIAL REASONING APPROACH; ATTRIBUTE DECISION-ANALYSIS; GOAL PROGRAMMING APPROACH; PIPELINE LEAK DETECTION; MODELING UNCERTAINTY; FUZZY ENVIRONMENT; SUPPLY CHAINS; EXPERT-SYSTEM; DEMAND; STRATEGIES	Finding high-performance solutions for aggregate production planning (APP) poses a significant challenge for both academics and practitioners alike. In real-world problems, severe demand fluctuations make forecasts hardly reliable. Forecast errors can be biased and magnifying from immediate to distant periods, and unstable demands are usually forecast in uncertain forms. For APP under uncertain demands, a new hierarchical belief-rule-based inference (BRBI) method is proposed. As an expert system with a belief-rule structure, BRBI can assist decision-makers in planning production, workforce and inventory levels with corresponding information representation, causal inference and identification algorithms. Operational data and expert knowledge can be employed to construct, initialise, and adjust the belief-rule base (BRB). An inference engine algorithm is developed to handle both deterministic and interval inputs. In order to make the method applicable to both continuous and discrete production settings, continuous mode and switching mode for BRBI are proposed using different transformation techniques. To approximate hidden patterns in APP situations, simultaneous identification and two-step identification for structure and parameter of BRB are developed. The two-step identification contains a belief k-means (BKM) clustering algorithm extended from k-means and fuzzy c-means. BKM ensures that an optimal cluster can both facilitate human cognition and improve accuracy of identification and inference. A paint-factory example is utilised to conduct comparative studies and sensitivity analyses in deterministic forecast context, and an automotive production example is implemented to illustrate BRBI's advantage in interval forecast context and to contrast simultaneous identification and two-step identification.

J	Chattopadhyay, AK; Mondal, S; Chattopadhyay, T				Chattopadhyay, Asis Kumar; Mondal, Saptarshi; Chattopadhyay, Tanuka			Independent Component Analysis for the objective classification of globular clusters of the galaxy NGC 5128	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Clustering; Independent Component Analysis; Globular clusters; Galaxy	ELLIPTIC GALAXIES; WASHINGTON PHOTOMETRY; INTERACTING GALAXIES; NGC-5128; METALLICITIES; MODEL; CONSTRAINTS; ORIGIN	Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is closely related to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and factor analysis. Whereas ICA finds a set of source data that are mutually independent, PCA finds a set of data that are mutually uncorrelated. The assumption that data from different physical processes are uncorrelated does not always imply the reverse case that uncorrelated data are coming from different physical processes. This is because lack of correlation is a weaker property than independence. In the present case an objective classification of the globular clusters (GCs) of NGC 5128 has been carried out. Components responsible for significant variation have been obtained through both Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and the classification has been done by K-means clustering. The set of observable parameters includes structural parameters, spectroscopically determined Lick indices and radial velocities from the literature. We propose that GCs of NGC 5128 consist of two groups. One group originated in the original cluster formation event that coincided with the formation of the elliptical galaxy and the other group emerged from an accreted spiral galaxy. This is unlike the previous result (Chattopadhyay et al., 2009) which accounts for a third group originating from the accretion of tidally stripped dwarf galaxies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Zhang, Q; Huang, X; Zhang, LP				Zhang, Qian; Huang, Xin; Zhang, Liangpei			An Energy-Driven Total Variation Model for Segmentation and Classification of High Spatial Resolution Remote-Sensing Imagery	IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS			English	Article						Classification; high resolution; object based; segmentation; total variation (TV)	MEAN-SHIFT; EXTRACTION; ALGORITHM	An energy-driven total variation (TV) formulation is proposed for the segmentation of high spatial resolution remote-sensing imagery. The TV model is an effective tool for image processing operations such as restoration, enhancement, reconstruction, and diffusion. Due to the relationship between the TV model and the segmentation problem, in this letter, a TV-based approach is investigated for segmentation of high-spatial-resolution remote-sensing imagery. Subsequently, an object-based classification method, i.e., majority voting, is used to classify the segmented results. In experiments, the proposed TV-based method is compared with the widely used fractal net evolution approach and the clustering segmentation methods such as the expectation-maximization and k-means. The performances of the segmentation and the classification are evaluated based on both thematic and geometric indices.

J	Maji, S; Berg, AC; Malik, J				Maji, Subhransu; Berg, Alexander C.; Malik, Jitendra			Efficient Classification for Additive Kernel SVMs	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Image classification; support vector machines; efficient classifiers; additive kernels	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; FACE DETECTION; FEATURES	We show that a class of nonlinear kernel SVMs admits approximate classifiers with runtime and memory complexity that is independent of the number of support vectors. This class of kernels, which we refer to as additive kernels, includes widely used kernels for histogram-based image comparison like intersection and chi-squared kernels. Additive kernel SVMs can offer significant improvements in accuracy over linear SVMs on a wide variety of tasks while having the same runtime, making them practical for large-scale recognition or real-time detection tasks. We present experiments on a variety of datasets, including the INRIA person, Daimler-Chrysler pedestrians, UIUC Cars, Caltech-101, MNIST, and USPS digits, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for efficient evaluation of SVMs with additive kernels. Since its introduction, our method has become integral to various state-of-the-art systems for PASCAL VOC object detection/image classification, ImageNet Challenge, TRECVID, etc. The techniques we propose can also be applied to settings where evaluation of weighted additive kernels is required, which include kernelized versions of PCA, LDA, regression, k-means, as well as speeding up the inner loop of SVM classifier training algorithms.

Comparison of Landsat image classification methods for detecting mangrove forests in Sundarbans	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							BANGLADESH; ACCURACY	Remote-sensing images taken from the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor with a spatial resolution of 30 m were applied for mapping and inventory of mangrove forest areas in Sundarbans, on both sides of the border between Bangladesh and India. Three different classification methods - unsupervised classification with k-means clustering, supervised classification using the maximum likelihood decision rule, and band-ratio supervised classification - were tested and compared in terms of the top of the atmosphere reflectance images. Spectral signature and principal component analyses were applied to select the appropriate band combinations prior to the band ratio-supervised classification. Our results show that the band ratio method is superior to the unsupervised or supervised classification methods considering the visual inspection, producer's and user's accuracy, as well as the overall accuracy of the all the classes in the image. The best discrimination of mangrove/nonmangrove boundary can be achieved when the combinations of B4/B2 (band 4/band 2), B5/B7, and B7/B4 are employed from the ETM+ bands.	[Rahman, Md.

Land-use and vegetation change detection in Plastira artificial lake catchment (Greece) by using remote-sensing and GIS techniques	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							GEOGRAPHICALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION; THEMATIC MAPPER; NDVI; COVER; MODIS; SPOT; CLASSIFICATION; RAINFALL; IMAGES; PRODUCTIVITY	Detecting changes in the land-use and vegetation conditions by using remote-sensing techniques is a common approach nowadays to assessing human-induced impacts in a specific area. For this purpose, a series of vegetation indices and change detection algorithms such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA), and k-means have been efficiently developed and used in many studies worldwide. However, identifying the driving forces for the estimated changes in land use and vegetation has always been a difficult and challenging task. In this study, Landsat and Systeme Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) images have been used to estimate the NDVI and land-use changes at the Plastira artificial lake catchment in the period 1984-2009. The recorded vegetation changes were correlated with a series of environmental and human-related parameters such as precipitation, temperature, specific land uses, and topography to identify the dominant factors of the aforementioned changes. This was done using both linear and geographically weighted regression methods. The results indicate that the precipitation and temperature fluctuations are strongly correlated with the vegetation conditions, whereas, as far as the topographic parameters are concerned, the aspect and slope affect mostly the particular vegetation index (the NDVI) of the study area.

J	Zhu, XF; Huang, Z; Yang, Y; Shen, HT; Xu, CS; Luo, JB				Zhu, Xiaofeng; Huang, Zi; Yang, Yang; Shen, Heng Tao; Xu, Changsheng; Luo, Jiebo			Self-taught dimensionality reduction on the high-dimensional small-sized data	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Dimensionality reduction; Self-taught learning; Joint sparse coding; Manifold learning; Unsupervised learning	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; GEOMETRIC FRAMEWORK; FEATURE-SELECTION; ALGORITHM	To build an effective dimensionality reduction model usually requires sufficient data. Otherwise, traditional dimensionality reduction methods might be less effective. However, sufficient data cannot always be guaranteed in real applications. In this paper we focus on performing unsupervised dimensionality reduction on the high-dimensional and small-sized data, in which the dimensionality of target data is high and the number of target data is small. To handle the problem, we propose a novel Self-taught Dimensionality Reduction (STDR) approach, which is able to transfer external knowledge (or information) from freely available external (or auxiliary) data to the high-dimensional and small-sized target data. The proposed STDR consists of three steps: First, the bases are learnt from sufficient external data, which might come from the same "type" or "modality" of target data. The bases are the common part between external data and target data, i.e., the external knowledge (or information). Second, target data are reconstructed by the learnt bases by proposing a novel joint graph sparse coding model, which not only provides robust reconstruction ability but also preserves the local structures amongst target data in the original space. This process transfers the external knowledge (i.e., the learnt bases) to target data. Moreover, the proposed solver to the proposed model is theoretically guaranteed that the objective function of the proposed model converges to the global optimum. After this, target data are mapped into the learnt basis space, and are sparsely represented by the bases, i.e., represented by parts of the bases. Third, the sparse features (that is, the rows with zero (or small) values) of the new representations of target data are deleted for achieving the effectiveness and the efficiency. That is, this step performs feature selection on the new representations of target data.

In the proposed approach, we construct multiple resolution images and extract local features from all the resolution images with dense regions. We then quantize these extracted features into a visual codebook using the k-means clustering method. To incorporate spatial information, two modalities of horizontal and vertical partitions are adopted to partition all resolution images into sub-regions with different scales. Each sub-region is then represented as a histogram of codeword occurrences by mapping the local features to the codebook. The proposed approach is evaluated over five commonly used data sets including indoor scenes, outdoor scenes, and sports events. The experimental results show that the proposed approach performs competitively against previous methods across all data sets. Furthermore, for the 8 scenes, 13 scenes, 67 indoor scenes, and 8 sport events data sets, the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A comparative study of efficient initialization methods for the k-means clustering algorithm	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Partitional clustering; Sum of squared error criterion; k-means; Cluster center initialization	VECTOR QUANTIZATION; ENCODING ALGORITHM; MULTIVARIATE DATA; INTERPRETABILITY; PERFORMANCE; DISTANCE; OUTLIERS; SETS	K-means is undoubtedly the most widely used partitional clustering algorithm. Unfortunately, due to its gradient descent nature, this algorithm is highly sensitive to the initial placement of the cluster centers. Numerous initialization methods have been proposed to address this problem. In this paper, we first present an overview of these methods with an emphasis on their computational efficiency. We then compare eight commonly used linear time complexity initialization methods on a large and diverse collection of data sets using various performance criteria. Finally, we analyze the experimental results using nonparametric statistical tests and provide recommendations for practitioners. We demonstrate that popular initialization methods often perform poorly and that there are in fact strong alternatives to these methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Celebi, M.

J	Yu, P; Lee, JH				Yu, Peng; Lee, Jang Hee			A hybrid approach using two-level SOM and combined AHP rating and AHP/DEA-AR method for selecting optimal promising emerging technology	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Two-level SOM (self-organizing map); DEA-AR (data envelopment analysis-assurance region); AHP (analytic hierarchy process); Emerging technology; Technology selection	DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; K-MEANS ALGORITHM; SELF-ORGANIZING MAP; MARKET-SEGMENTATION; ANALYTIC HIERARCHY; INTEGRATION; PERFORMANCE; MODEL	Emerging technologies are playing an important role in establishing competitive advantage for technology based companies. Selecting an efficient and important emerging technology to invest in is significant to the companies also. In this study, we propose a method for selecting optimal emerging technology which is efficient, important and the most suitable to a company's actual levels of input resource among various emerging technology alternatives. In order to select optimal emerging technology, the proposed method uses two-level-SOM to cluster the emerging technology alternatives based on alternatives' required levels of input resource. For selecting efficient and important promising emerging technology, the proposed method calculates emerging technology alternatives' efficiency score by using AHP/DEA-AR and their importance score by using AHP rating method in each technology cluster generated by two-level-SOM. Finally, the proposed method selects optimal promising emerging technology according to a company's actual levels of input resource and each emerging technology alternative's combined scores which is calculated by adding its efficiency score and importance score. A Korean company's case of selecting optimal promising nanotechnology is employed to illustrate the proposed method. The result shows that the proposed method can provide an effective and reasonable selection of optimal promising emerging technology. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Shin, S; Lee, S; Kim, H; Kim, S				Shin, Seongjun; Lee, Seungmin; Kim, Hyunwoo; Kim, Sehun			Advanced probabilistic approach for network intrusion forecasting and detection	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Intrusion forecasting; Markov chain; Anomaly detection; DDoS detection	ANOMALY DETECTION	Recently, as damage caused by Internet threats has increased significantly, one of the major challenges is to accurately predict the period and severity of threats. In this study, a novel probabilistic approach is proposed effectively to forecast and detect network intrusions. It uses a Markov chain for probabilistic modeling of abnormal events in network systems. First, to define the network states, we perform K-means clustering, and then we introduce the concept of an outlier factor. Based on the defined states, the degree of abnormality of the incoming data is stochastically measured in real-time. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated through experiments using the well-known DARPA 2000 data set and further analyzes. The proposed approach achieves high detection performance while representing the level of attacks in stages. In particular, our approach is shown to be very robust to training data sets and the number of states in the Markov model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To address this problem, this article develops a neighbourhood-constrained k-means (NC-k-means) algorithm by incorporating the pure neighbourhood index into the traditional k-means algorithm. The performance of the NC-k-means algorithm was assessed through a series of simulated images and a real hyperspectral image. The results indicate that the classification accuracy of NC-k-means algorithm is consistently better than that of the traditional k-means algorithm, in particular for the images with significant spatial autocorrelations among neighbouring pixels.

By applying the cluster analysis and k-means methods, four clusters representing the sets of cultivars with a defined level of production of the selected alkaloids were determined, based on their similarities. The content of individual minor alkaloids, which was obtained was relatively low (0.00-0.17%) and in some cases negligible, defined by the dominant representation of morphine in the alkaloid spectrum of all selected cultivars. In addition to the high-morphine cultivar 'Buddha' (mean 1.64%), there was a middle content (mean 0.79%) or low content (mean 0.61%) of morphine in the cultivars included in clusters 2 and 3 (average of 3 consecutive years 2007, 2008 and 2009). A relatively high content of morphine was detected in cultivar 'Bohmuv belosemenny' (mean 0.91%), although it is usually published that white-seed cultivars contain less morphine and other alkaloids, compared to blue-seed or grey-seed cultivars. Low content of morphine (mean 0.48% resp. 0.44%) by relatively high content of narcotine (mean 0.11% resp. 0.15%) was obtained in poppy cultivars 'Danneborg' and 'Tatarstan'. Also, surprisingly the highest papaverine content (mean 0.07%) was detected in the cultivar 'Susicky cervenosemenny' with the lowest content of morphine (mean 0.34%). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A technique that shows promise is acoustic emission (AE). This paper presents the results of an experimental study aimed at monitoring fracture processes in a large-scale RC shear wall using one of the most important AE parameters, that is, the b-value. The specimen was subjected to a displacement controlled reversed cyclic loading. A Gaussian filter is proposed to improve the interpretation of b-value data obtained during the test. In addition, a cluster analysis based on the k-means is presented to automatically classify the signal into tensile and shear cluster. Finally, a new algorithm called Sifted b-value (Sb) analysis is introduced to monitor the evolution of each crack mode. The proposed approach is capable to identify the initial yielding and eventually provide an early warning for the planning and implementation of remedial action to the structure at a point at which it is less expensive and invasive than when its structural performance has been seriously compromised.

The aims of the study were (a) to identify typical health-related behavior patterns in German adolescents focusing on physical activity, media use and dietary behavior; (b) to describe the socio-demographic correlates of the identified clusters and (c) to study their association with overweight. Methods: Within the framework of the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) and the "Motorik-Modul" (MoMo), 1,643 German adolescents (11-17 years) completed a questionnaire assessing the amount and type of weekly physical activity in sports clubs and during leisure time, weekly use of television, computer and console games and the frequency and amount of food consumption. From this data the three indices 'physical activity', 'media use' and 'healthy nutrition' were derived and included in a cluster analysis conducted with Ward's Method and K-means analysis. Chi-square tests were performed to identify socio-demographic correlates of the clusters as well as their association with overweight. Results: Four stable clusters representing typical health-related behavior patterns were identified: Cluster 1 (16.2%)-high scores in physical activity index and average scores in media use index and healthy nutrition index; cluster 2 (34.6%)-high healthy nutrition score and below average scores in the other two indices; cluster 3 (18.4%)-low physical activity score, low healthy nutrition score and very high media use score; cluster 4 (30.5%)-below average scores on all three indices. Boys were overrepresented in the clusters 1 and 3, and the relative number of adolescents with low socio-economic status as well as overweight was significantly higher than average in cluster 3. Conclusions: Meaningful and stable clusters of health-related behavior were identified. These results confirm findings of another youth study hence supporting the assumption that these clusters represent typical behavior patterns of adolescents. These results are particularly relevant for the characterization of target groups for primary prevention of lifestyle diseases.

Patterns of deficits in brain function in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia: A cluster analytic study	PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH			English	Article						Bipolar disorder; Schizophrenia; K-means clustering; Neurophysiologic profiles	DURATION MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL ENDOPHENOTYPES; GAMMA OSCILLATIONS; GENE-EXPRESSION; MENTAL-ILLNESS; P300; PSYCHOSIS; P50; SUPPRESSION	Historically, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have been considered distinct disorders with different etiologies. Growing evidence suggests that overlapping genetic influences contribute to risk for these disorders and that each disease is genetically heterogeneous. Using cluster analytic methods, we empirically identified homogeneous subgroups of patients, their relatives, and controls based on distinct neurophysiologic profiles. Seven phenotypes were collected from two independent cohorts at two institutions. K-means clustering was used to identify neurophysiologic profiles. In the analysis of all participants, three distinct profiles emerged: "globally impaired", "sensory processing", and "high cognitive". In a secondary analysis, restricted to patients only, we observed a similar clustering into three profiles. The neurophysiological profiles of the Schizophrenia (SZ) and Bipolar Disorder (BPD) patients did not support the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) diagnostic distinction between these two disorders. Smokers in the globally impaired group smoked significantly more cigarettes than those in the sensory processing or high cognitive groups. Our results suggest that empirical analyses of neurophysiological phenotypes can identify potentially biologically relevant homogenous subgroups independent of diagnostic boundaries. We hypothesize that each neurophysiology subgroup may share similar genotypic profiles, which may increase statistical power to detect genetic risk factors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J	Malinen, MI; Franti, P				Malinen, Mikko I.; Franti, Pasi			Clustering by analytic functions	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Clustering; Analytic function; Mean squared error; k-Means	ALGORITHM	Data clustering is a combinatorial optimization problem. This article shows that clustering is also an optimization problem for an analytic function. The mean squared error, or in this case, the squared error can expressed as an analytic function. With an analytic function we benefit from the existence of standard optimization methods: the gradient of this function is calculated and the descent method is used to minimize the function.

The CLEC-CMP analysis was carried out on ten amino acidic racemates and with nine different cupric salts. While the group of analytes comprised both aliphatic (leucine, isoleucine, nor-leucine, proline, valine, nor-valine, and alpha-methyl-valine) and aromatic (1-aminoindan-1,5-dicarboxylic acid, phenylglycine, and tyrosine) species, representative organic (formate, methanesulfonate, and trifluoroacetate) and inorganic (bromide, chloride, fluoride, nitrate, perchlorate, and sulfate) Cu(II) salts were selected as the metal source into the eluent. This route of investigation was pursued with the aim of identifying analogies among the employed Cu(II) salts, by observing the variation profile of the selected chromatographic parameters, upon a change of the above experimental conditions. All the data were collected and analyzed through a statistical approach (PCA and k-means clustering) that revealed the presence of two behavioral classes of cupric salts, sharing the same variation profile for k and a values. Interestingly, this clustering can be explained in terms of ESP (electrostatic surface potential) balance (ESPbal) values, obtained by an ab initio calculation operated on the cupric salts. The results of this appraisal could aid the rational choice of the most suitable eluent system, to succeed in the enantioseparation of difficult-to-resolve compounds, along with the eventual scale-up to a semi-preparative level.

Multiscale roughness measure for color image segmentation	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Color image segmentation; Rough set; Linear scale-space; Multiscale roughness; Roughness entropy	VECTOR ORDER-STATISTICS; K-MEANS; SET-THEORY; EDGE-DETECTION; ALGORITHM; ENTROPY; COMBINATION; GRANULATION; SPACES	Color image segmentation is always an important technique in image processing system. Highly precise segmentation with low computation complexity can be achieved through roughness measurement which approximate the color histogram based on rough set theory. However, due to the imprecise description of neighborhood similarity, the existing roughness measure tends to over-focus on the trivial homogeneous regions but is not accurate enough to measure the color homogeneity. This paper aims to construct a multiscale roughness measure through simulating the human vision. We apply the theories of linear scale-space and rough sets to generate the hierarchical roughness of color distribution under multiple scales. This multiscale roughness can tolerate the disturbance of trivial regions and also can provide the multilevel homogeneity representation in vision, which therefore produces precise and intuitive segmentation results. Furthermore, we propose roughness entropy for scale selection. The optimal scale for segmentation is decided by the entropy variation. The proposed method shows the encouraging performance in the experiments based on Berkeley segmentation database. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Yue, X. D.; Miao, D.

A recent study has shown that the dimethylation of lysine 4 residue on histone 3 (H3K4me2) marks the gene body area of tissue specific genes in the human CD4+ T cells and neural cells. However, little is known of the H3k4me2 distribution dynamics through the cell differentiation and tissue development. Results: We applied several clustering methods including K-means, hierarchical and principle component analysis on H3K4me2 ChIP-seq data from embryonic stem cell, neural progenitor cell and whole brain of mouse, trying to identify genes with the H3K4me2 binding on the gene body region in different cell development stage and study their redistribution in different tissue development stages. A cluster of 356 genes with heavy H3K4me2 labeling in the gene body region was identified in the mouse whole brain tissue using K-means clustering. They are highly enriched with neural system related functions and pathways, and are involved in several central neural system diseases. The distribution of H3K4me2 on neural function related genes follows three distinctive patterns: a group of genes contain constant heavy H3K4me2 marks in the gene body from embryonic stem cell stage through neural progenitor stage to matured brain tissue stage; another group of gene have little H3K4me2 marks until cells mature into brain cells; the majority of the genes acquired H3K4me2 marks in the neural progenitor cell stage, and gain heavy labeling in the matured brain cell stage. Gene ontology enrichment analysis also revealed corresponding gene ontology terms that fit in the scenario of each cell developmental stages. Conclusions: We investigated the process of the H3K4me2 mark redistribution during tissue specificity development for mouse brain tissue. Our analysis confirmed the previous report that heavy labeling of H3K4me2 in the downstream of TSS marks tissue specific genes. These genes show remarkable enrichment in central neural system related diseases. Furthermore, we have shown that H3K4me2 labeling can be acquired as early as the embryonic stem cell stage, and its distribution is dynamic and progressive throughout cell differentiation and tissue development.

Identification of molecular differences between typical males and females can provide a valuable basis for exploring conditions differentially affected by sex. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using multiplexed immunoassays, we analyzed 174 serum molecules in 9 independent cohorts of typical individuals, comprising 196 males and 196 females. Sex differences in analyte levels were quantified using a meta-analysis approach and put into biological context using k-means to generate clusters of analytes with distinct biological functions. Natural sex differences were established in these analyte groups and these were applied to illustrate sexually dimorphic analyte expression in a cohort of 22 males and 22 females with Asperger syndrome. Reproducible sex differences were found in the levels of 77 analytes in serum of typical controls, and these comprised clusters of molecules enriched with distinct biological functions. Analytes involved in fatty acid oxidation/hormone regulation, immune cell growth and activation, and cell death were found at higher levels in females, and analytes involved in immune cell chemotaxis and other indistinct functions were higher in males. Comparison of these naturally occurring sex differences against a cohort of people with Asperger syndrome indicated that a cluster of analytes that had functions related to fatty acid oxidation/hormone regulation was associated with sex and the occurrence of this condition. Conclusions/Significance: Sex-specific molecular differences were detected in serum of typical controls and these were reproducible across independent cohorts. This study extends current knowledge of sex differences in biological functions involved in metabolism and immune function. Deviations from typical sex differences were found in a cluster of molecules in Asperger syndrome. These findings illustrate the importance of investigating the influence of sex on medical conditions.

This TNF-induced angiogenesis plays a key role in cancer and rheumatic disease. However, the molecular system that underlies TNF-induced angiogenesis is largely unknown. Methods: We analyzed the gene expression changes stimulated by TNF in HUVEC over a time course using microarrays to reveal the molecular system underlying TNF-induced angiogenesis. Traditional k-means clustering analysis was performed to identify informative temporal gene expression patterns buried in the time course data. Functional enrichment analysis using DAVID was then performed for each cluster. The genes that belonged to informative clusters were then used as the input for gene network analysis using a Bayesian network and nonparametric regression method. Based on this TNF-induced gene network, we searched for sub-networks related to angiogenesis by integrating existing biological knowledge. Results: k-means clustering of the TNF stimulated time course microarray gene expression data, followed by functional enrichment analysis identified three biologically informative clusters related to apoptosis, cellular proliferation and angiogenesis. These three clusters included 648 genes in total, which were used to estimate dynamic Bayesian networks. Based on the estimated TNF-induced gene networks, we hypothesized that a sub-network including IL6 and IL8 inhibits apoptosis and promotes TNF-induced angiogenesis. More particularly, IL6 promotes TNF-induced angiogenesis by inducing NF-kappa B and IL8, which are strong cell growth factors. Conclusions: Computational gene network analysis revealed a novel molecular system that may play an important role in the TNF-induced angiogenesis seen in cancer and rheumatic disease. This analysis suggests that Bayesian network analysis linked to functional annotation may be a powerful tool to provide insight into disease.

In k-means clustering, we are given a set of n data points in d-dimensional space R-d and an integer k. The problem is to determine a set of k points in R-d, called centers, so as to minimize the mean squared distance from each data point to its nearest center. In this work, we develop a novel k-means algorithm, which is simple but more efficient than the traditional k-means and the recent enhanced k-means. Our new algorithm is based on the recently established relationship between principal component analysis and the k-means clustering. We provided the correctness proof for this algorithm. Results obtained from testing the algorithm on three biological data and six non-biological data (three of these data are real, while the other three are simulated) also indicate that our algorithm is empirically faster than other known k-means algorithms. We assessed the quality of our algorithm clusters against the clusters of a known structure using the Hubert-Arabie Adjusted Rand index (ARI(HA)). We found that when k is close to d, the quality is good (ARI(HA)> 0.8) and when k is not close to d, the quality of our new k-means algorithm is excellent (ARI(HA)> 0.9). In this paper, emphases are on the reduction of the time requirement of the k-means algorithm and its application to microarray data due to the desire to create a tool for clustering and malaria research. However, the new clustering algorithm can be used for other clustering needs as long as an appropriate measure of distance between the centroids and the members is used. This has been demonstrated in this work on six non-biological data. Citation: Osamor VC, Adebiyi EF, Oyelade JO, Doumbia S (2012) Reducing the Time Requirement of k-Means Algorithm.

Accuracy of direct genomic breeding values for nationally evaluated traits in US Limousin and Simmental beef cattle	GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION			English	Article							GENETIC-RELATIONSHIP INFORMATION; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; UNITED-STATES; DAIRY-CATTLE; ANGUS CATTLE; IMPACT; PREDICTION; SELECTION; RELIABILITY; VALIDATION	Background: In national evaluations, direct genomic breeding values can be considered as correlated traits to those for which phenotypes are available for traditional estimation of breeding values. For this purpose, estimates of the accuracy of direct genomic breeding values expressed as genetic correlations between traits and their respective direct genomic breeding values are required. Methods: We derived direct genomic breeding values for 2239 registered Limousin and 2703 registered Simmental beef cattle genotyped with either the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip or the Illumina BovineHD BeadChip. For the 264 Simmental animals that were genotyped with the BovineHD BeadChip, genotypes for markers present on the BovineSNP50 BeadChip were extracted. Deregressed estimated breeding values were used as observations in weighted analyses that estimated marker effects to derive direct genomic breeding values for each breed. For each breed, genotyped individuals were clustered into five groups using K-means clustering, with the aim of increasing within-group and decreasing between-group pedigree relationships. Cross-validation was performed five times for each breed, using four groups for training and the fifth group for validation. For each trait, we then applied a weighted bivariate analysis of the direct genomic breeding values of genotyped animals from all five validation sets and their corresponding deregressed estimated breeding values to estimate variance and covariance components. Results: After minimizing relationships between training and validation groups, estimated genetic correlations between each trait and its direct genomic breeding values ranged from 0.39 to 0.76 in Limousin and from 0.29 to 0.65 in Simmental. The efficiency of selection based on direct genomic breeding values relative to selection based on parent average information ranged from 0.68 to 1.28 in genotyped Limousin and from 0.51 to 1.44 in genotyped Simmental animals. The efficiencies were higher for 323 non-genotyped young Simmental animals, born after January 2012, and ranged from 0.60 to 2.04. Conclusions: Direct genomic breeding values show promise for routine use by Limousin and Simmental breeders to improve the accuracy of predicted genetic merit of their animals at a young age and increase response to selection. Benefits from selecting on direct genomic breeding values are greater for breeders who use natural mating sires in their herds than for those who use artificial insemination sires. Producers with unregistered commercial Limousin and Simmental cattle could also benefit from being able to identify genetically superior animals in their herds, an opportunity that has in the past been limited to seed stock animals.

On the Application of Clustering Techniques for Office Buildings' Energy and Thermal Comfort Classification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID			English	Article						Buildings; clustering; clustering algorithms; energy efficiency; energy management; parametric study	PERFORMANCE	The aim of this paper is to develop and propose an integrated classification method for the determination of office buildings' energy and thermal comfort rating classes. The applications of five clustering techniques: Hierarchical, K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Models, Fuzzy, and Neural algorithms to a large building dataset are tested in order to investigate the appropriate method for establishing energy and thermal comfort classifications. For the clustering results testing, three internal validity indices: the Silhouette, the Davies Bouldin, and the Dunn Index have been applied, in order to select the appropriate number of clusters and the most efficient algorithm for each case. The proposed classification approach is also evaluated through comparisons with the methodologies that are recommended by the European standards. The classification results are used for a parametric study of common buildings' characteristics in each rating class, in order to provide with a tool for adopting improvement recommendations for buildings' energy efficiency.

Most of the traditional PE detection methods depend on the professional physician's judgment. Serious PE will lead to death. Therefore, diagnosis of PE is very important. In this paper, we develop an automatic PE detection system for relieving doctor's load. It is divided into five parts - preprocessing, finding pulmonary, vessel searching, vessel tracking and evaluation. In the finding pulmonary part, we use active contour model (ACM) to extract pulmonary area. Next, we use cubic curve contrast enhancement method to enhance the contrast of branch vessel image. Its objective is to highlight the embolism area in the branch vessel. And, in the main vessel searching, we employ k-means algorithm and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to find the main vessel part. Moreover, we propose an effective vessel tracking method to achieve vessel tracking. Finally, we invite three radiologists to help us evaluate the performance of our proposed system and to obtain the ground truth image of our system. We can calculate the precision rate of our system according to these ground truth images. The experimental results show that a total of 62 false positives were obtained for the 16 cases. It means that the ratio of FP/DS is 3.875. At 3.875 FP/DS, the classification successful rate of our system is about 83% in main vessel detection and 82.6% precision rate in branch vessel detection. Finally, our system can relieve doctor's load according to the result of questionnaire analysis.

The Influence of Surrounding Buildings on the Natural Ventilation Performance of Residential Dwellings in Hong Kong	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF VENTILATION			English	Article						natural ventilation; surrounding buildings; prevailing wind; residential buildings; openings configurations; window types	WIND ENVIRONMENTAL-CONDITIONS; PEDESTRIAN-LEVEL WINDS; OUTDOOR HUMAN COMFORT; AIR-QUALITY; URBAN; GUIDELINES; SIMULATION; CANYONS; MODELS	Natural ventilation in residential dwellings is very important for occupants' health and comfort. Previous studies by the authors have concluded that natural ventilation performance in dwellings can be enhanced by positioning the two groups of window openings (bedroom windows and living room windows) in opposite directions or perpendicular to each other; and/or the use of side-hung windows. However, the buildings selected for those studies were located in an isolated site, for the purpose of focused evaluation of the influence of various configuration parameters and window types. However, in Hong Kong, buildings are tightly packed. In this study, the influence of urban environment was thoroughly considered. A residential estate was identified to represent typical characteristics of the urban environment in Hong Kong for CFD modelling and simulations. Bi-variate correlations and K-means cluster analyses were adopted to identify a set of probable local wind conditions, which took into account the combined influence of prevailing wind conditions, urban environment and building levels. Through side-by-side comparison of results obtained with and without considering the influence of surrounding buildings, it was found that surrounding buildings lower the wind power available in the vicinity of buildings by 2.5% to 86.8%, increase the angular spread of prevailing winds and adversely affect natural ventilation in residential dwellings. The increase in the mean age of air (MAA) is 0.6 times to 1.5 times. In respect of influence of openings configurations and window types, the conclusion drawn in this study was found to be in agreement with previous studies.	[Gao, C. F.; Lee, W.

Because of its short larval duration and rapid growth, M. spinosissimus is considered a good candidate for aquaculture. Out study documents for the first time the size at sexual maturity, sexual dimorphism, and allometric growth relative to carapace width for certain secondary sexual characters in male and female M. spinosissimus from the Florida Keys, Florida. Using principal component analysis, K-means cluster analysis, and discriminant analysis, we identified 2 major growth phases in the postlarval benthic life of this species (juvenile or prepubertal and adult or pubertal). The typical growth pattern for majoid crabs includes a third, intermediate growth phase that appears absent in M. spinosissimus. The major cheliped of males was larger than that of females and exhibited positive allometric growth to maturity, after which the level of allometry decreased. In females, both chelipeds exhibited positive allometry throughout ontogeny. Abdominal width was negatively allometric throughout ontogeny in males, whereas in females the abdomen exhibited positive allometric growth until reproductive maturity, at which point it became isometric. Logistic regression indicated that the carapace width at first maturity was 45.2 mm in males and 69.7 mm in females. This new information should be taken into account when assessing stocks and setting harvest regulations if this fishery is to be managed sustainably.

Methods: In total, 2127 singletons were examined by prenatal ultrasound within 3 days before delivery. First, correlation analysis was used to determine a significant USP for fetal grouping. Second, K-means algorithm was utilized for fetal size classification based on the selected USP. Finally, stepwise regression analysis was used to examine input parameters of the ANN model. Results: The estimated fetal weight (EFW) of the new model showed mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 5.26 +/- 4.14% and mean absolute error (MAE) of 157.91 +/- 119.90 g. Comparison of EFW accuracy showed that the new model significantly outperformed the commonly-used EFW formulas (all p < 0.05). Conclusion: We proved the importance of choosing a specific grouping parameter for ANN to improve EFW accuracy. Copyright (C) 2012, Taiwan Association of Obstetrics & Gynecology.

Soft and hard clustering methods for delineation of hydrological homogeneous regions in the southern strip of the Caspian Sea Watershed	JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Cluster analysis; Fuzzy C-Means; Kohonen; regionalisation; soft computing	FLOOD FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; REGIONALIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; REGIME; MODEL	Regionalisation is a fundamental task for transferring hydrological information from gauged to un-gauged catchments. This study employs several soft and hard clustering approaches for regionalisation of the 61 catchments located in the southern strip of the Caspian Sea Watershed. Factor analysis using Principal Component Analysis resulted to four out of 16 catchment's attributes relating to flooding which were then used for regionalisation. Hierarchical and Non-Hierarchical Clustering, K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means and Kohonen methods were studied and compared by L-Moment tests. While in hard clustering approach, distinct clusters of catchments were formed, soft clustering techniques allocated catchments to more than one cluster according to their membership probability. The performance of different clustering methods resulted to the similar number of homogeneous groups. However, the number of sites allocated to the clusters is different. Hard clustering resulted in three clusters at 38, 10 and 13 sites, while Soft clustering allocated 26, 20 and 15 sites to the clusters, respectively. Results indicate a superiority of the soft clustering in the study area where deriving hydrologic groups by hard clustering is problematic.

The first manifestations of DR are tiny capillary dilations known as Microaneurysms (MA) and Exudates. It may provide an early indication of the risk of the Type I Diabetes. The various features of the images of the Retinal Vessels are used to indicate the different MA's and Exudates disease processes. Neural Networks and k-means clustering provide significant benefits in medical research. This Proposed work deals DR with Segmentation and Classification algorithms for the analysis of Retina images. This effectiveness and robustness, together with its simplicity make this Optimized analysis for being integrated into a complete screening system for early DR detection. It proposes an Optimized Soft Computing technique approach for screening the Diabetic retinopathy.	[Raja, D.

There are different system designs for content based image retrieval (CBIR) system. This paper propose a novel system architecture for CBIR system which combines techniques include content-based image and color analysis, as well as data mining techniques. To our best knowledge, this is the first time to propose segmentation and grid module, feature extraction module, K-means and k-nearest neighbor clustering algorithms and bring in the neighborhood module to build the CBIR system.

J	Shi, TN; Wang, JS; Wang, PL; Yue, SH				Shi, Tingna; Wang, Jeenshing; Wang, Penglong; Yue, Shihong			Application of Grid-based K-means Clustering Algorithm for Optimal Image Processing	COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						electrical tomography; number of pixels; image ronconstruction	RAY COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; NEUTRON-RADIOGRAPHY; 2-PHASE FLOW; BEDS	The effectiveness of K-means clustering algorithm for image segmentation has been proven in many studies, but is limited in the following problems: 1) the determination of a proper number of clusters. If the number of clusters is determined incorrectly, a good-quality segmented image cannot be guaranteed; 2) the poor typicality of clustering prototypes; and 3) the determination of an optimal number of pixels. The number of pixels plays an important role in any image processing, but so far there is no general and efficient method to determine the optimal number of pixels. In this paper, a grid-based K-means algorithm is proposed for image segmentation. The advantages of the proposed algorithm over the existing K-means algorithm have been validated by some benchmark datasets. In addition, we further analyze the basic characteristics of the algorithm and propose a general index based on maximizing grey differences between investigated objective grays and background grays. Without any additional condition, the proposed index is robust in identifying an optimal number of pixels. Our experiments have validated the effectiveness of the proposed index by the image results that are consistent with the visual perception of the datasets.

There are used agglomerative hierarchical and nonhierarchical k-means clustering methods. The probabilistic seismic hazard assessment procedure based on the four-dimensional Markovian model of a seismic regime of zones is proposed. Seismic hazard is described by the probability of earthquake occurrence of any number and intensity in the course of a given time interval in some point. It is assumed that the intensity of shakes caused with earthquake from some seismic zone has conditional normal distribution. An algorithm of assessment of the seismic hazard on a territory within the range of several seismic zones is proposed.

Statistically if we plan to do so, it becomes pre-dominantly very difficult task. In this paper an attempt is made to develop a model of agricultural development in Haryana using Structural Equation Modelling technique. Structural equation models have been estimated with maximum likelihood technique assuming five dimensions for agricultural sector. Scores for latent variables from the best fitted model were computed and K-means cluster analysis have been used for the purpose of studying levels of development.	[Sheoran, O.

We explore spatial social diversity and assess opportunities to encounter diversity in an urban context. In doing so, we prepared a description of diversity in the residential communities of two cities, Leeds and Warsaw, using census data for small areas (UK 2001, Poland 2002). Selected variables were used to represent the key social dimensions of difference: demographic, socioeconomic, ethnic, and disability. A cluster analysis using a k-means algorithm was implemented for each city separately and for the two cities combined using harmonized indicators. We selected eight cluster solutions for each city which had different profiles and spatial distributions. A combined cluster analysis showed that there was little overlap in community types across the two cities. The paper illustrates that Leeds and Warsaw residents experience very different opportunities to encounter difference which need to be taken into account when local diversity policies are implemented.

Long-term Water Quality Variations and Chlorophyll a Simulation with an Emphasis on Different Hydrological Periods in Lake Baiyangdian, Northern China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						artificial neural networks; chlorophyll a; hybrid evolutionary algorithm; hydrological period; Lake Baiyangdian; water quality variations	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; NAKDONG RIVER KOREA; FRESH-WATER; EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION; NUTRIENT; PHYTOPLANKTON; SHALLOW; EUTROPHICATION; DYNAMICS; NITROGEN	Eutrophication and water quality degradation comprise one of the most important environmental problems associated with protecting freshwater. Here, systematical analyses of trends, qualitative and quantitative analyses of water quality variables, and simulations of eutrophication were conducted to evaluate biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), dissolved oxygen (DO), chlorophyll a (Chl a), and Secchi disk data (SD) based on separate hydrological periods to enhance our understanding of lake ecosystem restoration. Long-term trends were identified using seasonal-trend decomposition with local error sum of squares, while non-supervised artificial neural networks were used to identify qualitative characteristics, and quantitative characteristics were measured using statistical analyses. Numerical simulation of Chl a by the hybrid evolutionary algorithm provided a theoretical solution for ecological warnings. The results were as follows: (1) declining trends in BOD, TP, TN, DO and Chl a were observed during long-term seasonal decomposition after December 2006, but SD increased after June 2003; (2) partitioned K-means maps revealed quantitative characteristics with heterogeneous changes during three hydrological periods, with BOD, TN, SD and Chl a showing the highest clustering quality; (3) BOD and DO showed clear relative hierarchies when compared with other parameters based on quantitative analysis; (4) Chl a simulation revealed heterogeneous changes in the three hydrological periods, and sensitivity analyses indicated that BOD was highly sensitive to Chl a, but TP was not. The sensitivities of other parameters changed during different hydrological periods. The methods described here can be used as preliminary management tools for degraded lakes.

We propose and justify a clusterability criterion for data sets. We present variants of Lloyd's heuristic that quickly lead to provably near-optimal clustering solutions when applied to well-clusterable instances. This is the first performance guarantee for a variant of Lloyd's heuristic. The provision of a guarantee on output quality does not come at the expense of speed: some of our algorithms are candidates for being faster in practice than currently used variants of Lloyd's method. In addition, our other algorithms are faster on well-clusterable instances than recently proposed approximation algorithms, while maintaining similar guarantees on clustering quality. Our main algorithmic contribution is a novel probabilistic seeding process for the starting configuration of a Lloyd-type iteration.

Application of dimensionality reduction to visualisation of high-throughput data and building of a classification model in formulated consumer product design	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RESEARCH & DESIGN			English	Article						Formulated products; System properties; Dimensionality reduction; S-Isomap; Classification		Several dimensionality reduction techniques were applied to two data sets of consumer products formulations in order to infer their intrinsic structure and specific product design rules. High throughput experiments were used to generate the data sets of sufficient size. Supervised isometric feature mapping (S-Isomap) was combined with a k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) classifier and k-means clustering algorithm to perform categorization of viscosity of new formulations, not used to train the model. We compared prediction results of this approach with several well-established classification models. The results show the accuracy of the S-Isomap based approach to be superior and with a potential for further improvement. Compared with other dimensionality reduction techniques, applying S-Isomap has allowed for a superior visualization of category separation within the formulations, for the data sets used.

To determine key induced proteins and enzymes required for degradation of toluene, ethylbenzene, benzene, p-cymene, and p-cumate, we performed comprehensive proteome analysis using a combination of 1-D SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS in cells grown in the presence of each aromatic hydrocarbon. Semi-quantitative analysis using protein content calculated from the exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI) was performed for each proteome data set, and the resulting data were compared. Of 5250 known proteins in P. putida F1, 1733-2368 expressed proteins were identified. All of the key enzymes in the degradation pathways were identified. Additionally, the proteins induced by the aromatic hydrocarbons, regulators, and transporters were also found. Using K-means clustering analysis of the proteome data sets, substrate-specific induced proteins were characterized, ranging from 62 to 164 in number. The functions of most of these proteins were not unknown in relation to the metabolism of aromatic hydrocarbons. These results suggest that the approaches used here are ideal as a primary investigation of the various physiological characteristics of bacterial cells. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Farrou, I; Kolokotroni, M; Santamouris, M				Farrou, Ifigenia; Kolokotroni, Maria; Santamouris, Mat			A method for energy classification of hotels: A case-study of Greece	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS			English	Article						Hotel; Energy consumption; Classification; Clustering; Benchmarks	INDOOR AIR-QUALITY; SCHOOL BUILDINGS; CONSUMPTION; CONSERVATION; PERFORMANCE; HELLAS; BENCHMARKING; ALGORITHM	Hotels are a diverse building type with high normalized energy end-use because of its focus to provide best facilities for guests. There is scope, and in many countries legislative requirements, to reduce energy consumption without compromising facilities; case-studies from tourism intensive countries could be useful for demonstrating such possibilities. This paper presents a method of deriving energy benchmarks to enable classification of hotels in Greece based on operational energy use in terms of electricity and oil. The method of classification defines clusters of hotels using the k-means algorithm controlled with the silhouette plot after applying normalization factors for the operational energy data to correct for size, operation (seasonal or annual) and climatic conditions. Ninety hotels are analysed in the sample presented in this paper; and well separated clusters are defined for the whole sample and for the sample split in hotels with annual and seasonal operation. Energy consumption varies considerably between and within clusters indicating that a range of energy consumption targets might be more suitable than single value benchmarks for this type of building.

Accurate diagnosis of atrial tachyarrhythmias is important, as they have different therapeutic options and clinical decisions. In view of this, we have made an attempt to develop a discrimination mechanism between artrial utter and atrial fibrillation. The methodology consists of mean heart beat interval detection using Pan Tompkins algorithm, calculation of sample entropy of heart beat interval time series, computation of box counting FD from CWT coefficients of raw ECG, statistical significance test, and subsequent pattern classification using different classifiers. Different wavelet basis functions like Daubechies-4, Daubechies-6, Symlet-2, Symlet-4, Symlet-6, Symlet-8, Coiflet-2, Coiflet-5, Biorthogonal-1.3, Biorthogonal-3.1, and Mayer wavelet have been used to compute CWT coefficients. Features are evaluated using statistical analysis and subsequently two-class pattern classification is done using unsupervised (k-means, fuzzy c-means, and Gaussian mixture model) and supervised (error back propagation neural network and support vector machine) techniques. In order to reduce the bias in choosing the training and testing set, k-fold cross validation is used. The obtained results are compared and discussed. It is found that the supervised classifiers provide higher accuracy in comparison to the set of unsupervised classifiers.

Patients and methods: In a retrospective study of 50 patients (41 GBM and 14 MET) who underwent T2/FLAIR/T1(post-contrast) imaging and PWI, morphological (circularity, surface area), perfusion (rCBV in the ring-like tumor area, rCBV in the peritumoral area, percentage of signal intensity recovery at the end of first pass) and texture parameters in the peritumoral area were estimated. Statistical differences and performances were assessed using Wilcoxon's test and receiver operating characteristic curves, respectively. Multiparametric classification of tumors was performed using k-means clustering. Results: Significant statistical differences in circularity, surface area, rCBVs, percentage of signal intensity recovery and texture parameters (energy, entropy, homogeneity, correlation, inverse differential moment, sum average) were observed between MET and GBM (P < 0.05). Moderate-to-good classification performances were found with these parameters. Clustering based on rCBV and texture parameters (contrast, sum average) differentiated MET from GBM with a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 71%. Conclusion: Combining perfusion and visual texture parameters within a statistical classifier significantly improved the differentiation of a single brain MET and GBM.

Factors affecting vegetation and soil recovery in the Mediterranean woodland of the Canary Islands (Spain)	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						Abandoned farmland; Pumice; Resilience; Soil degradation; Succession; Thermophilous woodland; Volcanic soils	LAND ABANDONMENT; CONSERVATION; SUCCESSION; REGENERATION; RESTORATION; RESILIENCE; GRADIENTS; TENERIFE; EROSION; FIELDS	We investigated whether human-induced soil degradation may hinder the regeneration of a semiarid Mediterranean-type ecosystem with high biodiversity and conservation interest on the Canary Islands. To further this aim, the replacement of plant species and life-forms and the variation in soil quality were studied during the process of succession in old fields abandoned at different times and in relicts of the original thermophilous woodland by means of multivariate techniques of ordination (RDA, DCA, CCA) and clustering (k-means + IndVal). The studied ecosystem showed a limited capacity for recovery, which appears to be lower than in other similar semiarid Mediterranean ecosystems. Soil parent material exerted a considerable influence on plant reestablishment, and this process was more efficient with pumice-type rocks. Human activities have given rise to a loss of soil organic matter and an enrichment of certain nutrients, which revert to their normal levels once disturbance ceases. However, the erosion resulting from ploughing, farming and subsequent land abandonment has resulted in irreversible degradation of the soil water regime, thus severely limiting the restoration of the original ecosystem. We concluded that aridification due to soil degradation may, in certain cases, prevent the complete regeneration of thermophilous woodlands of the Canary Islands, and it must be taken into account when performing restoration activities. Pumice mulch can be useful for restoration, as it provides a suitable substrate in key stages of the plant recolonisation process. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Mora, J.

This paper considers the problem of constructing a genetic regulatory network (GRN) using the discrete dynamic system (DDS) model approach. Although considerable research has been devoted to building GRNs, many of the works did not consider the time-delay effect. Here, the authors propose a time-delay DDS model composed of linear difference equations to represent temporal interactions among significantly expressed genes. The authors also introduce interpolation scheme and re-sampling method for equalizing the non-uniformity of sampling time points. Statistical significance plays an active role in obtaining the optimal interaction matrix of GRNs. The constructed genetic network using linear multiple regression matches with the original data very well. Simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and model.

Arguments with lack of credibility in an argumentation tree may negatively affect decisions in a collaborative decision making process if they are not identified collectively by the group. To address this issue, we perform clustering analysis on an argumentation tree using the K-means clustering algorithm on credibility factors of arguments such as degree of an argument, and collective determination of an argument. Arguments are classified into multiple groups: from highly credible to lack of credibility. It helps capture the rationale of selection of the most favorable solution alternative by the system. It helps decision makers identify arguments with high credibility based on collective determination. We perform an empirical study of the method and its results indicate that it is effective in supporting collective decision making using the system.

Traditionally, analyses were performed for large environments like regions and nations. However, with the advent of Smart Grids, the study of the behavior of smaller environments has become a necessity to allow a deeper micromanagement of the energy grid. This paper presents a data processing system to analyze energy consumption patterns in industrial parks, based on the cascade application of a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and the clustering k-means algorithm. The system is validated with real load data from an industrial park in Spain. The validation results show that the system adequately finds different behavior patterns which are meaningful, and is capable of doing so without supervision, and without any prior knowledge about the data.

However, there are still some problems in face recognition system in which the light changes, expression changes, head movements and accessory occlusion are the main issues. In this article, a robust face recognition scheme is proposed. Speeded-Up Robust Features algorithm is used for extracting the feature vectors with scale invariance and pose invariance from face images. Then PCA is introduced for projecting the SURF feature vectors to the new feature space as PGA-SURF local descriptors. Finally, the K-means algorithm is applied to clustering feature points, and the local similarity and global similarity are then combined to classify the face images. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed scheme is better than other methods, and PCA-SURF feature is more robust than original SURF and SIFT local descriptors against the accessory, expression, and pose variations.

J	Jimenez, M; Castanedo, S; Medina, R; Camus, P				Jimenez, Mirian; Castanedo, Sonia; Medina, Raul; Camus, Paula			A methodology for the classification of estuary restoration areas: A management tool	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article							SELF-ORGANIZING MAPS; TIDAL INLETS; WETLAND RESTORATION; STABILITY; PATTERNS; FLORIDA; HYDRODYNAMICS; SEDIMENTATION; SYSTEMS; BASINS	Planning the recovery of estuarine areas represents a major challenge for environmental managers, who must find a balance between the desired environmental restoration, understood as the return to natural conditions, and the different socioeconomic uses currently borne by the estuaries. This work presents a methodology to optimize decision-making in accordance with the objectives which might arise in projects for the hydrodynamic restoration of estuaries. Socioeconomic issues are not considered in this study. The new approach is based on a classification of the zones to be restored according to characteristics representing their hydrodynamic performance and the possible morphodynamic effects of the restoration on the rest of the estuary. To achieve this, the four following parameters were chosen: (1) changes in tidal prism induced by restoration of that zone (Delta Omega), (2) the distance between the concession and the estuary inlet (L), (3) the tidal wave phase lag (phi) and (4) the flood potential of the restoration area (I). The classification combines self-organizing maps (SOM) and the K-means algorithm. The methodology was applied in a total of 139 areas (concessions) on ten estuaries along the entire coast of Cantabria (Northern Spain) where a Spanish Ministry of the Environment Recuperation Plan is under way. The results classify the 139 areas of restoration into five clusters. Empirical relationships were used to estimate the effects the restoration of each cluster may have on the estuary's various morphodynamic elements (cross-sectional area of the estuary mouth, area of tidal flats, volume of tidal channels and volume of the ebb tidal delta), giving managers an overall view of the potential effects of the restoration in each zone and providing a basis on which to plan these actions.

A wavelet-based damage diagnosis algorithm using principal component analysis	STRUCTURAL CONTROL & HEALTH MONITORING			English	Article						damage diagnosis; statistical pattern classification; wavelet analysis; structural safety; near real-time damage identification	HEALTH MONITORING BENCHMARK	The applicability of the Haar and Morlet wavelet transforms of the vibration signals for structural damage diagnosis was demonstrated in previous papers by the authors. Two significant developments that followed the initial research are presented in the current paper. In the first part of the paper, a data preprocessing algorithm is developed to enable optimal signal selection from a database of baseline signals for damage diagnosis purposes. The second part of the paper describes the extraction of the damage sensitive feature vector as a function of the energies at the fifth, sixth, and seventh dyadic scales of the vibration signal that serve for damage detection. Both data preprocessing and feature extraction models involve the use of principal components analysis. The process of damage detection is automated using the k-means algorithm and the gap statistic. A simple damage extent measure is also discussed. Finally, the migration of damage sensitive feature vectors with increased damage is illustrated for vibration signals obtained from the American Society of Civil Engineers' benchmark structure numerical simulations.

This type of models is frequently used in visual recognition tasks like object class recognition or human action recognition. An entity is represented as a histogram of codewords, which are traditionally clustered with unsupervised methods like k-means or random forests and then classified in a supervised way. We propose a new supervised method for joint codebook creation and class learning, which learns the cluster centers of the codebook in a goal-directed way using the class labels of the training set. As a result, the codebook is highly correlated to the recognition problem, leading to a more discriminative codebook. We propose two different learning algorithms, one based on error backpropagation and the other based on cluster label reassignment. We apply the proposed method to human action recognition from video sequences and evaluate it on the KTH data set, reporting very promising results. The proposed technique allows us to improve the discriminative power of an unsupervised learned codebook or to keep the discriminative power while decreasing the size of the learned codebook, thus decreasing the computational complexity due to the nearest neighbor search.

Cloud Properties over the North Slope of Alaska: Identifying the Prevailing Meteorological Regimes	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE			English	Article							PHASE ARCTIC CLOUD; BULK MICROPHYSICS SCHEME; PART I; RADIATION PROPERTIES; EXPLICIT FORECASTS; STRATIFORM CLOUDS; MODEL SIMULATIONS; STRATUS CLOUDS; BEAUFORT SEA; SURFACE	Long time series of Arctic atmospheric measurements are assembled into meteorological categories that can serve as test cases for climate model evaluation. The meteorological categories are established by applying an objective k-means clustering algorithm to 11 years of standard surface-meteorological observations collected from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2010 at the North Slope of Alaska (NSA) site of the U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM). Four meteorological categories emerge. These meteorological categories constitute the first classification by meteorological regime of a long time series of Arctic meteorological conditions. The synoptic-scale patterns associated with each category, which include well-known synoptic features such as the Aleutian low and Beaufort Sea high, are used to explain the conditions at the NSA site. Cloud properties, which are not used as inputs to the k-means clustering, are found to differ significantly between the regimes and are also well explained by the synoptic-scale influences in each regime. Since the data available at the ARM NSA site include a wealth of cloud observations, this classification is well suited for model observation comparison studies. Each category comprises an ensemble of test cases covering a representative range in variables describing atmospheric structure, moisture content, and cloud properties. This classification is offered as a complement to standard case-study evaluation of climate model parameterizations, in which models are compared against limited realizations of the Earth atmosphere system (e.g., from detailed aircraft measurements).

J	Gao, Q; Zhang, ZH; Lu, F				Gao Qun; Zhang Zhong-hu; Lu Feng			Comparison of Discriminative Methods of Hypoglycemic Drugs by Raman Spectroscopy	SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS			Chinese	Article						Raman spectroscopy; Cluster analysis; Self-organizing maps; Hypoglycemic tablets	CHEMOMETRICS	In the present paper, four kinds of cluster analysis methods were used in rapid, non-destructive discrimination of hypoglycemic tablets by the Raman spectroscopy technology. Nine kinds of hypoglycemic tablets, including 48 samples, were determined using a Raman spectrometer. The sample data were pretreated with the methods of frequency range cutting, baseline correction, smoothing and vector normalization, then were analyzed by K-means, hierachical cluster, self-organizing maps (SOM) and PCA-SOM respectively. The results demonstrated that SOM was better than K-means and hierachical cluster, and it provided the best discrimination when combined with PCA.

K-means cluster analysis of rehabilitation service users in the home health care system of Ontario: examining the heterogeneity of a complex geriatric population. Arch Phys Med Rehabil 2012;93:2198-205. Objective: To examine the heterogeneity of home care clients who use rehabilitation services by using the K-means algorithm to identify previously unknown patterns of clinical characteristics. Design: Observational study of secondary data. Setting: Home care system. Participants: Assessment information was collected on 150,253 home care clients using the provincially mandated Resident Assessment Instrument Home Care (RAI-HC) data system. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Assessment information from every long-stay (>60d) home care client that entered the home care system between 2005 and 2008 and used rehabilitation services within 3 months of their initial assessment was analyzed. The K-means clustering algorithm was applied using 37 variables from the RAI-HC assessment. Results: The K-means cluster analysis resulted in the identification of 7 relatively homogeneous subgroups that differed on characteristics such as age, sex, cognition, and functional impairment. Client profiles were created to illustrate the diversity of this geriatric population. Conclusions: The K-means algorithm provided a useful way to segment a heterogeneous rehabilitation client population into more homogeneous subgroups. This analysis provides an enhanced understanding of client characteristics and needs, and could enable more appropriate targeting of rehabilitation services for home care clients.

Multivariate Analysis in the Maximum Strength Performance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE			English	Article						1RM; muscle biopsy; cross-sectional area; body mass	MUSCLE-FIBER CHARACTERISTICS; CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA; FORCE PRODUCTION; POWER LIFTERS; ENDURANCE; WEIGHTLIFTERS; ARCHITECTURE; EXERCISE; RUNNERS; GREATER	This study performed an exploratory analysis of the anthropometrical and morphological muscle variables related to the one-repetition maximum (1RM) performance. In addition, the capacity of these variables to predict the force production was analyzed. 50 active males were submitted to the experimental procedures: vastus lateralis muscle biopsy, quadriceps magnetic resonance imaging, body mass assessment and 1RM test in the leg-press exercise. K-means cluster analysis was performed after obtaining the body mass, sum of the left and right quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area (Sigma CSA), percentage of the type II fibers and the 1RM performance. The number of clusters was defined a priori and then were labeled as high strength performance (HSP1RM) group and low strength performance (LSP1RM) group. Stepwise multiple regressions were performed by means of body mass, Sigma CSA, percentage of the type II fibers and clusters as predictors' variables and 1RM performance as response variable. The clusters mean +/- SD were: 292.8 +/- 52.1 kg, 84.7 +/- 17.9 kg, 19249.7 +/- 1645.5 mm(2) and 50.8 +/- 7.2% for the HSP1RM and 254.0 +/- 51.1 kg, 69.2 +/- 8.1 kg, 15483.1 +/- 1 104.8 mm(2) and 51.7 +/- 6.2 %, for the LSP1RM in the 1RM, body mass, Sigma CSA and muscle fiber type II percentage, respectively. The most important variable in the clusters division was the Sigma CSA. In addition, the Sigma CSA and muscle fiber type II percentage explained the variance in the 1RM performance (Adj R-2 = 0.35, p = 0.0001) for all participants and for the LSP1RM (Adj R-2 = 0.25, p = 0.002). For the HSP1RM, only the Sigma CSA was entered in the model and showed the highest capacity to explain the variance in the 1RM performance (Adj R-2 = 0.38, p = 0.01). As a conclusion, the muscle CSA was the most relevant variable to predict force production in individuals with no strength training background.	[de Souza, E. O.; Tricoli, V.; Paulo, A.

J	Bouras, C; Tsogkas, V				Bouras, Christos; Tsogkas, Vassilis			A clustering technique for news articles using WordNet	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						News clustering; k-Means; W-k means; Cluster labeling; Partitional clustering		The Web is overcrowded with news articles, an overwhelming information source both with its amount and diversity. Document clustering is a powerful technique that has been widely used for organizing data into smaller and manageable information kernels. Several approaches have been proposed which, however, suffer from problems like synonymy, ambiguity and lack of a descriptive content marking of the generated clusters. In this work, we are investigating the application of a great spectrum of clustering algorithms, as well as similarity measures, to news articles that originate from the Web. Also, we are proposing the enhancement of standard k-means algorithm using the external knowledge from WordNet hypernyms in a twofold manner: enriching the "bag of words" used prior to the clustering process and assisting the label generation procedure following it. Furthermore, we are examining the effect that text preprocessing has on clustering. Operating on a corpus of news articles derived from major news portals, our comparison of the existing clustering methodologies revealed that k-means, gives better aggregate results when it comes to efficiency. This is amplified when the algorithm is accompanied with preliminary steps for data cleaning and normalizing, despite its simple nature. Moreover, the proposed WordNetenabled W-k means clustering algorithm significantly improves standard k-means generating also useful and high quality cluster tags by using the presented cluster labeling process.

As a pilot study, we analyzed the breath sounds of 21 dysphagic individuals, 11 of which demonstrated aspiration during the fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) or videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS). We found that the low frequency components of the power spectrum of the breath sounds after a swallow show higher magnitude when there is aspiration. Thus, we divided the frequency range below 300 Hz into three sub-bands and calculated the average power of the breath sound signal in each sub-band as the characteristic features for the stage 1 classification into two groups of aspirated and non-aspirated patients. Then, for the aspirated group, the unsupervised fuzzy k-means clustering algorithm was deployed to label the breath sounds immediately after a swallow as aspiration or non-aspiration. The results were compared with the FEES/VFSS assessments provided by the speech language pathologists. The results are encouraging: more than 86 % accuracy in detection of silent aspiration. While the proposed method should be verified on a larger dataset, the results are promising for the use of acoustical analysis as a clinical tool to detect silent aspiration.

J	Trzcinski, T; Lepetit, V; Fua, P				Trzcinski, Tomasz; Lepetit, Vincent; Fua, Pascal			Thick boundaries in binary space and their influence on nearest-neighbor search	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Approximate nearest neighbor search; Binary vectors; Locality sensitive hashing; Hierarchical k-means	DIMENSIONS; ALGORITHM; FEATURES	Binary descriptors allow faster similarity computation than real-valued ones while requiring much less storage. As a result, many algorithms have recently been proposed to binarize floating-point descriptors so that they can be searched for quickly. Unfortunately, even if the similarity between vectors can be computed fast, exhaustive linear search remains impractical for truly large databases and approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search is still required. It is therefore surprising that relatively little attention has been paid to the efficiency of ANN algorithms on binary vectors and this is the focus of this paper. We first show that binary-space Voronoi diagrams have thick boundaries, meaning that there are many points that lie at the same distance from two random points. This violates the implicit assumption made by most ANN algorithms that points can be neatly assigned to clusters centered around a set of cluster centers. As a result, state-of-the-art algorithms that can operate on binary vectors exhibit much lower performance than those that work with floating point ones. The above analysis is the first contribution of the paper. The second one is two effective ways to overcome this limitation, by appropriately randomizing either a tree-based algorithm or hashing-based one. In both cases, we show that we obtain precision/recall curves that are similar to those than can be obtained using floating point number calculation, but at much reduced computational cost.

Data analysis is challenging and in the present study, we apply three different techniques (PMF. ART-2a and K-means) to a regional ATOFMS dataset collected at Harwell, UK. For the first time, Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) was directly applied to single particle mass spectra as opposed to clusters already generated by the other methods. The analysis was performed on a total of 56,898 single particle mass spectra allowing the extraction of 10 factors, their temporal trends and size distributions, named CNO-COOH (cyanide, oxidized organic nitrogen and carboxylic acids), SUL (sulphate), NH4-OOA (ammonium and oxidized organic aerosol), NaCl, EC+ (elemental carbon positive fragments), OC-Arom (aromatic organic carbon), EC- (elemental carbon negative fragments), K (potassium), NIT (nitrate) and OC-CHNO (organic nitrogen). The 10 factor solution from single particle PMF analysis explained 45% of variance of the total dataset, but the factors are well defined from a chemical point of view. Different EC and OC components were separated: fresh EC (factor EC) from aged EC (factor EC+) and different organic families (factors NH4-OOA, OC-Arom, OC CHNO and CNO-COOH). A comparison was conducted between PMF, K-means cluster analysis and the ART-2a artificial neural network. K-means and ART-2a give broadly overlapping results (with 9 clusters, each describing the full composition of a particle type), while PMF, by effecting spectral deconvolution, was able to extract and separate the different chemical species contributing to particles, but loses some information on internal mixing. Relationships were also examined between the estimated volumes of ATOFMS PMF factors and species concentrations measured independently by GRAEGOR and AMS instruments, showing generally moderate to strong correlations.

Only after objective validity tests to determine the appropriate number of clusters, a k-means cluster algorithm was applied to extract seven characteristic size distributions from the data set. The average total number concentrations of the clustered size distributions range from 6067 cm(-3) to 12,818 cm(-3) with modal diameters between 5 and 193 nm. The clustered size distributions were analyzed in terms of their physical properties (shape, log-normal modes, mode diameter), temporal occurrence (e.g. time of day, season) and their relation to local meteorology. Three different types of cluster distributions being represented by either three or two log-normal modes (in only one case) were characterized at the site: four clusters that were indicative for urban-type size distributions with different influence of anthropogenic and traffic activities occurring 69% of the study time, two maritime-type distributions (29% occurrence) and one nucleation-type size distribution (2% occurrence). We were able to relate the clusters to characteristic modal diameters, different temporal occurrence on the daily and annual cycle, e.g. urban clusters that occurred year round and those that were attributed to winter daytime situations specifically. Analysis of the daily patterns clearly reveals the influence of local traffic activity on three of the four urban-type cluster size distributions. The method offers the chance for a simple kind of source apportionment by establishing signature size distributions based on the physical properties of the aerosol size spectra.

Fuzzy c-means clustering approach for classification of Indian coal seams with respect to their spontaneous combustion susceptibility	FUEL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Mine fire; Spontaneous combustion; Coal; Classification; Fuzzy sets; Membership function	IMAGE SEGMENTATION; MEANS ALGORITHM	Mine fire due to spontaneous combustion in coal mines is a global concern. This leads to serious environmental and safety hazards and considerable economic losses. Therefore, it is essential to assess and classify the coal seams with respect to their proneness to spontaneous combustion to plan the production, storage and transportation capabilities in mines. This paper presents a fuzzy c-mean approach for classification of coal seams based on their proneness to spontaneous combustion. This produces sets of non-exclusive clusters that allow coal samples to have memberships in multiple clusters, rather than only in exclusive partitiobns, as generated by hierarchical and k means clustering. In this research work, fifty one coal samples of varying ranks belonging to both high and low susceptibility to spontaneous combustion have been collected from all the major coalfields of India. Using moisture, volatile matter, ash content and crossing point temperature of the coal samples as the parameters, the proposed algorithm has been applied to classify the coal seams into three different categories. This classification will be useful for the planners and field engineers for taking ameliorative measures in advance for preventing the occurrence of mine fires. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Spectral matching for abundances and clustering analysis of stars on the giant branches of omega Centauri	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						stars: abundances; stars: AGB and post-AGB; globular clusters: individual: omega Centauri (NGC 5139)	SPACE-TELESCOPE OBSERVATIONS; GLOBULAR-CLUSTERS; STELLAR POPULATIONS; MAIN-SEQUENCE; MULTIPLE POPULATIONS; METALLICITY RELATION; PROPER-MOTION; RELATIVE AGES; RED GIANTS; EVOLUTION	We have determined stellar parameters and abundances for 221 giant branch stars in the globular cluster omega Centauri. A combination of photometry and lower resolution spectroscopy was used to determine temperature, gravity, metallicity, [C/Fe], [N/Fe] and [Ba/Fe]. These abundances agree well with those found by previous researchers and expand the analysed sample of the cluster. k-means clustering analysis was used to group the stars into four homogeneous groups based upon these abundances. These stars show the expected anticorrelation between [C/Fe] and [N/Fe]. We investigated the distribution of CN-weak/CN-strong stars on the colour-magnitude diagram. Asymptotic giant branch stars, which were selected from their position on the colour-magnitude diagram, were almost all CN weak. This is in contrast to the red giant branch where a large minority were CN strong. The results were also compared with cluster formation and evolution models. Overall, this study shows that statistically significant elemental and evolutionary conclusions can be obtained from lower resolution spectroscopy.	[Simpson, Jeffrey D.; Cottrell, P.

Sighting data were collected during two scientific cruises in December 2009 and January and February 2011 and integrated into a geographical information system with environmental variables such as sea surface temperature, ocean colour, depth, distance to oceanographic fronts and distance from shore. We used a principal component analysis (PCA) to identify patterns in data and a non-hierarchic cluster analysis (K means) to classify observations into groups. A total of 19 sightings (96 individuals) were recorded. Group size ranged from one to twelve dolphins (mean 5.05). We could differentiate two groups in relation to the environmental conditions where animals were found, one group occurring in shallow coastal waters and the other occurring in deeper and colder waters further offshore. The present study contributes novel information on environmental measures associated with hourglass dolphin distribution in the South-West Atlantic and Southern Oceans. Additionally, it includes relatively high sighting clusters of this species in two highly productive and biodiverse areas (Burdwood Bank/Isla de los Estados and the South Shetland Islands).

Design: Analyses of nationally representative data with cross-sectional complex stratified design. Setting: Canadian Community Health Survey, Cycle 2.2 (2004). Subjects: A total of 14 277 participants aged 19-65 years, in whom dietary intake was assessed using a single 24 h recall, were included in the study. After determining total intake and the contribution of beverages to total energy intake among age/sex groups, cluster analysis (K-means method) was used to classify males and females into distinct clusters based on the dominant pattern of beverage intakes. To test differences across clusters, chi(2) tests and 95% confidence intervals of the mean intakes were used. Results: Six beverage clusters in women and seven beverage clusters in men were identified. 'Sugar-sweetened' beverage clusters - regular soft drinks and fruit drinks - as well as a 'beer' cluster, appeared for both men and women. No 'milk' cluster appeared among women. The mean consumption of the dominant beverage in each cluster was higher among men than women. The 'soft drink' cluster in men had the lowest proportion of the higher levels of education, and in women the highest proportion of inactivity, compared with other beverage clusters. Conclusions: Patterns of beverage intake in Canadian women indicate high consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages particularly fruit drinks, low intake of milk and high intake of beer. These patterns in women have implications for poor bone health, risk of obesity and other morbidities.

Performance of clustering procedures for grouping germplasms based on mixture data with missing observations	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Cluster analysis; Imputation; Missing data; Mixture data; Qualitative traits; Quantitative traits; Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)		Occurrence of missing observations in mixture of qualitative and quantitative trait data is a common feature in breeding experiments. However, it becomes difficult to cluster the germplasms in presence of missing data. In the present study, five different clustering methods, six different ways of imputing missing data and three levels of missing observations have been considered in order to compare the performance of clustering procedures meant for mixture data. It was found that all the clustering methods are robust against imputation up to 5% missing observations. The INDOMIX and PRINQUAL methods in conjunction with k-means clustering with imputation of missing observations by (i) mean substitution in quantitative traits and frequency substitution in qualitative traits and (ii) multiple imputation in quantitative traits and 0 imputation in qualitative traits found to perform better than EM, ANN and PCAMIX methods for classification of germplasms. This study has been conducted during 2009-10 at Indian Agricultural Statistics Research Institute and for illustration purpose data has been obtained from National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources.

In this paper, a framework for cascaded cluster ensembles is proposed, in which there are two layers of clustering. The first layer is considering about the diversity of clustering, and generating different partitions. In doing so, the samples in input space are mapped into labeled samples in a label attribute space whose dimensionality equals the ensemble size. In the second layer clustering, we choose a clustering algorithm as the consensus function. In other words, a combined partition is given by using the clustering algorithm on these labeled samples instead of input samples. In the second layer, we use the reduced k-means, or the reduced spectral, or the reduced hierarchical linkage algorithms as the clustering algorithm. For comparison, nine consensus functions, four of which belong to cascaded cluster ensembles are used in our experiments. Promising results are obtained for toy data as well as UCI data sets.

Sparse principal components by semi-partition clustering	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS			English	Article						Cluster-based; CSPC; Gene expression; Nonzero-loading; k-means	CRITERIA	A cluster-based method for constructing sparse principal components is proposed. The method initially forms clusters of variables, using a new clustering approach called the semi-partition, in two steps. First, the variables are ordered sequentially according to a criterion involving the correlations between variables. Then, the ordered variables are split into two parts based on their generalized variance. The first group of variables becomes an output cluster, while the second one-input for another run of the sequential process. After the optimal clusters have been formed, sparse components are constructed from the singular value decomposition of the data matrices of each cluster. The method is applied to simple data sets with smaller number of variables (p) than observations (n), as well as large gene expression data sets with p a parts per thousand << n. The resulting cluster-based sparse principal components are very promising as evaluated by objective criteria. The method is also compared with other existing approaches and is found to perform well.

Distressed, Immobilized, or Lacking Employer Support? A Sub-classification of Acute Work-Related Low Back Pain	JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL REHABILITATION			English	Article						Low back pain; Screening; Subgroups; Sub-classification; Disability risk factors	PERCEIVED ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; RISK-FACTORS; PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; SUBGROUPING PATIENTS; PRIMARY-CARE; DISABILITY; SCALE; RETURN; VALIDATION	Introduction One possibility for reducing the disabling effects of low back pain (LBP) is to identify subgroups of patients who might benefit from different disability prevention strategies. The aim of this study was to test the ability to discern meaningful patient clusters for early intervention based on self-reported concerns and expectations at the time of an initial medical evaluation. Methods Workers seeking an initial evaluation for acute, work-related LBP (N = 496; 58 % male) completed self-report measures comprising of 11 possible risk factors for chronicity of pain and disability. Outcomes of pain, function, and return-to-work were assessed at 3-month follow-up. A K-means cluster analysis was used to derive patient subgroups based on risk factor patterns, and then these subgroups were compared with respect to 3-month outcomes. Results Eight of the 11 measures showed significant associations with functional recovery and return-to-work, and these were entered into the cluster analysis. A 4-cluster solution met criteria for cluster separation and interpretability, and the four clusters were labeled: (a) minimal risk (29 %), (b) workplace concerns (26 %); (c) activity limitations (27 %); and (d) emotional distress (19 %). Functional outcomes were best in the minimal risk group, poorest in the emotional distress group, and intermediate in the other two groups. A global severity index at baseline also showed highest overall risk in the emotional distressed group. Conclusions Patterns of early disability risk factors from this study suggest patients have differential needs with respect to overcoming emotional distress, resuming normal activity, and obtaining workplace support. Classifying patients in this manner may improve the cost-benefit of early intervention strategies to prevent long-term sickness absence and disability due to LBP.

Based on 10 years of rainfall measurements and K-means clustering, 152 rainfall events were classified into three rainfall regimes. The mean statistical features of different rainfall regimes display a marked difference. Rainfall Regime I is events of medium amounts (31.8 mm) and medium duration (1371 min). Rainfall Regime II is events with high amounts (54.0 mm), long duration (2548 min), and an infrequent occurrence. Rainfall Regime Ill is events of low amount (22.2 mm). short duration (494 min) and high frequency. Each rainfall regime results in differing levels of runoff and erosion and Rainfall Regime I causes the greatest proportion of accumulated discharge (368.7 mm) and soil loss (4283 t). In the different rainfall regimes, the values of the mean runoff coefficient and the mean sediment load were ordered as follows: Rainfall Regime II> Rainfall Regime I> Rainfall Regime Ill. These results suggest that greater attention should be paid to Rainfall Regimes I and II because they had the most erosive effect. In the Wangjiaqiao watershed, the changes in land use primarily affected the paddy fields, where the cropland decreased significantly and the forest and orchards increased by 9.9% and 7.7%, respectively, during 1995-2004. The ANOVA shows land use changes caused significant decreasing trends in the runoff coefficients (P<0.01) and sediment loads (P<0.01). In order, the most sensitive response of runoff and erosion to land use was Rainfall Regime II> Rainfall Regime> Rainfall Regime III. Rainfall characteristics are decisive for the relative importance of different storm runoff generation mechanisms. The land use changes in the study watershed have considerably decreased runoff and soil loss. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To date, we are unable to accurately predict the cycle life of a battery under real-world operating conditions. There are a couple of reasons for that; on the one hand, the battery technology evolves rapidly whereas the battery cycle life testing requires large amounts of time and on the second hand, we know little about real-world duty profile of batteries. The work presented here intends to tackle this latter issue. In this paper, we evaluate real-world collected data of battery usage in an instrumented neighbourhood electric vehicle, using a new approach based on the concept of duty pulses. This automated method relies on the K-means clustering algorithm and aims at classifying duty pulses according to their current and energy distributions. We present the way data must be prepared and we discuss the results of the clustering. We report on the duty profiles of this vehicle's battery under various driving conditions.

KARST.; NORWAY SPRUCE; RADIAL GROWTH; NORTHERN EUROPE; TATRA MOUNTAINS; SCOTS PINE; POLAND; DENDROCHRONOLOGY; RESPONSES; PROGRAM	Tree ring width (TRW), maximum (MXD), mean (MED) and minimum (MID) wood density were investigated in samples from the vicinity of the Tuchola Forest Biosphere Reserve (Northern Poland) in an attempt to distinguish the relative importance of climate and insect attack on the growth of Norway spruce. Selected climate parameters were used for a multiple regression to predict tree-ring width during insect outbreaks. This also used AICc for model selection. Additionally, k-means clustering was then used to group the yearly data of TRW, MXD, MID and the data of insect outbreaks. The respective climate data and data on insect outbreaks during the years 1962-1996 revealed a strong influence of May precipitation on TRW and insect outbreaks on MID. Missing tree rings or narrow rings and lower MXD together with higher MID might indicate increased insect activity. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Fotouhi, A; Montazeri, GM				Fotouhi, A.; Montazeri, Gh M.			An Investigation on Vehicle's Fuel consumption and Exhaust Emissions in Different Driving Conditions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Vehicle; Fuel consumption; Exhaust emission; Driving pattern; K-means clustering; Traffic condition	PATTERN-RECOGNITION; TRAFFIC FLOW; SYSTEM	In this paper, vehicle's fuel consumption and exhaust emissions are investigated in different driving conditions based on driving segments clustering. Driving data collection is performed using global positioning systems in real traffic conditions. The driving data is clustered into five groups using k-means clustering technique. Vehicle's fuel consumption and exhaust emissions (i.e. HC, NOx and CO) are investigated in different driving conditions using computer simulations. The relationship between driving features and vehicle's fuel consumption and exhaust emissions is also presented. According to the simulation results, vehicle's fuel consumption decreases as average velocity increases from very congested traffic condition to freeway traffic condition. The most HC is produced is low speeds. The results also demonstrate that high accelerations and decelerations cause high amount of NOx. About the CO emission, a moderate driving in which the velocity and accelerations are not very high or very low, leads to the least amount of CO.

In the beam domain, the backscatter strength values - geometrically and radiometrically corrected - are used to extract a large number of Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features with different input parameters. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied in order to achieve dimensionality reduction whilst a K-means algorithm clusters as "shipwreck site" a large number of beams for each line. After the geo-referencing process, a K-nearest-neighbors (K-NN) technique is applied as a filter for possible misclassifications. Finally, the shape of the shipwreck site is defined from the georeferenced beams using the alpha-shape method, constructing an output compatible with Geographic Information Systems (GIS).

K-means with clustering property in PSO resulted in rapid convergence while chaotic search with ergodicity characteristic in PSO contributed to refine gbest. Experimental results indicated that the proposed KCPSO approach could evidently speed up convergence and successfully solving complex multidimensional problems. Besides, KCPSO was compared with canonical PSO in performance. And, a case study was also employed to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Clustering gene expression data using a diffraction-inspired framework	BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE			English	Article						Diffraction; Clustering; Gene-expression data	MICROARRAY DATA; CLASS DISCOVERY; PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION; VALIDATION; CANCER	Background: The recent developments in microarray technology has allowed for the simultaneous measurement of gene expression levels. The large amount of captured data challenges conventional statistical tools for analysing and finding inherent correlations between genes and samples. The unsupervised clustering approach is often used, resulting in the development of a wide variety of algorithms. Typical clustering algorithms require selecting certain parameters to operate, for instance the number of expected clusters, as well as defining a similarity measure to quantify the distance between data points. The diffraction-based clustering algorithm however is designed to overcome this necessity for user-defined parameters, as it is able to automatically search the data for any underlying structure. Methods: The diffraction-based clustering algorithm presented in this paper is tested using five well-known expression datasets pertaining to cancerous tissue samples. The clustering results are then compared to those results obtained from conventional algorithms such as the k-means, fuzzy c-means, self-organising map, hierarchical clustering algorithm, Gaussian mixture model and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). The performance of each algorithm is measured using an average external criterion and an average validity index. Results: The diffraction-based clustering algorithm is shown to be independent of the number of clusters as the algorithm searches the feature space and requires no form of parameter selection. The results show that the diffraction-based clustering algorithm performs significantly better on the real biological datasets compared to the other existing algorithms. Conclusion: The results of the diffraction-based clustering algorithm presented in this paper suggest that the method can provide researchers with a new tool for successfully analysing microarray data.

J	Azadeh, A; Saberi, M; Jiryaei, Z				Azadeh, Ali; Saberi, Morteza; Jiryaei, Zahra			An intelligent decision support system for forecasting and optimization of complex personnel attributes in a large bank	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Decision support system; Personnel efficiency; Data mining; Data envelopment analysis; ANN; K-Means algorithm; Optimization	ROUGH SET-THEORY; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY; FEATURE-SELECTION; RULE INDUCTION; EFFICIENCY; ALGORITHM; CONSUMPTION; PREDICTION	Developing decision support system (DSS) can overcome the issues with personnel attributes and specifications. Personnel specifications have greatest impact on total efficiency. They can enhance total efficiency of critical personnel attributes. This study presents an intelligent integrated decision support system (DSS) for forecasting and optimization of complex personnel efficiency. DSS assesses the impact of personnel efficiency by data envelopment analysis (DEA), artificial neural network (ANN), rough set theory (RST), and K-Means clustering algorithm. DEA has two roles in this study. It provides data to ANN and finally it selects the best reduct through ANN results. Reduct is described as a minimum subset of features, completely discriminating all objects in a data set. The reduct selection is achieved by RST. ANN has two roles in the integrated algorithm. ANN results are basis for selecting the best reduct and it is used for forecasting total efficiency. Finally. K-Means algorithm is used to develop the DSS. A procedure is proposed to develop the DSS with stated tools and completed rule base. The DSS could help managers to forecast and optimize efficiencies by selected attributes and grouping inferred efficiency. Also, it is an ideal tool for careful forecasting and planning. The proposed DSS is applied to an actual banking system and its superiorities and advantages are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Efficient colour texture image retrieval by combination of colour and texture features in wavelet domain	ELECTRONICS LETTERS			English	Article								A new approach for image retrieval by combination of colour and texture features is proposed. This approach uses the histogram of feature vectors, which are constructed from the coefficients of some subbands of wavelet transform and chosen according to their intrinsic characters. A K-means algorithm is used to quantise feature vectors. The experimental results both on small size databases (40 classes of textures) and large size databases (167 classes of textures) show that, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed approach can achieve better retrieval performance.

Fractal features-based pattern recognition of partial discharge in XLPE power cables using extension method	IET GENERATION TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION			English	Article								Partial discharge (PD) may cause insulation deteriorations in power facilities and may demonstrate impact on the reliability. Therefore PD detection with pattern recognition is seen as an effective approach in the high-voltage (HV) insulation diagnostics of power systems. Based on an extension method, a PD recognition system for HV power cables is proposed in this study. A PD detector is used to measure raw three-dimension PD patterns of cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) power cables using an L sensor, according to which two fractal features (the fractal dimension and the lacunarity) and the mean discharge are extracted as critical PD features that form the cluster domains of defect types. The matter-element models of the PD defect types are then built according to the PD features derived from practical experimental results. The PD defect type can be directly identified by the correlation degrees between a tested pattern and the matter-element models. The recognition ability is investigated on 160 sets of PD patterns of XLPE power cables and compared with a multilayer neural network and K-means method. The results show that a high accuracy together with a high tolerance in the presence of noise interference is reached by use of the extension method.

DETERMINISTIC INITIALIZATION OF THE K-MEANS ALGORITHM USING HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Partitional clustering; sum of squared error criterion; k-means; cluster center initialization; thresholding	GLOBAL THRESHOLDING TECHNIQUES; MULTIVARIATE DATA; PERFORMANCE	K-means is undoubtedly the most widely used partitional clustering algorithm. Unfortunately, due to its gradient descent nature, this algorithm is highly sensitive to the initial placement of the cluster centers. Numerous initialization methods have been proposed to address this problem. Many of these methods, however, have superlinear complexity in the number of data points, making them impractical for large data sets. On the other hand, linear methods are often random and/or order-sensitive, which renders their results unrepeatable. Recently, Su and Dy proposed two highly successful hierarchical initialization methods named Var-Part and PCA-Part that are not only linear, but also deterministic (nonrandom) and order-invariant. In this paper, we propose a discriminant analysis based approach that addresses a common deficiency of these two methods. Experiments on a large and diverse collection of data sets from the UCI machine learning repository demonstrate that Var-Part and PCA-Part are highly competitive with one of the best random initialization methods to date, i.e. k-means++, and that the proposed approach significantly improves the performance of both hierarchical methods.

Design: Retrospective intercenter outcome study. Patients: Upper dental casts from 129 children with repaired UCLP and 30 controls were analyzed by the trigonometric method. Setting: Six European cleft centers. Main outcome measures: Sagittal, transverse, and vertical dimensions of the palate were observed. Statistics: Palate variables were analyzed with descriptive methods and nonparametric tests. Regarding several various characteristics measured on a relatively small number of subjects, hierarchical, k-means clustering, and principal component analyses were used. Results: Mean values of the observed dimensions for five cleft groups differed significantly from the control (p < .05). The group with one-stage closure of the cleft differed significantly from all other cleft groups in most variables (p < .05). Principal component analysis of all 159 cases identified three clusters with specific morphologic characteristics of the palate. A similar number of treated children were classified into each cluster, while all children without clefts were classified in the same cluster. The percentage of treated children from a particular group that fit this cluster ranged from 0% to 70% and increased with age at palatal closure and number of primary surgical procedures. Conclusion: At 6 years of age, children with stepwise repair and hard palate closure after the age of two more frequently result in palatal dimensions of noncleft control than children with earlier palatal closure and one-stage cleft repair.

Hyperspectral remote sensing provides a tool for mapping macroalgal habitats if the algal communities are spectrally resolvable. We compared the performance of three classification approaches to determine the distribution of macroalgae communities in the rocky intertidal zone of Heligoland, Germany, using airborne hyperspectral (AISA(eagle)) data. The classification results of two supervised approaches (maximum likelihood classifier and spectral angle mapping) are compared with an approach combining k-Means classification of derivative measures. We identified regions of different slopes between main pigment absorption features of macroalgae and classified the resulting slope bands. The maximum likelihood classifier gained the best results (Cohan's kappa = 0.81), but the new approach turned out as a time-effective possibility to identify the dominating macroalgae species with sufficient accuracy (Cohan's kappa = 0.77), even in the heterogeneous and patchy coverage of the study area.

J	Wang, MH; Tsai, HH				Wang, M. H.; Tsai, H. H.			Fuel cell fault forecasting system using grey and extension theories	IET RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION			English	Article							DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM; MODEL	This study proposes a fault forecasting system for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), which uses a set of wireless sensors to accomplish fuel cell (FC) condition monitoring. The software interface of the FC fault forecast system uses LabVIEW software. Owing to the time delay condition of FC reactions, this study first forecasts all the operation features of the FC using a Grey prediction model. Then, an extension diagnosis method uses the forecasted values of the features to forecast the future operational conditions. Thus, the complex condition monitoring and fault forecasting problem of the FC can be implemented effectively. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, comparative studies using a multilayer neural network and k-means algorithm are conducted on 400 sets of field-test patterns of 200 W PEMFC with rather encouraging results.

This study proposes to extend this methodology with the inclusion of multivariate analysis to reveal particular patterns in the energy use of a system. The objective was to demonstrate the usefulness of multivariate exploratory techniques to analyze the variability found in a farming system and, establish efficiency categories that can be used to improve the energy balance of the system. To this purpose an input-output analysis was applied to the major greenhouse tomato production area in Colombia. Individual energy profiles were built and the k-means clustering method was applied to the production factors. On average, the production system in the study zone consumes 141.8 GJ ha(-1) to produce 96.4 CJ ha(-1), resulting in an energy efficiency of 0.68. With the k-means clustering analysis, three clusters of farmers were identified with energy efficiencies of 0.54, 0.67 and 0.78. The most energy efficient cluster grouped 56.3% of the farmers. It is possible to optimize the production system by improving the management practices of those with the lowest energy use efficiencies.

Usually, this analysis reveals that the attacker has run an exploit that takes advantage of a system vulnerability. Pinpointing, in a given log file, the execution of one such an exploit, if any, is very valuable for computer security. This is both because it speeds up the process of gathering evidence of the intrusion, and because it helps taking measures to prevent a further intrusion, e. g., by building and applying an appropriate attack signature for intrusion detection system maintenance. This problem, which we call postmortem intrusion detection, is fairly complex, given both the overwhelming length of a standard log file, and the difficulty of identifying exactly where the intrusion has occurred. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for postmortem intrusion detection, which factors out repetitive behavior, thus, speeding up the process of locating the execution of an exploit, if any. Central to our intrusion detection mechanism is a classifier, which separates abnormal behavior from normal one. This classifier is built upon a method that combines a hidden Markov model with k-means. Our experimental results establish that our method is able to spot the execution of an exploit, with a cumulative detection rate of over 90%. In addition, we propose an entropy-based approach that speeds up the construction of a profile for ordinary system behavior.

Batchwise experiments were carried out to evaluate the thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors of the aqueous nitrate adsorption onto D417 resin. Response surface methodology (RSM) with BoxBehnken design (BBD) was employed to analyze the competition disturbance and matrix effects in terms of pH, organic matter concentration, contact time (CT) and salinity. Test results revealed that the resin was composed of the quaternary ammonium functional group and exhibited a considerable adsorption capacity of 23.46 to 22.81?mg center dot g-1 at the temperature ranging from 293.15 to 313.15?K. Mean free energy of adsorption calculated from the DubininRadushkevich model showed that the adsorption was realized through ion-exchange pathway. Gibbs free energy change, enthalpy change and entropy change illustrated that the aqueous nitrate sorption was feasible and spontaneous. It was also found that the pseudo-second-order model could well describe the adsorption kinetics, and the intraparticle diffusion was the main rate-limiting step. RSM with BBD showed that CT and salinity had significant effects on aqueous nitrate adsorption, whereas the impacts of pH and dissolved organic matter were negligible.

Methylation of the Polycomb Group Target Genes Is a Possible Biomarker for Favorable Prognosis in Colorectal Cancer	CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY BIOMARKERS & PREVENTION			English	Article							MICROSATELLITE INSTABILITY; DNA METHYLATION; BREAST-CANCER; STEM-CELLS; PHENOTYPE; CARCINOMA; RISK; BRAF	Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cancer in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with ever increasing incidence rates. DNA methylation is a common event in CRC where it is now considered an important phenomenon in CRC carcinogenesis and useful for the classification and prognosis of CRC. Methods: To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underpinning CRC in Saudi Arabian patients, we profiled the DNA methylation frequency of key genes (MLH1, MSH2, RASSF1A, SLIT2, HIC1, MGMT, SFRP1, MYOD1, APC, CDKN2A, as well as five CIMP markers) in 120 sporadic CRC cases. CRC tumors originating from the rectum, left, and right colons are represented in this cohort of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Results: The most common methylation frequency was detected in the polycomb group target genes (PCGT) including SFRP1 (70%), MYOD1 (60.8%), HIC1 (61.7%), and SLIT2 (56.7%). In addition, MGMT methylation was detected at a high frequency (68.3%). RASSF1A, APC, and CDKN2A methylation frequencies were 42.5%, 25%, and 32.8%, respectively. K-means clustering analysis of the methylation events results in the clustering of the CRC samples into three groups depending on the level of methylation detected. Conclusion: Group II (PCGT methylation and CIMP-negative) methylation signature carried a favorable prognosis for male patients, whereas older patients with group 1 rare methylation signature have a potentially poorer clinical outcome.

J	Pyo, GC; Park, JW; Moon, SI				Pyo, Gi-Chan; Park, Jin-Woo; Moon, Seung-Il			Coherency Identification of Generators Using a PAM Algorithm for Dynamic Reduction of Power Systems	ENERGIES			English	Article						dynamic reduction; equivalent circuits; power system modeling	EQUIVALENTS	This paper presents a new coherency identification method for dynamic reduction of a power system. To achieve dynamic reduction, coherency-based equivalence techniques divide generators into groups according to coherency, and then aggregate them. In order to minimize the changes in the dynamic response of the reduced equivalent system, coherency identification of the generators should be clearly defined. The objective of the proposed coherency identification method is to determine the optimal coherent groups of generators with respect to the dynamic response, using the Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) algorithm. For this purpose, the coherency between generators is first evaluated from the dynamic simulation time response, and in the proposed method this result is then used to define a dissimilarity index. Based on the PAM algorithm, the coherent generator groups are then determined so that the sum of the index in each group is minimized. This approach ensures that the dynamic characteristics of the original system are preserved, by providing the optimized coherency identification. To validate the effectiveness of the technique, simulated cases with an IEEE 39-bus test system are evaluated using PSS/E. The proposed method is compared with an existing coherency identification method, which uses the K-means algorithm, and is found to provide a better estimate of the original system.

The key to GAK-KNN lies on defining a new weight assignment model, which can fully take the adverse effects that caused by the uneven distribution of training sample between classes and within classes into account. GAK-KNN can significantly improve the identification rate of the minority class and overall classification performance.

Assessment of the Psychometric Properties of an English Version of the Cancer Dyspnea Scale in People With Advanced Lung Cancer	JOURNAL OF PAIN AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Dyspnea (MeSH); lung neoplasms (MeSH); reproducibility of results (MeSH); Cancer Dyspnea Scale; symptom measurement	CHRONIC-BRONCHITIS; FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT; BREATHLESSNESS; DISEASE; LIFE; QUALITY; RELIABILITY; TRANSLATION; VALIDATION; INSTRUMENT	Context. Dyspnea is a poorly understood subjective sensation. Existing dyspnea measures fail to adequately address its multidimensionality. A Japanese group developed and validated the Cancer Dyspnea Scale (CDS) for assessing dyspnea in patients with advanced lung cancer. Objectives. We evaluated the validity and reliability of the English version of the CDS (CDS-E) that has 12 items and takes, on average, 140 seconds for individuals to complete. Methods. Eligible patients had advanced lung cancer, consented, and were fluent in English. Participants completed a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), the modified Borg scale, the CDS-E, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung quality-of-life scale. Demographic, radiographic, and treatment information were obtained from patients' medical records. Results. One hundred twelve participants were enrolled at three sites in the U. S., Australia, and the U. K. Mean age was 64.5 years (SD 11.5); 90% were Caucasian, 68% had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1, and 50% had non-small cell carcinoma. All completed the CDS-E independently, without difficulty. The CDS-E had reasonable internal consistency overall (Cronbach's alpha = 0.71) and for each of the three factors (effort, anxiety, discomfort Cronbach's alpha = 0.80-0.84). CDS-E scores were significantly correlated with the 100 mm VAS (r = 0.82; P < 0.001) and the modified Borg (r = 0.87; P < 0.001). After factor analysis, the CDS-E was revised by removing three items (r-CDS-E). Conclusion. The CDS-E and r-CDS-E are reliable and valid measures of the sensation and the psychological components of dyspnea, with the shorter version having similar psychometric properties.

An algorithm of sub segment means was presented for the data dimensionality reduction of the speech feature parameter, then the parameters of speech feature after dimensionality reduction were clustered by K-Means clustering algorithm and speech sample was divided into different feature groups. Based on this, an algorithm of cross-grouping and training was proposed to speech feature clustering, which improved the accuracy of speech feature grouping by clustering algorithm. In the recognition stage, the cross-grouping algorithm of HMM model was proposed to the identification operation. Compared with the traditional HMM, the computation can be reduced by 50% or more in the case that the speech recognition rate was guaranteed.

It is simple and suitable for different kinds of data, but can't be applied to the non-spherical clusters, different size or different density clusters. And it can not deal with the nonlinear division efficiently too. In this paper, we present a new K-means algorithm based on the kernel Fisher discrimination (KKFD). This algorithm uses the kernel Fisher discrimination to treat the nonlinear division, which can extend the application field of K-mean algorithm.

J	Han, LX; Yan, H				Han, Lixin; Yan, Hong			Hybrid method for the analysis of time series gene expression data	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Time series analysis; Gene expression; Regression analysis; Function approximation; K-means clustering	NETWORKS; MODELS; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; ALIGNMENT	Time series analysis plays an increasingly important role in the study of gene expression data. Some problems, such as a large amount of noise and a small number of replicates, are computational challenges in time series expression data analysis. This paper proposes a hybrid method for analyzing time series gene expression data (HMTS). In the HMTS method, we employ a combination of K-means clustering, regression analysis and piecewise polynomial curve fitting. The K-means clustering procedure is used to divide noisy time series into different clusters, and regression analysis is used to delete outliers according to different clusters. All time series data are divided into multiple segmentations, and polynomial curve fitting is used to fit all segmentation data. The HMTS method can obtain good estimates, especially when there is noise in the data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Tsimpiris, A; Kugiumtzis, D				Tsimpiris, Alkiviadis; Kugiumtzis, Dimitris			Feature selection for classification of oscillating time series	EXPERT SYSTEMS			English	Article						feature selection; classification; data base; oscillating time series; non-linear measures; electroencephalogram	HYBRID FEATURE-SELECTION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; EPILEPTIC SEIZURES; PREDICTION; OPTIMIZATION; SIGNALS; ATTRACTORS; ALGORITHMS; SYSTEM	We propose a forward sequential feature selection scheme based on k-means clustering algorithm to derive the feature subset that classifies best the time series data base, according to the criterion of the corrected Rand index. Moreover, we investigate the effect of the standardization scheme on the feature selection and propose a standardization given by the transform to standard Gaussian distribution. Our interest in this work is in classification of oscillating dynamical systems on the basis of measures computed on time series from these systems. The features to be selected are measures of linear and non-linear analysis of time series, such as auto-correlation and Lyapunov exponents, as well as oscillation characteristics, such as the mean magnitude of peaks. Simulations on known oscillating deterministic and stochastic systems showed that, for repeated realizations of the same classification task, the proposed feature selection scheme selected very often the same best feature subset, giving high classification accuracy for any standardization. We found that, regardless of the standardization, the highest classification accuracy could be obtained with a small feature subset, containing most frequently an oscillating-related feature. The same setting was applied to records of epileptic electroencephalogram signals, giving varying results and dependent on the standardization.

J	Gryspeerdt, E; Stier, P				Gryspeerdt, Edward; Stier, Philip			Regime-based analysis of aerosol-cloud interactions	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							GENERAL-CIRCULATION MODEL; SATELLITE DATA; POLLUTION; PRODUCTS; REMOTE	Previous global satellite studies into the indirect aerosol effect have relied on determining the sensitivity of derived Cloud Droplet Number Concentration (N-d) to co-located Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD). These studies generally find a positive N-d sensitivity to AOD changes over ocean, but some find a negative sensitivity over land, in contrast to that predicted by models and theory. Here we investigate the N-d sensitivity to AOD in different cloud regimes, determined using a k-means clustering process on retrieved cloud properties. We find the strongest positive N-d sensitivity in the stratiform regimes over both land and ocean, providing the majority of the total sensitivity. The negative sensitivity previously observed over land is generated by the low cloud fraction regimes, suggesting that it is due to the difficulty of retrieving N-d at low cloud fractions. When considering a mean sensitivity, weighted by liquid cloud fraction to account for sampling biases, we find an increased sensitivity over land, in some regions becoming positive. This highlights the importance of regime based analysis when studying aerosol indirect effects. Citation: Gryspeerdt, E., and P.

J	Romero, MJDD; Lambas, DG; Muriel, H				Dominguez Romero, Mariano Javier de Leon; Garcia Lambas, Diego; Muriel, Hernan			An improved method for the identification of galaxy systems: measuring the gravitational redshift by dark matter haloes	MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						gravitation; galaxies: groups: general; galaxies: haloes; dark matter	CLUSTERS; CATALOG	We introduce a new method for the identification of galaxy systems in redshift surveys based on the halo model. This method is a modified version of the K-means identification algorithm developed by Yang et al. We have calibrated and tested our algorithms using mock catalogues generated using the Millennium Simulations and applied them to the NYU-DR7 galaxy catalogue (based on the SDSS data sets). Using this local sample of groups and clusters of galaxies, we have measured the effect of gravitational redshift produced by their host dark matter haloes. Our results show radial velocity decrements consistent with general relativity predictions and previous measurements by Wojtak et al. in clusters of galaxies.

Patents, scientific publications and expenditure in R&D as well as the personnel involved in these activities are taken into account as proxy indicators, together with variables related to education and economy in order to classify R&D performance in 25 European Union (EU) Member States. This study classifies these countries using a set of variables which characterize them from 2005 to 2008 and analyses the most relevant ones for this classification. The Multilayer Perceptron Model (MLP) and the Product-Unit Neural Network (EPUNN) models, both trained by evolutionary algorithms (EA), were used to classify yearly country observations in clusters previously defined by employing unsupervised algorithm k-means clustering, obtaining four different classes of national R&D performance: low, moderate, high and innovation driven economies. Finally, our methodology is compared to other classification methods normally used in machine learning. The results show that while various methods of classification exist, our methodology obtains models with a significantly lower number of coefficients without decreasing their accuracy in predicting the classification of other European countries or in these countries in the following years.

Nonlinear clustering is utilized to partition in two a selected subset of pixels representing both changed and unchanged areas. Once the optimal clustering is obtained, the learned representatives of each group are exploited to assign all the pixels composing the multitemporal scenes to the two classes of interest. Two approaches based on different assumptions of the difference image are proposed. The first accounts for the difference image in the original space, while the second defines a mapping describing the difference image directly in feature spaces. To optimize the parameters of the kernels, a novel unsupervised cost function is proposed. An evidence of the correctness, stability, and superiority of the proposed solution is provided through the analysis of two challenging change-detection problems.

However, classification of human motion patterns is still a challenging topic because of the variations in kinetics and kinematics of human movements. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for automatic classification of motion trajectories of human upper limbs. The proposed scheme starts from transforming 3-D positions and rotations of the shoulder/elbow/wrist joints into 2-D trajectories. Discriminative features of these 2-D trajectories are, then, extracted using a probabilistic shape-context method. Afterward, these features are classified using a k-means clustering algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art techniques.

J	Koh, J; Chaudhary, V; Dhillon, G				Koh, Jaehan; Chaudhary, Vipin; Dhillon, Gurmeet			Disc herniation diagnosis in MRI using a CAD framework and a two-level classifier	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED RADIOLOGY AND SURGERY			English	Article						Lower back pain; Computer-aided diagnosis; Classifier; Disc herniation; Lumbar spine; MRI	LOW-BACK-PAIN; INTERVERTEBRAL DISC	Purpose Disc herniation in the lumbar spine is a common condition, so an automated method for diagnosis could be helpful in clinical applications. A computer-aided framework for disk herniation diagnosis was developed for use in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Materials and Method A computer-aided diagnosis framework for lumbar spine with a two-level classification scheme for disc herniation diagnosis was developed using heterogeneous classifiers: a perceptron classifier, a least mean square classifier, a support vector machine classifier, and a k-Means classifier. Each classifier makes a diagnosis based on a feature set generated from regions of interest that contain vertebrae, a disc, and the spinal cord. Then, an ensemble classifier makes a final decision using score values of each classifier. We used clinical MR image data from 70 subjects in T1-weighted sagittal view and T2-weighted sagittal view for evaluation of the system. Results MR images of 70 subjects were processed using the proposed framework resulting in successful detection of disc herniation with 99% accuracy, achieving a speedup factor of 30 in comparison with radiologist's diagnosis. Conclusion The computer-aided framework works well to diagnose herniated discs in MRI scans. We expect the framework can be adapted to effectively diagnose a variety of abnormalities in the lumbar spine.

Identifying irrigation zones across a 7.5-ha 'Pinot noir' vineyard based on the variability of vine water status and multispectral images	IRRIGATION SCIENCE			English	Article							SOIL ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; WINEGRAPE PRODUCTION SYSTEMS; UNDERSTANDING VARIABILITY; CABERNET-SAUVIGNON; MANAGEMENT ZONES; QUALITY; YIELD; SENSITIVITY; VINTAGES	Vine water status, yield and berry composition are variables within a vineyard. There is current interest in defining zones of similar yield and berry composition. The aim of this study was to compare two methods for identifying zones of similar yield within a 7.5-ha 'Pinot noir' vineyard. The two methods were based on: spatial distribution of average midday leaf water potential (I-L) and plant cell density (PCD = near-infrared/red) which is a vegetation index. A proposal for splitting the vineyard into eight new irrigation zones was assessed. A 'blind' zonation based on regular polygons of equal sizes was also established as a standard for comparison. Coefficients of variation (C (v)) in yield for both methods were compared with that of the blind zonation. In 2006 and 2007, a k-means cluster analysis indicated that variability in I-L was mainly effected by soil properties. In both years, the vineyard was fully irrigated (100 % ETc). The two methods did not improve yield C (v) for full irrigation in 2006 and 2007 compared to blind zonation. In 2009, regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) was applied resulting in higher variability in I-L and yield. The I-L method of zonation significantly reduced coefficient of variation under RDI but PCD method did not despite the reduction in C (v) by 16.7 %. We recommend irrigation zonation based on I-L when RDI is applied.
