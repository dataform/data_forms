Due to the requirement of prompt and accurate diagnosis of malaria, the current study has proposed an unsupervised colour image segmentation of malaria parasites using moving k-means (MKM) clustering algorithm. It has been applied on malaria images of P. vivax species. The proposed segmentation method provides a basic step for detection of the presence of malaria parasites in thin blood smears. With the aim of obtaining the fully segmented red blood cells infected with malaria parasites, the malaria images will firstly enhanced by using the partial contrast stretching technique. Then, the MKM clustering algorithm has been applied on the saturation and intensity components of HSI (hue, saturation, intensity) colour space for segmenting the infected cell from the background. After that, the segmented images have been processed using median filter and seeded region growing area extraction algorithms for smoothing the image and removing any unwanted regions from the image, respectively. Finally, the holes inside the infected cell are filled by applying region filling based on morphological reconstruction algorithm. The proposed segmentation method has been analyzed using 100 malaria images which consist of the trophozoite and gametocyte stages. Overall, the results indicate that MKM clustering that has been performed on saturation component image has produced the best segmentation performance with segmentation accuracy of 99.49% compared to the intensity component image with segmentation accuracy of 98.89%.

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for grid-based clustering by finding the optimal grid-size using the boundaries of the clusters. The algorithm has linear time complexity. The problem of outliers is resolved with the help of local outlier factor (LOF). We apply the proposed method on various synthetic as well as biological data sets. The results are compared with K-means and few existing grid-based techniques. The comparison results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The concept of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is considered as a well established precursor stage of AD. Early recognition of AD allows time to plan for the future and to treat patients before marked deterioration occurs. The main objective of this longitudinal study is to identify the structural characteristic of Grey Matter (GM), White Matter (WM) and Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at baseline and structural changes after one year that could serve as accurate predictors of future development of MCI in the normal aging controls and AD in the MCI patients. This paper we have explored the efficacy of different approaches such as k-means, FCM and VBM for the segmentation and the comparative analysis of longitudinal MR images of AD patients and controls. The Longitudinal structural changes were evaluated using Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) over a period of 2 years in 22 MCI patients and 20 normal aging controls. Due to the progressive nature AD, the serial imaging studies tracking the course of progression might improve the diagnostic accuracy of AD. In these results we report a statistically significant trend towards accelerated volume loss in the MCI follow up group compared to the MCI baseline group was observed. The observed changes at an individual level were small, and within the accuracy range of the measurements.

In the first stage, a clustering method is used to identify good quality assets in terms of alpha-reliability asset classification. In the second stage, investment allocation in the selected good quality assets is optimized using a genetic algorithm based on stochastic model of portfolio selection with minimum transaction lot and it's the alpha-reliability decision. Through the two-stage alpha-reliability model process, an optimal portfolio can be determined. The experimental result has showed that its application in portfolio selection is reliable and useful.

In previous work, Hacker et al. found that cluster analysis is a useful tool to understand the underlying spatio-temporal dependencies present in system fault and use logs. However, the cluster analysis used for reducing spatio-temporal dependences should be fast and accurate to understand the underlying stochastic properties of these systems. K-means is a fast cluster analysis method, in which accuracy depends on the use of initialization algorithms that are usually serial and slow. In this paper we present two new parallel strategies for fast seeding K-means cluster analysis. Both strategies were tested on a real problem where the aim was to reduce spatial and temporal dependencies of failures on large supercomputer systems. The performance of both strategies were compared with five existing serial implementations: K-means implementations of 1) Lloyd (L); 2) McQueen (M); and 3) Hartigan - Wong (HW), all of them using Forgy seeding; 4) K-tneans++; and 5) Neural Gas clustering (NG), a more recent and sophisticated method. Our results show that our new Parallel Competitive Fitness approach reduces the Within Sum of Squares (WSQQ) measure, thus increasing cluster quality of the three K-means implementations: L; M; HW, and is 200 times faster than the existing serial K-means++. The existing serial and our new Parallel K-means++ have the lowest WSQQ. Our new Parallel K-means++ is twice as fast as the existing serial K-means++ method, and is 4 times faster than the NG method. Moreover, our new methods did not generate empty clusters, while NG did. As a result of our new techniques, predicting the amount of resources needed to provision VMs processing historic system fault and use data can now be done faster and with more accuracy.

While using this kind of cloud services, one of the biggest problems for the users is to determine the proper number of VMs to complete the jobs considering both budget and time. In this paper, we propose a resource prediction framework (RPF), which can help users choose the minimum number of virtual machines to complete their jobs within a user specified time constraint. In order to verify the feasibility of RPF, we have done three case studies, namely parallel frequent pattern growth (FP-Growth), parallel K-means, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). FP-growth, K-means and PSO are data intensive algorithms. These algorithms are typically executed repeatedly with different execution parameters to find the optimal results. When evaluating RPF by these algorithms in cloud environments, we have to modify them to parallel versions. The evaluation results indicate that RPF can successfully obtain the minimum number of VMs with acceptable errors. According to our case studies, the proposed RPF can be adopted by data intensive jobs by providing flexibility to both end users and cloud system providers.

There are variant types of clustering methods that can be applied in genomic data. These are mainly divided into the two groups, namely, hierarchical and partitional methods. In this paper, as the novelty, we perform a detailed clustering analysis for the recently collected boron microarray dataset to investigate biologically more interesting results and to construct a basis for the selection of the most effective method in the analysis of different microarray datum. In the calculation, we implement the agglomerative hierarchical clustering among hierarchical techniques and use the k-means and the PAMSAM methods within partitional clustering approaches, and finally use a recently improved method, called HIPAM, which is not only a hierarchical but also partitional approach. In the assessment, we compare and discuss the significant genes of the boron data whose estimated signals are found by the FGX normalization method.

Dimensionality Reduction to Improve Content-based Image Retrieval A Clustering Approach	2012 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIOINFORMATICS AND BIOMEDICINE WORKSHOPS (BIBMW)	IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine Workshop-BIBMW		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine Workshops (BIBMW)	OCT 04-07, 2012	Philadelphia, PA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc (CS), Natl Sci Fdn (NSF), Omic Soft Corp, IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Bioinformat		clustering; CBIR; dimensionality; k-means		Techniques of Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) employ a mathematical representation of an image (also called feature vector), to characterize the image in the retrieval process. The feature vector-based representation of an image in CBIR systems causes the "semantic gap" problem, which is the inconsistency between the low-level image feature representation and the high-level image interpretation. However, the usage of a large number of features to represent an image, which seems to be a solution for the semantic gap, leads to the "dimensionality curse" problem. In this paper, we propose to amend the semantic gap along with the dimensionality curse by a dimensionality reduction method called FTK (Feature Transformation based on K-means). FTK performs feature transformation by clustering the feature vector. It employs the clustering principle of k-means to compact the feature vector space. The results indicate that clustering is an approach well-suited to perform dimensionality reduction in CBIR systems.	[Pirolla, Francisco R.; Santos, Marilde T.

Because of the shortcoming of FCM, for example, its results depend on the initial center node and need to specify the community number, based on the fuzzy theory, an improved FCM algorithm(NKFCM) is proposed, which can get the number of communities and the community centers automatically. NKFCM is used to find the communities of network. The experiments in real networks show that this method can get better results.

Nevertheless, there are flaws of selecting the weight of upper and lower approximation, defining the density of samples and searching the center in the Rough K-means Clustering Algorithm with Weight Based on Density. Aiming at the flaws, this paper proposes a solution to search initial central points and combines it with a distance measure with weight which is based on attribute reduction of rough set to achieve the algorithm. This improved algorithm decreases the level of interference brought by the isolated points to the k-means algorithm, and makes the clustering analysis more effective and objective. This experiment was performed by testing the true data sets. The results showed that the improved algorithm is effective, especially to those data sets with huge redundance.

To reach this, they first collect ratings on something from a large number users, and then perform the calculation through some algorithms. The algorithms, however, don't take the credibility of user himself into consideration. The paper proposes a ranking model based on user's credit, which takes user's credit as his weight integrated into his rating, and thus information submitted by different users has different effectiveness. The steps to implement this is firstly to cluster users by K-means to find out senior users, then to evaluate something synthetically by Attribution Coordinate Synthetic Evaluation on condition that senior users' rating is weighted, and finally to get ranking list. The simulation for film recommendation validates the model for recommendation system.

The scheme runs efficiently on the economical wireless ZigBee nodes and uses the link quality indicator (LQI) measured without the need for any additional hardware. It uses fuzzy logic to represent measure noise and surrounding environmental impacts. Position estimation is based upon the fuzzy information provided by all available ZigBee nodes and the surrounding environment is modeled by assembling a set of representative fuzzy vectors. Fuzzy levels are determined by applying the K-means algorithm given the LQI distribution as input. The scheme performance is compared to two popular schemes, the (IBM)-B-3 and the Environment Adaptive. The three are implemented using the Jennic JN5148 ZigBee PRO kit. It is demonstrated that for regular motion the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the other two without high computational cost, slow response, or large memory requirement.

In order to perform comprehensive optimization of film-cooling hole shape, the injection angle of the hole, the lateral expansion angle of the diffuser, the forward expansion angle of the hole and the pitch to hole diameter ratio, are chosen as design variables. Forty experimental designs within design spaces are selected by Latin hypercube sampling method. The response surface approximation method is used to construct the surrogate with objective function values for the experimental designs calculated through Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes analysis. The shear stress transport turbulence model is used as a turbulence closure. The optimization results are processed by the Pareto-optimal method. The Pareto optimal solutions are obtained using a combination of the evolutionary algorithm NSGA-II and a local search method. The optimum designs are grouped by k-means clustering technique and the six optimal points selected in the Pareto optimal solutions are evaluated by numerical analysis. The different trends in the variations of the design variables for each blowing ratios were found, and the optimum designs show enhanced objective function values.

The previous one is best known for its capability of transforming data into high dimension feature space, while the latter one is well known for its natural interpretations and good performance. In this paper, we propose a robust kernel NMF approach using L-2,L-1 norm loss function. Compared with the standard NMF algorithm, the new robust kernel NMF updating algorithm is as elegant and as simple, but with the newly added robustness to handle significantly corrupted datasets because of using L-2,L-1 norm. Experiments on normal and occluded datasets indicate that robust kernel NMF always perform better than k-means and standard NMF.

The equalizer uses non-linear mapping of Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) to overcome the impairments when a binary antipodal signal is transmitted through the nonlinear recursive channel. The Gaussian RBF based tapped delay line (TDL) neural network, used as channel equalizer, is first given a training sequence to compute the centers in an unsupervised manner using K-means clustering algorithm. The weights of the neural network are then adaptively adjusted using recursive least square (RLS) algorithm. The performance of the trained equalizer has been tested to compute the bit error rate (BER) at various SNR levels and for different number of hidden neurons. Finally the proposed equalizer is compared with perceptron classifier and back propagation neural networks.

Decomposition of the state space is vital for avoiding obstacles and generating an efficient trajectory. For the purpose of localization and building an efficient map in an unknown environment, decomposition of this area is equally important. For this reason, an autonomous mobile robot has to manage the free area of its workspace very efficiently. Perfect decomposition of state space will make the map building task very easy, faster and efficient. On the other hand, finding an efficient path is the most difficult part of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. Also, sensors are prone to noise that makes the robot to find the best move really hard. So we integrated the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and K-means clustering algorithm to build a method to formulate an efficient estimation of the future states and manage the environment efficiently as well. Here, Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) will find the accurate estimation on sensor data and K-means clustering algorithm will perform the partitioning task on that data to decompose the environment avoiding the obstacles.

Cluster analysis is one of the major data analysis techniques and k-means one of the most popular partitioning clustering algorithm that is widely used. But the original k-means algorithm is computationally expensive and the resulting set of clusters strongly depends on the selection of initial centroids. Several methods have been proposed to improve the performance of k-means clustering algorithm. In this paper we propose a heuristic method to find better initial centroids as well as more accurate clusters with less computational time. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm generates clusters with better accuracy thus improve the performance of k-means clustering algorithm.	[Mahmud, Md. Sohrab; Rahman, Md.

Previous research has identified time-frequency masking based approaches to blind source separation as a viable approach for multisource reverberant source separation. It is proposed the use of such separation techniques as a front-end to speech recognition will encourage greater recognition accuracy. Experimental evaluations confirmed the hypothesis with an improvement in recognition accuracy of over 20% at a reverberation time of RT60 = 300ms; this is indicative of the potential for future research in this field.

In the scope of research, body measurements were carried out and three kinds of hip shape (flat, normal and plump) were identified with K-Mean Cluster Analysis according to the hip convex angle. Then butt lifting effect of jeans was discussed through changing the back crutch angle and the style line angle of yoke. The corresponding sample jeans were fitted by 15 subjects of three hip shapes and evaluated by both subjects and 15 specialist people in fashion field. It was concluded that the butt lifting effect could be enhanced by increasing the back crutch angle and decreasing the style line angle of yoke. The preferable back crutch angle was 20 degrees similar to 22 degrees, which was conformed to the average hip convex angle (21.3 degrees) of young women, and the suitable style line angle was 74 degrees. The result has been applied in jeans production manufacture.

However, in faced of ever-growing amount of data and higher demand of cluster analysis today, how to improve the performance of K-means has become challenging and significant. So an improved method called parallel K-PSO which combines Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with K-means based on MapReduce is proposed in this paper. Firstly, it takes advantage of PSO to improve the global search ability of K-means, and then it makes K-means parallel with MapReduce to enhance its capability of processing massive data. We evaluate the proposed method through experimental results.

The ergonomic methodologies and data analysis technologies are translated into a potential for better understanding of astronauts' potential incapacitation during space flight. Firstly, the ergonomic simulation experiment is implemented to get the operation force data of basic actions. Secondly, the force data are classified and identified from different operation conditions by the Hybridized K-means method. Finally, the analysis results are utilized to evaluate the condition effect on mechanical characteristics. It shows that the data of suspended conditions affect upper limb strength more significantly than the result of the constrained condition. The Hybridized K-means algorithm is a good attempt of the evaluation methods for the assessment of the astronaut operation capabilities.

The anomaly detection approaches can be classified into semi-supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection. Unsupervised anomaly detection technique is the mainly approaches establish the profile of normal behavior with unlabeled training data that consists of both normal as well as anomalous samples. This paper uses the unsupervised K-MEANS algorithm to model and detect anomaly activities. The aim is to improve the detection rate and decrease the false alarm rate. A K-MEANS algorithm based on information entropy (KMIE) is proposed to detect anomaly activities. KMIE can filter the outliers on the dataset to reduce the negative impact, and indentify the initial cluster centers using entropy method. Then, KMIE can use these centers to iterative calculate and classify records into different clusters. This paper uses KDD CUP 1999 dataset to test the performance of KMIE algorithm. The results show that our method has a higher detection rate and a lower false alarm rate, it achieves expectant aim.

The former is mainly used in similarity-based text corpus clustering methods, while the latter, which is produced by LDA model, is used to identify the topics of texts. We conduct clustering experiments on 20-newsgroups (20NG) datasets. Based on the dataset, two typical text clustering methods are respectively employed to compare the clustering performance of the above two text features. The experiments demonstrate if the optimal topic number is chosen, the topic feature outperforms in the clustering accuracy.

Videos with both a static and moving camera can be tackled, where camera motion effects are overcome via motion compensation. Only pixels undergoing changing motion, found by extracting motion boundary-based activity areas, are processed in order to introduce robustness to camera motion and reduce computational complexity. In these regions, densely sampled grid points on multiple scales are tracked using a KLT tracker, leading to dense multi-scale trajectories, on which HOGHOF descriptors are estimated. The length of each trajectory is determined by detecting changes in the tracked points' motion or appearance using sequential change detection techniques, namely the CUSUM approach. A vocabulary is created for each video's features using Hierarchical K-means, and the resulting fast search trees are used to describe the actions in the videos. SVMs are used for classification, using a kernel based on the similarity scores between training and testing videos. Experiments are carried out with new and challenging datasets for which the proposed method is shown to lead to recognition results that are comparable to or better than existing state of the art methods.

Transmission with a single codeword makes the signal better aligned with the dominant eigenmode of the channel and achieves higher capacity. A design methodology of the global codebook for joint transmission from two transmission points is developed. A codebook is created using K-mean clustering algorithm from a large number of channel samples generated through simulation. Simulation results show that this approach can outperform traditional local precoding approach where two separate codewords from the existing LTE-A MIMO codebook are used from two transmission points.

There are various algorithms and tools available for this purpose. Data mining has a vast range of applications ranging from business to medicine to engineering. In this paper, we discuss the application of data mining in education for student profiling and grouping. We make use of Apriori algorithm for student profiling which is one of the popular approaches for mining associations i.e. discovering co-relations among set of items. The other algorithm used, for grouping students is K-means clustering which assigns a set of observations into subsets. In the field of academics, data mining can be very useful in discovering valuable information which can be used for profiling students based on their academic record. We apply Apriori algorithm to the database containing academic records of various students and try to extract association rules in order to profile students based on various parameters like exam scores, term work grades, attendance and practical exams. We also apply K-means clustering to the same set of data in order to group the students. The implemented algorithms offer an effective way of profiling students which can be used in educational systems.

Web images exist in huge amounts on the web and several methods for their efficient description and representation have been proposed so far. In many of the exploited algorithms, web image information is extracted from textual sources such as image file names, anchor texts, existing keywords and, of course, surrounding text. However, the systems that attempt to mine information for images using surrounding text suffer from several problems, such as the inability to correctly assign all relevant text to an image and discard the irrelevant text at the same time. A novel method for indexing web images is discussed in the present paper. The proposed system uses visual cues in order to obtain a web page segmentation. The segments are represented with semantic metrics and a k-means clustering assigns these segments to the web image they refer to. The evaluation procedure indicates that the semantic representation method of the visual segments delivers a good description for the web images.

Large amounts of research efforts have been made in developing effective bra in MR (magnetic resonance) image tumor segmentation methods in the past years. However algorithms proposed so far are time consuming because it involves lot of mathematical computations. Also serial segmentation of multiple MRI slices (usually required for 3D visualization) takes exponential time. This results in need for improvement in performance as far as the time complexity is concerned. This paper proposes a methodology that incorporates the K-means clustering and morphological operation for parallel segmentation of multiple MRI slices corresponding to single patient. Segmentation of multiple MRI slices for tumor extraction plays major role in 3D (Three Dimensional) visualization and serves as an input for the same. The proposed framework follows SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) model and since the segmentation of individual slice is independent of each other and can be performed in parallel and multithreading definitely speeds up the entire process. Also the framework does not involve any kind of inter-process communication thus the time is saved here as well.

It is important in Internal Medicine for clinical diagnosis and presumptive treatment on a probability model. Prevalence informs the total case load at a given time. Incidence yields a pointer to extent of attention required and choice of measures. Initially K-means clustering is used to group the disease related data into clusters and assigns classes to dusters. Subsequently multiple different classification algorithms are trained on the result set to build the final classifier model based on K-fold cross validation method. This methodology is evaluated using 768 raw diabetes data obtained from a city hospital. The best accuracy for the given dataset is achieved in bagging algorithm compared to other classifiers. The proposed approach helps doctors in their diagnosis decisions and also in their treatment planning procedures for different categories.

Privacy has become a major concern in data mining. The data which are stored in the organization's database may have some confidential information and hence it has to be protected from any unauthorized usage. In order to overcome the privacy problem in this paper we propose a new technique called shearing based composite transformation. Data owner transforms the original data into distorted data by shearing based composite data transformation. Only this distorted data is given to the clients. For clustering we have used k-means algorithm and from our experiments we found that the total number of elements in the clusters is same with the original and distorted data.

The main purpose of this paper is to study the customer's behavior using the Web mining techniques and its application in e-commerce to mine customer behavior. The concept of Web mining describing the process of Web data mining in detail: source data collection, data preprocessing, pattern discovery, pattern analysis and cluster analysis. With the advanced information technologies, server are now able to collect and store mountains of data, describing their numerous contributions and different customer profiles, from which they seek to derive information about their customer's requirements. Conventional methods are no longer appropriate for these business situations to find the customer behavior. The principle of data mining is to cluster customer segments by using K-Means algorithm in which input data comes from web log of various e-commerce websites. Hence, determine the relationship between Web data mining and e-commerce and also to apply Web mining technology in e-commerce.

To achieve further process improvement and process rationalization comprehensive data analysis of both process data and phenotypic cell-level data is essential. Here, we present a framework for advanced bioprocess data analysis consisting of multivariate data analysis (MVDA), metabolic flux analysis (MFA), and pathway analysis for mapping of large-scale gene expression data sets. This data analysis platform was applied in a process development project with an IgG-producing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line in which the maximal product titer could be increased from about 5 to 8 g/L. Principal component analysis (PCA), k-means clustering, and partial least-squares (PLS) models were applied to analyze the macroscopic bioprocess data. MFA and gene expression analysis revealed intracellular information on the characteristics of high-performance cell cultivations. By MVDA, for example, correlations between several essential amino acids and the product concentration were observed. Also, a grouping into rather cell specific productivity-driven and process control-driven processes could be unraveled. By MFA, phenotypic characteristics in glycolysis, glutaminolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, citrate cycle, coupling of amino acid metabolism to citrate cycle, and in the energy yield could be identified. By gene expression analysis 247 deregulated metabolic genes were identified which are involved, inter alia, in amino acid metabolism, transport, and protein synthesis.

This algorithm calculates cluster specific feature weights that can be interpreted as feature rescaling factors thanks to the use of the Minkowski distance. Here, we use an small amount of labelled data to select a Minkowski exponent and to generate clustering constrains based on pair-wise must-link and cannot-link rules. We validate our new algorithm with a total of 12 datasets, most of which containing features with uniformly distributed noise. We have run the algorithm numerous times in each dataset. These experiments ratify the general superiority of using feature weighting in K-Means, particularly when applying the Minkowski distance. We have also found that the use of constrained clustering rules has little effect on the average proportion of correctly clustered entities. However, constrained clustering does improve considerably the maximum of such proportion.

Traditional clustering techniques that find clusters in full dimensional space may fail to find clusters in high dimensional data due to various problems associated with clustering on high dimensional data. Subspace and projected clustering methods find clusters that exist in subspaces of dataset. These methods provide solutions to challenges associated with clustering on high dimensional data. Projected clustering methods output subspace clusters where one point in the dataset belongs to only one subspace cluster. Points may be assigned to multiple subspace clusters by subspace clustering methods. Projected clustering is preferable to subspace clustering when partition of points is required. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been proven to be effective for solving complex optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a Projected Clustering Particle Swarm Optimization (PCPSO) method to find subspace clusters that are present in the dataset. In PCPSO, Particle swarm optimization has been used to find optimal cluster centers by optimizing a subspace cluster validation index. In this paper, kmeans has been used to find neighbourhood of subspace cluster centers. The proposed method has been used to find subspace clusters that are present in some synthetic datasets.

Initialization for K-means clustering using Voronoi diagram	2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER, COMMUNICATION, CONTROL AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (C3IT-2012)	Procedia Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Computer, Communication, Control and Information Technology (C3IT)	FEB 25-26, 2012	INDIA			Clustering; K-means; improved K-means; Voronoi diagram; error rate		K-Means algorithm is one of the famous partitioning clustering techniques that has been studied extensively. However, the major problem with this method that it cannot ensure the global optimum results due to the random selection of initial cluster centers. In this paper, we present a novel method that selects the initial cluster centers with the help of Voronoi diagram constructed from the given set of data points. The initial cluster centers are effectively selected from those points which lie on the boundary of higher radius Voronoi circles. As a result, the proposed method automates the selection of the initial cluster centers to supply them for K-means. The proposed method is experimented on various artificial (hand-made) as well as real world data sets of various dimensions. It is observed that it is able to produce better clustering results than the traditional K-means and the improved K-means. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Nystrom can be used to obtain approximate similarity matrix, which clustering results are unstable since randomly selected the sampling points. And dictionary learning is used to search the example points to construct similarity matrix, which Dictionary learning sampling Nystrom spectral clustering algorithm (DNSC) is proposed in this paper. The DNSC constructs the dictionary by learning the entire data set, and select those points nearest atoms of the dictionary as sampling points. Further, removing redundancy points from candidate sampling points set that makes the size of sampling points be adaptive and sufficient. Compared with the Nystrom Spectral Clustering Algorithm and K-means Nystrom Spectral Clustering Algorithm, the presented algorithm has more stable and more accurate segmentation results.

Even though there are Bayesian inference algorithms than can handle continuous variables, performance tends to be better when these variables are discretized that when they are assumed to follow a specific distribution. On the other hand, the choice of the discretization method and the number of discretized intervals may lead to significantly different estimating results. However, discretization issues are seldom mentioned in software engineering effort estimation models. Aim: This paper seeks to show that discretization issues are important in terms of prediction accuracy while building a Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) for estimating software effort. Method: For this purpose, a NBC model has been developed for software effort estimation based on ISBSG projects applying different discretization schemes (equal width intervals, equal frequency intervals, and k-means clustering) and using different number of intervals. Results: Regarding the NBC model built, the estimation accuracy of equal frequency discretization is only improved by k-means clustering with respect to Pred(0.25), although it reflects better the original distribution. Conclusions: Further experimentation should determine the potential of clustering methods already highlighted in other fields.

In time series data, similarity metric are often used to measure the similar data. Many works use different algorithms to calculate similarity between two subsequences. Also, in location clustering, the well-known algorithm k-means and k-NN propose excellent results, and many works focus on how to increase efficient and accuracy of these algorithms. However, in some cases, we need to consider both similarities between locations and time series. Like greenhouse or wildfire detection, key points in these cases play an important status. This paper addresses how to cluster both location points and time series data together. We propose a new algorithm to consider location and time series together. We further show the algorithm we proposed can solve the problem of real cases well.

Here, a signature object is characterized by spatial features computed from recognition result of background blobs. The background blobs are computed by analyzing character holes and water reservoir zones in different directions. For the indexation purpose, a codebook of the background blobs is created using a set of training data. Zernike Moment feature is extracted from each blob and a K-Mean clustering algorithm is used to create the codebook of blobs. During retrieval, Generalized Hough Transform (GHT) is used to detect the query signature and a voting is casted to find possible location of the query signature in a document. The spatial features computed from background blobs found in the target document are used for GHT. The peak of votes in GHT accumulator validates the hypothesis of the query signature. The proposed method is tested on a collection of mixed documents (handwritten/ printed) of various scripts and we have obtained encouraging results from the experiments.

Level of abstraction allows us to create a network of information granules that are connected to each other through a real-world relationship. For example, the phone calls are connected to the origin and destination phone numbers. This paper describes the relationship between clustering schemes by propagating the information through the connection between granules. We focus on the hierarchical granular graphs, where phone numbers represent the higher level (coarser) granules that are connected to phone calls which are lower level (liner) granules. The paper studies the effect of transferring crisp and fuzzy clustering schemes through the granular hierarchy. The fuzzy clustering is shown to provide a better technique for such a transfer. Rough clustering derived from fuzzy clustering is shown to be a good instrument for comparing crisp and fuzzy clustering schemes.

This proposed method starts with K-means algorithm to do the segmentation of the object and background in the frame. The Pixel-based color features are used for identifying and tracking the object. The remaining background is also considered. These classified features of object and extended background are used to train the Radial Basis Function Neural Network. The trained network will track the object in next subsequent frames. This method is tested for the video sequences and is suitable for real-time tracking due to its low complexity. The objective of this experiment is to minimize the computational cost of the tracking method with required accuracy.

The proposed approach is based on multi-class k-nearest neighbor, K-means, and particle swarm optimization algorithms for feature weighting, in conjunction with normalized cuts based image segmentation technique. This hybrid approach refines the output of multi-class classification that is based on the usage of k-nearest neighbor classifier for automatically labeling image regions from different classes. Each input image is segmented using the normalized cuts segmentation algorithm in order to subsequently create a descriptor for each segment. Particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed as a search strategy to identify an optimal feature subset. Experimental results and comparative performance evaluation, for results obtained from the proposed particle swarm optimization based approach and another support vector machine based approach presented in previous work, demonstrate that the proposed particle swarm optimization based approach outperforms the support vector machine based one, regarding annotation accuracy, for the used dataset.

The two approaches are K-means and normalized cuts. An experiment was applied on ten liver CT scan images, with reference segmentations, in order to test the performance of the two approaches. Experimental results were compared using an evaluation measure that highlights segmentation accuracy. Based on the obtained results in this study, it has been observed that K-means clustering algorithm outperformed normalized cuts segmentation algorithm for cases where region of interest depicts a closed shape, while, normalized cuts algorithm obtained better results with non-circular clusters. Moreover, for K-means clustering, different initial partitions can result in different final clusters.

Particle swarm optimization is amongst swarm intelligence algorithms that performs based on population and random search. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm based on PSO, k-means and learning automata is proposed for image segmentation. In the proposed algorithm, learning automata is responsible for activating and deactivating PSO and k-means methods based on current conditions of the segmentation problem. The proposed approach along with other comparative studies has been applied for segmenting benchmark images. Efficiency of the proposed method has been compared with that of other methods and experimental results show the superiority proposed algorithm.

Proposed method has the capability to deal with continuous and categorical features (mixed features) of data set. Commonly means and modes of features represents clusters for continuous and categorical features respectively. For this reason, K-means and K-modes are most popular clustering algorithm for continuous and categorical features respectively. The searching power of Genetic Algorithm (CA) is exploited to search for suitable clusters and cluster centroids (means or modes) so that intra-cluster distance (Homogeneity, H) and inter-cluster distances (Separation, 8) are simultaneously optimized. It is achieved by measuring H and S using a special distance per feature metric, suitable for continuous and categorical features both. We have selected four benchmark data sets from UCI Machine Learning Repository containing continuous and categorical features both. Here, K-means and K-modes is hybridized with GA to combine global searching capabilities of CA with local searching capabilities of K-means and K-modes. Considering context sensitivity, we have used a special crossover operator called "pairwise crossover" and "substitution".

Conventional SCF approaches utilize preferences of all nearest neighbors to recommend the items. However, in practice preferences of credible peers / true friends with similar interests influence the decision making process. Thus need of trust aware approaches is being increasingly felt. Incorporating user's web of trust information though solves the sparsity and cold start problem prevailing in conventional social context filtering techniques but issue of scalability still remains. The work presents Shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) based SCF approach to develop trust aware system which is capable of handling all the issues addressed above. The approach performs social context modeling using SFLA based clustering. Subsequently, only the trusted neighbors participate in the process of computing most relevant items. Experimental evaluation over Movielens dataset establishes that SFLA based SCF model significantly outperlbrms conventional K-means approach. Evaluation over Epinions (rating and trust) dataset further substantiates the accuracy of SFLA based trust aware approach over mean absolute error metric.

Cluster validity indices are developed for this purpose. There are two different types of cluster validity indices available : External and Internal. External cluster validity indices utilize some supervised information and internal cluster validity indices utilize the intrinsic structure of the data. In this paper a new external cluster validity index, MMI has been implemented based on Max-Min distance among data points and prior information based on structure of the data. A new probabilistic approach has been implemented to find the correct correspondence between the true and obtained clustering. Genetic K-means algorithm (GAK-means) and single linkage have been used as the underlying clustering techniques. Results of the proposed index for identifying the appropriate number of clusters is shown for five artificial and two real-life data sets. GAK-means and single linkage clustering techniques are used as the underlying partitioning techniques with the number of clusters varied over a range. The MMI index is then used to determine the appropriate number of clusters. The performance of MMI is compared with existing external cluster validity indices, adjusted rand index (ARI) and rand index (RI). It works well for two class and multi class data sets.

Integrated Genetic - Fuzzy Approach for Items with Single Minimum Support Using 3-Dimensional k-means Clustering	2012 12TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HYBRID INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS (HIS)			English	Proceedings Paper	12th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS)	DEC 04-07, 2012	Pune, INDIA	MIR Labs, IEEE, IEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc Spain, IEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc CzechoSlovakia	MITCOE	3 dimensional k-means Clustering; data mining; fuzzy set; Genetic algorithm(GA); chromosomes; confidence; Fuzzy Association Rules; membership functions; Quantitative transactions	TRADE-OFF; NUMBER; RULES	Data mining is the process of extracting desirable knowledge or interesting patterns from existing databases for specific purposes. Most conventional data-mining algorithms identify the relationships among transactions using binary values. Transactions with quantitative values are however commonly seen in real-world applications. The fuzzy concepts are used to represent item importance, item quantities, minimum supports and minimum confidences. Each attribute uses only the linguistic term with the maximum cardinality in the mining process. The number of items is thus the same as that of the original attributes, making the processing time reduced. It uses a combination of large 1-itemsets and membership-function suitability to evaluate the fitness values of chromosomes. The calculation for large 1-itemsets could take a lot of time, especially when the database to be scanned could not totally fed into main memory. In this system, an enhanced approach, called the cluster-based fuzzy-genetic mining algorithm. It divides the chromosomes in a population into clusters by the 3-dimensional k-means clustering approach and evaluates each individual according to both cluster and their own information. A genetic-fuzzy data-mining algorithm for extracting lit membership functions and multilevel association rules with its confidence from quantitative transactions is shown.

When a few labeled patterns can be collected by experts, semi-supervised (learning) clustering can be opted for change detection instead of the unsupervised approach to make full utilization of both labeled and unlabeled patterns. In the present work, a study has been carried out by applying some of the semi-supervised clustering techniques for changed detection. A comparative analysis between K-Means, COP-KMeans, Seeded-KMeans and Constrained-KMeans algorithms is being performed based on the results obtained using two multi-temporal remotely sensed images. It can be concluded from the experiments that the Constrained-KMeans is well suited for changed detection of remotely sensed images under semi-supervised framework.

Clouds can be tracked from a given sequence of satellite images, and becomes useful for weather now-casting. There are several models available for cloud motion prediction. Adjusted Mean Based Prediction (AMBP) Model is one of them. A modified model of AMBP, based on temperature, for cloud movement tracking has been proposed and presented in this paper for better prediction.

Automatic Image Annotation Using SURF Descriptors	2012 ANNUAL IEEE INDIA CONFERENCE (INDICON)	Annual IEEE India Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)	DEC 07-09, 2012	Kochi, INDIA	IEEE		Automatic Image Annotation; SURF feature extraction; Image classification; K-means clustering; Fuzzy K-NN	FEATURES	In recent years there is an apparent shift in research from content based image retrieval (CBIR) to automatic image annotation in order to bridge the gap between low level features and high level semantics of images. Automatic Image Annotation (AIA) techniques facilitate extraction of high level semantic concepts from images by machine learning techniques. Many AIA techniques use feature analysis as the first step to identify the objects in the image. However, the high dimensional image features make the performance of the system worse. This paper describes and evaluates an automatic image annotation framework which uses SURF descriptors to select right number of features and right features for annotation. The proposed framework uses a hybrid approach in which k-means clustering is used in the training phase and fuzzy K-NN classification in the annotation phase. The performance of the system is evaluated using standard metrics.			mohdaneesv@gmail.com; san@cusat.ac.in; sreerajtkzy@gmail.com					Akbas E., 2006, THESIS MIDDLE E TU A; Bay H, 2008, COMPUT VIS IMAGE UND, V110, P346, DOI 10.1016/j.cviu.2007.09.014; Blei DM, 2003, P 26 ANN INT ACM SIG, P127, DOI DOI 10.1145/860435.860460; Duygulu P., 2002, ECCV 02 P 7 EUR C 4, P97112; Fei-Fei L., 2004, IEEE CVPR 2004 WORKS; Feng S.

CLUSTERING OF DURATION PATTERNS IN SPEECH FOR TEXT-TO-SPEECH SYNTHESIS	2012 ANNUAL IEEE INDIA CONFERENCE (INDICON)	Annual IEEE India Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual IEEE India Conference (INDICON)	DEC 07-09, 2012	Kochi, INDIA	IEEE		Speech synthesis; duration models; cluster analysis; k-means clustering; silhouette plot		Synthesis of natural sounding speech is the greatest challenge in a Text-to-Speech Synthesis (TTS) system. In natural speech, duration, intensity and pitch are dynamically varied which is manifested as rhythm or prosody of speech. If these variations are not recreated, the synthesized speech will sound robotic. Synthesis of good quality speech depends on how well the duration and intonation patterns are imposed on speech segments. The best way to improve naturalness in speech is to mimic the way human brain imposes rhythm. We speak in a particular style by varying the duration of the speech segments in words and phrases as per certain specific duration patterns. Brain might be retrieving the corresponding patterns at the time of speaking for generating a discourse in a particular style (news reading, bible reading, story telling etc.). The main objective of this work is to investigate the existence of duration patterns in natural speech using cluster analysis. Speech uttered in Malayalam, an Indian language was taken for analysis. Cluster analysis was done on isolated words, as well as on words and phrases in continuous speech. Results of cluster analysis when observed using silhouette plot showed the existence of duration patterns in speech.	[Sreelekshmi, K.

One key issue is scalability. Parallelism and distribution is an obvious approach to achieve scalability for agent-based crowd simulation. Parallel and distributed agent-based crowd simulation, however, introduces its own challenges, in particular, effectively distributing workload amongst multiple nodes with minimal overhead. In order to ensure effective distribution with low overhead, a proper partitioning mechanism is required. Generally, human crowds consist of groups or exhibit particular patterns of flow, which are then reflected in simulations. Exploiting this grouping with an appropriate partitioning mechanism should enable efficient distribution of crowd simulation. In this paper we introduce a grid-based clustering algorithm which we compare to previous clustering approaches that used the K-means algorithm.

The structured light is projected on an object by a projector. Two calibrated digital cameras are used to capture the images of projected area on the object separately. Artificial corner points generated by the structured light are detected. We defined a simple but effective feature parameter of the corner points. The corner points are clustered into several groups by adopting k-means cluster to analyze the feature parameter of corner points. We propose a stereo matching method using the cluster result and geometric constraint. A sequence of images is captured to enhance the measuring resolution. According to triangulation, the 3D point clouds are obtained from the pair of images. Experiment result demonstrated the feasibility of this 3D measuring system. The system with the advantages of high measuring precision and good robustness is highly attractive for applications in 3D measurement, 3D display and so on.

Now, the System has been the largest bike- sharing program in the world. The software of Hangzhou Public Bicycle System was developed by our team. There are many and many technology problems in the decision of intelligent dispatch. Among of these problems, determining how to find the key stations to give special care is very important. In this paper, an improved k-means algorithm is used to recognize the key stations of Hangzhou Public Bicycle System. At first, by passing over the two week's real data, a rent-return database is initialed. Then the algorithm builds minimum spanning tree and splits it to gets k initial cluster centers. The key stations are determined from the rent-return database by the algorithm. Practice examples and comparison with the traditional k-means algorithm are made. The results show that the proposed algorithm is efficient and robust. The research result has been applied in Hangzhou.

J	Guerrero, CD; Morillo, DS		Velasquez, CE		Guerrero, Cesar D.; Salcedo Morillo, Dixon			On the Reduction of the Available Bandwidth Estimation Error Through Clustering with K-means	2012 IEEE LATIN-AMERICAN CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Latin-American Conference on Communications (LATINCOM)	NOV 07-09, 2012	Cuenca, ECUADOR	IEEE, IEEE Commun Soc			TOOLS	There are different tools to estimate the end to end available bandwidth (AB). These tools use techniques which send pairs of packets to the network and observe changes in dispersion or propagation delays to infer the value of the AB. Given the fractal nature of Internet traffic, these observations are prompt to errors affecting the accuracy of the estimation. This article presents the application of a clustering technique to reduce the estimation error due to wrong observations of the available bandwidth in the network. The clustering technique used is K-means which is applied to a tool called Traceband that is originally based on a Hidden Markov Model to perform the estimation. It is shown that using K-means in Traceband can improve its accuracy in 67.45% when the cross traffic is about 70% of the end-to-end capacity.

In this paper, we present an implementation of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to conduct the automatic unsupervised clustering of reconstructed white matter fiber tracts in DTI. The statistical model is the multivariate and multi-mode Gaussian mixture which depicts the probability distribution of white matter fiber tracts. Issues related to the parameter estimation, initialization, and convergence for applying the EM algorithm in the context of the white matter fiber tract clustering are discussed in detail. Comparisons of the EM algorithm with the K-means approach are also performed. The difference between the fixed and variant prior probabilities on the clustering result as the EM algorithm proceeds is demonstrated by experiments. Real DTI datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is feasible and may be useful in the automatic unsupervised clustering of white matter fiber tracts.

Every day many digital images are coming into the web. User is attracted to automatic image retrieval from this large dataset. Many methods which are introduced in this last ten years for image retrieval based on the similarity, size of database, image classification, similar group of images finding, performance of retrieval. when the size of database is increasing image similarity finding It is big task for the researchers to give the efficient solutions. Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems are used in order to retrieve image from image dataset. In our proposed method, we are utilizing clustering method for retrieve the images. Each Image converted into gray form and calculated the threshold values for 10000 images for each image extracted cluster mean values using k-mean method and stored into the database. In first method query image mean values are comparing using mean distances between query image and database images. In second method group of images are selecting from the image database with similar features and finding the distance difference of the each image and considered the squires of the all distances and make a sum and divide with the number of cluster values then make in sequential order of the images. Main aim of this work is to extract images with good similarity when the images that are retrieved based on query image. Above mention methods are given good performance.	[Chary, R.

Many previous authors often embed data into the index table of the color palette or into the color palette directly. Those data hiding methods will change the color palette into a difference one. It is impossible to reconstruct the original color palette. We follow previous method to apply the K-means clustering to split the color image palette into several groups first. If a palette group has k numbers indices, the data can be embedded log(2)k bits into the pixel that its palette index falls in this group. The current embedding pixel will be replaced by the same group of pixel in the order of embedding data value which are corresponding each palette index. Next step, we collect those k -2 (log2k) in each groups to use the Euclidean distance to cluster two groups with similar group that have similar index pairs. We embed one bit in each pixel that belongs these two groups. The extraction method firstly groups of the color palette index of stego-image by k-means clustering and similar pairs like embedding steps. If the palette index of the pixel belong to groups that produced by K-means clustering, then finds what order in its group. That order is the embedded value. If the palette index of the pixel belong to groups that yielded by similar pairs, then it belongs to first group is embedded 0, else is 1. The information can be extracted completely until all embedded pixels are retrieved or retrieved to the last bit of host image. From the experimental results, the method has the more embedding capacity then it only uses k-means clustering in the same image.

In this study, basic particle swarm optimization (PSO) was proposed to make classification as both of the training and testing procedures. 38 and 34 leukemia samples that each contained 50 same genes were chosen separately as training and testing dataset. K-means clustering algorithm was used to establish a comparison procedure. Another group of 200 genes were also used for further comparison of the two algorithms. In conclusion, the performance of PSO is better than K-means, while the stability is in reverse.

Noise and Irregularity in light intensities are the major bottleneck in the segmentation process which generally present in real images. Most of the segmentation processes are region based process and depends on regularity of intensities in that region, which lead to the faulty segmentation of images that are affected by noise and intensity inhomogenity. This paper presents a novel approach for segmentation of the images with irregular intensities and noise. Non-local denoising models provide excellent results because these models can denoise smooth regions or/and textured regions simultaneously, unlike standard denoising models. We presented a integrated model which correct the image as well as segment the image. A non-local denoising algorithm presented which denoise the image in the preprocessing step. Following that Local clustering criteria function is presented using K-means clustering algorithm for the images with irregular intensities. This local clustering criteria function when formulated in the level set, it gives better segmentation model. Continuous global minimization of energy function will give segmentation result and bias field which is a cause of irregular intensities in image. Bias corrected image can be obtained by removing obtained bias field form corrupted image. Therefore our method segments the image and at the same time corrects the effect of irregular intensities and noise. A MATLAB code has been implemented based on this method and it gives good results in all cases including the presence of irregular intensities in image and other non-local noise. Our method also has better performance characteristics like robustness and accuracy compared to previous segmentation techniques.

Open-field test is a popular experiment to study rat behavior. Elevated plus maze and holeboard model are usually used for open-field test. Their behavioral parameters such as moving distance, duration and actions in regions of interest are usually considered. These parameters are observed and recorded by human, certainly, it involves some human error. Commercial recording and analyzing programs are available but they are expensive. In this paper, we proposed a simple method for measuring parameters of rat's behaviors in the elevated plus maze and holeboard model test by using webcam and simple computer program. The camera is installed over the models. Parameters measured are distance and duration of rat's movement in the interested area. The proposed method consists of two main processes. Firstly, background modeling; K-mean clustering technique is adapted to reconstruct the background. Secondly, rat is extracted by means of background subtraction. Position and duration are measured in the selected area. To test performance of the proposed method, precision of the proposed method on elevated plus maze and holeboard models is considered. It is about 0.98 and 0.69 centimeters of error for elevated plus maze and holeboard models, respectively. The results show the feasibility of the proposed method. Advantage of the proposed method over other is that our method is simple self-setup for experimenter.

The conventional process using trypan blue dye staining requires expertise and it is time-consumed and tedious work. The aim of this study was to develop a computer-assisted program that counts a number of cells by using image analysis. There were five steps to complete in this study; i) input image acquiring, ii) cell extraction from a background, iii) noise reduction, iv) cell counting and v) output with expert comparison. K-mean algorithm was selected to use to extract features and cluster objects in the images. Hough transform was also performed after completion of k-mean algorithm and noise removal. The counting results using our code had a greater number of both death cells and living cells compared with the counting results from the expert. The accuracy of death cells counting and living cells counting were in range of 33% to 97% and 74% to 100%, respectively. However, the process time was short, only 2-3 second per image. This computer-assisted program needs to further develop as a graphic user interface (GUI) to make it easier for users as well as making higher accuracy.

The algorithm outperforms conventional similarity measures for comparing two color images. In this paper, we propose a new content-based medical image retrieval system based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) symlet and the weighted MWW runs test. The DWT is used to extracted texture features of the medical images. The weighted MWW runs test is used to compare distributions of texture features of two medical images. Our experiments were performed on 1,000 medical images from image retrieval in medical applications (IRMA). The experimental results show promisingly efficient to retrieve the medical images.

These indicators have a negative influence in these institutions, creating problems such as low uptake of funds, difficulties for the accreditation of its educational programs, among many others. In this research, we analyze the data collected from academics paths studies and supported by software in order to find viable information to identify the factors that affect the academic success of students in higher education and that offers an efficient strategy for the efficient selection of candidates to study in the college to avoid in this way desertion and increasing terminal efficiency rate. In this sense, we apply the techniques of data mining, cluster analysis, using the clustering algorithm known as k-means, which is to group items into homogeneous groups based on similarities or similarities between them. We used WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) for the implementation of k-means algorithm, in order to analyze the statistics of academic paths that were extracted from a graduated group of higher education. Starting with a sample extracted from graduated students in computer science from the Computer Science Faculty of Mazatlan (Autonomous University of Sinaloa), with the help of their overall performance and analyzing qualitative and quantitative factors such as their age, gender, high school average, parents' education, family income, marital status, former high school, among others; and discarding those that, according to mathematical analysis, do not affect student performance. The results show that this technique of unsupervised clustering and hierarchical able to identify the relevant variables associated with academic success and successfully classify the two groups (successful students and students with low academic performance). We hope this study will serve as a tool for selecting students to study computer science, as well as a tool for diagnosis and prediction of academic performance.

Applying Data Mining in Educational sector has become an emerging research field used to determine information and find out patterns from E-learning systems. The educational system in various universities are presently facing lots of issues like identifying students' needs, personalization of training and announcing the excellence of scholar communications. Educational Data Mining provides a set of ways, which can help the learning system to overcome these issues. The idea of this work is to explain Educational Data Mining examination, by telling a step-by-step development using a range of techniques such as Clustering (K-Means), Organization (Tree Induction), Association Mining (Apriori, FPGrowth, Create Association Rule, GSP) in order to get the goal to find out obliging information from the Moodle LMS. Analyzing mining results enables learning institutions to superior assign resources and systematize the education process in order to look up the learning experience of students as well as enhance their profits. In this study Data for the primary set of experiments was derived from the Moodle logs. These data were analyzed from different levels and perspectives, in order to provide more approaching on the whole educational system. From the point of an entity course user action is measured, accomplishing coursework, quizzes development coursework, membership in forum and chat. By applying clustering methods, the goal was to split data set in groups of data points that logically group together. By means of prediction techniques, the objective was to build up a representation that can deduce predicted variables from predictors' variables. By applying Society Mining techniques, the objective was to find out interaction between variables. The mining outcome can be used by the class teacher to examine the impact of a number of e-learning behaviors on the students' knowledge growth. This paper concentrated on the overall LMS performance at our college and the mining development of Moodle data. Mining the Moodle data permitted to identify the most successful ways to the teaching development that can be used to improve the education development. The investigational outcome have exposed that the data mining representation presented in this paper was capable to attain understandable and reasonable response from the LMS data telling students' knowledge performance patterns. To test the efficiency of the planned representation and to increase the simplification of this research, more broad experiments should be conducted by using larger LMS data sets.

MINING STUDENT'S ADMISSION DATA AND PREDICTING STUDENT'S PERFORMANCE USING DECISION TREES	5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (ICERI 2012)			English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)	NOV 19-21, 2012	Madrid, SPAIN			K-means clustering; decision trees; predicting performance		The purpose of data mining is to find out new and possibly useful information from huge amounts of data. Data mining techniques are useful in many application areas like fraud detection, businesses, banking and telecommunications. Educational Data Mining is the application of Data Mining Techniques to educational data. Quality Assurance in education has compelled academia to constantly explore ways to improve overall educational processes. This has led to increasing interest in educational data mining. This paper is a first attempt to retrieve pedagogical information from the data of a public sector engineering university in Pakistan. The data mining techniques are used on the educational data of the undergraduate students in order to predict the performance of students. The study is planned around three research question: Can the students' college marks be used to predict their performance at the undergraduate education? Is the discipline in which they are enrolled significant in predicting their performance? Is any one particular year out of their four years undergraduate studies more decisive than the rest in predicting their performance? To answer these questions, data mining algorithms were applied to identify patterns in the available historical data. The students' marks at college level were examined and mined using the k-means clustering algorithm. The findings revealed a strong correlation in the students' college marks and their marks in individual subjects particularly in Maths, Physics and Chemistry at college level, however, no significant correlation was found between the students' college marks and their overall performance in the undergraduate programme. So the first question is answered negatively which is in agreement with results of different studies conducted in other countries. This analysis suggests that students' performance at university level might be based on the learning and teaching methods of university. The result of clustering pointed out that discipline should be taken into account to predict performance. The application of different decision trees, as classification algorithms, to the examination marks of students from different years of their current degree programme in order to predict their academic achievement in their final year examination indicates that performance in first and second year has a considerably decisive impact in predicting students' final year performance. The study carries important implication for the academic institutions by helping them in providing assistance to students to improve their academic skills at the appropriate level and time.

Web services are becoming more complex and dynamic. This offers new possibilities for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities by inputting malicious queries or code. However., these attack attempts are often recorded in server logs. Analyzing these logs could be a way to detect intrusions either periodically or in real time. We propose a framework that preprocesses and analyzes these log Ides. HTTP queries are transformed to numerical matrices using n-gram analysis. The dimensionality of these matrices is reduced using principal component analysis and diffusion map methodology. Abnormal log lines can then be analyzed in more detail. We expand our previous work by elaborating the cluster analysis after obtaining the low-dimensional representation. The framework was tested with actual server log data collected from a large web service. Several previously unknown intrusions were found. Proposed methods could be customized to analyze any kind of log data. The system could be used as a real-time anomaly detection system in any network where sufficient data is available.

A cluster analysis of product demand data of stores is used to identify typical dynamic demand patterns and product delivery tactical plans. Further, simulation optimisation techniques are applied to find optimal parameters of product transportation and vehicle delivery schedules. In the paper, a cluster analysis of the demand data by using the K-means clustering algorithm and silhouette plots mean values is performed, and an NBTree-based classification model is built. In order to define optimal parameters of vehicle schedules, a genetic algorithm is applied and interacts with a discrete-event simulation transportation model built in AnyLogic simulation environment. Integrated solutions are illustrated and adjusted to a specific business case.

This algorithm is popular and more widely used for its easy implementation and fast working. However, it is well known that in the k-means algorithm, the user should specify the number of clusters in advance. In order to improve the performance of the K-means algorithm, various methods have been proposed. In this paper, has been presented an improved parameter less data clustering technique based on maximum distance of data and Lioyd k-means algorithm. The experimental results show that the use of new approach to defining the centroids, the number of iterations has been reduced where the improvement was 60%.	[Mohd, Wan Maseri Binti Wan; Beg, A.

This paper mainly studies a method of spectrum transformation based on clustering algorithm. First of all, the training data are classified into several clusters and each cluster is trained relatively to get a more accurate transformation rule. And in the stage of transformation, the source parameters of each frame are classified into one cluster, and then are converted by the transformation rule of that cluster. In this paper, K-means algorithm is used as the clustering method to classified data. Experiment results show that proposed method based on clustering is better than the transformation by conventional GMM, especially the one by K-Means algorithm with 20 centers is the best one.

As a typical cloud service, each file stored in the cloud is described with several keywords. By querying the cloud with certain keywords, a user can retrieve files whose keywords match his query. An organization that has thousands of users querying the cloud can set multiple proxy servers inside itself to reduce the querying cost. All users can be classified into different groups, and the users in a group will send their queries to the same proxy server, which will query the cloud with a combined query, i.e., the union of keywords in a group of queries. In such an environment, an important problem is cost efficiency, i.e., how to classify users into different groups so that the total number of returned files is minimized. Observing that this is mainly affected by the number of keywords in the combined queries, our problem is translated to classifying n users into k groups in the case of k proxy servers, so that the number of keywords in k combined queries is minimized. Since more common keywords in a group of queries will generate less keywords in the combined queries, we should group users with the most common keywords together. Two additional aspects needed to be addressed are load balancing and robustness, i.e., the workloads among proxy servers are balanced and each user obtains search results even if some proxy servers fail. To solve above problems simultaneously, we propose mathematic grouping and heuristic grouping strategies, where mathematic grouping solves the relaxed problem by using a local optimization method, and heuristic grouping is based on the classical heuristic clustering algorithm, K-means. Extensive evaluations have been conducted on the analytical model to verify the effectiveness of our strategies.

Tweet is distinguished from conventional text data in that it is typically composed of short and informal message, and it makes typical text analysis methods do not work well. Accordingly, extracting meaningful topics from tweets brings up new challenges. In this work, we propose a simple and novel method called Core-Topic-based Clustering (CTC), which extracts topics and cluster tweets simultaneously based on the clustering principles: minimizing the inter-cluster similarity and maximizing the intra-cluster similarity. Experimental results show that our method efficiently extracts meaningful topics, and the clustering performance is better than K-means algorithm.

Principal component analysis based on colony means and k-means clustering proposed a separation of Saudi Honeybees into three clusters. These were confirmed by discriminant analysis, which reclassified colonies with 100% accuracy into clusters two and three and 96% accuracy into cluster one. Results indicate significant morphometric variation and a cline of factor one (characters associated with body size) from the north (cluster one) to the south (cluster three), with the highest dissimilarities between bees from the far north and the far south. The substantial variation detected in this study supported the previous description of Saudi Arabian Honeybees made by RUTTNER in 1976, which, based on few samples, was not representative of this large and diverse country.

By incorporating the advantages of mean shift (MS) segmentation and spectral clustering (SC) method, the proposed approach provides effective and robust segmentation. Firstly, input image is transformed from a pixel-based to a region-based model by using the MS algorithm. The input image after MS segmentation is composed of multiple disjoint regions that preserve the desirable discontinuity characteristics of the image. Then the regions are treated as nodes in the image plane and a graph structure is applied to represent them. The final step is to apply the improved SC to perform globally optimal clustering. To avoid some incorrect partitioning when considering each region as one graph node, we assign different numbers of nodes to represent the regions according to area ratios among the regions. In addition, K-harmonic means (KHM) instead of K-means is applied in the improved SC procedure in order to enhance its stability and performance. The superiority of the proposed approach is demonstrated and examined through a mass of experiments using color images.

Generally, the whole classifier consists of two stages: training and testing. In the first stage, all training images from the whole breasts were filtered by one of the maximum response filter banks (38 filters together but choose only the maximum 8 filter responses from each direction). Then mass regions were segmented automatically from those filtered images and aggregated together as the input of K-means clustering. This resulted in the generation of the final texton dictionary. Then, each region of interest (ROI) was modeled into the texton distributions. Similarly, in the second stage, all the novel testing images are represented by texton histograms of their own ROIs. In the end, Fisher Classifier was used for the classification and Receive Operation Characteristic (ROC) Curve was applied to show the performance (in the form of Az scores). Additionally, intensity independent texture analysis proposed in our previous research was used to normalize original images before the filter bank application. Performance turned out to be promising for the future research.

However, the scanned models without post-processing could not be used directly due to environment noise and accuracy limitation in terms of discrete sampling property in scanning. This paper introduces a systemic point-cloud de-noising and mesh smoothing method to handle this issue. The model de-noising and regularity is based on k-means clustering, and mesh smoothing module is an improved mean approach which processes the discrete data in the regular order. Case study will be given to verify the smoothing effectiveness. The proposed method could facilitate the construction of model database for design reuse, and could be output to downstream applications such as shape adaptive deformation, and shape searching.

Anomaly based intrusion detection technique is one of the building blocks of such a foundation. In this paper, the attempt has been made to apply hybrid learning approach by combining k-Medoids based clustering technique followed by Naive Bayes classification technique. Because of the fact that k-Medoids clustering techniques represent the real world scenario of data distribution, the proposed enhanced approach will group the whole data into corresponding clusters more accurately than k-Means such that it results in a better classification. An experiment is carried out in order to evaluate performance, accuracy, detection rate and false positive rate of the classification scheme. Results and analyses show that the proposed approach has enhanced the detection rate with minimum false positive rates.

Super-node based P2P network is an example. The physical scope and the number of clusters are two conflicting objectives and clustering algorithm should strike a balance between them. In this paper, nodes clustering problem is formally described and pre-optimized k-means algorithm is put forward.

However, it behaves badly without enough history records for new users, called the cold starting problem. Both time and space complexity are huge for computing all pairwise similarities among items or users. A mixed neighborhood algorithm is proposed for treating new users and old users separately. For new users, this paper takes into account users' characteristics. For old users, combined with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), we reduce the time and space complexity efficiently. Experiment on MovieLens dataset shows that the proposed model can solve the cold starting problem in effect and remarkably improve the accuracy of traditional model and lower time consuming level.

As a result, today researchers are challenged to develop new techniques to deal with massive high dimensional data that has not only in term of number of data but also in the number of attributes. In order to improve effectiveness and accuracy of mining task on high dimensional data, an efficient dimensionality reduction method should be executed in data preprocessing stage before clustering technique is applied. Many clustering algorithms has been proposed and used to discover useful information from a dataset. Iterative Local Gaussian Clustering (ILGC) is a simple density based clustering technique that has successfully discovered number of clusters represented in the dataset. In this paper we proposed to use the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method to preprocess the data prior to ILGC clustering in order to simplify the analysis and visualization of multi dimensional data set. The proposed approach is validated with benchmark classification datasets. In addition, the performance of proposed hybrid PCA-ILGC clustering approach is compared to original ILGC, basic k-means and hybridized k-means. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is capable to obtain clusters with higher accuracy, and time taken to process the data was decreased.

These technologies are very useful for users who do not need the exact solution but who care very much about the response time. For every existing heuristic algorithm has its pros and cons, a hyper-heuristic clustering algorithm based on the diversity detection and improvement detection operators to determine when to switch from one heuristic algorithm to another is presented to improve the clustering result in this paper. Several well-known datasets are employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can provide a better clustering result than the state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms compared in this paper, namely, k-means, simulated annealing, tabu search, and genetic k-means algorithm.

When there are sufficient data samples and good representations, traditional clustering algorithms such as K-means can work well. But when the number of samples is small and the data representation is bad, direct use of clustering may yield bad results. In this paper we propose a new algorithm TCTC(Topic-Constraint Transfer Clustering), which is an instance of unsupervised transfer learning, to cluster a small number of unlabeled data with the help of sufficient and better represented auxiliary data. First several latent topics are extracted from the clusters of the auxiliary data. Then the affinities between target data samples and topics are discovered to "guide" the disseminated data clustering. Finally semi-supervised clustering algorithm is applied on target data. The experiments demonstrate our method is quite effective to solve the problem of disseminated and ill-presented data clustering.

Screening tests, such as the Pap smear test used for the detection of the precancerous stage are able to avoid the occurrence of cervical cancer. However, the Pap smear test does have some disappointing disadvantages such as the fact that it has less effective slide preparation and also that it is laden with human error. Therefore, a computer-aided diagnosis system is introduced as a solution to the problem. Recently, artificial neural networks have been widely implemented as a cervical cancer diagnosis system i.e. to classify cervical cancer into normal and abnormal cells. In this recent study, neural network architecture i.e. the Hybrid Radial Basis Function (HRBF) network with Adaptive Fuzzy K-Means Clustering (AFKM) asa centre positioning algorithm is used to diagnose cervical cancer. Four extracted features of cervical cell are used as input data to the networks, which are the size of nucleus and cytoplasm and its grey level. Cells from normal, Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (LSIL) and High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (HSIL) categories are used as the training as well as the testing data. The data are fed randomly into the neural networks via 5-folds cross validation techniques. The network performance is compared with the HRBF network with the Moving K-Means algorithm as the centre positioning algorithm. The proposed network produces better accuracy, sensitivity and specificity which illustrates the promising capability of the network to be implemented as cervical cancer diagnosis system for Pap test performance improvement.

In this paper, operation economic has been considerate. The operation condition has been classified using thermal power unit history data; then the improved K-means method has been used to get k clusters of the data for the specific operation condition and fuzzy association rule was used to get the target of the data respectively from each cluster.

Two types of classifier are designed. The first one is called as preliminary classifier, which is constructed by using k-means clustering algorithm based on the test data in order to save the useful information of the customers of majority class as much as possible. The second one is called as minority classifier, which is constructed by using random forest method and used to reclassify the customers that were predicted to belong to minority of class in preliminary classification to improve the classification performance of the minority class. The proposed approach is compared with the approaches that use only k-nearest neighbor. or random forest method. Through the comparison the advantages of the proposed approach over other methods will be-showed.

For large scale datasets, clustering algorithm can shorten the training time while keeping the distribution of original data and guaranteeing the classification precision. Both k-means and density clustering algorithm need seek the optimal parameters, while wavecluster algorithm can handle large datasets with arbitrary shape clusters and also is not sensitive to the input order of samples, this paper proposed SVM-WC model which combined the SVM and wavecluster algorithm. SVM-WC model can speed SVM training by eliminating non support vectors, but imbalanced datasets will affect the classification accuracy. To solve this problem, this paper assigned different error costs to different classes in the SVM-WC model. The experimental results indicated that the proposed SVM-WC-DEC model performed best for large imbalanced datasets.

In this paper, we propose a method to generate tag-based profiles for clustering users in a social music site. To evaluate our approach, a data set of 1000 users was collected from last.fm, and our approach was compared with conventional track-based profiles. The K-Means clustering algorithm is executed on both user profiles for clustering users with similar musical taste. The test of statistical hypotheses of inter-cluster distances is used to check clustering validity. Our experiment clearly shows that tag-based profiles are more efficient than track-based profiles in clustering users with similar musical tastes.

Spectral matting is the state-of-the-art image matting and it is also a milestone in theoretic matting research. However, the accuracy of alpha matte using spectral matting is usually low without user intervention. In the proposed method, k-means algorithm is used to generate components of a given image. Next, component classification is used based on the hue difference of components to obtain the foreground, background, and unknown components. The corresponding matting components of the foreground, background, and unknown components are obtained via a linear transformation of the smallest eigenvectors of the matting Laplacian matrix. Finally, only matting components of the foreground and unknown components are combined to form the complete alpha matte based on minimizing the matte cost. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods based on spectral matting.

After that, the histogram of these visual words are computed and considered as a feature vector. Finally, we use SVM to train each classifier for each category. The classification result of the video is the production of the scores output from all of the key frames.

This paper focuses on an approach to assessing project success using AI approaches including K-means Clustering, Genetic Algorithm (GA), Fuzzy Logic (FL), and Neural Network (NN). As various factors at different construction stages affect project performance, project success criteria change dynamically and are hard to estimate accurately through reliance on experience alone. Information that is uncertain, vague, and incomplete is an inherent feature of this problem. CAPP (Continuous Assessment of Project Performance) software was used to study in a dynamic manner the significant factors that influence upon project performance. K-means clustering was employed to conduct an unsupervised clustering to extract similar cases for comparison. FL for was used to examine uncertainties, NN was employed for data mining, and GA was used for optimization. A developed Evolutionary Fuzzy Neural Inference Model (EFNIM) was used to achieve optimal mapping of input factors and project success output. Results show that EFNIM is able to estimate the degree of project success well and case clustering can greatly enhance project success assessments.

The data placement is proved to be a NP hard problem, and several methods for this problem like K-means clustering algorithm are presented in the literatures. K-means clustering algorithm can reduce the number of data movements very well, but it may result that the datasets will be concentrated to few data centers, and so the loads of data centers greatly deviate from each other. The paper proposes a data placement strategy based on heuristic genetic algorithm to reduce data movements among the data centers while balancing the loads of data centers. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce data movements and balance the load of data centers.

The objects modeled in these maps include tables, walls and ceilings. Our segmentation approach is based on 3D point cloud data representations. In order to solve the segmentation problem in complicated environment, a variable model is used in this paper. It is applied in 3D planar segmentation from point clouds. The segmentation algorithm was developed based on fuzzy K-means, which can automatically find the optimal number of clusters and self-organize the clusters based on Inter cluster Distance Index and Sample Distribution Index. After the 3D point clouds of each planar are clustered, we get the 3D planar candidates by extracting semantic information from the clusters based on functional reasoning module. The model has been evaluated on the real test scenes, which contain noisy point clouds. Empirical results show that our model can rationally interpret planar objects from the point clouds and shows the high performance and robust results.	[Liu, Xin; Cheng, S. Y.; Zhang, X. W.; Yang, X.

In this paper, we propose a new paradigm to recognize an aggressive human behavior such as boxing action. This method has been carried out on two levels; the low-level analysis consists to characterize each frame by using a new geometric descriptor. The latter is associated with a bag-of-features approach in order to extract the local movement of actions. Each frame of atomic action is associated with an appropriate label. This is done by using an offline clustering algorithm such as k-means. The high-level analysis consists to generate the feature vectors from a sequence video by using a set of labels as an optimum codebook. The boxing actions are then recognized by applying a support vector machine classifier. The tests are conducted on our own database and KTH dataset actions. The obtained results show that the proposed method enables robust recognition of aggressive human behavior in very challenging situations such as dynamic environment and deals well with self-occlusion problem.

After image preprocessing including image compression, image cropping and image denoising, K_means clustering algorithm was used to segment the disease images, and then 21 color features, 4 shape features and 25 texture features were extracted from the images. Backpropagation (BP) networks were used as the classifiers to identify grape diseases and wheat diseases, respectively. The results showed that identification of the diseases could be effectively achieved using BP networks. While the dimensions of the feature data were not reduced by using principal component analysis (PCA), the optimal recognition results for grape diseases were obtained as the fitting accuracy and the prediction accuracy were both 100%, and that for wheat diseases were obtained as the fitting accuracy and the prediction accuracy were both 100%. While the dimensions of the feature data were reduced by using PCA, the optimal recognition result for grape diseases was obtained as the fitting accuracy was 100% and the prediction accuracy was 97.14%, and that for wheat diseases was obtained as the fitting accuracy and the prediction accuracy were both 100%.

Actually, the performance of a service may fluctuate due to the dynamic environments, which may violate the end-to-end QoS constraints or degrade the QoS of a composite service. History records (or QoS records) can exhibit QoS fluctuations over the past period and reflect the actual performance of a service. Thus, a novel Two-Phase Approach for Service Composition (TPASC) based on QoS records is presented to address the problem. The proposed approach has the two phases: one is preliminary filtering, where a heuristic QoS decomposition algorithm is proposed to decompose the end-to-end QoS constraints into local constraints, and then some promising services are selected in terms of the probability that they can meet the local constraints; the other is MIP (Mixed Integer Programming)-based service selection, where QoS records associated with each promising service are reduced by K-means clustering method, and then a MIP model is proposed to rank and select services in terms of the reduced QoS records. The experimental results show TPASC can conduct service composition with high efficiency and significant cost savings in dynamic environments.

Trajectories of moving objects often contain repeated patterns of motion, and learning those patterns can yield interception paths that succeed more often. We therefore propose an original trajectory clustering algorithm for extracting motion patterns from trajectory data and demonstrate its effectiveness over the more common clustering approach of using k-means. We use the results to build a Hidden Markov Model of a target's motion and predict movement. Our simulations show that these predictions lead to more effective interception. The results of this work have potential applications in coordination of multi-robot systems, tracking and surveillance tasks, and dynamic obstacle avoidance.

Our framework extracts features of the grasp posture in order to estimate the contact region. Redundant dimension of the hand posture is removed depending on task, which we regard typical for the object. For this purpose, we used mixture principal component analysis (MPCA). This method enables to estimate clusters that can approximate grasp postures by using lower dimensional features. Estimation results of the contact region was obtained by using clustered lower dimensional features of MPCA and object features. These results show that our clusters by MPCA have stronger correlation with the contact region than clustered lower dimensional features obtained by PCA and k-means. Finally, estimation results of the grasp posture and the contact region for three objects are demonstrated. One of the result was compared with grasp posture synthesized by another method presented in the previous research. This comparison revealed that our framework was able to synthesize human-like natural grasp posture than the previous one.			yayukaar@nii.ac.jp; y.endo@aist.go.jp; n.miyata@aist.go.jp; m.tada@aist.go.jp	Miyata, Natsuki/A-6848-2013	Miyata, Natsuki/0000-0001-8987-6831			Amor H.

The proposed method provides a robust and principled framework for fusing the complementary information obtained from these two different sensing modalities. High-dimensional features are extracted from a training set of textured point clouds (scans) and hierarchical k-means clustering is used to quantize these features into a set of codewords. Using this codebook, any new scan can be represented as a collection of codewords. Under the correct rigid-body transformation aligning two overlapping scans, the MI between the codewords present in the scans is maximized. We apply a James-Stein-type shrinkage estimator to estimate the true MI from the marginal and joint histograms of the codewords extracted from the scans. Experimental results using scans obtained by a vehicle equipped with a 3D laser scanner and an omnidirectional camera are used to validate the robustness of the proposed algorithm over a wide range of initial conditions. We also show that the proposed method works well with 3D data alone.

In order to improve the convergence basin for NDT, a multi-scale k-means NDT (MSKM-NDT) variant is proposed. This approach divides the point cloud using k-means clustering and performs the optimization step at multiple scales of cluster sizes. The k-means clustering approach guarantees that the optimization will converge, as it resolves the issue of discontinuities in the cost function found in the standard NDT algorithm. The optimization step of the NDT algorithm is performed over a decreasing scale, which greatly improves the basin of convergence. Experiments show that this approach can be used to register partially overlapping scans with large initial transformation error.

Motivated by the success of manifold learning for visual recognition, we present a novel clustering-based discriminative locality alignment (CDLA) algorithm to discover the low-dimensional intrinsic submanifold from the embedding high-dimensional ambient space for improving the face gender recognition performance. In particular, CDLA exploits the global geometry through k-means clustering, extracts the discriminative information through margin maximization and explores the local geometry through intra cluster sample concentration. These three properties uniquely characterize CDLA for face gender recognition. The experimental results obtained from the FERET data sets suggest the superiority of the proposed method in terms of recognition speed and accuracy by comparing with several representative methods.

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm based on decision tree classification and K-means clustering which are well known techniques in data mining. Several performance measures are used to compare the K-means localization algorithm with those using linear least squares (LLS) and weighted linear least squares based on singular value decomposition (WLS-SVD). It is shown that the proposed algorithm performs better than the LLS and WLS-SVD algorithms even when the geometric anchor distribution about an unlocalized node is poor.

The procedure is described as follows. Firstly the Daubechies wavelet and pyramid-structure is selected, then the approach decomposes the low frequency part of the fabric image. Secondly starting from the highest scaling level and considering all the four sub-bands, the image is automatic clustered and segmented by K-means clustering. During the process we should calculate the average mean and standard deviation of the three high-frequency coefficients at the current level and transform the higher scaling level label values to have the same mean and standard deviation. Lastly the texture's contour of image is traced and extracted by Canny operator. The results show that this approach is a feasible way for jacquard fabric.

Hydrophobicity is the property which is considered around each surface atom. The actual hydrophobicity distribution on the atoms that form an atom's vicinity is replaced by an equivalent hydrophobicity density distribution, computed in a standardized octagonal pattern around the atom. All atoms hydrophobicity densities are clustered using K-means algorithm. A three layers neural network is trained for classification of the atoms vicinities having as many nodes in the output layers as clusters are.

This paper firstly uses a linear function and a nonlinear function respectively to detect the linear correlations and the nonlinear correlations of the time series. And a small data set which includes effective information of the system is defined. Then, a local search procedure is introduced to optimize K-means clustering algorithm, which is aimed at quickly and effectively adjusting hidden layer's clustering centers. Finally, input other training samples to determine network weights, LS or its improved method can be selected.

Hadoop is an open-source implementation of MapReduce, enjoying wide adoption, and is used not only for batch jobs but also for short jobs where low response time is critical. However, Hadoop's performance is currently limited by its default task scheduler, which implicitly assumes that cluster nodes are homogeneous and tasks make progress linearly, and uses these assumptions to decide when to speculatively re-execute tasks that appear to be stragglers. In practice, the homogeneity assumption does not always hold. Longest Approximate Time to End (LATE) is a MapReduce scheduling algorithm that takes heterogeneous environments into consideration. It, however, adopts a static method to compute the progress of tasks. As a result neither Hadoop default nor LATE schedulers perform well in a heterogeneous environment. Self-adaptive MapReduce Scheduling Algorithm (SAMR) uses historical information to adjust stage weights of map and reduce tasks when estimating task execution times. However, SAMR does not consider the fact that for different types of jobs their map and reduce stage weights may be different. Even for the same type of jobs, different datasets may lead to different weights. To this end, we propose ESAMR: an Enhanced Self-Adaptive MapReduce scheduling algorithm to improve the speculative re-execution of slow tasks in MapReduce. In ESAMR, in order to identify slow tasks accurately, we differentiate historical stage weights information on each node and divide them into k clusters using a k-means clustering algorithm and when executing a job's tasks on a node, ESAMR classifies the tasks into one of the clusters and uses the cluster's weights to estimate the execution time of the job's tasks on the node. Experimental results show that among the aforementioned algorithms, ESAMR leads to the smallest error in task execution time estimation and identifies slow tasks most accurately.

Usually, these services put a huge amount of effort into geometry data computation. Thus, their workload is generally high. By exploring cloud computing techniques, one could utilize a number of computing nodes to distribute the workload of the systems. However, the workload is usually not equally balanced across computing nodes, if data is not well-distributed. To make the best use of computing nodes, we propose a sophisticated data distribution technology for geometry computation processing. Intuitively, one can simply divide geometry data into tiles so that the geometry data in each tile can be stored on one computing node. Unfortunately, since data in a tile shares spatial-proximity, processing a geometry computation on spatial-proximity data still incurs a huge workload. To address this issue, we propose a new data distribution approach, Reversed K-means, to distribute geometry data that shares spatial-proximity across different computing nodes. In this way, we can use more computing nodes to process geometry computation and get better performance. To evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm, we evaluate the utility of computing nodes and the response time when performing geometry computations. The experimental results show that the utility of the computing nodes is higher than existing methods, and the response time is the fastest of all methods.

Byte-precision Level of Detail Processing for Variable Precision Analytics	2012 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING, NETWORKING, STORAGE AND ANALYSIS (SC)	International Conference for High Performance Computing Networking Storage and Analysis		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC)	NOV 10-16, 2012	Salt Lake City, UT	IEEE Comp Soc, Assoc Comp Machinery (ACM)				I/O bottlenecks in HPC applications are becoming a more pressing problem as compute capabilities continue to outpace I/O capabilities. While double-precision simulation data often must be stored losslessly, the loss of some of the fractional component may introduce acceptably small errors to many types of scientific analyses. Given this observation, we develop a precision level of detail (APLOD) library, which partitions double-precision datasets along user-defined byte boundaries. APLOD parameterizes the analysis accuracy-I/O performance tradeoff, bounds maximum relative error, maintains I/O access patterns compared to full precision, and operates with low overhead. Using ADIOS as an I/O use-case, we show proportional reduction in disk access time to the degree of precision. Finally, we show the effects of partial precision analysis on accuracy for operations such as k-means and Fourier analysis, finding a strong applicability for the use of varying degrees of precision to reduce the cost of analyzing extreme-scale data.

Three clustering methods are presented and discussed by comparative experimental analysis model. The results by using three kinds of different clustering methods which are K-means method, Two-step method and Kohonen method visually illustrate the different clustering results. In the end of this paper, we could come to the conclusion that the applicability of different clustering methods on three-dimensional spatial linear data distribution. Clearly, when the kind of three-dimensional spatial linear data distribution is simple, at the same cluster number case, the clustering evaluation score of single method is higher. That is to say, the single method is more suitable to simple linear data distribution, especially Two-step clustering method is the priority selection. By comparison, when the kind of three-dimensional spatial linear data distribution is hybrid, the combination method is more suitable. The more optimized clustering analysis process is presented based on the above comparative analysis.

Most genes are believed to be uninformative with respect to studied classes. This paper proposed a novel feature selection approach for the classification of high dimensional cancer microarray data, which used filtering technique such as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) score and optimization technique as Particle swarm Optimization (PSO). The proposed method is divided in to two stages. In the first stage the data set is clustered using k-means clustering, SNR score is used to rank each gene in every cluster. The top scored genes from each cluster is gathered and a new feature subset is generated. In the second stage the new feature subset is used as input to the PSC) and optimized feature subset is being produced. Support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) arc used as evaluators and leave one out cross validation approach is used for validation. We have compared both of our approach and approaches using PSO in the literature. It has been demonstrated that our approach using PSC) gives better result than others.

In the proposed model, initially individual samples are selected and a matrix is generated which shows the genetic distances between individuals. Then by using the distance matrix, samples are divided into clusters. Then phylogenetic trees for each cluster are constructed independently. In order to find the clustering algorithm that gives the most effective clusters for biological data are k-means algorithm, k-medoid algorithm and density-based algorithms are used. By doing a comparative study it is concluded that density-based clustering (DBSCAN) is quite good for biological dataset because; this algorithm performs efficiently for low dimensional data and the algorithm is robust towards outliers and noise points. The phylogenetic tree for every individual clusters are formed and finally joined to create the final phylogenetic tree. From the experimental evaluation it has been found that, the DBSCAN is showing better result showing appropriate information and it is faster than other two methods.

In this paper, we focus our discussion on the rough set theory for attribute clustering. Rough set theory is a theory adopted to deal with rough and uncertain knowledge, which analyzes the clusters and finds the data principles when previous knowledge is not available, providing a new method for data classification. Although there are numerous methods of rough set and cluster analysis, as the data objects are changing continuously, we have to improve these relevant technologies over time, and propose creative theory in response, meeting the demands of application. Lastly, the experimental result of our proposed algorithm Rough Set based attribute Clustering for Sample Classification (RSCSC) is compared with some of the traditional attribute clustering methods and it is proved to be efficient in finding the meaningful, feasible and compact patterns.

But handling large value data set is a time consuming task, so we have introduced the fuzzy concept in order to discretize the dataset within the range 0 to 1. For our experiment, the gene expression data has been considered because of the common challenges. The first one is the curse of dimensionality. With increasing dimensionality, this data set becomes computationally intractable and therefore inapplicable in many real applications. Secondly, the specificity of similarities between points in a high dimensional data diminishes. It was proven that; for any point in a high dimensional data, the expected gap between the Euclidean distance to the closest neighbour and that to the farthest point shrinks as the dimensionality grows. In this paper, a key step in the analysis of gene expression data is the clustering using k-means and fuzzy k-means which group the genes that manifest similar expression patterns. From the experimental evaluation; it has been analyzed that fuzzy k-means shows better performance. The optimization techniques like Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for clustering on gene expression data has been used because; many mathematical features that make them attractive for gene expression analysis including their flexibility in choosing a similarity function, when dealing with large data set. As compared to all the techniques it has been observed that the number of clusters is more and runtime of fuzzy k-means is less and it provides crisp boundary among the clusters; and the application of soft computing techniques shows better result than the traditional algorithms.

Dev			Brain Image Segmentation Using Adaptive Mean Shift Based Fuzzy C Means Clustering Algorithm	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODELLING OPTIMIZATION AND COMPUTING	Procedia Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Modelling Optimisation and Computing (ICMOC)	APR 10-11, 2012	Kumarakoil, INDIA	Dept Mech Engn, Noorul Islam Ctr Higher Educ		Adaptive Mean-Shift; Segmentation; Tissues; FCM; Classification		Medical image segmentation has become an essential technique in clinical and research-oriented applications. MRI provides accurate anatomical brain images without use of ionizing radiation. For clinical use, the estimated values must be reliable and accurate,but many techniques fail on these criteria in an unrestricted clinical environment. Automated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) segmentation systems classify brain voxels into one of three main tissue types such as Gray Matter (GM), White Matter (WM) and Cerebro-Spinal Fluid (CSF). Volumetric analysis of different parts of the brain is useful in assessing the progress or remission of various diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and schizophrenia. In the existing methods segmentation was done based on the intensity value of the voxels. Thus using intensity information alone has proven to be insufficient for a reliable automated segmentation of the brain tissues. Hence an adaptive mean-shift methodology is utilized in order to classify brain voxels where the MRI image space is represented by a high-dimensional feature space that includes multimodal intensity features as well as spatial features. This proposed method clusters the joint spatial-intensity feature space thus extracting a representative set of high-density points within the feature space otherwise known as modes. The resultant output of an Adaptive means shift consists of several modes. A mode pruning step is undergone to reduce the number of modes. After the pruning step, intensity based clustering technique such as K-means algorithm is used for the classification of tissues. In this paper instead of K-means algorithm, Fuzzy C-means algorithm is implemented in order to achieve better segmentation. The final output consists of three regions which are used for the analysis of various neural diseases. It is shown to perform well in comparison to other state-of-the-art methods without the use of a preregistered statistical brain atlas. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In literature we can find three different clustering validity techniques: external criteria; internal criteria and relative criteria. In this paper, we focus on external criteria and present an algorithm that allows the implementation of external measures to assess clustering quality when the structure of the data set is unknown. To obtain an automatic partition of a data set and to reflect how documents must be grouped according to human intuition we use internal information present in data like descriptions provide by the users as tags and the distance between documents. The results show an evident correlation between manual and automatic classes indicating it is acceptable to use an automatic partition. In addition to presenting an alternative to finding the structure of the data set using meta-data such as tags, we also wanted to test the impact of their integration in the k-means++ algorithm and verify how it influences the quality of the formed clusters, suggesting a model of integration based on the occurrence of tags in document content. The experimental results indicate a positive impact when external measures are calculated, although there was no apparent correlation between the weight assigned to the tags and the quality of the obtained clusters.

The aim of our research is to construct a system that uses clustering techniques and tool catalog data to support the decision of end-milling conditions for difficult-to-cut materials. We used variable cluster analysis and the K-means method to find tool shape parameters that had a linear relationship with the end-milling conditions listed in the catalog. We used the response surface method and significant tool shape parameters obtained by clustering to derive end-milling condition. Milling experiments using a square end mill under two sets of end-milling conditions (conditions derived from the end-milling condition decision support system and conditions suggested by expert engineers) for difficult-to-cut materials (austenite stainless steel) showed that catalog mining can be used to derive guidelines for deciding end-milling conditions.

Measuring the calibration of a classifier usually relies on performing chi-squared goodness-of-fit tests between grouped probabilities and the observations in these groups. We considered alternatives to the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, the standard chi-squared test with groups based on sorted model outputs. Since this grouping does not represent "natural" groupings in data space, we investigated a chi-squared test with grouping strategies in data space. Using a series of artificial data sets for which the correct models are known, and one real-world data set, we analyzed the performance of the Pigeon-Heyse test with groupings by self-organizing maps, k-means clustering, and random assignment of points to groups. We observed that the Pigeon-Heyse test offers slightly better performance than the Hosmer-Lemeshow test while being able to locate regions of poor calibration in data space.

Methods: Two models of multilayer perceptron (MLP) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network approaches based on decision support system were developed. The MLP model was used to optimize the predicting algorithm based on the conjugate gradients descent method. To design the RBF network, K-Means clustering technique was used to select the centers of RBFs, and k-nearest neighbourhood to define the spread and forward selection for determining the optimum number of RBFs. To assess the generalization of the network, K-fold cross-validation test was used. A total of 3,109 medical records containing 19 main clinical parameters were used to train and test the networks. Results: The findings indicate a reliable performance of the proposed system. The MLP based model yields a sensitivity, specificity, and an area under the receiver/relative operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 87.1%, 90%, and 0.887 +/- 0.02, respectively. However, the RBF network shows the above parameters as 84.4%, 94.3%, and 0.905 +/- 0.017, respectively. Conclusions: The proposed intelligence system achieved a high degree of diagnostic accuracy (92.9% for MLP and 93.7% for RBF) indicating its high efficiency for clinical diagnosis of LOHF.

The existing literature contains a plethora of density based algorithms but in all cases one or multiple global parameters need to be set, parameters that are seldom easy to set requiring in depth knowledge about the analyzed data. This paper proposes a parameter-free novel genetic clustering algorithm with an original method for encoding clustering solutions relying on density based clustering parameters. Within each clustering solution genotype, gene position, defined by several density based clustering attributes, plays a key role for recovering the encoded partition. Each gene defined density-based cluster can only attract object not already attracted by previously defined clusters. The proposed encoding scheme allows for always valid crossover results, with great offspring variations even when using simple crossover operators. While not requiring any input parameters, experiments involving multiple clustering validation indices as fitness criteria, across both synthetic and real data sets, show comparable results with existing density-based clustering techniques.

Rank distance has applications in many different fields such as computational linguistics, biology and informatics. Rank distance can be computed fast and benefits from some features of the edit (Levenshtein) distance. In [1] two clustering methods based on rank distance are described. The K-means algorithm uses the median string to represent the centroid of a cluster, while the hierarchical clustering method joins pairs of strings and replaces each pair with the median string. Two similar clustering algorithms are about to be presented in this paper, only that the closest string will be considered instead of the median string. The new clustering algorithms are compared with those presented in [1] and other similar clustering techniques. Experiments using mitochondrial DNA sequences extracted from several mammals are performed to compare the results of the clustering methods. Resultsmdemonstrate the clustering performance and the utility of the new algorithms.

Past work reported in literature uses projection pursuit methods as means to visualize high-dimensional data, or to identify linear combinations of attributes that reveal grouping tendencies or outliers. The framework of projection pursuit is generally formulated as an optimization problem aiming at finding projection axes that minimize/maximize a projection index. With regard to identifying interesting structure, the existing approaches suffer from obvious limitations: linear models are not able to catch more general structures in data like circular/curved clusters or any structure that is the result of a polynomial/nonlinear generative model. This paper extends linear projection pursuit to nonlinear projections while allowing at the same time for the preservation of the general methodology employed in the search of projections. In addition, an algorithmic framework based on multi-modal genetic algorithms is proposed in order to deal with the large search space and to allow for the use of non-differentiable projection indices. Experiments conducted on synthetic data demonstrate the ability of the new approach to identify clusters of various shapes that otherwise are undetectable with linear projection pursuit or popular clustering methods like k-Means.

In this paper we present an automatic recognition system of flowers for smartphone users. After a user transmits a flower image to the server, the image processing and searching is performed only by the server, eliminating the user interaction from the recognition process. The server detects the contour of a flower image by using both color-based and edge-based contour detection. Then, we classify its color groups and contour shapes by using k-means clustering and history matching. After comparing the input image with the reference images stored on the server, the server sends the most similar image to the user. We also address the image recognition failure issue caused by the light and the camera angle by partial recognition and image recovery. We have obtained the success rate of 94.8 % for 500 images from 100 species.

This paper presents a graph-based algorithmic method for defining nominal terminal routing from historical flight tracks. First historical traffic is used to generate a directed graph. Then Djikstra's shortest path algorithm is used to identify the shortest yet most commonly used paths through the graph. There were many different nominal routes between different engine types due to the distinct differences in engine performance characteristics. A comparison of graph-based shortest path routes to two other methods (manual and k-means) showed how the method could rapidly produce similar distinct dominant terminal area flows. Finding shortest paths from all links of a sufficient weight, rather than just source nodes, identified more route options depicting standard path control techniques in addition to the dominant route. This method may be used to rapidly prototype route models to assess trajectory-based terminal area concepts.

State-of-the-art visual image retrieval techniques are based on bag-of-visual-words (BoV) model, which is an analogy for text-based search. In BoV, each keypoint is rounded off to the nearest visual word. On the other hand in this work, thanks to the vector computation power of GPUs, we utilize real values of keypoint descriptors. We match keypoints in two steps. The idea in the first step is similar to visual word matching in BoV. In the second step, we do matching in keypoint level. By keeping identities of each keypoint, closest keypoints are accurately retrieved in real-time. Image search has different characteristics than textual search. We implement one-to-one keypoint matching, which is more natural for images. Our experiments reveal 265 times speed up for offline index generation, 104 times speedup for online index search and 20.5 times speedup for online keypoint matching time, when compared to the CPU implementation. Our proposed keypoint-matching-based search improves accuracy of BoV by 9.5%.

The algorithm consists of two stages. In the first stage, the optimal number of segments is automatically determined by means of a compactness measure that is formulated to find a clustering with "maximum inter-cluster distance and minimum intra-cluster variance". In the second stage, a multiple terminal vertices weighted graph is constructed based on an energy function and the image is segmented. A large number of performance evaluations have been carried out and the experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is effective, and it obtains satisfied results in comparing with other algorithms.

We propose an approach for player detection in long view of broadcast soccer video. We detect long view frames using dominant color ratio. We use k-means clustering algorithm for calculating dominant color thresholds. Our method for player detection has two phases: in the first phase we perform a preprocessing for deleting some non-player regions, this is done with knowledge of soccer video domain and morphology operation. Remaining regions will be classified into player or non-player groups with using a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network as classifier in second phase. Our used feature vector for every region consist of two parts: color value of region in Cb and Cr layers from YCbCr color space and area of the region. Finally we track each player. Experiments show that our method can detect player effectively and with high accuracy.

The master selects portions of the search space, and slaves perform, in parallel and independently, a GA that solves the problem on the assigned portion of the search space. The master's work is to progressively narrow the areas explored by the slave's GAs, using parallel dynamic K-means clustering to determine the basins of attraction of the search space. Coordination of activities between master and slaves is done in an asynchronous way (i.e. no waiting is entertained among the processes). The proposed asynchronous model has managed to reduce computation time while maintaining the quality of solutions.

In the synthetic simulation of RBF, we have set the Gaussian function based on parameters and tried to reconstruct the vocal fluctuations. With respect to parameter estimation, we have adopted to nonlinear least-squares method for making much account of the nonlinearity of human voice. When we have reproduced the synthesized speech, we have tried to reconstruct the nonlinear fluctuations of amplitude by adding normal random number. We have made a comparison the real voice and the synthetic voice obtained from simulation. As a consequence, we have found that it was possible to synthesize the vocal fluctuations for a short time.

Although traditional clustering algorithms can be used to domain-specific features clustering, the performance may not good as the features have little inter-connection in related domains. In this paper, we develop a solution that uses the domain-independent feature as a bridge to connect the domain-specific features. And we use spectral clustering to cluster the domain-specific features into K clusters. We present theoretical analysis to show that our algorithm is able to produce high quality clusters.

Following this unprecedented discovery made by zoologists at the University of Oxford and Eotvos University, we extend in this paper the flocking model largely used in computer science. We define a new biologically inspired clustering algorithm entitled "FlockbyLeader" that detects hierarchical leaders, discovers their followers, and enables them to flock based on local proximity in an artificial virtual space to create clusters. We offer empirical evidence that the algorithm outperforms both the existing flocking algorithm and the K-means algorithm. We analyze the performance of the algorithm based on widely used datasets in the literature.

In D2DC, devices are very close among themselves and therefore the resulting interferences maybe quite serious, it becomes an important issue of how to properly select a UE owner so that when this UE owner searches for its associated communicating UEs in its service range they will suffer the least interference effect. In this paper, as UEs are distributed and clusters of UEs are formed in the D2D communication area; we propose to use K-Means to locating a UE around the cluster center as the UE Owner of the cluster. With this formation of UE clusters and UE owners they still have the chance to incur interferences among UE clusters due to they may be possibly use the same frequency band in their communications. Frequency hopping technique is then considered in this paper to further reduce the co-channel interference. In this paper it proposes to use Genetic Algorithm (GA) with frequency hopping technique to optimally select the number of frequency channels required in the system and then allocate these frequency channels to the UE clusters for their D2D communications. Simulations have been performed in a D2DC system with the proposed GA algorithm to reveal the effectiveness of the designed algorithm in the allocation of frequency channels to the clusters with minimum interference effect.

In particular, the distance signal feature and the width feature are combined in an effective way to enhance each other's discriminating capability. The resulting feature vector is quantized into mid-level features using k-means clustering. In the mid-level feature space, we apply the nonparametric embedding method to construct a compact yet discriminative subspace model. We have conducted a series of experiments on the Weizmann dataset to validate the proposed scheme. Compared with the existing approaches, our method can achieve high recognition accuracy while having a reduced computational complexity in classification stage.

The need of generalizing the spectral features for the images captured by different kinds of devices is investigated. Mean-shift segmentation algorithm is employed to partition the input multi-spectral image in addition to k-means which is used as a complementary method for structural feature generation. Adaboost learning algorithm is utilized with extracted features to distinguish roads from non-road regions in the satellite images. The proposed algorithm is tested on an image database containing both IKONOS and GEOEYE images to verify the achieved generalization. The empirical results show that the proposed road extraction method is promising and capable of finding the majority of the road network.

The proposed AL method aims at selecting the most informative and representative unlabeled samples which have maximum uncertainty, diversity and density assessed according to the SVR estimation rule. This is achieved on the basis of two consecutive steps that rely on the kernel k-means clustering. In the first step the most uncertain unlabeled samples are selected by removing the most certain ones from a pool of unlabeled samples. In SVR problems, the most uncertain samples are located outside or on the boundary of the e-tube of SVR, as their target values have the lowest confidence to be correctly estimated. In order to select these samples, the kernel k-means clustering is applied to all unlabeled samples together with the training samples that are not SVs, i.e., those that are inside the e-tube, (non-SVs). Then, clusters with non-SVs inside are rejected, whereas the unlabeled samples contained in the remained clusters are selected as the most uncertain samples. In the second step the samples located in the high density regions in the kernel space and as much diverse as possible to each other are chosen among the uncertain samples. The density and diversity of the unlabeled samples are evaluated on the basis of their clusters' information. To this end, initially the density of each cluster is measured by the ratio of the number of samples in the cluster to the distance of its two furthest samples. Then, the highest density clusters are chosen and the medoid samples closest to the centers of the selected clusters are chosen as the most informative ones. The diversity of samples is accomplished by selecting only one sample from each selected cluster. Experiments applied to the estimation of single-tree parameters, i.e., tree stem volume and tree stem diameter, show the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

Unsupervised classification of hyperspectral images using an Adaptive Vector Tunnel classifier	IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR REMOTE SENSING XVIII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Image and Signal Processing for Remote Sensing XVIII	SEP 24-26, 2012	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE, SELEX GALILEO, THALES		Hyperspectral Images; Classification; Unsupervised Classification; K-Means; Vector Tunnel		Hyperspectral image classification is one of the most popular information extraction methods in remote sensing applications. This method consists of variety of algorithms involving supervised, unsupervised or fuzzy classification, etc. In supervised classification, reference data which is known as a priori class information is used. On the other hand, computer based clustering algorithms are employed to group pixels which have similar spectral characteristics according to some statistical criteria in unsupervised classification. Among the most powerful techniques for hyperspectral image clustering, K-Means is one of the widely used iterative approaches. It is a simple though computationally expensive algorithm, particularly for clustering large hyperspectral images into many categories. During application of this technique, the Euclidian Distance (ED) measure is used to calculate the distances between pixel and local class centers. In this study, a new adaptive unsupervised classification technique is presented. It is a kind of vector tunnel around the randomly selected pixel spectra that changes according to spectral variation with respect to hyperspectral bands. Although vector tunnel classifier does not need training data or intensive mathematical calculation, classification results are comparable to K-Means Classification Algorithm.

Apart from learning related activities however, it is possible for them to engage in non-learning related activities. From the data gathered, the k-Means algorithm was used to discover five behaviors exhibited by students as they learned online relative to how they transitioned between viewing learning and non-learning related websites. Since emotion was previously reported to have an effect on how students learned online, differences in emotion transitions for each of the online learning behaviors were also observed. The analysis of these transitions provided possible reasons for why students exhibited these behaviors. Possible interventions were then suggested which can be used for supporting students as they learn online. Systems can later be developed to utilize the developed model for predicting the type of behavior exhibited by a student and provide appropriate support mechanisms for their learning.

Efficient Kernel Clustering Using Random Fourier Features	12TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING (ICDM 2012)	IEEE International Conference on Data Mining		English	Proceedings Paper	12th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM)	DEC 10-13, 2012	Brussels, BELGIUM	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, Natl Sci Fdn (NSF), FWO, IBM, SAS, Yahoo, NASA, Biside, KNIME, Univ Antwerpen, Univ Libre Bruxelles (ULB)		Kernel clustering; Kernel k-means; Random Fourier features; Scalability	NYSTROM METHOD; APPROXIMATIONS	Kernel clustering algorithms have the ability to capture the non-linear structure inherent in many real world data sets and thereby, achieve better clustering performance than Euclidean distance based clustering algorithms. However, their quadratic computational complexity renders them non-scalable to large data sets. In this paper, we employ random Fourier maps, originally proposed for large scale classification, to accelerate kernel clustering. The key idea behind the use of random Fourier maps for clustering is to project the data into a low-dimensional space where the inner product of the transformed data points approximates the kernel similarity between them. An efficient linear clustering algorithm can then be applied to the points in the transformed space. We also propose an improved scheme which uses the top singular vectors of the transformed data matrix to perform clustering, and yields a better approximation of kernel clustering under appropriate conditions. Our empirical studies demonstrate that the proposed schemes can be efficiently applied to large data sets containing millions of data points, while achieving accuracy similar to that achieved by state-of-the-art kernel clustering algorithms.

In this paper, we will examine the problem of clustering uncertain graphs. Uncertain graphs are best clustered with the use of a possible worlds model in which the most reliable clusters are discovered in the presence of uncertainty. Reliable clusters are those which are not likely to be disconnected in the context of different instantiations of the uncertain graph. In this paper we provide a generalized reliability measurement from two basic intuitions (purity and size balance) to overcome the challenges from standard reliability criterion, and develop a novel k-means algorithm to solve the uncertain clustering problem. We present experimental results which illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our model and approachs.

However, some of the available sources may be misleading (due to noise, errors in measurement etc.) in revealing the true structure of the data, thus, their inclusion in the clustering process may have negative influence. This aspect seems to be overlooked in the multi-view literature where all representations are equally considered. In this work, views are expressed in terms of given kernel matrices and a weighted combination of the kernels is learned in parallel to the partitioning. Weights assigned to kernels are indicative of the quality of the corresponding views' information. Additionally, the combination scheme incorporates a parameter that controls the admissible sparsity of the weights to avoid extremes and tailor them to the data. Two efficient iterative algorithms are proposed that alternate between updating the view weights and recomputing the clusters to optimize the intra-cluster variance from different perspectives. The conducted experiments reveal the effectiveness of our methodology compared to other multi-view methods.

A popular class of graph clustering algorithms for large-scale networks, such as PMetis, KMetis and Graclus, is based on a multilevel framework. Generally, these multilevel algorithms work reasonably well on networks with a few million vertices. However, when the network size increases to the scale of 10 million vertices or greater, the performance of these algorithms rapidly degrades. Furthermore, an inherent property of social networks, the power law degree distribution, makes these algorithms infeasible to apply to large-scale social networks. In this paper, we propose a scalable and memory-efficient clustering algorithm for large-scale social networks. We name our algorithm GEM, by mixing two key concepts of the algorithm, Graph Extraction and weighted kernel k-Means. GEM efficiently extracts a good skeleton graph from the original graph, and propagates the clustering result of the extracted graph to the rest of the network. Experimental results show that GEM produces clusters of quality comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art graph clustering algorithms, while it is much faster and consumes much less memory. Furthermore, the parallel implementation of GEM, called PGEM, not only produces higher quality of clusters but also achieves much better scalability than most current parallel graph clustering algorithms.

Each of these submanifolds can be modeled by a number of linear subspaces. This is in fact the main intuition behind a majority of subspace clustering algorithms. In many cases, however, the subspaces computed by these algorithms consist of disconnected subsets of the underlying submanifolds and therefore, do not form localized and compact clusters. To address this problem, we propose "Low Dimensional Localized Clustering (LDLC)", a new method for subspace clustering. Unlike existing methods, LDLC respects the topology of the underling submanifolds and assigns the data points to localized clusters such that the total reconstruction error is minimized. This is a valuable property in many tasks, such as semi-supervised classification, data visualization and local dimensionality reduction. We establish connections between LDLC, K-Means, and VQPCA from different perspectives, and validate our method through various experiments on synthetic and real data sets.

This method integrates multiple clusters produced by using a simple constrained K-means algorithm that we modify to utilize the constraints priorities. The cluster ensemble is executed according to a boosting framework, which adaptively learns the constraints priorities and provides them for the modified constrained K-means to create diverse clusters that finally improve the clustering performance. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the original constrained K-means and is comparable to several state-of-the-art constrained clustering methods.

Data mining, based on pattern recognition algorithms can be of significant help for power system analysis, as high definition data is often complex to comprehend. In this paper three pattern recognition algorithms are applied to perform the data mining tasks. The deployment is carried out firstly for fault data classification, secondly for checking which faults are occurring more frequently and thirdly for identifying the root cause of a fault by clustering the parameters behind each scenario. For such purposes three algorithms are chosen, k-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes and the k-means Clustering.

In the first segmentation fourteen directions are chosen initially, and a k-mean algorithm according to the normal vectors is used, then the surface is divided to form patches by a region-growing scheme. In order to identify simple analytic surface, curvedness of a patch is set as the criterion by which the surface merged into near constant curvedness region. Especially a novel mean shift algorithm is adopted in this method, that a powerful technique for clustering in image process, and is extended to normal filtering while preserving the features to increase robustness of the method.

It builds on the results of factor analysis, which defined seven significant factors that characterize the socio-economic status of communities. The input for cluster analysis was the factor loadings, which allowed making multi-dimensional classification of the studied municipalities. To build the structure of clusters there were used both hierarchical clustering methods and non-hierarchical clustering methods with the help of k-means. In the first case the Ward's method was utilized to create clusters and the results were graphically displayed by tree diagram. With the help of the division procedure an initial cluster was divided into 2 to 4 smaller clusters. Two basic clusters can be classified as urban and rural. Urban cluster is characterized by better features of population settlement, age structure, civic amenities and the branch structure. On the contrary, cluster consisting of rural communities has an aging population, population migrating to cities, poor civic amenities and the employment structure is dominated by manufacturing and agriculture. When lowering the clustering level, it can be found that rural cluster breaks down to agricultural, submountaneous and cross-border areas. In the second stage, the method of non-hierarchic clustering using k-means was applied on the results of factor analysis. A set of municipalities of the Liberec Region was gradually divided into 2 to 10 clusters, which were analyzed in detail using the R-square index and Calinski-Habarasz F index. Taking into account the requirement that the clusters were not formed only by a few elements and outlying values, the region was finally divided into 6 clusters, which can be classified as urban, micro-regional, economically weak and rural focused on housing, services and agriculture.

A heuristic optimal technique like particle swarm optimization (PSO) can find global optimal solution with the cost of extensive computation. In this paper, a PSO based clustering algorithm (PSOBC) has been proposed to avoid local optimal cluster center in cluster analysis. The algorithm utilizes both global search capability of PSO and local search capability of K-Means. Proposed method has been tested with various multidimensional datasets and performance comparison with traditional centroid-based clustering method is also highlighted. Finally, the experimental results and complexity analysis put light on the effectiveness of the algorithm.

For improving the generalization ability of support vector machine ensemble, K-means algorithm is used to select the most accurate individual support vector machine from every cluster for ensembling It is established a one-step predictive model that detects the weak signal, including transient signal and period is signals, from the predictive error in the chaotic sequences. It is illustrated in the experiment which is conducted to detect weak signals from Lorenz chaotic background and IPIX Sea Clutter, that the proposed method is highly effective to detect weak signal from a chaotic background and to minimize the influence of noise on weak signals, Compared wich the RBF neural network and SVM model, the new method presents great value in predicting accuracy and detection threshold.

As it was not possible to inject errors into the "real" SOA system and to measure them, a special model of SOA system was designed and implemented. In this systems several anomalies were introduced and the effectiveness of algorithms in detecting them were measured. The results of experiments may be used to select efficient algorithm for anomaly detection. Two algorithms: K-Means clustering and emerging patterns were used to detect anomalies in the frequency of service call. The results of this experiment are discussed.

J	Saharkhiz, S; Abdorazaghi, M				Saharkhiz, Siamak; Abdorazaghi, Mohammad			The Performance of Different Clustering Methods in the Objective Assessment of Fabric Pilling	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERED FIBERS AND FABRICS			English	Article							IMAGE-ANALYSIS	In the present work, the performance clustering methods for classifying the pilling of knitted fabric and comparison among different classification algorithms is presented, Median- cut, K-mean, and Competitive Learning algorithms of K-mean were investigated in order to objectively evaluate fabric pilling. To achieve objective assessment, the fabric surface was scanned by a non-contact method using a laser triangulated device with no interfere to the fabric surface. The 2-D Fast Fourier Transform method considering low pass filtration and suitable cut-off frequency was applied to identify and separate pills from fabric fuzzy surfaces and fabric textures. Several fabric surface parameters were extracted but the number of pills, protruding geometrical volume, and area of pills were found to have better correlation with subjective evaluation. A pill grade intensity vector, comprising the three mentioned parameters was introduced for developing the clustering algorithms. The results show that K-mean and Competitive Learning algorithms of K-mean give a fair agreement between objective and subjective grades, while the Median- cut method has a poor correlation.

An essential sector in the daily processing of received Formosat-2 image is to estimate the cloud statistic of image using Automatic Cloud Coverage Assessment (ACCA) algorithm. The information of cloud statistic of image is subsequently recorded as an important metadata for image product catalog. In this paper, we propose an ACCA method with two consecutive stages: preprocessing and post-processing analysis. For pre-processing analysis, the un-supervised K-means classification, Sobel's method, thresholding method, non-cloudy pixels reexamination, and cross-band filter method are implemented in sequence for cloud statistic determination. For post-processing analysis, Box-Counting fractal method is implemented. In other words, the cloud statistic is firstly determined via pre-processing analysis, the correctness of cloud statistic of image of different spectral band is eventually cross-examined qualitatively and quantitatively via post-processing analysis. The selection of an appropriate thresholding method is very critical to the result of ACCA method. Therefore, in this work, We firstly conduct a series of experiments of the clustering-based and spatial thresholding methods that include Otsu's, Local Entropy(LE), Joint Entropy(JE), Global Entropy(GE), and Global Relative Entropy(GRE) method, for performance comparison. The result shows that Otsu's and GE methods both perform better than others for Formosat-2 image. Additionally, our proposed ACCA method by selecting Otsu's method as the threshoding method has successfully extracted the cloudy pixels of Formosat-2 image for accurate cloud statistic estimation.

Therefore, for word segmentation from arbitrarily-oriented video text lines, in this paper, we extract four new gradient directional features for each Canny edge pixel of the input text line image to produce four respective pixel candidate images. The union of four pixel candidate images is performed to obtain a text candidate image. The sequence of the components in the text candidate image according to the text line is determined using nearest neighbor criteria. Then we propose a two-stage method for segmenting words. In the first stage, for the distances between the components, we apply K-means clustering with K=2 to get probable word and non-word spacing clusters. The words are segmented based on probable word spacing and all other components are passed to the second stage for segmenting correct words. For each segmented and un-segmented words passed to the second stage, the method repeats all the steps until the K-means clustering step to find probable word and non-word spacing clusters. Then the method considers cluster nature, height and width of the components to identify the correct word spacing. The method is tested extensively on video curved text lines, non-horizontal straight lines, horizontal straight lines and text lines from the ICDAR-2003 competition data. Experimental results and a comparative study shows the results are encouraging and promising.

It's a natural way to think about combine them together to get a good classifier. In this paper, we give a new selection criterion for a graph based semi-supervised learner. Contribution of our work is that based on local & global consistency (LGC) SSL method we create a new framework of active learning. Firstly, we do active learning by selecting representative data and these data uniformly distribute over the manifold cloud with the largest local density and have the least chance to be error labeled. Secondly, we do greed confidence label propagation inference under LGC-F function criterion in the second active learning process. Thirdly, our work can be easily extended to multi-class problem using LGC-F function. Compared with Zhu's work, our algorithm starts from representative data in local area and make no assumption about the distribution of original dataset. The proposed active learning method only starts from one basic assumption that data close to each other should have the same label. Our method is more robust and more general compared with Zhu's work. Experiment results on two moon toy data, digit recognition, and face detection dataset prove that the efficiency of our new active leaning method. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Several positioning methods for a single hovering type AUV have been proposed in order to achieve different kind of missions. We had proposed a navigation method of multiple AUVs aimed at unexplored and wide seafloor surveys. In this method, the AUVs need to share their estimated states. However, typical data rates of acoustic communications in underwater environments are too small to share the states with each other constantly. In order to overcome the problem, we propose a state estimation method where the stochastic state estimator "Particle Filter" is applied to multiple AUVs. The information about the estimated states is approximated by "Particle Clustering" using a clustering method (k-means) and a model evaluation method by AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) to select the optimal size of clusters and reduce the required communication data size. Through simulations, the proposed method succeeded in stable positioning and reduction of the data size required to share.

XML clustering techniques have been the key mechanisms to efficiently manage and categorize XML data when e-business transactions occur. Most previous works in the related literature focus on extracting frequent subtrees or common structures from a tree collection, which may incur the serious loss of structure information of the original tree during the extracting process. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Scanning approach for XML structural clustering based on Trie Matching (DSTM). We initially extracted structure paths from XML documents and then constructed their XML tries. The structural similarity is computed between two XML tries utilizing trie matching method. By dynamically scanning the unassigned XML tries, XML documents are allocated into different clusters according the given structural similarity threshold, and finally our approach discovers the number of clusters on its own, where the complete cluster structure is preserved without any loss of structure information. Further, we develop a heuristic to automatically determine a suitable similarity threshold to achieve good clustering results. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DSTM, we conduct extensive experiments on XML documents in e-business. The experimental results show that DSTM is approximately linear to the size of XML documents, is efficient for dynamic and incremental XML documents clustering, and outperforms K-means and the traditional hierarchical clustering methods in efficiency. In conclusion, our approach is scalable, effective and efficient for clustering large amounts of XML documents in e-business.

However, little attention has been paid to the integration of these two approaches. Combining non-stationary feature analysis with complex feature classifiers, this article presents a novel direction to enhance the discriminatory power of pattern recognition methods. This approach, which is based on a fusion of non-stationary feature analysis with clustering techniques, proposes an algorithm to adaptively identify the feature vectors according to their importance in representing the patterns of discrimination. Non-stationary feature vectors are extracted using a non-stationary method based on time-frequency distribution and non-negative matrix factorization. The clustering algorithms including the K-means and self-organizing tree maps are utilized as unsupervised clustering methods followed by a supervised labeling. Two labeling methods are introduced: hard and fuzzy labeling. The article covers in detail the formulation of the proposed discriminant feature clustering method. Experiments performed with pathological speech classification, T-wave alternans evaluation from the surface electrocardiogram, audio scene analysis, and telemonitoring of Parkinson's disease problems produced desirable results. The outcome demonstrates the benefits of non-stationary feature fusion with clustering methods for complex data analysis where existing approaches do not exhibit a high performance.

Clustering of the satellite infrared images is required in order to estimate the cloud cover area. In this paper a neuro-fuzzy technique in the form of unsupervised fuzzy min-max clustering neural (FMMCN) network has been implemented for clustering satellite infrared image. Each cluster is in the form of an n-dimensional hyperbox defined by minimum and maximum points and a fuzzy membership function. FMMCN suits this application area because it is completely unsupervised and hence, unlabeled data can be used with it. Also the number of clusters is not required to be mentioned at the beginning as it is calculated dynamically.

There are many issues that make difficult the complete elucidation of the relationship between these mutations and drug resistance, such as cross resistance and the limitations to detect the relevance of resistance. Look up tables and rule-based systems are an attempt to classify sequences and predict treatment failure. However, they depend on the scientific literature and their quality and reliability. Data-intensive analysis of HIV mutation databases may help to corroborate or to improve such knowledge spread in the literature. Pattern recognition algorithms classify data extracting information from different data domain. Clustering and biclustering classification algorithms have been explored to group scientific and business data based on measures of similarities. K-means is a popular algorithm for clustering and Bimax is used with binary data. Considering this scenario, the main contribution of this work is to develop a new methodology based on K-means and Bimax using a binary data representation of reverse transcriptase and protease sequences, in an attempt to get an unsupervised classification of the sequences that may be related to drug resistance. In our work, 14,393 sequences with selected positions of the proteins, known to be related to drug resistance, represented in an 82-dimensional vector space are analyzed by pattern recognition algorithms. The sequences are represented as binary vectors. Suitable visualization of such vectors is produced for medical interpretation and indicates some correspondence to the prediction of drug resistance given by the brazilian look up table, used by brazilian physicians, but that depends on the literature on HIV and it's quality to be created. As a consequence, in this work we describe a methodology based on the application of pattern recognition algorithms using binary data in order to suggest clusters of mutations and their relations with drug resistance using a different cluster visualization scheme.

Most residual data in depth map coding are generated along abrupt depth discontinuities, represented by near-zero and high-magnitude values. In this paper, we model the residual data with two representative values calculated by the K-means clustering method and send them to the decoder by skipping transformation. After best mode decision, we applied the proposed method to a block containing residual data, and then we send the quantized representative values to decoder if its coding rate is less than the conventional best mode. By conducting INTRA only coding, -20.32% bit saving was achieved.

The proposed scheme adopts the K-means clustering algorithm to segment the depth image into K segments. The resulting segmented image is losslessly compressed and transmitted to the decoder. The depth image is then compressed using a bi-modal block encoder, where the smooth blocks are predicted using direct spatial prediction. On the other hand, blocks containing depth discontinuities are approximated using a novel depth discontinuity predictor. The residual information is then compressed using a lossy compression strategy and transmitted to the receiver. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme outperforms the state of the art spatial video coding systems available today such as JPEG and H.264/AVC Intra. Moreover, the proposed scheme manages to outperform specialized depth image compression algorithms such as the one proposed by Zanuttigh and Cortelazzo.

Various clustering based segmentation methods have been proposed. However, it is very difficult to choose the method best suited to the type of data. Therefore, the objective of this research was to compare the effectiveness of three clustering methods involving RGB, HSV and CIE L*a*b* colour spaces and a variety of real colour images. The methods were: K-Means clustering algorithm, Partitioning Around Medoids method (PAM) and Kohonen's Self -Organizing Maps method (SOM). To evaluate these three techniques, the connectivity(C), the Dunn index (D) and the silhouette width (S) cluster validation techniques were used. For C, a lower value indicates a better technique and for D and S, a higher value indicates a better technique. Clustering algorithms were evaluated on natural images and their performance is compared. Results demonstrate that K-Means and SOM were considered to be the most suitable techniques for image segmentation among CIE L*a*b* and HSV colour spaces.

In emerging countries, domestic and regional travel represents a highly promising tourism market in its nascent stage; even it has not yet reached significant volume because of low average levels of disposable income. However, domestic travel can mean a massive volume of tourist activity (Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report 2011 - World Economic Forum). In this respect, in the present paper we aimed at carrying out a research on the European countries tourism competitiveness using statistical tools. Our analysis is based on the 14 pillars described in the Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report 2011 - World Economic Forum (http://www.weforum.org/reports/travel-tourism-competitiveness-report-2011) taking into consideration only European countries. In order to see how the 14 pillars of the competitiveness index are grouping on the 27 EU countries and the other 15 non-EU countries, we used - separately for EU countries and non-EU countries - the principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation and Kaiser normalization, followed by hierarchical cluster analysis and then the k-means cluster analysis to view the countries clustering on the principal components resulted.

The characteristic dimensions are up to hundreds of dimensions. The capabilities for image representation, storage, management far exceed that of the database. Retrieval and matching of large-scale image are the urgent problems which need to be solved. To solve the construction of image indexing of large-scale image retrieval, this paper introduces a parallel level K-means clustering method. Firstly, image clustering based on the level K-means reduces the size of matching data in retrieval; secondly, considering the inherent defects in the cluster, we put forward optimization program and calculate cluster rapidly with parallel computing algorithms. The experimental results show that this method can quickly build a massive image index for fast image retrieval.

K-harmonic means clustering (KHM) is an extension of K-means (KM) and solves the problem of KM initialization using a built-in boosting function. However, it is also suffering from running into local optima. As a stochastic global optimization technique, harmony search (HS) can solve this problem. HS-based KHM, HSKHM not only helps KHM clustering escaping from local optima but also overcomes the shortcoming of slow convergence speed of HS. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid data-clustering algorithm, HSKHM. The experimental results on four real gene expression datasets indicate that HSKHM is superior KHM and HS in most cases. The HSKHM algorithm not only improves the convergence speed of HS but also helps KHM escaping from local optima.

They are a high-priority target group for viral marketing campaigns. On an average, an opinion leader will tell about his or her experience with a product or company to 14 other people. It is important to identify such opinion leaders from data derived from online activity of users. We present an approach to identification of opinion leaders using the K-means clustering algorithm. This approach does not require knowledge of the user's opinions or membership in other forums.

That's because having good segmentation results is useful for both physicians and patients via providing important information for surgical planning and early disease detection. This paper aims at evaluating the performance of the K-means clustering algorithm. To achieve this, we applied the K-means approach on different medical images including liver CT and breast MRI images. Experimental results obtained show that the overall segmentation accuracy offered by the K-means approach is high compared to segmentation accuracy by the well-known normalized cuts segmentation approach.

Traditionally the information is derived from the primary source of data by recording events such as transactions, phone calls, user sessions, security breaches, and car trips. Much of the early data mining techniques used information granules generated from primary data sources. Recent data mining techniques such as ensemble classifiers and stacked regression use secondary sources of data obtained from initial data mining activities. Typically, these techniques use preliminary applications of data mining techniques for initial knowledge discovery. The knowledge acquired from the preliminary data mining is then used for more refined analysis. Granular computing can enable us to develop a formal framework for incorporating information from both primary and secondary sources of data. This enhanced granular representation can help us develop integrated data mining techniques. This paper proposes a novel recursive meta-clustering algorithm to demonstrate the versatility of granular computing for developing integrated data mining techniques to exploit primary and secondary knowledge sources.

The Developmental Networks (DN) use Lobe Component Analysis (LCA) features developed not only from the image space X but also the action space Z. Since, Z can be taught to represent a set of trainer specified meanings (e.g., type and location), a DN treats these meanings in a unified way for both detection and recognition for objects in dynamic cluttered backgrounds. However, the DN method has not been applied to publicly available datasets and compared with well-known major techniques. In this work, we fill this void. We describe how the Z information enables the features to be more sensitive to trainer specified output meanings (e.g., type and location). The reported experiments fall into two extensively studied categories - global template based object recognition and local template based scene classification. For the datasets used, the performance of the DN method is better or comparable to some major local template based methods but the DNs also provide statistics-based location information about the object in a cluttered scene.

Generally, they show dynamic morphologic changes that arise from high tidal energy and sediment transportation. The study of sediment budget processes is important in many ecological systems. The sediment budget can be estimated only if maps of morphological changes are available. Remote sensing, combined with in situ surveying, is an effective tool for monitoring tidal flats. The aim of this work is to precisely map tidal flats changes using multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired by the TerraSAR-X sensor. For that purpose, is proposed the application of K-Means clustering (in a gray level mode) to both original and preprocessed SAR amplitude data sets, followed by a morphological sequence task to generate optimized datasets, which will be compared for change detection between tides. Results will show the segmentation of intertidal regions from flooding tide's comparison.

Specifically, the introduction of Dirichlet process is purposed to extend the LDA to an infinite mixtures model which can estimate the number of components (e. g. clusters in image analysis) automatically. Finally, the effect of the proposed algorithm is analyzed through experiments, and the results of it with the traditional K-means method over a QUICKBIRD image are compared.

Dense divisions are defined to discriminate target classes of possibly subtle distinction. The statistical similarity and uncertainty of overlapping cluster pairs are evaluated with Wishart based likelihood ratio and at a desired level of false classification the dense set of clusters is hierarchically pruned. Wishart based classification is then applied to the whole imagery, accomplishing a physical-based unsupervised classification algorithm. The algorithm is illustrated using an AIRSAR dataset of San Francisco to evaluate its capability in characterizing complex terrains. As an optional step, the K-Means or Expectation-Maximization iteration is performed to further adapt the cluster centers.

MAPPING FOREST STANDS USING RADARSAT-2 QUAD-POLARIZATION SARIMAGES: A COMBINATION OF POLARIMETRIC AND SPATIAL INFORMATION	2012 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 22-27, 2012	Munich, GERMANY	IEEE, IEEE Geosci & Remote Sensing Soc, DLR, ESA		Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar; image classification; Foresty	CLASSIFICATION	This study proposes an approach which simultancously uses spatial information and polarimetric data from a RADARSAT-2 quad-polarization satellite image for forest tree species classification. The study area is near the Gounamitz River located in northwestern New Brunswick (Canada). After geometric correction of the image, two statistical models were used for the classification: (1) a Markov random fields model based on an initial segmentation provided by the K-means algorithm to account for the spatial statistical dependencies between adjacent sites; and (2) a K-distribution model with, as parameters, the covariance matrix containing all of the polarimetric information. The classification was optimized using the stochastic simulated anncaling algorithm. Validation of the results was performed by comparison with field inventory measurements. Variation of the backscattering coefficient sigma degrees obtained for the RADARSAT-2 quad-polarization SAR image with incidence angles of 26 degrees and 45 degrees ranged from 1 and 3 dB for the different tree species. The results of average and ovarall accuracies of the classification were respectively 77.13% and 72.35% for the 26 degrees incidence angle image compared to 81.47% and 79.12% for the 45 degrees incidence angle.

A first step in this work is segmenting the images in regions that represent, as close as possible, cartographic entities (e. g., roads, buildings, vegetation). Region-Growing segmentation is implemented in a multispectral image using an open source programming language. This segmentation method is analyzed for land used and land cover applications, and it is compared with classification-based segmentation, known as Fuzzy K-Means. Both algorithms, Region Growing and Fuzzy K-Means, are run in an aerial image with four spectral bands (red, green, blue, and near infrared). Depending on the scale, the values of the parameters of the algorithms can yield an under segmentation or over segmentation results. Advantages and disadvantages of both segmentation methods are provided.	[Rodriguez-Cuenca, B.; Malpica, J. A.; Alonso, M.

Our new proposal relies on an existing strategy for non-linear data modelling where a general non-linear model is approximated via several piece-wise linear models. The algorithm is the result of hybridizing two well-known strategies for exploratory high-dimensional data analysis: cluster analysis and non-negative matrix factorization. It has been proposed to answer the limitations of global linear unmixing models which are widely used for spectral unmixing. Our strategy is to first group similar pixels from the hyperspctral image via cluster analysis and then to consider a local linear unmixing model for each cluster in order to obtain the constituent endmembers. Subsequently, the resulted local endmembers from each cluster of mixed pixels are at their turn clustered based on their spectral similarity; the final solution is given by the clusters' centroids.

This paper depicts the impact of constant parameters such as Harmony Memory Consideration Rate and Pitch Adjusting Rate, and presents an approach for parameter tuning. It presents modifications in existing harmony search, by choosing appropriate values of these two parameters and allows them to change dynamically during the process of improvisation. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated for data clustering on five benchmark datasets. The clustering performance of proposed algorithm is compared with K-Means, Genetic algorithm, HS and improved version of HS. Experimental results reveal that proposed algorithm provides better results than the above said techniques in terms of precision, recall, G-Measure, inter-cluster and intra-cluster distance.

In this study, we propose a novel heuristics for clustering news headlines. News headlines are grammatically and semantically different from larger bodies of text, like blog posts and reviews. Based on the heuristics, we implemented versions of the frequent term-based and frequent noun-based clustering algorithms. Both these algorithms, along with k-means, regular frequent term and frequent noun clustering were evaluated using five datasets - Reuters343, Reuters2388 (news headlines), CICLing-2002, Hep-ex and KnCr (scientific abstracts). On interpreting the results based on common external cluster quality evaluation measures (purity, entropy and F measure), it was found that the heuristics performed at par with, or even better than, traditional clustering algorithms and few other intuitive algorithms, when tested using the datasets comprising of news headlines. However, on using the datasets comprising of scientific abstracts, the results were not favorable. (C) 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A prototype-based modified DBSCAN for gene clustering	2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION, COMPUTING & SECURITY [ICCCS-2012]	Procedia Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Communication, Computing and Security (ICCCS)	OCT 06-08, 2012	Rourkela, INDIA	Natl Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn		Clustering; gene expression data; DBSCAN; squared error method; prototype	ALGORITHM	In this paper, we propose, a novel DBSCAN method to cluster the gene expression data. The main problem of DBSCAN is its quadratic computational complexity. We resolve this drawback by using the prototypes produced from a squared error clustering method such as K-means. Then, the DBSCAN technique is applied efficiently using these prototypes. In our algorithm, during the iterations of DBSCAN, if a point from an uncovered prototype is assigned to a cluster, then all the other points of such prototype belongs to the same cluster. We have carried out excessive experiments on various two dimensional artificial and multi-dimensional biological data. The proposed technique is compared with few existing techniques. It is observed that proposed algorithm outperforms the existing methods. (C) 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Its diagnostic accuracy is relatively low and there is not a biomarker able to detect AD without invasive tests. This study is a new approach to obtained electroencephalogram (EEG) temporal events in order to improve the AD diagnosis. For that, K-means were used and the results suggested that there are sequences of EEG energy variation that appear more frequently in AD patients than in Health subject.

We use the Kuiper test, similar to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, to compare the cumulative distributions of chosen observables of detected radio pulsars with those simulated for various parameters. Our code simulates pulsars at birth using Monte Carlo techniques and evolves them to the present assuming initial spatial, kick velocity, magnetic field, and period distributions. Pulsars are spun down to the present, given radio and gamma-ray emission characteristics, filtered through ten selected radio surveys, and a Fermi all-sky threshold map. Each chain begins with a different random seed and searches a ten-dimensional parameter space for regions of high probability for a total of one thousand different simulations before ending. The code investigates both the "large world" as well as the "small world" of the parameter space. We apply the K-meanS clustering algorithm to verify if the chains reveal a single or multiple regions of significance. The outcome of the combined set of chains is the weighted average and deviation of each of the ten parameters describing the model. While the model reproduces reasonably well the detected distributions of normal radio pulsars, it does not replicate the predicted detected (P)over dot - P distribution of Fermi pulsars. The simulations do not produce sufficient numbers of young, high-E pulsars in the Galactic plane.

Leaf shapes are classified from the macro and micro perspectives respectively. In the macro perspective, influential factors on leaf shapes, such as ground diameter, breast diameter, etc., are used as variables to carry out K-means clustering analysis for classification on leaf shapes. In the micro perspective, 40 influential leaf structure factors on leaf shapes are extracted and analyzed by factor analysis and a second K-means clustering. After comparing clustering result with actual classification result, misjudgment probability is found to be very low. In the second part, snowflake model theory is proposed; the growth process of a tree is simulated. Through statistics, the number of leaves growing on smallest branches is not so different to each other. After calculating the number of smallest branches through programming, the total number of leaves could be calculated out.

On the other hand, we use K-means cluster analysis to determine the center of class, which make the study more scientific and rigorous. In aspect of determining order, we find the best order by using the third criterion for judgment of order, which makes error less, makes precision of forecasting higher.

Network Anomaly Detection by Cascading K-Means Clustering and C4.5 Decision Tree algorithm	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEM DESIGN 2011	Procedia Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Communication Technology and System Design	DEC 07-09, 2011	Coimbatore, INDIA			Anomaly detection; C4.5 decision tree; k - Means clustering		Intrusions pose a serious securing risk in a network environment. Network intrusion detection system aims to identify attacks or malicious activity in a network with a high detection rate while maintaining a low false alarm rate. Anomaly detection systems (ADS) monitor the behaviour of a system and flag significant deviations from the normal activity as anomalies. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection method using "K-Means + C4.5", a method to cascade k-Means clustering and the C4.5 decision tree methods for classifying anomalous and normal activities in a computer network. The k-Means clustering method is first used to partition the training instances into k clusters using Euclidean distance similarity. On each cluster, representing a density region of normal or anomaly instances, we build decision trees using C4.5 decision tree algorithm. The decision tree on each cluster refines the decision boundaries by learning the subgroups within the cluster. To obtain a final conclusion we exploit the results derived from the decision tree on each cluster. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Extraction of Motif Patterns from Protein Sequence Using Rough- K-Means Algorithm	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEM DESIGN 2011	Procedia Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Communication Technology and System Design	DEC 07-09, 2011	Coimbatore, INDIA			Clustering; Motif; Protein Sequence; HSSP; DSSP; HSSP-BLOSUM62	DATABASE	Bioinformatics is the application of computer technology to the management of biological information. In Bioinformatics, Motif finding is one of the most popular problems, which has many applications. It is the process of locating the meaningful patterns in the sequence of Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid (DNA), Ribo Nucleic Acid (RNA) or Proteins. Motifs vary in lengths, positions, redundancy, orientation and bases. Finding these short sequences (motifs or signals) is a fundamental problem in molecular biology and computer science with important applications such as knowledge-based drug design, forensic DNA analysis, and agricultural biotechnology. In this work, the clustering system is used to predict local protein sequence Motifs. Since clustering algorithms can provide an automatic, unsupervised discovery process for sequence motifs, the K-Means clustering algorithm and Rough-K-means algorithm proposed are chosen as the motif discovery method for this study and the results are compared. The structural similarity of the clusters discovered by the proposed approach is studied to analyze how the recurring patterns correlate with its structure. Also, some biochemical references are included in our evaluation. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Novel Hybrid PSO-SA Model for Biclustering of Expression Data	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEM DESIGN 2011	Procedia Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Communication Technology and System Design	DEC 07-09, 2011	Coimbatore, INDIA			data mining; biclustering; gene expression data; simulated annealing; particle swarm optimization; Average Correlation Value	BIOLOGICAL DATA	Uncovering genetic pathways is equivalent to finding clusters of genes with expression levels that evolve coherently under subsets of conditions. Conventional clustering approaches like K-Means, heuristic biclustering approaches like Greedy Algorithms, meta-heuristic biclustering approaches like Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing or Particle Swarm Optimization may not be specific enough to find correlations between genes in an appropriate manner, as each of the algorithms has its own merits and demerits. In this paper, a hybrid PSO-SA BIClustering algorithm namely PSO-SA-BIC that combines features of binary PSO with Simulated Annealing has been proposed in order to extract biclusters of gene expression data. A novel fitness function, based on ACV has been used to identify shifting pattern and scaling pattern biclusters. Experimental results on bench mark datasets show that PSO-SA-BIC algorithm is outperforming the classical algorithms by providing statistically significant biclusters.

The methodology for selecting the characteristic days is presented. For classifications with different number of similar day clusters the air-quality directive limit and target values for SO2 are calculated from CALMET/CALPUFF model simulations performed for representative days. These results are compared with target and limit values assessed from results of simulations performed over the entire one year time period. Results show that especially the annual average and hourly maximum fields can be assessed from characteristic days, but it cannot be assured that certain classification with selected characteristic days will provide accurate results.

Many intrusion detection system (IDS) have been developed in recent past which are based on either signature information or anomaly information. But all these systems do generate a lot of false detections. In this work a hybrid IDS is being proposed which uses the signature and anomaly information together. The proposed algorithm first explore those traffic features which are changing during an intrusion activity and then based on a predefined threshold value the most prominent features related to attack are identified. Thereafter, these features are included in snort rule set to detect the anomalous traffic. This anomaly detection process is combined with existing signature of snort to produce the better detection. The proposed detection algorithm has been implemented on KDDcup99 dataset. It is observed through experimental results that the proposed algorithm efficiently detect the intrusion activity in the given network.	[Arya, K.

Field traffic surveys are carried out to capture the classified volume and speed data through manual as well as videographic technique. Multi regime speed flow relation is developed based on the 5-min data extracted from the field survey. Unobserved data is simulated by artificial neural network model. Thresholds of level of service based on volume to capacity ratio are established by cluster analysis approach. The results are very useful for evaluation of traffic quality for access controlled urban arterials in mixed traffic condition. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Pathologists stain tissue biopsies with various colored dyes to see the expression of biomarkers. In these images, because of color variation due to inconsistencies in experimental procedures and lighting conditions, the segmentation used to analyze biological features is usually ad-hoc. Many algorithms like K-means use a single metric to segment the image into different color classes and rarely provide users with powerful color control. Our 2D color map interactive segmentation technique based on human color perception information and the color distribution of the input image, enables user control without noticeable delay. Our methodology works for different staining types and different types of cancer tissue images.

The paper proposed a method to semi-automatically segment the left ventricle (LV) boundaries from a stack of cine MRI and build a LV mesh. The different intensities in the MRI are modeled with the mixture of Gaussian method. The thresholds between them are semi-automatically determined by K-means initialization and the expectation maximization (EM) method. The spatial constrain is added into the model with active contour models, which fit explicit contours on the boundary of the area of interest. We propose a marching cube alike initialization method of the active contour models. A 3D mesh is built from a stack of contours and smoothed afterwards. Stroke volume, myocardium mass and ejection function can be estimated from the LV boundary mesh and the endocardium mesh.

This paper presents an algorithm for prevention forest fire disaster based on digital image processing technology. The algorithm distinguishes the realtime forest video by smoke and fire. To determine whether there are some suspicious area in the image in the spatial domain by judging the color properties of smoke and fire through Clustering Algorithm. If it detects any suspicious circumstances, then fixes ccd and detects the suspicious areas in the time domain. In this step, firstly get the initial detect results by wavelet decomposition, then use the k-means clustering algorithm for the spread detection of smoke. Experimental results show that the algorithm is ideal for the experimental video. It alarms before the fire disaster occurs to avoid major fire disaster, which protects the forest resources in the Poyang Lake Ecological Economic Zone.

Information extraction is the prerequisite of remote sensing image segmentation, which is the key procedure of image analysis. In this paper hard C-means and fuzzy C-means is adopted for segmentation in remote sensing image to realize our road extraction. Firstly, we proposed k-means for image segmentation using non-supervised clustering, and we can achieve our aim finally. Meanwhile, SVM combined with Fuzzy C means was proposed and this model was implemented in remote sensing image segmentation to extract the road net. Finally the comparison with two proposed algorithm was carried out, and after experiment, SVM plus FCM model is much more accurate than k-means.

Collaborative filtering(CF) is one of the most important technologies. However, traditional collaborative filtering suffers sparsity and scalability problems, which results in poor quality of prediction in recommendation systems. To solve these problems, this paper proposed a recommendation algorithm combining clustering method and slope one scheme. This approach uses clustering algorithms to partition the set of items to several clusters based on user rating data, and then we use slope one scheme to predict ratings independently for unknown items based on which cluster the items belong to. We make experiments on the standard benchmark Movielens data sets and compare our approach with the basic slope one scheme. The results show that our algorithm outperforms the slope one scheme.

The factors strongly affecting the flow boiling have been assumed as the inputs, such as mass flux (G), heat flux (q), quality (x), saturation temperature (T-sat) and tube inner diameter (D). At the same time, the flow boiling heat transfer coefficient (h) as the output. The K-means clustering algorithm is applied to design RBF network. In addition, the prediction results is significantly improved compared with the four frequently used conventional correlations. For the network model of heat transfer, the average deviation, absolute average and root-mean-square deviations are -0.9%, 5.5% and 10.9%, respectively. Hence, the simulation results prove that the model based on RBF neural network is feasible to forecast the flow boiling heat transfer coefficient of R407C, and optimization design evaporators used R407C.

In this paper, the problem of visually similar image retrieval has been investigated. For this task we use the methods derived from the Bag of Visual Words approach, such as Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for identifying image keypoints and K-means to build a visual dictionary. To create a ranking of similar images, a novel Ranking by K-means Voting algorithm is proposed. The experimental section shows that our method works well for similar image retrieval. It turned out that our results are more accurate in comparison with a classical similarity measure based on the Euclidean metric in the order of 6% - 15%.

This paper describes an advisory system that recommends fault tolerance techniques considering specified development and runtime application attributes. In the selection process, we use the K-means clustering algorithm to identify similarities between known fault tolerance techniques to select those ones that are possibly different, but simultaneously conform to developer specification. As a part of the research, we implemented a web-based system that covers definition of attributes, aggregates knowledge about fault tolerance techniques together, and implements the advisory algorithm.

In this article, a hybrid recognition approach is presented that classifies radar emitter signals by exploiting the different separability of samples. The proposed approach comprises two steps, i.e., the primary signal recognition and the advanced signal recognition. In the former step, the rough k-means classifier is proposed to cluster the samples of radar emitter signals by using the rough set theory. In the latter step, the samples within the rough boundary are used to train the support vector machine (SVM). Then SVM is used to recognize the samples in the uncertain area; therefore, the classification accuracy is improved. Simulation results show that, for recognizing radar emitter signals, the proposed hybrid recognition approach is more accurate, and has a lower time complexity than the traditional approaches.

Methods: A questionnaire form prepared by the researchers in light of the related literature was used in the present cross-sectional study which was carried out on students taking education in high schools providing education and training in Sivrihisar town center. The questionnaire included 41 questions regarding the students' first aid knowledge level in addition to the sociodemographic characteristics of them. Each correct answer was scored as 1 point. The first aid knowledge level was evaluated on the basis of scores obtained from the answers to knowledge-based questions. The scores of the students were divided into two clusters by K-Means clustering, followed by ROC Analysis based on these cluster features. A score of 19.5 or above in ROC analysis was classified as "adequate knowledge" about first aid. Results: The scores of the students from knowledge component of the questionnaire ranged from 0 to 38 points, the mean score was 22.13 +/- 6.89 points and 70.3% (n=751) of the students had an adequate level of first aid knowledge. The first aid knowledge was significantly more adequate in girls than boys. There were no differences between the age groups; however the students in the 12th class, those from nuclear families, those with an adequate income level, and the students whose paternal education level was at the secondary school level or above had a more adequate knowledge level. Conclusion: The present study determined a fairly adequate level of first aid knowledge among the students. To maintain this knowledge level and to give accurate first aid information at an earlier age, it would be appropriate to provide training on first aid in the schools.

These ants have a simple but efficient prey search strategy: when they capture their prey, they return straight to their nest, drop off the prey and systematically return back to their original position. This behavior has already been applied to optimization, as the API meta-heuristic. API is a shortage of api-calis. Here, we combine API with the ability of ants to sort and cluster. We provide a comparison against Ant clustering Algorithm and K-Means using Machine Learning repository datasets. API introduces new concepts to ant-based models and gives us promising results.

Clustering analysis is the major application area of data mining where Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) is being widely implemented due to its simplicity and efficiency. When compared with techniques like K-means, Fuzzy C-means, K-Harmonic means and other traditional clustering approaches, in general, the PSO algorithm produces better results with reference to inter-cluster and intra-cluster distances, while having quantization errors comparable to the other algorithms. In recent times, many hybrid algorithms with PSO as one of the techniques have been developed to harness the strong points of PSO and increase its efficiency and accuracy. This paper provides an extensive review of the variants and hybrids of PSO which are being widely used for the purpose of clustering analysis.

Segmentation of Diffuse Reflectance Hyperspectral Datasets with Noise for Detection of Melanoma	2012 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	34th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 28-SEP 01, 2012	San Diego, CA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS), CAS, SMC, PubMed, MEDLINE			COMPONENT ANALYSIS; DIAGNOSIS; CANCER	We present a segmentation algorithm that allows optical properties to be extracted from diffuse reflectance hyper-spectral datasets with a speedup of three orders of magnitude when compared to current methods. Such data could be used for the detection of melanoma. The algorithm first performs dimensionality reduction using principal component analysis, and then the image is segmented using k-means clustering. The mean spectrum from each cluster is then calculated and can be used to extract chemical information. By reducing the number of spectra to be analyzed, extraction of physiological information can be achieved three orders of magnitude faster than methods requiring the analysis of every spectrum in the hyperspectral dataset. The effect of noise on the ability of the algorithm to accurately segment images was tested using digital phantoms, for which the noise level was under the control of the investigators. The analysis showed a linear relationship between the level of noise and the smallest difference in scattering that the algorithm was able to accurately detect and segment. This finding can be used to determine the maximum amount of noise in the imaging system that will still allow detection of the difference in optical properties between non-melanoma and melanoma.

It also proposes a new approach for detecting the occurrence of heartbeats from ballistocardiogram (BCG) signals through the use of the k-means clustering algorithm, based on finding the location of the J-peaks. Preliminary testing showed that the new transducer arrangement was able to capture the occurrence of heartbeats for all the participants, and the clustering approach achieved correct heartbeat detection ranging from 98.6 to 100% for three of them. Some considerations are discussed regarding adjustments that can be done in order to increase the correct detection of heartbeats for the participant whose percentage of correct detection ranged from 71.0 to 92.5%.

In this study, the application of acoustical analysis in detecting silent aspiration is investigated. We recorded the swallowing and the breath sounds of 10 individuals with swallowing disorders, who demonstrated silent aspiration during the fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) assessment. We analyzed the power spectral density (PSD) of the breath sound signals following each swallow; the PSD showed higher magnitude at low frequencies for the breath sounds following an aspiration. Therefore, we divided the frequency range below 300 Hz into 3 sub-bands, over which we calculated the average power as the characteristic features for the classification purpose. Then, the fuzzy k-means unsupervised classification method was deployed to find the two clusters in the data set: the aspirated and non-aspirated groups. The results were evaluated using the FEES assessments provided by the speech language pathologists. The results show 82.3% accuracy in detecting swallows with silent aspiration. Although the proposed method should be verified on a larger dataset, the results are promising for the use of acoustical analysis as a clinical tool to detect silent aspiration.

To this end, two different cases are considered: nonaligned original recordings and aligned signals according to P300 position. For latter case, a novel approach to conduct time location of P300 component is introduced, which is based on derivative of event-related potential signals. The used database holds event-related potentials registered in auditory and visual oddball paradigm. Several experiments are carried out testing both configurations of considered data matrix. For grouping input data matrices, the k-means clustering technique is employed. To assess the quality of formed clusters and the relevance for clustering of latency-based features, relative values of distances between centroids and data points are computed in order to apprise separability and compactness of estimated clusters. Experimental results show that time localization of P300 component is not a decisive feature in formation of compact and well-defined groups within a discrimination framework for two considered data classes under certain conditions.

Decomposition of Intramuscular EMG Signals Using a Knowledge -based Certainty Classifier Algorithm	2012 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)	IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	34th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 28-SEP 01, 2012	San Diego, CA	IEEE, Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS), CAS, SMC, PubMed, MEDLINE				An automated system for resolving an intramuscular electromyographic (EMG) signal into its constituent motor unit potential trains (MUPTs) is presented. The system is intended mainly for clinical applications where several physiological parameters for each motor unit (MU), such as the motor unit potential (MUP) template and mean firing rate, are required. The system decomposes an EMG signal off-line by filtering the signal, detecting MUPs, and then grouping the detected MUPs using a clustering and a supervised classification algorithm. Both the clustering and supervised classification algorithms use MUP shape and MU firing pattern information to group MUPs into several MUPTs. Clustering is partially based on the K-means clustering algorithm. Supervised classification is implemented using a certainty-based classifier technique that employs a knowledge-based system to merge trains, detect and correct invalid trains, as well as adjust the assignment threshold for each train. The accuracy (93.2%+/- 5.5%), assignment rate (93.9%+/- 2.6%), and error in estimating the number of MUPTs (0.3 +/- 0.5) achieved for 10 simulated EMG signals comprised of 3-11 MUPTs are encouraging for using the system for decomposing various EMG signals.

In order to achieve this it is required to convert these educational resources into Learning Objects and store them in structured & meaningful way via a learning management system (LMS) thus enriching classical teaching. Also with enhancement of e-learning environment there is a great need of managing the LMS repositories by storing information resources as Learning object, a digital entity which can be used in electronic learning environment. These learning objects are stored in repositories and are managed by Learning Management Systems. It aids teaching and learning process and helps in communications between users. Many designs of LMS are non user-centric and has limited capabilities in delivering user preferred learning material. Searching through keywords or metadata of learning material will result in display of huge quantity of information. Thus there is an earnest need to identify the techniques that can provide more efficient mechanism for information retrieval. Recommendation techniques have shown to be successful in many domains (e. g. movies, books, music, etc.). Thus there is a need to deploy a recommending system in the E-Learning domain to extend the functionality of standard-based learning management systems with providing the user based retrieval. In this paper a model is being proposed that can enhance the search and delivery of a relevant learning object based on his/her preferences and further ranking & clustering of learning objects are done through K-Mean and Self Organising Maps for a personalised learning environment.

Robust Haar classifiers technique is used for face detection from an image. Since illumination variations lie in low frequency DCT coefficients, illumination variations is removed from detected face by rescaling down an appropriate number of low frequency DCT coefficients while still preserving important facial features. Further, since, important facial features are concentrated in small number of DCT coefficients, face feature vector is generated by discarding high frequency coefficients. K-means clustering is employed to reduce search space complexity. Face recognition is performed by comparing feature vector of test image with feature vector of images in the closest matching cluster using Euclidean distance. Experimental results on Yale database, Caltech database, IMM database and Extended Yale face database B show that the proposed approach improves face recognition rate upto 100% along with significantly reduced search space complexity and low computational cost. Equal error rate (EER) is acquired by plotting false acceptance rate (FAR) and false reject rate (FRR) against different threshold values.

J	Li, PP; Wu, XD; Hu, XG				Li, Peipei; Wu, Xindong; Hu, Xuegang			Mining Recurring Concept Drifts with Limited Labeled Streaming Data	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Algorithms; Experimentation; Data stream; concept drift; decision tree; clustering	CLASSIFIERS; CONTEXTS; ENSEMBLE	Tracking recurring concept drifts is a significant issue for machine learning and data mining that frequently appears in real-world stream classification problems. It is a challenge for many streaming classification algorithms to learn recurring concepts in a data stream environment with unlabeled data, and this challenge has received little attention from the research community. Motivated by this challenge, this article focuses on the problem of recurring contexts in streaming environments with limited labeled data. We propose a semi-supervised classification algorithm for data streams with REcurring concept Drifts and Limited LA-beled data, called REDLLA, in which a decision tree is adopted as the classification model. When growing a tree, a clustering algorithm based on k-means is installed to produce concept clusters and unlabeled data are labeled in the method of majority-class at leaves. In view of deviations between history and new concept clusters, potential concept drifts are distinguished and recurring concepts are maintained. Extensive studies on both synthetic and real-world data confirm the advantages of our REDLLA algorithm over three state-of-the-art online classification algorithms of CVFDT, DWCDS, and CDRDT and several known online semi-supervised algorithms, even in the case with more than 90% unlabeled data.

Mammographic screening has been shown to be effective in reducing mortality rates by 30%-70%. In the analysis of Mammography images using Computer-Aided Diagnosis, Segmentation stage is one of the most Significant step, since it affects the accuracy of the Feature Extraction & Classification. In this paper, Rough k-means approach is used for segmentation of tumor from breast parenchyma. Pixel objects which definitely belong to the tumor region are classified under lower approximation, where as objects which possibly belong to the same are categorized as upper approximation. The difference of upper and lower approximation will result with objects in the rough boundaries. The segmentation algorithm has been verified on Mammo-grams from Mias database and the CICRI database. (Central India Cancer Research Institute, Nagpur, India). Geometrical and Textural features were calculated for segmented region. Once the features were computed for each region of interest (ROT), they are used as inputs to Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for classification as Benign or Malignant. Results of Rough k-means segmentation were compared with Otsu method of segmentation using ANN. Results indicate that Rough k-means method performs better than Otsu method in terms of classification accuracy up to 95% and can also reduces the number of biopsies required in the diagnostic process.

In this paper, graph-based consensus clustering, Cluster-based Similarity Partitioning Algorithm (CSPA), was used to improve the quality of chemical structures clustering by enhancing the ability to separate active from inactive molecules in each cluster and improve the robustness and stability of individual clusterings. The clustering was evaluated using Quality Partition Index (QPI) measure and the results were compared with the Ward's clustering method. The chemical dataset MDL Drug Data Report (MDDR) database was used for experiments. The results obtained by combining multiple K-means clusterings showed that graph-based consensus clustering, CSPA, can improve the quality of individual chemical structure clusterings.

The perception of the color depends on the devices used to show the colors and it changes with the color transformation between one device and another. This paper proposes an optimization of the Compactly-Supported Radial Basis Functions (CSRBF) space mapping to minimize the error in the color conversion between the system and the printer color spaces. A clustering k-means method is used to select the representative data in the printer color space to reproduce the whole space with high accuracy. The calculation of optimized CSRBF parameters using the representative data is proposed to minimize the color difference between the predicted CSRBF color value and the printed color value of all data in the printer color space. Proposed optimization method finds the optimized CSRBF parameters values and the optimal weighting parameters for color differences evaluation.

However, a full connected graph used in KL clustering may not be appropriate to indicate the similarity relations between the data points. This paper has improved the KL clustering with sparse graphs constructed by b-matching method and sparse representation. The b-matching graph, in which each node has strictly b neighbors, is more regular than KNN (K nearest neighbors) graph. Graph constructed by sparse representation (11 graph) also has many merits such as sparsity and datum-adaptive neighborhoods. Hence the improved KL clustering with the constructed graphs has more attractive properties than the classic KL clustering. The experiments on the benchmark datasets (COIL-20 and MNIST) show the effectiveness of the improved KL clustering with promising results.

The stock price sequence is truncated to charts by sliding window. Then the charts are clustered by K-Means algorithm to form chart patterns. Therefore, the charts form chart pattern sequences, and frequent patterns in the sequences can be extracted by AprioriAll algorithm. The existence of frequent patterns implies that some specific market behaviors often show accompanied, thus the corresponding trend can be predicted. Experiment results show that the proposed system can produce better index return with fewer trade. Its annualized return is also better than award winning mutual funds. Therefore, the proposed method makes profits on the real market, even in a long-term usage.

Fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory (Fuzzy ART) is a kind of unsupervised neural networks that learns training data until satisfying a given need. In the learning process, weights of categories are changed to adapt to noisy inputs. In other words, learning process decides the quality of clustering. Thus, updating weights of categories is an important step of learning process. We propose a new effective learning rule for Fuzzy ART to improve clustering. Our learning rule modifies weights of categories based on the ratio of the input to the weight of chosen category and a learning rate. The learning rate presents the speed of increasing/decreasing the weight of chosen category. It is changed by the following rule: the number of inputs is larger, value is smaller. We have conducted experiments on ten typical datasets to prove the effectiveness of our novel model. Result from experiments shows that our novel model clusters better than existing models, including Original Fuzzy ART, Complement Fuzzy ART, K-mean algorithm, Euclidean ART.

The main idea is to define k initial seeds, one for each cluster. At each loop, the reassignment step of documents into the nearest center's group is followed by the calculation step of the center of each cluster. No changes as a result of a loop mean the end of this algorithm. But, the different initial seeds cause different result. So, the better choice is to place them as far away as possible from each other. We propose a new method of selecting initial centers in K-Means clustering. This method uses triangle height for initial centers of clusters. After that, the centers are distributed evenly and that result is more accurate than initial cluster centers selected random. It is time-consuming, but can reduce total clustering time by minimizing the number of allocation and recalculation. We can reduce the time spent on total clustering.

We use 3D human pose data as additional information and propose a compact human pose representation, called a weak pose, in a low-dimensional space while still keeping the most discriminative information for a given pose. With predicted poses from image features, we map the problem from image feature space to pose space, where a Bag of Poses (BOP) model is learned for the final goal of HAR. The BOP model is a modified version of the classical bag of words pipeline by building the vocabulary based on the most representative weak poses for a given action. Compared with the standard k-means clustering, our vocabulary selection criteria is proven to be more efficient and robust against the inherent challenges of action recognition. Moreover, since for action recognition the ordering of the poses is discriminative, the BOP model incorporates temporal information: in essence, groups of consecutive poses are considered together when computing the vocabulary and assignment. We tested our method on two well-known datasets: HumanEva and IXMAS, to demonstrate that weak poses aid to improve action recognition accuracies. The proposed method is scene-independent and is comparable with the state-of-art method.

Four clustering algorithms - hierarchical, K-means, subtractive clustering, and fuzzy C-means clustering - were used to obtain the optimum number of clusters based on the mean silhouette coefficient and R-value before applying the fuzzy clustering algorithms. The best-fit algorithms were selected according to two criteria: precision (root mean square, R-value, mean absolute errors, and sum of square error) and response time (t). The highest R-value was obtained for the multi-layer perceptron (0.89), demonstrating that the multi-layer perceptron had a high precision in traffic crash prediction among the prediction models, and that it was stable even in the presence of outliers and overlapping data. Meanwhile, in comparison with other prediction models, fuzzy subtractive clustering provided the lowest value for response time (0.284 second), 9.28 times faster than the time of multi-layer perceptron, meaning that it could lead to developing an on-line system for processing data from detectors and/or a real-time traffic database. The model can be extended through improvements based on additional data through induction procedure.

This paper presents normalized cuts graph partitioning approach for liver segmentation from CT images. To evaluate the performance of the presented approach, we present tests on different liver CT images. Experimental results obtained show that the overall accuracy offered by the employed normalized cuts technique is high compared to the well known K-means segmentation approach.

Hebbian learning process and K-mean clustering algorithm are integrated in the Time Domain (TD) of scheduling architecture, to intelligently allocate available radio resources to Real Time (RT) and Non Real Time (NRT) traffic, and to prioritise RT users based on their Packet Drop Rate (PDR) feedback. The integration of these algorithms allows just enough resource allocation to RT traffic and diverts extra resources to NRT traffic, to fulfill its minimum throughput requirements. System level simulation is set up for system level performance evaluation. Simulation results show that the proposed architecture reduces average delay, delay violation probability and average Packet Drop Rate (PDR) of RT traffic while guaranteeing the support of minimum throughput to NRT traffic and maintains system throughput at good level.

Radio Propagation Modeling in Indoor Stairwell: A K-Means Clustering Approach	2012 IEEE ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION SOCIETY INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM (APSURSI)	IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Antennas and Propagation	JUL 08-14, 2012	Chicago, IL	Inst Electr Electron Engineers, IEEE Antennas & Propaga Soc				The propagation characteristics in indoor stairwell differ from those of the conventional indoor signal propagation across different floors and hence, deserve independent scrutiny. In this work, the propagation characteristics in four indoor stairwells have been examined by means of extensive field measurements at two frequency bands - 2.4 and 5.8 GHz respectively. It has been found the values of the path loss exponent n for stairwell are higher than those for other indoor environments. More importantly, the standard deviation of the n-values are high, leading to less accurate propagation models. This paper proposes the use of K-means clustering for the path loss data and values of path loss exponent n of stairwells are subsequently computed. The newly-computed path loss exponents n are lowered and their standard deviation values are significantly reduced. The path loss characteristics are useful for understanding radio propagation in pico- or femto-cells that have great potential in increasing the capacity and reducing the operational cost for wireless communications systems.

Many algorithms can perform clustering in a simple and efficient manner, but have drawbacks, such as the lack of a way to automatically determine the optimal number of clusters in the dataset and the possibility of getting stuck in local optima solutions. To try and reduce these drawbacks this work proposes a new clustering algorithm based on Artificial Immune Systems. This algorithm is characterized by the generation of multiple simultaneous high quality solutions in terms of the number of clusters in the database and the use of a cost function that explicitly evaluates the quality of clusters, minimizing the inconvenience of getting stuck in local optima solutions.

This paper presents an Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) based image clustering method to find clusters of an image where the number of clusters is specified. The proposed method is applied to three benchmark images and the performance of it is analysed by comparing the results of K-means and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms. The comprehensive results demonstrate both analytically and visually that ABC algorithm can be successfully applied to image clustering.

Our proposed GA-KM is a hybrid method that combines a genetic algorithm (GA) and K-means (KM) algorithm, and MPSO-KM is also a hybrid method that combines a momentum-type particle swarm optimization (MPSO) and K-means algorithm. The functions of GA-KM or MPSO-KM are to determine the optimal weights of attributes and cluster centers of clusters that are needed to classify the disease dataset. The dataset, used in this study, includes 13 attributes with 270 instances, which are the data records of cardiac disease. A comparative study is conducted by using C5, Nave Bayes, K-means, GA-KM and MPSO-KM to evaluate the accuracy of presented algorithms. Our experiments indicate that the clustering accuracy of cardiac disease dataset is significantly improved by using GA-KM and MPSO-KM when compared to that of using K-means only.

The proposed method is developed as an artificial immune system (AIS) which considers the influence of the immunomodulator (AISI), specifically, hormone concentration. The concept of hormone concentration is inducted into current AIS to adjust its decision making based on both large and small scale viewpoints. B-cells and antibodies are used to deal with small-scale responses because of the characteristics to neutralize high affinity antigens in a certain range. By contrast, the hormone concentration inception is associated with probability matrix has more advantages on large-scale responses. After testing on four databases, the proposed AISI system offered better overall performances to compare with the original AIS and the ant K-means (AK) system.

The purpose of this research is to propose a methodology for designing the RFID network planning problem (RNP) for application in the Mackay Memorial Hospital in Hsinchu, Taiwan. In this study, the RFID network is first considered as a grid and divided into several small squares. A soft computing methodology called FKB-SSO is proposed to solve the RNP problem based on simplified swarm optimization (SSO) by integrating k-means, fuzzy adaptive resonance theory (fuzzy-ART), and binary search. The proposed FKB-SSO will provide the basis for strategic decisions in constructing the RFID network to reduce the number of RFID readers with a minimal budget under the constraint of 100% coverage rate. The proposed FKB-SSO is more efficient than PSO and experts' manual solution in both run time and solution quality.

A major obstacle for many clustering techniques is that they are computationally expensive, hence limited to smaller data volume and dimension. We propose a lightweight swarm clustering solution called Rapid Centroid Estimation (RCE). Based on our experiments, RCE has significantly quickened optimization time of its predecessors, Particle Swarm Clustering (PSC) and Modified Particle Swarm Clustering (mPSC). Our experimental results show that on benchmark datasets, RCE produces generally better clusters compared to PSC, mPSC, K-means and Fuzzy C-means. Compared with K-means and Fuzzy C-means which produces clusters with 62% and 55% purities on average respectively, thyroid dataset has successfully clustered on average 71% purity in 14.3 seconds.

The main advantage of MOSSC lies in the fact that it effectively integrates the merits of soft subspace clustering and the good properties of the multiobjective optimization-based approach for fuzzy clustering. This makes it possible to avoid trapping in local minima and thus obtain more stable clustering results. Substantial experimental results on both synthetic and real data sets demonstrate that MOSSC is generally effective in subspace clustering and can achieve superior performance over existing state-of-the-art soft subspace clustering algorithms.

Particularly, PSO is used as a global search to allow fast exploration of the candidate cluster centers. PSO has strong ability to find high quality solutions within tractable time, but it suffers from slow-down convergence as the swarm approaching optima. K-means, achieving fast convergence to optimum solutions, is utilized as local search to fine-tune the solutions of PSO in the framework of memetic algorithm. The performance of MCA is evaluated on four synthetic datasets and three high-dimensional gene expression datasets.

Applications of such technology include, but are not limited to, query-by-example search, spoken term detection and automatic word discovery. Obtaining content-aware acoustic features as independent as possible from speaker and acoustic environment variations is a key step in these algorithms. Currently, GMM posteriorgrams are found to outperform the standard MFCC features even though they were not designed to optimize the discrimination between acoustic classes. In this paper we combine the K-means clustering algorothm with the GMM posteriorgrams front-end to obtain more discriminant features. Results on a query-by-example task show that the proposed approaches outperform standard MFCC features by 7.8% absolute P@N and GMM-based posteriorgram features by 3.7% absolute P@N when using a 64-dimensional feature vector.

Expectation-Maximization leads to compact models but may be expensive to compute whereas Kernel Density Estimation yields to large models which are cheap to build. In this paper we present new methods to get high-quality models that are both compact and fast to compute. This is accomplished with clustering methods and centroids computation. The quality of the resulting mixtures is evaluated in terms of log-likelihood and Kullback-Leibler divergence using examples from a bioinformatics application.

A context refers to a group of pixels, that have similar correlations with its neighboring pixels. We propose to form a pixel's feature vector by its neighboring pixels' ratios, so that they better capture the pixel properties described by the regression weights. Then we use K-means clustering to classify the feature vectors of all pixels into several contexts. Clustering reduces pixel randomness within each context, thus reducing prediction error. We apply three regression algorithms, the least square, quantile and lasso regression, which assume different loss function and regularization. Experimental results demonstrate that all context based regression methods have outperformed conventional pixel predictors. Among them, quantile regression, which assumes l1-norm loss function has the best result. It has 3.1% less bits per pixel (bpp) than least square prediction with 12 neighboring pixels.

A crucial issue of spectral matting is to determine the number of matting components which has large impacts on the matting performance. In this paper, we propose an improved framework based on spectral matting in order to solve this limitation. Iterative K-means clustering with the assistance of the modularity measure is adopted to obtain the hard segmentation that can be used as the initial guess of soft matting components. The number of matting components can be determined automatically because the improved framework will search possible image components by iteratively dividing image subgraphs.

One way to achieve this is by dimension reduction via manifold-learning, such as Locally Linear Embedding [8]. While effective in improving retrieval accuracy, these algorithms have high computational cost that depends on feature dimensionality d and number of training samples N. In this paper, we explore a clustering-based approach to reduce number of training samples; it uses L cluster centers (L << N) computed from N input features as training samples. We propose to use extremely randomized clustering tree [3] for clustering. Experiments showed that the proposed approach produces better retrieval performance than random sampling, and that the randomized tree is much faster than the k-means algorithm.

The method is derived from kernel principal component analysis (kPCA). Instead of applying PCA in a high-dimensional feature space and then going back to the original input space by using a solution to the pre-image problem, only the pre-image step is applied for de-noising. We show that the de-noised audio sample is a convex combination of the noisy input data and that the resulting algorithm is closely related to the soft k-means algorithm. Compared to kPCA, this method reduces the computational costs while the audio quality is similar and speech quality measures do not degrade.

The classifier accepts or rejects the ASR hypothesis based on the confidence generated by the ASR system. In the proposed approach, training data is grouped into across-domain clusters and separate cluster-specific classifiers are trained. One of the main findings is that the cluster purity and the normalized mutual information of the clusters are not very high which suggests that the domains might not necessarily be natural clusters. The performance of these cluster-specific classifiers is better than that of: (a) a single classifier trained on data from all the domains, and (b) a set of classifiers trained separately for each of the training domains. At an operating point corresponding to low False Accept, the Correct Accept of the proposed technique is on an average 2.3% higher than that obtained by the single-classifier or the individual train-domain classifiers.

We propose a new method that is based on the kernel K-means clustering and the SKPCA approach to tackle the above problem. Here kernel K-means clustering is to divide all the frames of each sample into a given amount of clusters; the resulted clustering centers are used as the input samples for the SKPCA since they can represent better the clusters they belong to. This method reduced store and compute complexity, it guarantee to reduced data well represent the original data and Information is lost minimum.

It is very popular and widely used for its simplicity and fastness. The main drawback of this algorithm is that user should specify the number of cluster in advance. As an iterative clustering strategy, K-Means algorithm is very sensitive to the initial starting conditions. In this paper, we propose a clustering technique called MaxD K-Means clustering algorithm. MaxD K-Means algorithm auto generates initial k (the desired number of cluster) without asking for input from the user. MaxD K-means also used a novel strategy of setting the initial centroids. The experiment of the Max-D means has been conducted using synthetic data, which is taken from the Llyod's K-Means experiments. The results from the new algorithm show that the number of iteration improves tremendously, and the number of iterations is reduced by confirming an improvement rate is up to 78%.

Rodents sense and explore the environment through whisking. The local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the barrel columns of the rat somatosensory cortex during whisking provide information about the tactile information processing pathway. Particularly when large-scale high-resolution neuronal probes are used, during each experiment many single LFPs are recorded as an outcome of the underlying neuronal network activation and averaged to extract information. However, single LFP signals are frequently very different from each other. Extracting information provided by their shape can be used to better decode information transmitted by the network. This work proposes an automated method capable of classifying these signals based on their shapes. A template matching approach is used to recognize single LFPs and the contour information is extracted from the recognized signals to generate a feature matrix, which is then classified using intelligent K-means clustering. As an application example, the shape-specific information (e. g., latency and amplitude) of LFPs evoked in the rat barrel cortex are used in decoding the rat whisker information processing pathway using the proposed method.

In order to overcome k-means shortcomings, hybrid algorithms involving evolutionary algorithms are a good option for boosting the clustering performance. In this study, a hybrid two-phase algorithm for data clustering is proposed. In the first phase we utilize the new genetically improved PSO algorithm (GAI-PSO) which combines the standard velocity and position update rules of PSOs with the ideas of selection, mutation and crossover from GAs. The GAI-PSO algorithm searches the solution space to find an optimum initial seed for the next phase. The second phase is a local refining stage utilizing the k-means algorithm which can efficiently converge to the optimum solution.

As an improvement for SPM, we proposed three pieces of meliorations: first, use approximate nearest neighbor method instead of k-means for clustering; second, regulate the size of codebook referring to quantity and pixels of the images, by calculating sub-codebook for every category and eliminating the codes which are nearer to the registered ones than the threshold; third, rescale the histogram features, and classify the scene with hierarchical strategy. Experiments prove that our approach make better performance than other state-of-the-art classification methods using just one matching kernel.

Unsupervised Learning Based Performance Analysis of nu-Support Vector Regression for Speed Prediction of A Large Road Network	2012 15TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (ITSC)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems-ITSC		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	SEP 16-19, 2012	Anchorage, AK				TRAFFIC FLOW PREDICTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MACHINES; VALIDATION; MODELS	Many intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications require accurate prediction of traffic parameters. Previous studies have shown that data driven machine learning methods like support vector regression (SVR) can effectively and accurately perform this task. However, these studies focus on highways, or a few road segments. We propose a robust and scalable method using nu-SVR to tackle the problem of speed prediction of a large heterogenous road network. The traditional performance measures such as mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) provide little insight into spatial and temporal characteristics of prediction methods for a large network. This inadequacy can be a serious hurdle in effective implementation of prediction models for route guidance, congestion avoidance, dynamic traffic assignment and other ITS applications. We propose unsupervised learning techniques by employing k-means clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), and self organizing maps (SOM) to overcome this insufficiency. We establish the effectiveness of the developed methods by evaluation of spatial and temporal characteristics of prediction performance of the proposed variable window nu-SVR method.	[Asif, M.

The identification of natural frequencies and damping ratios by means of dynamic measurements provides a good information basis for further analysis. In this paper we review the Dynamic Data System (DDS) approach using autoregressive (AR) models in order to overcome the limitations of the FFT-based methods and evaluate it using experimental data from a real analysis case. As a secondary problem, we also discuss an ARMA model order identification technique which will be used to determine an upper bound for the used AR models. Our results show that this model order is too low for the identification of almost every eigenfrequency of the unfiltered measurement signature. Furthermore, the k-means clustering algorithm was used to clean up the data as well as to get correct eigenfrequency-damping ratio pairs in a semi-automated way.

Moreover, a clickstream is a record of a user's activity on the Internet. Using a clickstream analysis we can collect, analyze, and report aggregate data about which pages visitors visit in what order - and which are the result of the succession of mouse clicks each visitor makes. Clickstream analysis can reveal usage patterns leading to a heightened understanding of users' behavior. In this paper, we introduced a novel and efficient web log mining model for web users clustering. In general, our model consists of three main steps; 1) Computing the similarity measure of any path in a web page, 2) Defining the k-mean clustering for group customerID 3) Generating the report based on the Hadoop MapReduce Framework. Consequently, our experiments were run on real world data derived from weblogs of Siam University at Bangkok, Thailand (www.siam.edu).

In order to develop power efficiency and alleviate the problem, people have planned the methods of load identification. This paper is on the basis of many different kinds of methods, and used K-means classification and fuzzy algorithm. This kind of method also needs to store the templates in database in advanced, and compare the features of samples which are extracted from the experiment with templates. Then it utilizes K-means classification to classify and uses fuzzy algorithm to calculate the closeness degree of every cluster. The industrial environment is very complex. E.g. the number of load types, states, some interference factors etc. This method we proposed can handle large amount of data and has another key of advantage. It is the capability to identify major industrial loads accurately. The results are presented in this paper. All in all, industrial load identification needs to be consummated.

The main difficulty in establishing reject inference model is that the 'through-the-door' applicant population is unavailable. In this paper, we propose a hybrid data mining technique for reject inference. It is a three-stage approach: k-means cluster, support vector machines classification and computation of feature importance. By combining the samples of the accepted applicants and the new applicants, we obtain representative samples. To some extent, this is cost-free. Analytic results demonstrate that our method improves the predictive performance while still retaining interpretability.

The conventional calculations of similarities are inefficient, which suffers from data sparsity and poor prediction quality problems. In order to overcome the limitations, a new collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on item clustering and global similarity is proposed. Firstly, K-MEANS clustering algorithm is applied to cluster items into several classes based on users' ratings on items, and the local user similarity is calculated in each cluster. In addition, the factor of overlap is introduced to optimize the accuracy of the local similarity between users. Finally, a newly global similarity between users is presented to optimize the selection of target user's neighbors and achieve better prediction accuracy. The experimental results show that this method can improve the accuracy of the prediction and enhance the recommendation quality.

Automated Ontology Construction from Scenario Based Software Requirements Using Clustering Techniques	2012 IEEE 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION REUSE AND INTEGRATION (IRI)			English	Proceedings Paper	13th IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration (IEEE IRI) / DIM / WICSOC / IEEE EM- RITE / IRI-HI	AUG 08-10, 2012	Las Vegas, NV	IEEE Syst Man & Cybernet Soc (IEEE SMC), Soc Informat Reuse & Integrat (SIRI), IEEE		Software requirements; Scenario-based software engineering; Ontology; K-means clustering; Emergent behavior	INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT	Ontologies have been utilized in many different areas of software engineering. As software systems grow in size and complexity, the need to devise methodologies to manage the amount of information and knowledge becomes more apparent. Utilizing ontologies in requirement elicitation and analysis is very practical as they help to establish the scope of the system and facilitate information reuse. Moreover ontologies can serve as a natural bridge to transition from the requirements gathering stage to designing the architecture for the system. However manual construction of ontologies is time consuming, error prone and subjective. Therefore it is greatly beneficial to devise automated methodologies which allow knowledge extraction from system requirements using an automated and systematic approach. This paper introduces an approach to systematically extract knowledge from system requirements to construct different views of ontologies for the system as a part of a comprehensive framework to analyze and validate software requirements and design.

These may serve various functions and will reflect each student's goals and understanding of the text. This research proposes two simple biology-inspired approaches to represent the patterns of student annotations and to cluster students based on the similarity between their annotations; the annotations produced were simple highlighting. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, the research compared the processing speed of these approaches with generic hierarchical clustering algorithm implemented in Matlab and compared the accuracy of the clusters with the clusters created by human raters. The results show that both of the proposed approaches are more efficient and accurate than the generic hierarchical clustering algorithm. The proposed methodology can be implemented as an add-on to existing learning management systems and e-book readers, to automatically offer the students important notes and annotations conducted by others (either peers or students in the past) who have similar annotation behaviour pattern and style to the students.

Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) can decompose the nonstationary and nonlinear signals by sifting into a few intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) which represent a simple oscillatory mode of local data. However, the traditional bidimensional EMD (BEMD) has two drawbacks of the gray spots in IMF image and the slow computation speed. WEMD can solve such problems. Based on the characteristic of WEMD and local time/space-frequency analysis of structure multivector, the renovate technique of texture segmentation is also presented. Characterized by the local amplitude and the local frequency of every IMF component, the texture image can be segmented by k-means clustering algorithm. The subsequent experimental results indicate this method's effectiveness.

For IVF-ET, the successful rate largely depends on the receptivity of the endometrium, while there is potential application of digital image processing to help the automatic assessment of the receptivity of the endometrium. This paper studies proper methods to get quantitative analysis of HE (Hematoxylin-Eosin) staining medical images in the womb, including the number, density, area and perimeter of the glands. Instead of using monochrome analysis for color images, we represent the color medical images in the form of quaternion matrix to well preserve interrelationship between color channels. Quaternion Singular Value Decomposition (QSVD) is imposed on quaternion matrix to conduct dimension reduction of color vector data and to obtain color texture segmentation using k-means technique. Quaternion-based edge detection and pattern matching are then implemented on segmentation results to locate glands. Consequently, the quantitative analysis is available based on the extracted glands. Rather than reading a large number of medical images all by themselves, doctors can provide diagnosis more efficiently and more accurately using the proposed automatic quantitative analysis of pathological signal.

It is one of the responsible factors for software quality. Functionalities of the software components have been distributed among the constituents of software architecture. In this paper partitional clustering of the use cases has been proposed. The components to be clustered have been extracted from the mdl file formed by default in Rational Rose. Rational Rose has been taken as the modeling tool to model the software during the design stage. MDL is the model description language describing the facts about the model components in Rational Rose. It is a textual representation of the various aspects about the design of the software. The QUID (qualified unique identifier) has been extracted from the MDL file on which k means clustering algorithm has been applied which results into non overlapping clusters. Euclidean distance measure has been used to measure the distance between the components. In order to represent the partitional clustering, graphs have been drawn.

Using computers to analyze masses of information to discover trends and patterns. The current trend in business collaboration shares the data and mines results to gain mutual benefit. The main goal of the work is to introduce a bisection method which is capable of transforming a non-anonymous data set into adult data set. In this model, transform a table so that no one can make high probability association between records in the table and the corresponding entities. In order to achieve these goals we are implemented a bracket rule identifier for the prediction of the cluster. For this a suitable metric has been developed to estimate information loss by suppression which works well for both numeric and categorical data.

Increasing Scalability through Affinity Measure in Clustering	GLOBAL TRENDS IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, PT 2	Communications in Computer and Information Science		English	Proceedings Paper	4th ObCom International Conference on Recent Trends in Computing, Communication and Information Technology	DEC 09-11, 2011	Vellore, INDIA	Vellore Inst Technol Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Engn		Cluster; K-Means; UCAM		Clustering is a widely used technique in data mining application for discovering patterns in large dataset. In this paper the traditional K-Means algorithm is analyzed and found that quality of the resultant cluster is based on the initial seed where it is selected either sequentially or randomly. The K-Means algorithm should be initiated with the number of cluster k and initial seeds. For real time large database its difficult to predict the number of cluster and initial seeds accurately. In order to overcome this drawback the current paper focused on developing the UCAM (Unique Clustering with Affinity Measure) algorithm for clustering without giving initial seed and number of clusters. Unique clustering is obtained with the help of affinity measures.

Colposcopic images are acquired in raw form, contains major cervix lesions, regions outside the cervix and parts of the imaging devices such as speculum. In this paper, a preprocessing method that removes the irrelevant information from the cervical images based on Mathematical morphology and clustering based on Gaussian Mixture Modeling is presented. The detection of specularities in cervix image is based on intensity and saturation information from the HSI colour space is presented. A novel approach to detect the lesion in the cervix image based on statistical features and Bayes classifier is presented. The detection of lesion is achieved by extracting the statistical features such as mean, standard deviation and skewness and the features are used as an input to the Bayes classifier. Segmentation results are evaluated on 240 images of colposcopy.	[RamaPraba, P.

Multi-objective optimization for combined quality-quantity urban runoff control	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							OPTIMAL LOCATION; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM	Urban development affects the quantity and quality of urban surface runoff. In recent years, the best management practices (BMPs) concept has been widely promoted for control of both quality and quantity of urban floods. However, means to optimize the BMPs in a conjunctive quantity/quality framework are still under research. In this paper, three objective functions were considered: (1) minimization of the total flood damages, cost of BMP implementation and cost of land-use development; (2) reducing the amount of TSS (total suspended solid) and BOD5 (biological oxygen demand), representing the pollution characteristics, to below the threshold level; and (3) minimizing the total runoff volume. The biological oxygen demand and total suspended solid values were employed as two measures of urban runoff quality. The total surface runoff volume produced by sub-basins was representative of the runoff quantity. The construction and maintenance costs of the BMPs were also estimated based on the local price standards. Urban runoff quantity and quality in the case study watershed were simulated with the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). The NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) optimization technique was applied to derive the optimal trade off curve between various objectives. In the proposed structure for the NSGA-II algorithm, a continuous structure and intermediate crossover were used because they perform better as far as the optimization efficiency is concerned. Finally, urban runoff management scenarios were presented based on the optimal trade-off curve using the k-means method. Subsequently, a specific runoff control scenario was proposed to the urban managers.	[Zare, S.

Employees are clustered into 4 different groups according to a job satisfaction-performance model and strategic plans are derived for each group for an effective performance management. The sustainability of this business process improvement model is managed with a control mechanism as a Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle as a continuous improvement methodology. The grouping model is developed with a data mining clustering algorithm. Firstly 4 different performance groups are determined with a two-step k-means clustering approach. Then the clustering model developed is testified with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. Necessary data for this study are collected with a questionnaire application composed of 25 questions, first 13 variables measuring job satisfaction level and last 12 variables measuring performance characteristics where evaluators are employees themselves. With the help of model developed, human resources department is able to track employees' job satisfaction and performance levels and strategies for different performance groups are developed. Application of the model is conducted in a manufacturing company located in Istanbul, Turkey.

But it cannot perform well in some cases such as large sample size, etc. In terms of its shortcoming, some scholars in this area put up the idea of subclass, which can break out of LDA's limitation and achieve better classification results. Subclass discriminant analysis (SDA) worked out the division of subclasses, before solving the generalized eigenvalue problem. By contrast, our proposed approach performs subclass division based on K-means cluster, class by class, in the iterative steps under EM framework. The experimental results on two character databases show that our proposed approach can achieve better results than SDA, meanwhile not quite time-consuming.

Hyperspectral derivatives analysis for intertidal habitat mapping	REMOTE SENSING OF THE OCEAN, SEA ICE, COASTAL WATERS, AND LARGE WATER REGIONS 2012	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters and Large Water Regions	SEP 26-27, 2012	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	SPIE, SELEX GALILEO, THALES		Imaging spectroscopy; Helgoland; intertidal; macrophyte vegetation; classification	HELGOLAND GERMAN BIGHT; AQUATIC VEGETATION; NORTH-SEA; MACROPHYTES	Analysis of coastal marine algae communities enables an estimation of the state of coastal marine environments and provides evidence for environmental changes. Hyperspectral remote sensing provides a tool for mapping macroalgal habitats if the algal communities are spectrally resolvable. We tested the performance of a new approach for determining the distribution of macroalgae communities in the rocky intertidal zone of Helgoland (Germany) using airborne hyperspectral (AISA(eagle)) data. This new approach calculates the slopes in wavelength regions between specific pigment absorption features and does not rely on absolute reflectance values. The first order derivatives of these wavelength regions form slope bands, which are then classified using a k-Means approach. The new derivatives approach proved to be a time effective possibility for identifying the dominating macroalgae species with sufficient accuracy (Cohan's kappa = 0.70). The method was tested on another AISA data set and turned out to be as a robust (Cohan's kappa = 0.77) and easy-to-use approach for delineating dominant algae communities or habitats, which can be adapted easily to different data sets.

The algorithm showed the boundary between analysed types of wood on the basis of input data based on macroscopic structure of wood, i.e. the width of the annual ring, the proportion of late wood in the annual ring and the length of the ray of the annual ring (the location of the annual ring on the ray). Analyses conducted using this method indicated that juvenile wood in 24 European larches covers from 9 to 22 annual rings located around the pith (on average 13). The applied method was verified by changing the degree of crystallinity of cellulose determined at breast height of 3 mean sample trees. Boundaries indicated by the algorithm coincided with high accuracy with places where the course of changes in values of the degree of crystallinity at successive annual rings started to be similar.

Automatic Data Clustering Analysis of Arbitrary Shape with K-means and Enhanced Ant-based Template Mechanism	2012 IEEE 36TH ANNUAL COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS CONFERENCE (COMPSAC)	Proceedings International Computer Software & Applications Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	36th Annual IEEE International Computer Software and Applications Conference (COMPSAC)	JUL 16-20, 2012	Izmir, TURKEY	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, Iowa State Univ Sci & Technol	Izmir Inst Technol (IZTECH)			With the advancement of miniature sensors, wireless networking and context awareness, the importance of data-intensive computing is on the rise, with practical applications such as web categorization and data mining. One of the critical challenges in data-intensive computing is data clustering, as effective clustering algorithm will enable researchers and automated systems to analyze and organize massive amount of data much more efficiently. Many data clustering algorithms already exist, but most require a priori knowledge on the number of classes to guide the clustering process. We propose Auto_Ant_TMs_Shape, a two-phase algorithm, for automatically forming optimal number of clusters with arbitrary shapes. The first phase uses the hybrid approach of K-means and enhanced Ant-based template mechanism to generate small seed clusters with high purity in each cluster. In the second phase, small clusters are iteratively merged to obtain the final clusters using a merging algorithm. We apply Auto_Ant_TMs_Shape to 8 widely-used datasets, and compare the clustering results with two approaches based on density-based algorithm (DBSCAN) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The results show that Auto_Ant_TMs_Shape is very effective and thus achieve good clustering results in near optimal number of clusters without knowing the number of classes in advance.

In general, leukocytes are usually manually classified in laboratories by using microscopes. It is a painstaking and subjective task for biologists. An automatic method is essential to reduce the overhead for biologists. The nuclei are used to identify five types of leukocyte in this paper. The leukocyte cell nucleus enhancer is proposed to segment the region we are interested in by enhancing the region of the leukocyte nucleus and suppressing the other region of the blood smear images. In the recognition steps, we reduce features by principle component analysis (PCA) to obtain suitable features. The genetic algorithm based k-means clustering approach is used to classify the five kinds of leukocyte in the reduced dimensions. The experimental results show that even though only leukocyte nucleus features are used for classification in our method,	[Huang, Der-Chen; Hung, Kun-Ding] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Taichung 40227, Taiwan	Huang, DC (reprint author), Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, 250 Kuokuang Rd, Taichung 40227, Taiwan.	huangdc@nchu.edu.tw; phd9505@cs.nchu.edu.tw					Bergen T, 2008, IEEE ENG MED BIO, P3075, DOI 10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649853; Chan YK, 2010, BMC BIOINFORMATICS, V11, DOI 10.1186/1471-2105-11-558; Chunming T., 2005, LECT NOTES COMPUTER, V3645; Clausi DA, 2002, CAN J REMOTE SENS, V28, P45; Colunga MC, 2009, LECT NOTES ARTIF INT, V5845, P545, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-05258-3_48; DAVIES DL, 1979, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V1, P224; DICE LR, 1945, ECOLOGY, V26, P297, DOI 10.2307/1932409; Hamghalam M, 2009, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2009 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS, P103, DOI 10.1109/ICSPS.2009.36; Otsu N., 1979, SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNET, V9, P62, DOI DOI 10.1109/TSMC.1979.4310076; Pai PY, 2011, INFORM SCIENCES, V181, P1463, DOI 10.1016/j.ins.2010.12.007; Ramoser H, 2005, P ANN INT IEEE EMBS, P3371, DOI 10.1109/IEMBS.2005.1617200; Sabino DMU, 2004, REAL-TIME IMAGING, V10, P205, DOI 10.1016/j.rti.2004.02.007; Soh LK, 1999, IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE, V37, P780, DOI 10.1109/36.752194; Theera-Umpon N, 2007, IEEE T INF TECHNOL B, V11, P353, DOI 10.1109/TITB.2007.892694; Timby B.

Recent works demonstrates that the GGD can be employed for texture identification in the wavelet domain with more accuracy than other measures, like the Kullback Leibler Divergence. The wavelet coefficients of an image can be grouped considering color and spatial dependence. The Laplacian distribution is one of various possible elliptical distributions and is the choice of this work for modeling these coefficients. A street view application of this technique is presented. First, a wavelet decomposition of the image is done. Then, the coefficients of smaller regions (windows) are grouped, and a Laplacian distribution is computed for each coefficients group at each sub band. The geodesic distance between these distributions can be computed. This can be viewed as a similarity measure between the regions of the image, and a spectral clustering is employed, using the k-means method for the segmentation. Thus, regions with different textures, as the streets, can be discriminated from each other. The main contribution of this paper is the use of the geodesic distance between GGDs in a segmentation context.

Our aim is to locate and segment the EMROIs based on children's hand radiographs, in which the images are with nonuniform background. Furthermore, a great destructive noise may suppress the segmentation process. The proposed approach combines a series of image preprocessing procedures to crop the left-hand radiograph and EMROIs. The experiments were conducted on different parts of knuckles, such as distal, middle, and proximal.

This paper presents a novel method of power lines detection and tracking. Firstly, the Hough transform is used to extract line segments of power lines. Secondly, according to the characteristics of power lines in the aerial images, we use K-means in the Hough space to cluster and filter the straight lines, and then detect power lines. Finally, a Kalman filter is used to track the power lines in the Hough space, based on the continuity of a video sequence. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective for automatic power line detection and tracking in complex environments.

In order to avoid disadvantages of the current algorithms, this paper proposed a new algorithm combined PSO and ISODATA. The hybrid PSO-ISODATA algorithm first changes the color space of the images. Then, the initial cluster number is determined by the combined algorithm, and finally, the automatic segmentation of remote sensing images is achieved through multiple iterations. Many segmentation experiments on different spatial resolution remote sensing images using the proposed methods in this paper, we also compared the method to the current existing methods such as K-means, PSO, ISODATA, and PSO-K-means methods. The results show that the hybrid PSO-ISODATA algorithm can determine the initial cluster number adaptively, avoid the local optima of K-means and ISODATA algorithms, increase the searching capability of PSO, and the segmentation results are much more close to the actual situation.

First, wavelet transform is used to remove noise and detail information which impact extraction of radiation feature. Then road and other objects with same spectrum are extracted by carrying out improved K-means clustering segmentation based on radiation feature. Next, rough road extraction is achieved by implementing area threshold segmentation based on topology feature. Finally, road skeleton is extracted through thinning. The results show that this approach is applied for road extraction.

Quantitative contributions to particle number concentrations of the nucleation (33-39%), Aitken (39-49%) and accumulation mode (18-22%) were estimated. We examined the source and time variability of atmospheric aerosol particles by using both K-means clustering and Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis. Performing clustering analysis on hourly size distributions, nine K-means DMPS clusters were identified and, by directional association, diurnal variation and relationship to meteorological and pollution variables, four typical aerosol size distribution scenarios were identified: traffic (69% of the time), dilution (15% of the time), summer background conditions (4% of the time) and regional pollution (12% of the time). According to the results of PMF, vehicle exhausts are estimated to contribute at least to 62-66% of the total particle number concentration, with a slightly higher proportion distributed towards the nucleation mode (34 %) relative to the Aitken mode (28-32%). Photochemically induced nucleation particles make only a small contribution to the total particle number concentration (2-3% of the total), although only particles larger than 13 nm were considered in this study. Overall the combination of the two statistical methods is successful at separating components and quantifying relative contributions to the particle number population.

K-means algorithm has been invoked for forming arbitrary clusters of the data which in turn have been subjected to minimum distance algorithm for the extraction of features corresponding to expected return and risk. A HMM has been trained with the classified historical data with these attributes. This trained HMM has been used to predict return and risk for NSE index data.

The existence of delaminations changes the vibration characteristics of composite laminates and hence such indicators can be used to quantify the health characteristics of laminates. An approach for online health monitoring of in-service composite laminates is presented in this paper that relies on methods based on computational intelligence. Typical changes in the observed vibration characteristics (i.e. change in natural frequencies) are considered as inputs to identify the existence, location and magnitude of delaminations. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated using numerical models of composite laminates. Since this identification problem essentially involves the solution of an optimization problem, the use of finite element (FE) methods as the underlying tool for analysis turns out to be computationally expensive. A surrogate assisted optimization approach is hence introduced to contain the computational time within affordable limits. An artificial neural network (ANN) model with Bayesian regularization is used as the underlying approximation scheme while an improved rate of convergence is achieved using a memetic algorithm. However, building of ANN surrogate models usually requires large training datasets. K-means clustering is effectively employed to reduce the size of datasets. ANN is also used via inverse modeling to determine the position, size and location of delaminations using changes in measured natural frequencies. The results clearly highlight the efficiency and the robustness of the approach.

It is very difficult to segregate a people whether he or she is in the normal position or barring unexpected circumstances that has occurred abruptly. Over the past 50 years, different researchers have developed human-observer based methods that can be used to classify and correlate facial expressions with human sensation. In this paper we proposed a novel methodology based on histogram classification for extraction of panic moment of a human being. Firstly, we have considered face-mask to collect the maximum information from human face. Then we have set the three coordinate positions for storing the data as a panic-info-mask. Finally, the geometrical value of panic-info-mask represents the data of panic moment.

In particular, previous studies have shown that the unsupervised clustering approach is both accurate and capable of discovering previously unknown application classes. In this paper, we explore the utility of side information in the process of traffic clustering. Specifically, we focus on the flow correlation information that can be efficiently extracted from packet headers and expressed as instance-level constraints, which indicate that particular sets of flows are using the same application and thus should be put into the same cluster. To incorporate the constraints, we propose a modified constrained K-Means algorithm. A variety of real-world traffic traces are used to show that the constraints are widely available. The experimental results indicate that the constrained approach not only improves the quality of the resulted clusters, but also speeds up the convergence of the clustering process.

The vehicular park and the industry, as well as orography and climatic characteristics have propitiated the increment in pollutant concentration of Sulphur Dioxide (SO2). In this work, a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network has been used to make the prediction of an hour ahead of pollutant concentration. A database used to train the Neural Network corresponds to historical time series of meteorological variables and air pollutant concentrations of SO2. Before the prediction, Fuzzy c-Means and K-means clustering algorithms have been implemented in order to find relationship among pollutant and meteorological variables. Our experiments with the proposed system show the importance of this set of meteorological variables on the prediction of SO2 pollutant concentrations and the neural network efficiency. The performance estimation is determined using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The results showed that the information obtained in the clustering step allows a prediction of an hour ahead, with data from past 2 hours.	[Cortina-Januchs, M.

Because of the large scale and practical constraints, the real life application related to cigarette distribution can't be efficiently solved by existing methods. Based on previous research and practical characteristics, we proposed a multi-stage algorithm. After dividing to reduce the problem scale, we used an adapted K-means clustering to dispatch the customers into different routes. The adapted clustering overcomes some defects of traditional K-means clustering in the application to realworld problem, for example, it balances the customers between clusters. The computational experiment was carried out on a real-world problem of cigarette distribution in Jinan city. Comparing with the effective algorithm proposed in recent years, we find that the multi-stage algorithm is highly competitive to tackle real-world large-scale vehicle routing problem with regards to solution quality as well as runtime.

In this paper presents a density-based algorithm to determine the initial cluster centers, eliminate the clustering results depend on the initial cluster centers. While, optimized the methods of cluster centers re-calculation and the distance from data-object to the cluster center, reduce noise impact on the clustering results, which meets the clustering of asymmetry density cluster. Experiments on UCI datasets show that the improved algorithm can eliminate the clustering results depend on the initial cluster centers, obtain more compact cluster. Therefore, the improved K-means clustering algorithm is effective.

This involves inspecting the sample for cellular level abnormalities and determining the spread of the abnormalities. Cancer is graded based on the spread of the abnormal cells. This is a tedious, subjective and time-consuming process with considerable variations in diagnosis between the experts. This paper presents a computer aided decision support system (CADSS) tool to help the pathologists in their examination of the cervical cancer biopsies. The main aim of the proposed CADSS system is to identify abnormalities and quantify cancer grading in a systematic and repeatable manner. The paper proposes three different methods which presents and compares the results using 475 images of cervical biopsies which include normal, three stages of pre cancer, and malignant cases. This paper will explore various components of an effective CADSS; image acquisition, pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, classification, grading and disease identification. Cervical histological images are captured using a digital microscope. The images are captured in sufficient resolution to retain enough information for effective classification. Histology images of cervical biopsies consist of three major sections; background, stroma and squamous epithelium. Most diagnostic information are contained within the epithelium region. This paper will present two levels of segmentations; global (macro) and local (micro). At the global level the squamous epithelium is separated from the background and stroma. At the local or cellular level, the nuclei and cytoplasm are segmented for further analysis. Image features that influence the pathologists' decision during the analysis and classification of a cervical biopsy are the nuclei's shape and spread; the ratio of the areas of nuclei and cytoplasm as well as the texture and spread of the abnormalities. Similar features are extracted towards the automated classification process. This paper will present various feature extraction methods including colour, shape and texture using Gabor wavelet as well as various quantative metrics. Generated features are used to classify cells or regions into normal and abnormal categories. Following the classification process, the cancer is graded based on the spread of the abnormal cells. This paper will present the results of the grading process with five stages of the cancer spectrum.

Because of multispectral instruments can be used to estimate the reflectance of materials in the scene, these techniques constitute fundamental tools for materials analysis and quality control. During the last years, a variety of algorithms has been developed to work with multispectral data, whose main purpose has been to perform the correct classification of the objects in the scene. The present study introduces a brief review of some classical as well as a novel technique that have been used for such purposes. The use of principal component analysis and K-means clustering techniques as important classification algorithms is here discussed. Moreover, a recent method based on the min-W and m a x-M lattice auto-associative memories, that was proposed for endmember determination in hyperspectral imagery, is introduced as a classification method. Besides a discussion of their mathematical foundation, we emphasize their main characteristics and the results achieved for two exemplar images conformed by objects similar in appearance, but spectrally different. The classification results state that the first components computed from principal component analysis can be used to highlight areas with different spectral characteristics. In addition, the use of lattice auto-associative memories provides good results for materials classification even in the cases where some spectral similarities appears in their spectral responses.

First, a pre-detection of targets gives us candidates. For each candidate, we choose an extended region called candidate with neighborhood which comprises candidate and its neighbor area. Second, the patches of candidate with neighborhood are got by a regular grid, and their SIFT(Scale Invariant Feature Transform) features are extracted. Then the SIFT features of training images are clustered with the K-means algorithm to form a codebook of the patches. We quantize the patches of candidate with neighborhood according to this codebook and get the visual word representation. Finally by applying spatial pyramid matching, the candidates are classified with SVM (support vector machine). Experiment results are given for a set of images show that our method has got predominant performance.

Hence, we need a more efficient and effective image searching technology. In this paper, we introduce a new scheme to image annotation in two stage. First semi-supervised k-means clustering with Mahalanobis similarity measure has been used. Second, a novel hybrid relevance feedback algorithm. AHRFC is proposed to narrow the gap between low-level image feature and high-level semantic and improve the accuracy of image annotation. The AHRFC algorithm is compound of three stages: (I) The images that the user knows irrelevant to cluster, are conducted to correct cluster by a long-term RE; (2) Regarding the images that the user knows relevant to cluster, we try to estimate feature weight of the clusters to provide a multiple similarity measure using a re-weighting RF: (3) To approach the exact place of the cluster centers, a cluster center movement (CCM) RE is used.

A clustering algorithm, (Modified K-Means) is used to determine the patterns of interest, i.e. the nearest operating state in the history of the process data, on which the efficiency is higher than the current state of the process. Then, like what happens in a decision support mechanism, controllable variable of the current operating state is suggested to be changed to meet the ones of the desired pattern.			s_aghvami@yahoo.com; htshandiz@shahroodut.ac.ir; jahedmr@iust.ac.ir					Booth RC, 1998, P IEEE IND APPL DYN, P1; Gupta M.

Hierarchical clustering algorithm can be used to generate the initial cluster center of K-means clustering algorithm. The geometric features of input data can achieve a good distribution by means of pretreatment and feature extraction and selection.

The objective is to separate the breast gland, which is the region of interest for the breast cancer diagnosis, from other tissues. Images are pre-processed with four different algorithms that consider the image surrounding: speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion, homomorphic filter, Perona and Malik non-linear diffusion and Moran index. For each image pixel a four bins descriptor is created composed by the corresponding pixels of each of these preprocessed images. The segmentation is based on the classification of the image pixel descriptors, using two methods: the unsupervised K-means and the supervised Support Vector Machines. Using the separation between regions that result from the pixel classification, a set of heuristic rules is established in order to provide a separation line between the two regions. For training and testing, a breast ultrasound database collected at "Hospital da Cova da Beira" is used.

This problem is difficult. As a first step, we consider the extreme sparse code given by vector quantization, i.e. each pixel is finally associated to 1 single atom. For Gaussian noise, the natural solution is K-means clustering using the sum of the squares of differences between gray levels as the dissimilarity measure between patches. For non Gaussian noises (Poisson, Gamma,...), a new measure of dissimilarity between noisy patches is necessary. We study the use of the generalized likelihood ratios (GLR) recently introduced by Deledalle et al. in [1] to compare non Gaussian noisy patches. We propose a K-medoids algorithm generalizing the usual Linde-Buzo-Gray K-means using the GLR based dissimilarity measure. We obtain a vector quantization which provides a dictionary that can be very large and redundant. We illustrate our approach by dictionaries learnt from images featuring non Gaussian noise, and present preliminary denoising results.

Due to asymmetry or lack of positive definiteness they are not naturally suited for kernel K-means. We propose a generative Bayesian model for dense matrices which generalize kernel K-means to consider off-diagonal interactions in matrices of interactions, and demonstrate its ability to detect structure on both artificial data and two real data sets.

Intrusion detection (ID) is the process of examining the events occurring in a computer system or network. Analyzing the system or network for signs of intrusions, defined as attempts to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, availability, or to bypass the security mechanisms of a network. The focus of this paper is mainly on intrusion detection based on data mining. The main part of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) is to produce huge volumes of alarms. The interesting alarms are always mixed with unwanted, non-interesting and duplicate alarms. The aim of data mining is to improve the detection rate and decrease the false alarm rate. So, here we proposed a framework which detect the intrusion and after that, it will show the improvement of k-means clustering algorithm.

They rapidly gained acceptance in the scientific community as powerful statistical search method whicj allows us to consider the segmentation problem as an optimization problem. In this paper, we propose the use of GAs in an integrated manner with traditional image segmentation techniques to provide an efficient segmentation and edges detection for selected natural images. The developed experimental results are compared with the results of other known existing segmentation algorithms such as K-mean clustering, and global threshold methods. The proposed method is capable of achieving a satisfactory results. Accordingly, the GAs based image segmentation method will definitely help in solving various complex image processing tasks.

Spectral cross-correlation as a supervised approach for the analysis of complex Raman datasets: the case of nanoparticles in biological cells	ANALYST			English	Article							GOLD NANOPARTICLES; IN-VIVO; CELLULAR UPTAKE; LIVING CELLS; SPECTROSCOPY; MICROSCOPY; TRAFFICKING; PARTICLES; TOXICITY; THERAPY	Spectral cross-correlation is introduced as a methodology to identify the presence and subcellular distribution of nanoparticles in cells. Raman microscopy is employed to spectroscopically image biological cells previously exposed to polystyrene nanoparticles, as a model for the study of nano-bio interactions. The limitations of previously deployed strategies of K-means clustering analysis and principal component analysis are discussed and a novel methodology of spectral cross-correlation analysis is introduced and compared with the performance of classical least squares analysis, in both unsupervised and supervised modes. The previous study demonstrated the feasibility of using Raman spectroscopy to map cells and identify polystyrene nanoparticles in a lipid rich environment, which is suggestive of the membrane rich endoplasmic reticulum. However, short comings in identification of all nanoparticle signatures in the cell using K-means clustering are apparent, as highlighted by principal component analysis of the identified clusters which demonstrates that K-means clustering does not identify all regions where spectral signatures of the nanoparticles are evident. Thus, two more sophisticated analytical approaches to the extraction of the nanoparticle signatures from the Raman spectral datasets, namely classical least squares analysis and cross-correlation analysis, were employed and are demonstrated to improve the identification of spectroscopic signatures characteristic of polystyrene nanoparticles in a cellular environment. Additionally, to investigate the local biochemical environment in which the nanoparticles are trafficked, a pure spectrum of 3-sn-phosphatidyl ethanolamine was cross-correlated against the Raman dataset, further suggesting the particles are indeed localized in a lipid rich environment. Furthermore, to demonstrate the robustness and versatility of the analysis method, a spectrum of pure RNA was used to demonstrate that a differentiation could be made between DNA of the nucleus and RNA of the nucleolus using the supervised spectral cross-correlation technique.

Then the centroids of these clusters are found. These centroids are then connected, which form the brain boundary. We use Quadratic equations to fit the Curve to find the edges by connecting all the maxima values in the boundary. Then, we remove the skull area and the clusters which are outside the boundary. resulting in the segmentation of the brain portion.	[Somasundaram, K.; Shankar, R.

Its prediction competence relies highly on the initial value of translation vectors. However, there is no established solution in determining the appropriate initial value for the translation vectors at this moment. In this paper, we propose a novel enhanced fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm - specifically, the modified point symmetry-based fuzzy c-means (MPSDFCM) algorithm - in initializing the translation vectors of the WNNs. The effectiveness of embedding different activation functions in WNNs will be investigated as well. The categorization effectiveness of the proposed WNNs model was then evaluated in classifying the type 2 diabetics, and was compared with the multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) models. Performance assessment shows that our proposed model outperforms the rest, since a 100% superior classification rate was achieved.

In the complex aluminium smelting process, there are difficulties in isolating historical data into different classes of faults for developing a fault diagnostic model. This paper presents a new application of using a data mining tool, k-means clustering in order to determine precisely how data corresponds to different classes of faults in the aluminium smelting process. The results of applying the clustering technique on real data sets show that the boundary of each class of faults can be identified. This means the faulty data can be isolated accurately to enable for the development of a fault diagnostic model that can diagnose faults effectively.

Despite the popularity of EM algorithms, it is challenging to efficiently implement these algorithms in a distributed environment. In particular, many EM algorithms that frequently update the parameters have been shown to be much more efficient than their concurrent counterparts. Accordingly, we propose two approaches to parallelize such EM algorithms in a distributed environment so as to scale to massive data sets. We prove that both approaches maintain the convergence properties of the EM algorithms. Based on the approaches, we design and implement a distributed framework, FreEM, to support the implementation of frequent updates for the EM algorithms. We show its efficiency through three well-known EM applications: k-means clustering, fuzzy c-means clustering and parameter estimation for the Gaussian Mixture model. We evaluate our framework on both a local cluster of machines and the Amazon EC2 cloud. Our evaluation shows that the EM algorithms with frequent updates implemented on FreEM can run much faster than those implementations with traditional concurrent updates.

PIC: Partitioned Iterative Convergence for Clusters	2012 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CLUSTER COMPUTING (CLUSTER)	IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing	SEP 24-28, 2012	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE Tech Comm Scalable Comp (TCSC), Sugon, Intel, Inspur, VMware, Mellanox, PARATERA, BLSC, LoongStore, Nvidia				Iterative-convergence algorithms are frequently used in a variety of domains to build models from large data sets. Cluster implementations of these algorithms are commonly realized using parallel programming models such as MapReduce. However, these implementations suffer from significant performance bottlenecks, especially due to large volumes of network traffic resulting from intermediate data and model updates during the iterations. To address these challenges, we propose partitioned iterative convergence (PIC), a new approach to programming and executing iterative convergence algorithms on frameworks like MapReduce. In PIC, we execute the iterative-convergence computation in two phases - the best-effort phase, which quickly produces a good initial model and the top-off phase, which further refines this model to produce the final solution. The best-effort phase iteratively performs the following steps: (a) partition the input data and the model to create several smaller, model-building sub-problems, (b) independently solve these sub-problems using iterative convergence computations, and (c) merge solutions of the sub-problems to create the next version of the model. This partitioned, loosely coupled execution of the computation produces a model of good quality, while drastically reducing network traffic due to intermediate data and model updates. The top-off phase further refines this model by employing the original iterative-convergence computation on the entire (un-partitioned) problem until convergence. However, the number of iterations executed in the top-off phase is quite small, resulting in a significant overall improvement in performance. We have implemented a library for PIC on top of the Hadoop MapReduce framework, and evaluated it using five popular iterative-convergence algorithms (PageRank, K-Means clustering, neural network training, linear equation solver and image smoothing). Our evaluations on clusters ranging from 6 nodes to 256 nodes demonstrate a 2.5X-4X speedup compared to conventional implementations using Hadoop.

We propose to use motion tracking to generate video features. First, we extract motion vectors derived from the standard 'MPEG-4 AVC/H.264' video stream. Second, the image sequence motion based segmentation is performed by a combination of k-means clustering and motion consistency verification. Third, we used the well-known Kalman filter to track region displacement between consecutive frames, and build region's motion trajectories. Finally, to compare videos, we adopted an extension of dynamic time warping (EDTW) to multidimensional time series. Results are promising: a retrieval precision at 5 of 62 % was achieved.

The characteristics of blue algal bloom images and feature extraction procedures are analyzed in this paper. The pixel value of Cyanobacteria blooms color images has a significant difference from normal coastal waters images, particularly those of Hue and Saturation. A new method is proposed for Cyanobacteria blooms detection using dynamic K-means algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the excellent practicability of the proposed detection method. Based on the pixel statistics, it can achieve a highly successful probability of detecting bloom images. Therefore, the proposed detection method can be expected to classify and detect Cyanobacteria blooms in monitoring and forecasting systems.

A algorithm was proposed on action analysis of mice in this paper. Difference of mice in inter-frame was extracted while the position relationship between mice contours and change information was taken into account. Then K-Means clustering algorithm was used to cluster the information while the cluster center was used as the key frame. In the recognition phase, the similarity measure function was defined according to practical significance of the center of K-Means algorithm, the most similar sample class with it was the result. Experimental results showed that the action analysis algorithm is very effective.

In GCGD, a geodesic distance based proximity measure is employed replacing Euclidean distance that cannot correctly describe the relationship between data lying in a manifold, and GCGD determines partitioning of the feature vectors from a combinatorial optimization viewpoint. Fault detection experiments of inlet valve leakage in a two-stage reciprocating compressor reveal that GCGD achieves a better performance of fault detection than the K-means algorithm and a genetic algorithm based clustering technique.

Based on the characteristics of the indentation images, this article uses texture features to extract the indentation silhouette from the point view of texture segmentation. We adopt Redundant Wavelet Transform and laws texture measurement algorithm to describe the texture characteristics of the indentation image, forming a n-dimensional feature vector, introducing texture features smoothing algorithm based on quadrant to smooth the features. Finally we combine with the improved k-means clustering algorithm to get texture segmentation result. The experiment demonstrates that in the material Vickers hardness image segmentation the proposed algorithm was significantly effective and robust.

One of the most used techniques for clustering is based on K-means such that the data is partitioned into K clusters. Although K-means algorithm is easy to implement and works fast in most situations, it suffers from several drawbacks due to its choice of initializations and convergence to local optima. The K-harmonic means clustering solves the problem of initialization, but for the convergence to local optima, the K-harmonic means is hopeless. In this paper, a new method is proposed to solve the problem of convergence to local optima, namely particle swarm optimization K-harmonic means clustering (PSOKHM) algorithm. The experiment results on the three well known datasets show the effectiveness of the PSOKHM clustering algorithm.

Sobotkova, T. Osecka, M. Jelinek, M. Blatny, M. Hrdlicka Objectives. The study deals with antisocial behavior of school children in urban areas, its typology and relationship to exposure to violence in the community and to school bullying. Subjects and settings. Participants were adolescents participating in international project The Social and Health Assessment (SAHA) that aims to assess risk and protective factors for psychosocial adjustment of children and youth. The sample consisted of 12 year-old and 14-year-old students from schools in 13 regional capitals. The sample consisted of 2.973 persons (53 % girls, mean age 13.5 years, SD = 1.1): 12 years old cohort consisting of 1.447 adolescents - 54 % of girls; 14 years old cohort consisting of 1.526 adolescents - 53 % of girls. SAHA was used to measure antisocial behavior, exposure to violence and school bullying. Hypothesis. Created empirical types of adolescents with varying degrees of antisocial behavior differ in violence exposure, types with higher levels of antisocial behavior are exposed to a greater extent to violence and lower extent to bullying as objects. Statistical analysis. Non-hierarchical cluster analysis (k-means) to identify four types of antisocial behavior. Types comparision in violence exposure and bullying (Kruskal-Wallis test, Dunn post-hoc tests). Results. Authors found relationships between exposure to violence (community and bullying) and the type of behavior (exposure to violence as a witness (chi(2) = 265.7, df = 3, p<0.01), exposure to violence as a victim (chi(2) = 236.6, df = 3, p<0.01); object of bullying (chi(2) = 263.4, df = 3, p<0.01). The highest rates of exposure to violence in all three variables have adolescents with the highest rates of antisocial behavior. Study limitation. Bullying from aggressor's point of view and cyberbullying were not analysed.

Global rankings have a variety of uses, levels of popularity and rationales and they are here to stay. An examination of the results of the current global ranking reveals that well-reputed world-class universities are amongst the top ranked ones. A major concern for university administrators in many parts of the world is how to use the global rankings wisely in their mid-term and long-term strategic planning for building their institutions into world-class universities. Four major global rankings have been developed: the Academic Ranking of World Universities, the World University Rankings, the Webometrics Ranking of World Universities and the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities. The main purpose of this paper is to explore the most influential indicators in these global university rankings that will affect the rank mobility of an institution. Based on an analysis of correlation coefficients and K-means clustering, a model of strategic institutional planning for building a world-class university is proposed.

The increase in prevalence of neurodegenerative disorders such as AD has led to a need for objective means to assist clinicians with the analysis and interpretation of complex biomedical data. To this end, we propose a "Bioprofile" analysis to reveal the pattern of disease in the subject's biodata. From the Bioprofile, personal "Bioindices" that indicate how closely a subject's data resemble the pattern of AD can be derived. We used an unsupervised technique (k-means) to cluster variables of the ADNI database so that subjects are divisible into those with the Bioprofile of AD and those without it. Results revealed that there is an "AD pattern" in the biodata of most AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients and some controls. This pattern agrees with a recent hypothetical model of AD evolution. We also assessed how the Bioindices changed with time and we found that the Bioprofile was associated with the risk of progressing from MCI to AD. Hence, the Bioprofile analysis is a promising methodology that may potentially provide a complementary new way of interpreting biomedical data. Furthermore, the concept of the Bioprofile could be extended to other neurodegenerative diseases.

The ER embraces three steps: bit mapping, K-means clustering, and sign judgment. In this detector, we construct a mapping function and map the output base-band bits from MFs into a one-dimensional feature space to get the amplitude information. After that, we set an initial value and classify the bits into right bits and wrong ones by K-means clustering. Finally, we make the sign judgment to prevent some right bits being picked out as wrong bits and correct the wrong bits to reduce the bit error rate (BER) of the system. Compared to a conventional detector based on MFs and minimum mean square error detector, to a large extent, our detector can improve the BER performance of a system because of high recognition probability of the wrong bits in K-means clustering. What is more, the simulation results show that the proposed hybrid MUD is not sensitive to the number of users. It can achieve a good BER performance and low computational complexity when there are 20 UWB transmitters in the channel.

Through parallel programming environment based on message passing, parallel K-means unsupervised classification of remote sensing image with different sizes we performed in parallel environment with different computers number. The speedup and efficiency of parallel computation as well as effect of message communication on parallel unsupervised classification were analyzed. The results show that the classification speed of mass amount data parallel remote sensing image unsupervised classification has been greatly improved and the parallel unsupervised classification has effect on parallel efficiency. In the parallel programming, message communication should be minimized as possible and messages should be merged to improve computation efficiency. Rational task allocation and communication can improve performance of parallel computing. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Yet, k-Means suffers from the major shortcoming of passing number of clusters and centroids in advance. Decimal scaling is one of the normalization approaches which standardize the features of the dataset and improve the effectiveness of the algorithm. Integrating different distance measures with modified k-Means algorithm help to select the proper distance measure for specific data mining application. This paper compare the results of modified k-Means with different distance measures like Euclidean Distance, Manhattan Distance, Minkowski Distance, Cosine Measure Distance and the Decimal Scaling normalization approach. Result Analysis is taken on various datasets from UCI machine dataset repository and shows that Mk-Means is advantageous and improve the effectiveness with normalized approach and Minkowski distance measure.

While most proposed techniques for achieving this rely on voltage overscaling (VOS), this paper shows that Imprecise Hardware (IHW) with design-time structural parameters can achieve orthogonal energy-quality tradeoffs. Two IHW adders are improved and two IHW multipliers are introduced in this paper. In addition, a simulation-free error estimation technique is proposed to rapidly and accurately estimate the impact of IHW on output quality. Finally, a quality-aware energy minimization methodology is presented. To validate this methodology, experiments are conducted on two computational kernels: DOT-PRODUCT and L2-NORM - used in three applications - Leukocyte Tracker, SVM classification and K-means clustering. Results show that the Hellinger distance between estimated and simulated error distribution is within 0.05 and that the methodology enables designers to explore energy-quality tradeoffs with significant reduction in simulation complexity.

According to the concept of density-based and grid-distance- based distribution in the Mel-frequency cepstrum domain, the feature vectors of each speaker were self-adaptively classified into L clusters with less overlapped. With these convex and non-interwoven clusters, the Gaussian Mixture Model could statistically analyze and estimate the distinct feature classification for each speaker. Moreover, a new speaker recognition system was established by using GMM-UBM model. The experimental results showed that the clustering effect of the proposed method was superior to the K-means plus EM clustering method, and the proposed speaker recognition system achieves better classification performance in terms of verification accuracy and computational complexity.

METAHEURISTIC APPROACH FOR THE MULTI-DEPOT VEHICLE ROUTING PROBLEM	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; SCHEDULING PROBLEM; GENETIC ALGORITHM; DELIVERY POINTS; NUMBER; TIME	Distribution logistics comprises all activities related to the provision of finished products and merchandise to a customer. The focal point of distribution logistics is the shipment of goods from the manufacturer to the consumer. The products can be delivered to a customer directly either from the production facility or from the trader's stock located close to the production site or, probably, via additional regional distribution warehouses. These kinds of distribution logistics are mathematically represented as a vehicle routing problem (VRP), a well-known nondeterministic polynomial time (NP)-hard problem of operations research. VRP is more suited for applications having one warehouse. In reality, however, many companies and industries possess more than one distribution warehouse. These kinds of problems can be solved with an extension of VRP called multi-depot VRP (MDVRP). MDVRP is an NP-hard and combinatorial optimization problem. MDVRP is an important and challenging problem in logistics management. It can be solved using a search algorithm or metaheuristic and can be viewed as searching for the best element in a set of discrete items. In this article, cluster first and route second methodology is adapted and metaheuristics genetic algorithms (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are used to solve MDVRP. A hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) for solving MDVRP is also proposed. In HPSO, the initial particles are generated based on the k-means clustering and nearest neighbor heuristic (NNH). The particles are decoded into clusters and multiple routes are generated within the clusters. The 2-opt local search heuristic is used for optimizing the routes obtained; then the results are compared with GA and PSO for randomly generated problem instances. The home delivery pharmacy program and waste-collection problem are considered as case studies in this paper. The algorithm is implemented using MATLAB 7.0.1.

More precisely, we focus on the mining part and develop original approaches for incremental clustering based on k-means for knowledge bases. Instead of addressing the prohibitive amounts of knowledge, the latter is gradually exploited by packets in order to reduce the problem complexity. We introduce original algorithms named ICPK/k-means for Incremental Clustering by Packets of Knowledge, ICPKG/k-means for Incremental Algorithm by Packets of Knowledge and Grouping of clusters for determining the number of desired clusters, LICPK/k-means for Learning Incremental Clustering by Packets of Knowledge and LIGPKG/k-means for Learning Incremental Clustering by Packets of Knowledge and Grouping of clusters for handling the clustering of large amount of knowledge. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of our algorithms.

In this paper, we proposed a novel approach of multiple kernel learning for clustering based on the kernel k-means algorithm. Rather than using a convex combination of multiple kernels over the whole input space, our method associates to each cluster a localized kernel. We assign to each cluster a weight vector for feature selection and combine it with a Gaussian kernel to form a unique kernel for the corresponding cluster. A locally adaptive strategy is used to localize the kernel for each cluster with the aim of minimizing the within-cluster variance of the corresponding cluster. We experimentally compared our methods to kernel k-means and spectral clustering on several data sets. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Recent improvements in CAM system make it easier for even unskilled engineers to generate NC programs. In the NC program, the end-milling conditions are decided by engineers. However, engineers need to decide the order of the process, cutting tool selection, and the end-milling conditions on the basis of their expertise and background knowledge because the CAM system cannot automatically decide. Data-mining methods were used to support decisions about end-milling conditions. Our aim was to extract new knowledge by applying data-mining techniques to a tool catalog. We used both hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering of catalog data and also used applied multiple regression analysis. We focused on the shape element of catalog data and we visually grouped ball end-mills from the viewpoint of tool shape, which here meant the ratio of dimensions, by using the k-means method. We also found an expression for calculating end-milling conditions, and we compared the calculated with the catalog values.

TopoSUB: a tool for efficient large area numerical modelling in complex topography at sub-grid scales	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							HETEROGENEOUS LAND SURFACES; FUZZY K-MEANS; CLIMATE MODELS; MASS-BALANCE; PERMAFROST; RESOLUTION; ENERGY; WATER; ALPS; PARAMETERIZATION	Mountain regions are highly sensitive to global climate change. However, large scale assessments of mountain environments remain problematic due to the high resolution required of model grids to capture strong lateral variability. To alleviate this, tools are required to bridge the scale gap between gridded climate datasets (climate models and reanalyses) and mountain topography. We address this problem with a sub-grid method. It relies on sampling the most important aspects of land surface heterogeneity through a lumped scheme, allowing for the application of numerical land surface models (LSMs) over large areas in mountain regions or other heterogeneous environments. This is achieved by including the effect of mountain topography on these processes at the sub-grid scale using a multidimensional informed sampling procedure together with a 1-D lumped model that can be driven by gridded climate datasets. This paper provides a description of this sub-grid scheme, TopoSUB, and assesses its performance against a distributed model. We demonstrate the ability of TopoSUB to approximate results simulated by a distributed numerical LSM at around 104 less computations. These significant gains in computing resources allow for: (1) numerical modelling of processes at fine grid resolutions over large areas; (2) efficient statistical descriptions of sub-grid behaviour; (3) a "sub-grid aware" aggregation of simulated variables to coarse grids; and (4) freeing of resources for computationally intensive tasks, e. g., the treatment of uncertainty in the modelling process.

One important step for managing and querying such sensor network data is to create abstractions of the data in the form of models. These models can then be stored, retrieved, and queried, as required. In our OpenSense(1) project, we advocate an adaptive model-cover driven strategy towards effectively managing such data. Our strategy is designed considering the fundamental principles of LCSNs. We describe an adaptive approach, called adaptive k-means, and report preliminary results on how it compares with the traditional grid-based approach towards modeling LCSN data.

Improving Multi-target Tracking via Social Grouping	2012 IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION (CVPR)	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)	JUN 16-21, 2012	Providence, RI	IEEE				We address the problem of multi-person data-association-based tracking (DAT) in semi-crowded environments from a single camera. Existing tracklet-association-based methods using purely visual cues (like appearance and motion information) show impressive results but rely on heavy training, a number of tuned parameters, and sophisticated detectors to cope with visual ambiguities within the video and low-level processing errors. In this work, we consider clustering dynamics to mitigate such ambiguities. This leads to a general optimization framework that adds social grouping behavior (SGB) to any basic affinity model. We formulate this as a nonlinear global optimization problem to maximize the consistency of visual and grouping cues for trajectories in both tracklet-tracklet linking space and tracklet-grouping assignment space. We formulate the Lagrange dual and solve it using a two-stage iterative algorithm, employing the Hungarian algorithm and K-means clustering. We build SGB upon a simple affinity model and show very promising performance on two publicly available real-world datasets with different tracklet extraction methods.

Traditional k-means is an iterative algorithm in each iteration new cluster centers are computed and each data point is re-assigned to its nearest center. The cluster re-assignment step becomes prohibitively expensive when the number of data points and cluster centers are large. In this paper, we propose a novel approximate k-means algorithm to greatly reduce the computational complexity in the assignment step. Our approach is motivated by the observation that most active points changing their cluster assignments at each iteration are located on or near cluster boundaries. The idea is to efficiently identify those active points by pre-assembling the data into groups of neighboring points using multiple random spatial partition trees, and to use the neighborhood information to construct a closure for each cluster, in such a way only a small number of cluster candidates need to be considered when assigning a data point to its nearest cluster. Using complexity analysis, real data clustering, and applications to image retrieval, we show that our approach out-performs state-of-the-art approximate k-means algorithms in terms of clustering quality and efficiency.

It uses the k-means to extract the background and foreground of a picture, which contains the information of a person dressed up with a color cloth in a complex background. The first step aims to recognize the position of the cloth content and lows the influence of the background. After the first step of k-means, we reconstruct the image as the clustering data for the second step of mean shift. The recognition effect achieves above 85% by calculating the distance of the clustering center of our color model of pixel, comparing to the database with the accurately color map of our clothes' images. The experiment of our approach shows that the two-steps k-means and mean shift of color recognition is improved. We developed a color recognition system of clothes for the image searching using that approach and the recognition performance is optimized.

The first step to adapt instruction to group of learners is learners grouping. Many methods have used to group learners in e-learning environment specially data mining techniques such as clustering methods. This paper aims to propose a clustering method to group learners using some specific learners' observable behavior while working by system and based on cognitive style. The objective function of proposed method is defined by considering two criteria in measuring the clustering goodness, compactness and separation, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method is used to optimize the objective function. This method used to group learners based on cognitive style. Results of the proposed method are compared with K-means, fuzzy C-means, and EFC methods using Davies-Bouldin cluster validity index and comparing the achieved groups and the cognitive style of learners who are in the same group, shows that the grouping accuracy is in a higher level using fuzzy-inspired PSO method and this method has the better clustering performance than the others and groups similar learners in one cluster.

This paper focuses on the middle issue and describes a new scheme for iris preprocessing from an image sequence. We must assess the quality of the image sequence and select the clear one from this sequence to the next step. After detecting the pupil coarsely, we get the radius and center coordinate. We can extract local texture features of the iris as our eigenvector, then utilize k-means clustering algorithm to classify the defocused, blurred and occluded image from clear iris image. This method obviously decreases the quality assessment time, especially some people's iris texture are not distinct. Experiments show the proposed method has an encouraging performance.

Many clustering algorithms and alignment-free similarity measures have been used to analyze gene family. The clustering results can be influenced by the similarity measure and clustering algorithm used. We compare the results from running four commonly used clustering methods, including K-means, single-linkage clustering, complete-linkage clustering and average-linkage clustering, on three alignment-free similarity measures. We try to find out which method should provide the best clustering result based on real-world gene family datasets. Experiment results show that average-linkage clustering with our similarity measure, DMk, performed best.

Typically, the k-means algorithm treats all features fairly and sets weights of all features equally when evaluating dissimilarity. However, experiment results show that a meaningful clustering phenomenon often occurs in a subspace defined by some specific features. Different dimensions make contributions to the identification of points in a cluster. The contribution of a dimension is represented as a weight that can be treated as the degree of the dimension in contribution to the cluster. This paper first proposes Weight in Competitive K-means (WCKM). which derives from Improved K-means and Entropy Weighting K-means. By adding weights to the objective function, the contributions from, each feature of each clustering could simultaneously minimize the dispersion within clusters and maximize the separation between clusters. The proposed algorithm is confirmed by experiments on real data sets.

The Performance Analysis of a Novel Enhanced Artificial Bee Colony Inspired Global Best Harmony Search Algorithm for Clustering	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS DESIGN AND INTELLIGENT APPLICATIONS 2012 (INDIA 2012)	Advances in Intelligent and Soft Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Information Systems Design and Intelligent Applications (INDIA 2012)	JAN 05-07, 2012	Visakhapatnam, INDIA	Comp Soc India, Vishakhapatnam Chapter			OPTIMIZATION	Clustering is the unsupervised classification of data items of patterns into groups, each of which should be as homogeneous as possible. The problem of clustering has been addressed in many contexts in many disciplines and this reflects its broad appeal and usefulness in exploratory data analysis. This paper presents a new clustering algorithm, called GHSBEEK which is a combination of the Global best Harmony search (GHS) with features of Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) and K-means algorithms. Global-best Harmony search (GHS) is a derivative-free optimization algorithm, which draws inspiration from the musical process of searching for a perfect state of harmony. It has a remarkable advantage of algorithm simplicity. However, it suffers from a slow search speed. The ABC algorithm is applied to improve the members of the Harmony Memory based on their fitness values and hence improves the convergence rate of the Harmony Search method. The GHSBEEK algorithm has been used for data clustering on several benchmark data sets. The clustering performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the GHS, PSO, and K-means. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other algorithms in terms of accuracy, robustness, and convergence speed.

The paper aims at developing an appropriate data mining methodology to extract knowledge about the characteristics of diseases by analyzing the images acquired from the field. Since all features are not equally involved in classifying diseases; selection of optimum features is a challenging task to address the problem. The work is performed in three steps. Firstly, thirty six features of different category are extracted from the diseased plant images using image processing techniques. Then, images with respect to each attribute are clustered by k-means algorithm where k is the number of class labels of the diseases. Cluster validity indices are computed using the proposed and existing techniques. Finally, all the computed indices are fused and based on that score of the attributes is calculated. The attributes having scores greater than average score are considered as optimal feature set. With the reduced feature set, classification accuracy is calculated by applying the proposed method on four hundred fifty infected rice plant images and compared with other classifiers demonstrating effectiveness of the proposed model.

The procedure follows a simple and easy way to classify a given data set through a certain number of clusters (assume k-clusters) fixed a priori. We recommend on the design of fitness functions for genetic-based information retrieval experiments. This paper focuses on the problem of index page synthesis where an index page consists of a set of links that cover a particular topic. Its basic approach is to analyze web access logs, find groups of pages that often occur together in user visits and convert them into index pages. Grouping of pages can efficiently be done by clustering method. In this paper we have used the K-means algorithm for the purpose. Also considered is a fitness function that will find out the fitness value of a document & thus clusters are formed.

Dataset handling in high-dimensional spaces presents complicated problems, such as the degradation of data accessing, data manipulating as well as query processing performance. Dimensionality reduction efficiently tackles this problem and benefited us to visualize the intrinsic properties hidden in the dataset. The proposed method first generates decision attribute by computing the class label of each gene using clustering technique and subsequently computes the score of each sample of microarray cancerous gene data based on decision attribute using the division operation of relational algebra and select the samples with score below the average score as initial reduct. The reduced dataset is grouped into k clusters by k-means algorithm where, k is the set of values of decision attribute and matching factor of reduct is computed by considering the overlapping of clusters with the original classes of genes. Other samples are added iteratively one at a time based on their increasing score provided computed matching factor improved and thus final reduct known as optimal set of samples is obtained.

Analysis of Similarity Measures with WordNet Based Text Document Clustering	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS DESIGN AND INTELLIGENT APPLICATIONS 2012 (INDIA 2012)	Advances in Intelligent and Soft Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Information Systems Design and Intelligent Applications (INDIA 2012)	JAN 05-07, 2012	Visakhapatnam, INDIA	Comp Soc India, Vishakhapatnam Chapter				Text Document Clustering aids in reorganizing the large collections of documents into a smaller number of manageable clusters. While several clustering methods and the associated similarity measures have been proposed in the past, the partition clustering algorithms are reported performing well on document clustering. Usually cosine function is used to measure the similarity between two documents in the criterion function, but it may not work well when the clusters are not well separated. Word meanings are better than word forms in terms of representing the topics of documents. Thus, here we have involved ontology into the text clustering algorithm. In this research WordNet based document representation is attempted by assigning each word a part-of-speech (POS) tag and by enriching the tag-of-words' data representation with synset concept which corresponds to synonym set that is introduced by WordNet. After replacing the 'bag of words' with their respective Synset IDs a variant of K-Means algorithm is used for document clustering. Then we compare the three popular similarity measures (Cosine, Pearson Correlation Coefficient and extended Jaccard) in conjunction with different types of vector space representation (Term Frequency and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) of documents.

Unlike existing uses of semi-supervised learning, our methodology does not assume the presence of labels from part of the data, but rather, each of the different domains of the data separately undergoes an unsupervised learning process, while sending and receiving supervised information in the form of data constraints to/from the other domains. The entire process is an alternation of semi-supervised learning stages on the different data domains, based on Basu et al.'s Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) variation of the K-means algorithm for semi-supervised clustering that combines the constraint-based and distance-based approaches in a unified model. Our experiments demonstrate a successful mutual semi-supervision between the different domains during clustering, that is superior to the traditional heterogeneous domain clustering baselines consisting of converting the domains to a single domain or clustering each of the domains separately.

For data segmentation, value of fatigue damage and global statistical signal analysis such as kurtosis was obtained using specific software. Data clustering were carried out using K-Mean clustering approaches. The objective function was calculated in order to determine the best numbers of groups. This method is used to calculate the average distance of each data in the group from its centroid. Finally, the fatigue failure indexes of metallic components were generated from the best number of group that has been acquired. Based on four data collect from two different roads which are D1, D2, the index value generated is not the same for all of data because due to K-Mean clustering, the best group is different for each of the data used. The maximum indexes generated are different for two types of road and namely the index 4 for D1 and index 5 for D2. Due to the road surface condition, higher distributions of the best groups give higher values of index and reflect to higher fatigue damage experienced by the system.	[Yunoh, M. F.

However, in real-world computational analysis, such data common meet with the curse of dimensionality due to the tens of thousands of measures of gene expression level versus the small number of samples. therefore, developing effective clustering method is a challenging problem for high dimensional dataset. Here, we use two step feature filtering and dimensional reduction methods to reduce the dimension of gene expression data. At first, we extract a subset of genes based on ReliefF and Fast Correlation-Based Filter (FCBF). Then, the clustering approach of k-means (KM), KM with principal component analysis (PCA), KM with random projection (RP), respectively is implemented on the reduced gene dataset and generates the resulting data of clusters of cancer samples. Experimental results on the small round blue-cell tumor (SRBCT) data set demonstrate that two step feature filtering can significantly improve the performance of KM clustering algorithm and contribute to the application of PCA and RP in high dimensional space and that the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed scheme in addressing high dimensional gene expression data.

Firstly, a lifting wavelet transform is adopted to represent an original image in different resolutions; Secondly, attain the low frequency sub-image and execute an initial segmentation and a multi-level segmentation; Lastly, the spatial domain transform is applied on the segmentation result of the wavelet domain to revise the segmentation results and to get an accurate outcome. The algorithms of the initial and multi-level segmentation in wavelet domain are K-means improved by SAPSO and MAP/ICM. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a good robustness.

J	Gholizadeh, H; Zoej, MJV; Mojaradi, B			IEEE	Gholizadeh, Hamed; Zoej, Mohammad Javad Valadan; Mojaradi, Barat			A Decision Fusion Approach for Clustering of Hyperspectral Data Using Spectral Unmixing Methods	2012 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 03-10, 2012	Big Sky, MT	IEEE, AIAA, Phmsoc, AESS			ALGORITHM	This paper aims at a decision fusion approach for combining three spectral unmixing methods to cluster hyperspectral data. Unlike standard image clustering techniques, analyzing hyperspectral data on a pure pixel basis may not be a true assumption. Meanwhile, multiple classifier systems often show better performance than each of the constituent classifiers. This is due to the fact that each classifier makes errors on different regions of the input space. With these facts in mind, this paper distills these two approaches into a single approach and exploits the advantages of both spectral unmixing algorithms and decision fusion methods. In this paper, three unmixing methods namely, Fully Constrained Least Squares (FCLS), Nonnegatively Constrained Least Squares (NCLS) and Sum-to-one Constrained Least Squares (SCLS) are employed as the ensemble classifiers and their results are combined at two different fusion levels: the abstract level and the measurement level. Experimental results on a real-world hyperspectral data proved that the proposed approach shows better clustering results compared to those of K-Means and Fuzzy c-Means in terms of the Adjusted Random Index (ARI) measure.

The proposed clustering method consists of three major steps: endmember extraction, unmixing procedure and hardening process via the winner-takes-all approach. To estimate the optimal number of endmembers, instead of using the background signal subspace identification methods, the number of endmembers is varied in a predefined interval and the commonly accepted VCA (Vertex Component Analysis) algorithm is employed to extract the endmembers' spectra. At each iteration, the bandwise Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the reconstructed image, obtained from estimated fractions. and the original image is computed and the mean of all bandwise RMSEs is regarded as a measure to choose the optimum number of endmembers. Experiments conducted on the Indian Pines challenging dataset proved the superiority of proposed method over the K-Means and Fuzzy c-Means methods in terms of the widely used Adjusted Rand Index measure.

The fault forecasting engine is designed as part of development of expert system shell for power plants. It is a hybrid approach incorporating data mining, fault models, clustering and time series analysis. For real time monitoring of plant condition, graphical models are constructed by K means clustering algorithm. To build the time series value forecasting model, Multilayer Perceptron (M LP) based neural network is used. By using latest history data base of SCADA system training and testing of the models are done. Models once created, is updated in the model library for providing adaptive nature to the proposed system. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) of the forecasting engine displays the variation of all sensor values affecting a particular fault for next time instances.

The automatic method proposed is composed by two phases: one for designing the individual classifiers and one for clustering patterns of training set and search specialized classifiers for each cluster found. The performed experiments adopted the artificial neural networks in the classification phase and k-means in clustering phase. Adaptive differential evolution has been used in this work in order to optimize the parameters and performance of the different techniques used in classification and clustering phases. The experimental results have shown that the proposed method has better performance than manual methods and significantly outperforms most of the methods commonly used to combine multiple classifiers using the fusion version for a set of 7 benchmark problems.

As nonparametric probability density function estimation methods make no assumptions about the probability distribution of a dataset, this paper applies kernel density estimation to construct the initial boundaries surrounding the normal data points. Afterwards, the level set method makes the initial boundaries shrink or expand to better fit the normal data distribution and optimize the boundary surfaces. The proposed method is able to smooth the boundary's evolution automatically while merging or splitting happens. The boundary motion is governed by partial differential equations which formulate the dynamics of the level set method. The proposed novelty detection method is compared with four representative existing methods: support vector data description, nearest neighbours data description, mixture of Gaussian and k-means. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed level set based method presents a comparable performance as mixture of Gaussian, which performs best in terms of false negative and false positive rates.

Due to the low dependability of individual nodes, small radio coverage and large areas to be monitored, the organization of nodes in small clusters is generally used. Moreover, a large number of WSN nodes is usually deployed in the monitoring area to increase WSN dependability. Therefore, the best cluster head positioning is a desirable characteristic in a WSN. In this paper, we propose a hybrid clustering algorithm based on community detection in complex networks and traditional K-means clustering technique: the QK-Means algorithm. Simulation results show that QK-Means detect communities and sub-communities thus lost message rate is decreased and WSN coverage is increased.

We propose a novel technique called Dynamically Weighted Classification with Clustering (DWCC), which explores hidden states in non-stationary EEG using a modified k-means clustering method by combining cosine distance measure and mutual information criterion. DWCC builds a set of classifiers, one for each pair of clusters from different classes. A dynamically-weighted classifier ensemble network is trained to combine the outputs of the classifiers, where we propose to dynamically assign the weight of a classifier for each test sample based on its distances to the cluster centres associated with the classifier. Experimental results on publicly available BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a yielded a mean accuracy of 81.5% which is statistically significant (t-test p<0.05) compared to the baseline result of 75.9% using a single classifier.

We consider the problem of removing the noise in the training samples and generating more samples at the same time. To accomplish this, we extended the matrix rank minimization problem to cope with complex data. Samples from the same class are segmented into several groups by k-means clustering algorithm, and matrix rank minimization is applied on the clustered data to separate the noises and recover the low-rank structures in the grouped data. An over-complete dictionary is constructed by connecting the low-rank structures and the training samples together to keep the samples diversity. Sparse representation is operated based on this over-complete dictionary for recognition. Furthermore, a parameter is introduced to adjust the weighting of the coefficients that code the noises. We apply the proposed algorithm for character and face recognition. Experiments with improved performances validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Clustering techniques are broadly used in solving the permutation problem, however, some challenges still exist, for example, elongated datasets should be handled, and constraint from the background knowledge must be considered. Inspired by various successful applications of kernel and spectral clustering methods in machine learning and data mining community, we try to solve the permutation problem by these methods. In this paper, the weighted kernel k-means algorithm is modified according to the specific requirement of the permutation problem, and the spectral interpretation of the kernel approach is also investigated. In addition, we propose several kernel construction approaches to improving the permutation performance. Different experiments are carried out on a uniform platform, and show better performance of the proposed approach.

Circle-Clustering: A New Heuristic Partitioning Method for the Clustering Problem	2012 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	JUN 10-15, 2012	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA			component; heuristic clustering techniques; mixed integer programming	MODEL	This paper present a novel method to perform clustering of time-series and static data. The method, named Circle-Clustering (CirCle), could be classified as a partition method that uses criteria from SVM and hierarchical methods to perform a better clustering. Different heuristic clustering techniques were tested against the CirCle method by using data sets from UCI Machine Learning Repository. In all tests, CirCle obtained good results and outperformed most of clustering techniques considered in this work. In addition, CirCle was tested against others heuristic techniques considering time-series data from electric feeders in Santiago, Chile's capital city. The optimal solution of the min-cut clustering optimization problem was solved in order to identify the optimal solution for 883 datasets. The results show that the proposed method obtains an average of 81% of well-classified samples in all datasets. Also, as compared to other algorithms, CirCle made a better classification in 98.7% of the datasets as compared to the Model-Base Best BIC. As compared to K-means, Robust K-means and Ward's methods the new algorithm classified better in nearly 68% of the datasets.

The final contents of clusters in some clustering algorithms like k-means depend on the initialization of clustering parameters like cluster centres. Layered cluster oriented ensemble classifier is based on this philosophy where the base classifiers are trained on clusters generated at multiple layers from random initialization of cluster centres. As the data is clustered into multiple layers some patterns move between clusters (unstable patterns). This instability of patterns brings in diversity among the base classifiers that in turn influences the accuracy of the ensemble classifier. There is thus a connection between the instability of the patterns and the accuracy of layered cluster oriented ensemble classifier. The research presented in this paper aims to find this connection by investigating the influence of unstable patterns on the overall ensemble classifier accuracy as well as diversity among the base classifiers. We have provided results from a number of experiments to quantify this influence.

Particularly, in-network data fusion techniques are very important to applications such as target classification and tracking to reduce the communication burden in these constrained networks. However, the efficiency of the solution can be affected by the data correlation among several sensor nodes. Thus, the application of value fusion (for clusters of nodes with correlated measurements) and decision fusion (combining the local decisions of the clusters) is a common strategy. In this work, we propose an algorithm for properly selecting the groups of nodes with correlated measurements. Experiments show that our algorithm is 30% better than a solution that considers only the spatial coherence regions.	[Ribas, Afonso D.; Figueiredo, Carlos M.

This paper introduces a novel unsupervised approach for clustering multidimensional time series that present the 3-d acceleration data measured with body-worn accelerometers. More specifically, the proposed approach uses a statistical model based on Multiple Hidden Markov Model Regression (MHMMR) to automatically analyze the human activity. This method takes into account the sequential appearance and temporal evolution of the data to easily detect static and dynamic activities. Comparisons with existing unsupervised approaches, including the standard Gaussian Mixture Model, the k-means algorithm, the DBSCAN algorithm and the standard HMM, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The training dictionary is composed by labeled samples directly, and both training dictionary and testing sample are mapped into feature space from original sample space by the sparse kernel which employs the "center" samples matrix constructed by a method similar to k-means clustering. Then in the feature space, the basic sparse representation based classification method is employed. We test our proposed algorithm on some different public database, and the results show that our proposed method can achieve higher classification accuracy without much time consumed.

J	Hirose, K; Higuchi, T				Hirose, Kei; Higuchi, Tomoyuki			Creating facial animation of characters via MoCap data	JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						3D facial animation; fused lasso; interpolation; kernel k-means; MoCap data		We consider the problem of generating 3D facial animation of characters. An efficient procedure is realized by using the motion capture data (MoCap data), which is obtained by tracking the facial markers from an actor/actress. In some cases of artistic animation, the MoCap actor/actress and the 3D character facial animation show different expressions. For example, from the original facial MoCap data of speaking, a user would like to create the character facial animation of speaking with a smirk. In this paper, we propose a new easy-to-use system for making character facial animation via MoCap data. Our system is based on the interpolation: once the character facial expressions of the starting and the ending frames are given, the intermediate frames are automatically generated by information from the MoCap data. The interpolation procedure consists of three stages. First, the time axis of animation is divided into several intervals by the fused lasso signal approximator. In the second stage, we use the kernel k-means clustering to obtain control points. Finally, the interpolation is realized by using the control points. The user can easily create a wide variety of 3D character facial expressions by changing the control points.

Application of k-means and Gaussian mixture model for classification of seismic activities in Istanbul	NONLINEAR PROCESSES IN GEOPHYSICS			English	Article							ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; QUARRY BLASTS; AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION; REGIONAL DATA; DISCRIMINATION; EVENTS; EARTHQUAKES; EXPLOSIONS; MICROEARTHQUAKES; IDENTIFICATION	Two unsupervised pattern recognition algorithms, k-means, and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) analyses have been applied to classify seismic events in the vicinity of Istanbul. Earthquakes, which are occurring at different seismicity rates and extensions of the Thrace-Eskisehir Fault Zone and the North Anatolian Fault (NAF), Turkey, are being contaminated by quarries operated around Istanbul. We have used two time variant parameters, complexity, the ratio of integrated powers of the velocity seismogram, and S/P amplitude ratio as classifiers by using waveforms of 179 events (1.8 < M < 3.0). We have compared two algorithms with classical multivariate linear/quadratic discriminant analyses. The total accuracies of the models for GMM, k-means, linear discriminant function (LDF), and quadratic discriminant function (QDF) are 96.1 %, 95.0 %, 96.1 %, 96.6 %, respectively. The performances of models are discussed for earthquakes and quarry blasts separately. All methods clustered the seismic events acceptably where QDF slightly gave better improvements compared to others. We have found that unsupervised clustering algorithms, for which no a-prior target information is available, display a similar discriminatory power as supervised methods of discriminant analysis.

The developed algorithms cover several steps: pre-processing, image segmentation, nuclei and cytoplasm detection, feature calculation, and classification. The K-means clustering algorithm based on colour segmentation is used to segment cervical biopsy images into five regions: background, nuclei, red blood cell, stroma and cytoplasm. The morphological characteristics of cervical cells are used for feature extraction of cervical histopathology images. The cervical histopathology images are classified using four well known discriminatory features: 1) the ratio of nuclei to cytoplasm, 2) the diameter of nuclei, 3) the shape factor and 4) the compactness of nuclei. Finally, the images are analysed and classified into appropriate classes. This method is utilised to classify the cervical biopsy images into normal, pre-cancer (Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN)1, CIN2, CIN3) and malignant.

The zero crossing value is computed for each pixel in the Laplacian-filtered image to found edges in four directions. K-means is then used to classify all the pixels of the filtered image into two clusters: text and non-text. For each candidate text region, the corresponding region in the canny edge map of the input image undergoes projection profile analysis to determine the boundary of the text blocks. Finally, we employ empirical rules to eliminate false positives based on geometrical properties. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is able to detect texts of different fonts, contrasts and backgrounds. Moreover, it outperforms four existing algorithms in terms of detection and false positive rates.	[Ahmad, Ashraf M.

STATISTICAL MID-LEVEL FEATURES FOR BUILDING-UP AREA EXTRACTION FROM FULL POLARIMETRIC SAR IMAGERY	PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH-PIER			English	Article							SCATTERING MODEL; DECOMPOSITION; CLASSIFICATION	This paper addresses the problem of designing statistical features for the extraction of building-up areas (BAs) from highresolution polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) imagery. The idea is to represent a building-up area by the distribution of its mid-level components, called intermediates, which are statistical patterns unsupervisedly learnt from PolSAR images. More precisely, by analyzing the structural properties and the polarimetric characteristics exhibited in various terrain types, we propose two kinds of midlevel features for small regions: the cluster based statistical feature (CSF) and the scattering mechanism based statistical feature (SMSF). In detail, for the CSF, the intermediates are the K-mean clusters with Wishart distance of the PolSAR images; for the SMSF, the intermediates are the scattering mechanism categories obtained by relying on a four-component decomposition with deorientation of the PolSAR images. In contrast with existing features for describing BAs, the proposed features, i.e., CSF and SMSF, capture more complex context information of BAs. We compare the proposed features with those based on the Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) models, which have been proven to be suitable for BAs mapping. Experimental results on RADARSAT-2 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed features.

Model specimens are fabricated to obtain expected damage mechanisms during tensile testing. Then, relationship among AE descriptors is studied by hierarchical cluster analysis, and AE signals are classified by k-means algorithm. Finally, an artificial neural network (ANN) is created and trained by various optimal algorithms to identify damage mechanisms. The results reveal that typical damage mechanisms in PE self-reinforced composite can be classified in terms of the similarity between AE signals and identified by a well trained ANN.

QoE, though embodying the subjective measures of the end user's perceived quality, can be expressed in relation to some quality of service (QoS) parameters. Having information on content types in modelling QoE-QoS interactions is advantageous as videos with the same QoS parameters may have different subjective scores due to different content types. Consequently, using content clustering with the help of spatio-temporal activities within depth layers, QoE predictor is designed per each content cluster utilising full reference (FR) and no reference (NR) metrics. Finally, the performance of the proposed QoE prediction algorithm is evaluated extensively and the overall measure of success value equal to 95.4% is achieved for the test sequences. This model can be applied for QoE control in video provisioning systems.	[Malekmohamadi, Hossein; Fernando, W. A. C.; Kondoz, A.

Existing side channel attacks and corresponding countermeasures focus primarily on packet length, packet timing, web object size and web flow size. However, we found that encrypted web traffic can also leak information via network delay between a user and the web sites that she visits. Motivated by this observation, we investigate a novel network-delay based side-channel attack to infer web sites visited by a user. The adversary can utilize pattern recognition techniques to differentiate web sites by measuring sample mean and sample variance of the round-trip time (RTT) between a victim user and web sites. We theoretically analyzed the damage caused by such an adversary and derived closed-form formulae for detection rate, the probability that the adversary correctly recognizes a web site. To defeat this side-channel attack, we proposed several countermeasures. The basic idea is to shape traffic from different web sites so that they have similar RTT statistics. We proposed the strategies based on the k-means clustering and K-Anonymity to ensure that traffic shaping will not cause excessive delay while providing a predictable degree of anonymity. We conducted extensive experiments and our empirical results match our theory very well.

We consider this problem in a bag of features like setting and propose a new, learned, local feature descriptor for RGB-D images, the convolutional k-means descriptor. The descriptor is based on recent results from the machine learning community. It automatically learns feature responses in the neighborhood of detected interest points and is able to combine all available information, such as color and depth into one, concise representation. To demonstrate the strength of this approach we show its applicability to different recognition problems. We evaluate the quality of the descriptor on the RGB-D Object Dataset where it is competitive with previously published results and propose an embedding into an image processing pipeline for object recognition and pose estimation.

We first simulated tactile feedback using a soft finger contact model in GraspIt! [1] and computed tactile contacts of thousands of grasps with a robotic hand using the Columbia Grasp Database [2]. We used the K-means clustering method to learn a contact dictionary from the tactile contacts, which is a codebook that models the contact space. The feature vector for a grasp is a histogram computed based on the distribution of its contacts over the contact space defined by the dictionary. An SVM is then trained to predict the stability of a robotic grasp given this feature vector. Experiments indicate that this model which requires low-dimension feature input is useful in predicting the stability of a grasp.

The between-class variance thresholding, entropy-based segmentation, and K-means clustering are applied to segment target and clutter regions. Real 2D polarimetric images are used to demonstrate that simple histogram-based segmentation methods produce either comparable or improved performance over the Likelihood Ratio Tests (LRT) detector. Specifically, the results show that, for the cases considered, the entropy-based segmentation outperforms the other image segmentation methods and the LRT detector.	[Seng, C.

These are indicative of unresolved magnetic structures and/or gradients along the line of sight that have been overlooked in the inversion analyses performed so far. The interpretation of the complex shapes of SOT/SP Stokes V profiles for the understanding of the quiet Sun magnetism must be seriously considered in the near future. In fact, Stokes V profiles significantly deviating from an antisymmetric shape are rather common in the quiet Sun and, in particular, in intranetwork (IN) regions. Here we present the results of the analysis of the shapes of SOT/SP Stokes V profiles performed through a k-means classification. Such an analysis aims at defining different profile classes representative of SOT/SP polarization measurements. We found that about 35 classes can be defined from quiet Sun measurements. Among these, two main subsets can be recognized: network profiles and IN profiles. Approximately 34% of quiet Sun profiles present important asymmetries. From such results, it follows that new inversion techniques able to reproduce line asymmetries must be considered in future analyses of Hinode SOT/SP measurements. The number of line shapes to be reproduced by such analyses is finite and small.

The algorithm adopts max-min principle to determine initial cluster centers of K-means clustering algorithm. Comparison of clustering effects of the new method with that of muilt-restart K-means clustering algorithm on artificial data set showed the better effect and the greater excellence of max-min principle. Then, the max-min K-means clustering algorithm was applied to analyze vibration response signal of cylindrical shell automatic in order to discover space distribution feature of dynamics response. Clustering results tallied with feature of dynamic response of cylindrical shell, which validated the effectiveness and reasonableness of the new clustering method itself.

One of the key issues in multi robot exploration is how to assign target locations to the individual robots and how to better distribute the robots over the environment. The proposed technique applies a well-known unsupervised clustering algorithm (k-means) in order to fairly divide the space into as many disjoint regions as available robots. Hungarian Method is used for the assignment of robots to the individual regions with the task to explore the corresponding area. To drive the robots around the environment, a frontier 'regions on the boundary between open space and unexplored space' based navigation strategy is used to decide where to move next, according to the data collected so far. Furthermore, we discuss improvements to the frontier based exploration strategy, by pruning the frontier cells that further reduces the computational time. The numbers of candidate locations are evaluated based on three criteria: number of unknown cells, number of known cells and real path travelling cost. Simulations are presented to show the performance of the proposed technique. This method can best be applied in search and rescue operations, partitioning helps to explore different regions of the workspace parallely by different robots instead of concentrating efforts in particular spot, pruning helps to make movement decisions much faster, the result is that the potential victims in a region will not have to wait much longer.			anshika@iiitm.ac.in; ritutiwari@iiitm.ac.in; anupamshukla@iiitm.ac.in					Al-Khawaldah M., 2010, INT J CIRCUIT SYSTEM, V4; Burgard W, 2005, IEEE T ROBOT, V21, P376, DOI 10.1109/TRO.2004.839232; Burgard W., 2000, P IEEE INT C ROB AUT, V1, P476, DOI 10.1109/ROBOT.2000.844100; Choset H, 2001, ANN MATH ARTIF INTEL, V31, P113, DOI 10.1023/A:1016639210559; Fox D, 2006, P IEEE, V94, P1325, DOI [10.1109/JPROC.2006.876927, 10.1109/JPROC.2006.879927]; Ge S.S., 2005, IEEE INT C ROB AUT, P727; Hartigan JA, 2002, J ROYAL STAT SOC C, V28, P100, DOI DOI 10.2307/2346830; Howard A., 2002, 6 INT S DISTR AUT RO, V5, P299; Kuhn H.W., 1955, NAV RES LOG, V2, P83, DOI DOI 10.1002/NAV.3800020109; Latimer D., 2002, IEEE INT C ROB AUT, P961; Mataric M.

The clock gating strategy employed has a huge bearing on the clock tree synthesis quality along with the impact to leakage and dynamic power. This paper proposes a technique for clock gate optimization to aid clock tree synthesis. The technique enables cloning and redistribution of the fanout among the existing equivalent clock gates. The technique is placement aware and hence reduces overall clock wire length and area. The method involves employing the "k-means clustering algorithm" to geographically partition the design's registers. This enables better clock tree quality entitlement during clock tree synthesis in terms of clock tree area, power and better local skew distribution. The paper highlights the utility of this technique by showcasing the clock tree synthesis quality of results improvement on a complex design.

There are two scenarios that are studied in determining the near-optimal placement of monitoring wells: (1) placement of an entirely new network and (2) placement of additional monitoring wells within a previously placed network. The key technique utilized in this strategy minimizes the variance of spatial analysis using Geostatistical analysis and optimizes using Monte Carlo analysis. A clustering technique, namely k-means, is used in the second scenario to determine specific locations of importance relative to previously placed monitoring wells. This strategy is applied to chromium contamination at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The purpose is the determination of monitoring well placement to detect potential contaminant arrival in a regional aquifer located at Sandia and Mortandad Canyons.

Unlike other clustering algorithms, QTC does not require knowing the number of clusters a priori, however, its perceived need for high computing power often makes it an unattractive choice. This paper presents a thorough study of QTC. We analyze the worst case complexity of the algorithm and discuss methods to reduce it by trading memory for computation. We also demonstrate how the expected running time of QTC is affected by the structure of the input data. We describe how QTC can be parallelized, and discuss implementation details of our thread-parallel, GPU, and distributed memory implementations of the algorithm. We demonstrate the efficiency of our implementations through experimental data. We show how data sets with tens of thousands of elements can be clustered in a matter of minutes in a modern GPU, and seconds in a small scale cluster of multi-core CPUs, or multiple GPUs. Finally, we discuss how user selected parameters, as well as algorithmic and implementation choices, affect performance.

We address the problem of fair resource allocation for SC-FDE minimum mean square error (MMSE) receivers. In particular, relays are classified into multiple disjoint clusters through the K-means algorithm, where each cluster is identified by a centroid. The centroids of the clusters are directly related to the average amount of resources available to the relays belonging to that cluster, as well as the quality of the relaying links. The final centroids of the clusters after the convergence of the K-means algorithm, are used to generate contribution factors for each group. Different sub-channels are further associated with uniform random distribution where the thresholds of the uniform random variables are associated with the clusters contribution factors. RFRC for SC-FDE proves superior SER performance as well as improved diversity gain which is achieved by randomizing the allocation. The employed algorithm further improves the performance by optimizing the number of clusters. Numerical results are provided to corroborate the mathematical modeling.

To launch reliable and trusted vehicular communications, one prerequisite is to ensure peer vehicles' credibility, by means of digital certificate validation from messages that are sent out by other vehicles. However, in vehicular communication systems, certificate validation is more time sensitive than in traditional networks, because each vehicle receives a large number of messages in a short period of time. Another issue that needs to be tackled is the unsuccessful delivery of information between vehicles and other entities on the road due to their high rate of mobility. For these reasons, we need new solutions to speed up the process of certificate validation. In this article, we propose a certificate revocation status validation scheme; this uses the concept of clustering in the realm of data mining, which can meet the aforementioned requirements. We employ the technique of k-means clustering to boost up the efficiency of certificate validation, thereby enhancing the security of VANETs. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis in terms of security for the scheme is presented; and the analytical results demonstrate that this scheme can effectively improve the validation of a certificate, thus securing the vehicular communication in vehicular networks.

The method based on K_means clustering algorithm was used to implement unsupervised segmentation of the disease images. Fifty shape, color and texture features were extracted from the images of the diseases. Support vector machine (SVM) classifier for the diseases was designed based on thirty-one effective selected features. The training recognition rates of these two kinds of grape diseases were both 100%, and the testing recognition rates of grape downy mildew and grape powdery mildew were 90% and 93.33%, respectively. The recognition results using the SVMs with different kernels indicated that the SVM with linear kernel was the most suitable for image recognition of the diseases. This study provided an effective way for rapid and accurate identification and diagnosis of plant diseases, and also provided a basis and reference for further development of automatic diagnosis system for plant diseases.

In this paper, a semi-supervised clustering algorithm-SSK (Semi-Supervised K-means) is proposed for it, which, to our knowledge, is the first semi-supervised clustering method for it. In SSK, some positive information is firstly extracted. The information is then used to help k-means to cluster all SNP fragments into two sets from which two haplotypes can be reconstructed. The performance of SSK is tested on both real data and simulated data. The results show that it outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms on Minimum Error Correction (MEC) model.

Given unique socio-economic situation each Czech region suffered in a different way during the crisis. The aim of this article is to divide 14 regions of the Czech Republic into groups (clusters) with similar impacts of the financial crisis, where the impact of the financial crisis is defined as a (percentual) difference in selected macroeconomic indicators before and after the crisis. To solve the problem, cluster analysis via k-means clustering method was employed. Results showed regions formed following clusters: A = {Ustecky, Moravskoslezsky}, B = {Prague}, C = {Stredocesky, Plzensky, Karlovarsky}, D ={Kralovehradecky, Pardubicky, Vysocina, Olomoucky, Zlinsky} and E = {Jihocesky, Jihomoravsky, Liberecky}. Globally, regions in clusters A, B and E were less affected and regions in clusters C and D more affected by the crisis. Presented results can be used to stimulate collaboration between regions, to adopt similar policies and to coordinate measures needed for overcoming crisis consequences.

Many approaches have been proposed for color images segmentation, but Fuzzy C-Means has been widely used, because it has a good performance in a wide class of images. However, it is not adequate for noisy images and it takes longer runtimes, as compared to other method like K-means. For this reason, several methods have been proposed to improve these weaknesses. Methods like Fuzzy C-Means with Gustafson-Kessel algorithm (FCM-GK), which improve its performance against the noise, but increase significantly the runtime. In this paper we propose to use the centroids generated by GK-FCM algorithms as seeding for K-means algorithm in order to accelerate the runtime and improve the performance of K-means with random seeding. These segmentation techniques were applied to feature extraction on vineyard images. Segmented images were evaluated using several quality parameters such as the rate of correctly classified area and runtime.

Traditional medical image-guided systems include CT, MRI and ultrasound image (US). While considering frame rate and invasiveness, the ultrasound image-guided system is proposed for tracking the liver motion. The main objective is to use ultrasound image for continuously tracking liver motion and for tumor treatment. After locating the liver motion from ultrasound images, the corresponding relationship can immediately inform the treatment probe the location of the liver tumor existed in body. Ultrasound images have lower resolution and ill-defined edges in noisy images. To improve the accuracy and computation speed, four tracking methods are tested. These methods are: (1) K-means clustering, (2) template matching, (3) optical flow, and (4) neural network. The K-means clustering method is first used to roughly identify the liver location and the (2)-(4) methods are performed separately to precisely estimate the liver motion. Two different scenarios are experimentally tested. In the first scenario, the "subject" breathes normally. In the second scenario, the "subject" varies between taking deep and slow breathes, holding his breath, or panting rapidly.

This paper proposes a linear clustering model for estimating intrinsic linear sub-structures in a robust way based on a similar manner to alternative c-means. In order to replace the least square measure with alternative c-means-type robust measure, the clustering criteria of distances between data samples and linear prototypes are calculated by the lower rank approximation concept. In numerical experiments, the model is compared with the conventional noise clustering model, where noise samples are dumped into the additional noise cluster while they are still assigned to normal clusters in the alternative c-means-type model. Several experimental results demonstrate the robust feature of the proposed model from both view points of noise sensitivity and cluster validation.

We make special emphasis on two major node types: hubs, which are nodes with a high relative degree value, and bridges, which act as connecting nodes between different regions in the graph. By clustering the graph's statistical data before and after perturbation, we can measure the change in characteristics and therefore the information loss. We partition the nodes into three groups: hubs/global bridges, local bridges, and all other nodes. We suspect that the partitions of these nodes are best represented in the fuzzy form, especially in the case of nodes in frontier regions of the graphs which may have an ambiguous assignment.

Aspect Mining Using Model-Based Clustering	2012 PROCEEDINGS OF IEEE SOUTHEASTCON			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE SoutheastCon	MAR 15-18, 2012	Orlando, FL	IEEE		Aspect Mining; Model-Based Clustering; Crosscutting Concerns; Software Metrics; Heuristic-Based Clustering; Fan-in metric; Aspect-Oriented Programming	MIXTURE	Legacy systems contain critical and complex business code that has been in use for a long time. This code is difficult to understand, maintain, and evolve, in large part due to crosscutting concerns: software system features, such as persistence, logging, and error handling, whose implementation is spread across multiple modules. Aspect-oriented techniques separate crosscutting concerns from the base code, using separate modules called aspects and, thus, simplify the legacy code. Aspect mining techniques identify aspect candidates so that the legacy code can then be refactored into aspects. This study shows that model-based clustering using a carefully selected vector-space of features can be more effective than extant aspect mining methods based on heuristic methods as such hierarchical or partitional clustering. Three model-based algorithms were experimentally compared against existing heuristic methods, such as k-means clustering and agglomerative hierarchical clustering, using six different vector-space models. Model-based algorithms performed better in not spreading the methods of the concerns across the multiple clusters and were significantly better at partitioning the data such that, given an ordered list of clusters, fewer clusters and methods were needed to be analyzed to find all the concerns. In addition, model-based algorithms automatically determined the optimal number of clusters, a great advantage over the heuristic-based algorithms. Lastly, the newly defined vector-space models performed better, relative to aspect mining, than the previously defined vector-space models	[McFadden, Renata Rand; Mitropoulos, Frank J.] Nova SE Univ, Grad Sch Comp & Informat Sci, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USA	McFadden, RR (reprint author), Nova SE Univ, Grad Sch Comp & Informat Sci, Ft Lauderdale, FL 33314 USA.	randmcfa@nova.edu; mitrof@nova.edu					Agostinelli C, 2002, STAT PROBABIL LETT, V56, P289, DOI 10.1016/S0167-7152(01)00193-6; Asif Nadim, 2009, WSEAS Transactions on Computers, V8; Breu S., 2005, P 5 INT WORKSH SOURC, P57; Breu S., 2004, Proceedings. 19th International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, DOI 10.1109/ASE.2004.1342754; Bruntink M, 2004, PROC IEEE INT CONF S, P200, DOI 10.1109/ICSM.2004.1357804; Cojocar G.

The asymmetric version of this algorithm is derived using the asymmetric coefficients, which convey the information provided by the asymmetry in analyzed data sets. The formulation of the asymmetric k-means algorithm is motivated by the fact that, when an analyzed data set has the asymmetric nature, a data analysis algorithm should properly adjust to this nature. The traditional k-means approach using the symmetric dissimilarities does not apply correctly to this kind of phenomenon in data. We propose the k-means algorithm using the asymmetric coefficients, which has the ability to reflect the asymmetric relationships between objects in analyzed data sets. The results of our experimental study on real data show that the asymmetric k-means approach outperforms its symmetric counterpart.

Aviation has a sensitive response to any economic or social changes and painful aviation catastrophes. In spite of increasing the flows of passengers and flights, for certain reasons, the aviation system does not always satisfy the expectations of the airspace users in the sense of efficiency. The effectiveness of air transport operations is determined by both a reduction in the costs of every airspace user and the efficiency of the air traffic management system. Airspace organization performed by the air traffic management system, i.e. its adaptation to the performance of appropriate air navigation services, largely defines the efficiency of these services. Due to various reasons, presently, the area of airspace and airspace management has remained one of the largest and incompletely used aviation resources. Beside other appropriate means, the organization of air traffic management and airspace establishes flight conditions and determines the efficiency of flight trajectories and regularity. A comparison of air traffic management systems of different regions identifies the obstacles that do not allow ensuring the maximum results of flight efficiency in any place. One of the main reasons is the high fragmentation of the specified regions that mostly coincide with the state borders. The above reasons show that in order to efficiently develop aviation, the successful development of that to the extent of one country is not enough. Thus, the best results will only be reached solving the existing problems and intended challenges to the extent of a few countries - up to the extent of the whole region. The aim of research is to define a methodology allowing the organization of regional airspace according to the flows of air traffic and subsequently enabling to solve flight efficiency problems related to air traffic management. For space evaluation, the paper suggests using rectangular grids the application of which makes possible dividing the researched space more easily and exactly. Considering the examples of air traffic management systems demonstrating the best results of efficiency, it can be exactly assumed about the number of possible airspace blocks complying with the flows of flights in the analyzed airspace. In case, a preliminary number of the wanted clusters is known, it is purposeful to apply the method of the cluster analysis of K-means with necessary limitations to the formed building airspace blocks and to determine the optimum version taking into account the analyzed ones. The paper suggests representing points having appropriate weighted coefficients during the stage of clustering rather than using grid cells. The optimization of the obtained airspace blocks is necessary in case the formed blocks do not properly comply with the aims raised. The application of the methodology suggested in the paper enables dividing the airspace of a big territory into airspace blocks according to the flows of flights independent from the air way network, flight intensity and the collocation of the airspace elements of a special purpose.

To address this problem, the improved adaptive multi-scaled retinex (MSR) and K-mean clustering methods are applied for image enhancement and positioning techniques. In the experimental the proposed model were found to improve the segmentation efficiency, thereby the result of inspection is optimized. The evaluation result also demonstrated the good system performance when the application is implemented using Vision Services Oriented (VSO) framework.

Chemometric procedures for analyzing trace organic impurities present in street doses of heroin via a constant weight approach	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES			English	Article						chemometric procedure; clustering; street heroin; organic impurities; constant weight; drug profiling	SAMPLES; VALIDATION	This paper seeks to evaluate whether the chemical profiling data obtained with a constant weight approach can be used in the classification of highly cut heroin samples. A constant weight of a seized substance instead of the conventional weight equivalent to 15 mg heroin base was used to profile the manufacturing impurities. The study attempts to optimize four clustering tools using 12 impurity peaks extracted from the heroin samples (52.3% purity) analyzed at 650 mg sample weight to find the most ideal statistical techniques for sample classification. The effectiveness of four clustering tools, namely the principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), K-means clustering (KMC) and discriminant analysis (DA) was assessed using 25 heroin samples derived from five known batches. HCA and DA proved promising in clustering the related samples. Finally, only the HCA was then employed to evaluate the general relationships between 46 unknown heroin samples.

The main k-NN drawback is that it involves high computational cost when applied on large datasets. Many Data Reduction Techniques have been proposed in order to speed-up the classification process. However, their effectiveness depends on the level of noise in the data. This paper shows that the k-means clustering algorithm can be used as a noise-tolerant Data Reduction Technique. The conducted experimental study illustrates that if the reduced dataset includes the k-means centroids as representatives of the initial data, performance is not negatively affected as much by the addition of noise.

J	Zheng, YF; Jia, LX; Cao, H				Zheng, Yifei; Jia, Lixin; Cao, Hui			Multi-Objective Gene Expression Programming for Clustering	INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND CONTROL			English	Article						Clustering; multi-objective; evolutionary algorithm; gene expression programming	ALGORITHM	This paper proposes a multi-objective gene expression programming for clustering (MGEPC), which could automatically determine the number of clusters and the appropriate partitioning from the data set. The clustering algebraic operations of gene expression programming are extended first. Then based on the framework of the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II, two enhancements are proposed in MGEPC. First, a multi-objective k-means clustering is proposed for local search, where the total symmetrical compactness and the cluster connectivity are used as two complementary objectives and the point symmetry based distance is adopted as the distance metric. Second, the power-law distribution based selection strategy is proposed for the parent population generation. In addition, the external archive and the archive truncation are used to keep a historical record of the non-dominated solutions found along the search process. Experiments are performed on five artificial and three real-life data sets. Results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the PESA-II based clustering method (MOCK), the archived multiobjective simulated annealing based clustering technique with point symmetry based distance (VAMOSA) and the single-objective version of gene expression programming based clustering technique (GEP-Cluster).

Kinetics of alpha hydrogen abstractions from thiols, sulfides and thiocarbonyl compounds	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							GAS-PHASE THERMOLYSIS; REACTION-RATE PREDICTION; BETA-SCISSION REACTIONS; TRANSITION-STATE THEORY; ACTIVATION-ENERGIES; DIMETHYL SULFIDE; SULFUR-COMPOUNDS; REACTION-RATES; H-ABSTRACTION; AB-INITIO	Hydrogen abstraction reactions involving organosulfur compounds play an important role in many industrial, biological and atmospheric processes. Despite their chemical relevance, little is known about their kinetics. In this work a group additivity model is developed that allows predicting the Arrhenius parameters for abstraction reactions of alpha hydrogen atoms from thiols, alkyl sulfides, alkyl disulfides and thiocarbonyl compounds by carbon-centered radicals at temperatures ranging from 300 to 1500 K. Rate coefficients for 102 hydrogen abstractions were obtained using conventional transition state theory within the high-pressure limit. Electronic barriers were calculated using the CBS-QB3 method and the rate coefficients were corrected for tunneling and hindered rotation about the transitional bond. Group additivity values for 46 groups are determined. To account for resonance and hyperconjugative stabilization in the transition state, 8 resonance corrections were fitted to a set of 32 reactions. The developed group additivity scheme was validated using a test set containing an additional 30 reactions. The group additivity scheme succeeds in reproducing the rate coefficients on average within a factor of 2.4 at 300 K and 1.4 at 1000 K. Mean absolute deviations of the Arrhenius parameters amount to, respectively, 2.5 kJ mol(-1) for E-a and 0.13 for log A, both at 300 and 1000 K. This work hence illustrates that the recently developed group additivity methods for Arrhenius parameters extrapolate successfully to hetero-element containing compounds.

Second, four types of noise data are summarized, that is wrong sample data from signal error, passenger cell phone sample noise data beside roads, vehicle cell phone sample ones between parallel and overlapping roads. Third, hierarchy and K means cluster algorithms are applied with SPSS software for the collected sample data cleaning based on real handover data by try and trial to produce link travel speed, which is compared with practical traffic situation. Finally, historic loop data is used as the baseline to evaluate the accuracy compared with cleaned results.

The maximal response 8 (MR8) method extracts an 8-dimensional feature set from 38 filters. It is one of state-of-the-art rotation invariant texture classification methods. This method assumes that each local patch has a dominant orientation, thus it keeps the maximal response from six responses of different orientations in the same scale. To validate whether local dominant orientation is necessary for texture classification, in this paper, a complex texton, complex response 8 (CR8), is proposed. The average and standard deviation of filter responses for different orientations is computed, and then an 8-dimensional complex texton is extracted. After using k-means clustering algorithm to learn a texton dictionary, a histogram of texton distribution could be built for a given image. Experimental results on one large public database show that CR8 could get comparable results with MR8.

Partitional clustering methods such as K-means or self-organizing maps assign each gene to a single cluster. However, these methods do not provide information about the influence of a given gene for the overall shape of clusters. Here we apply a fuzzy partitioning method, Fuzzy C-means (FCM), to attribute cluster membership values to genes. Gene expressions are expected to vary not only in terms of expression amplitudes, but also in terms of time progression since biological processes may unfold with different rates in response to different experimental conditions or within different organisms and individuals. Any distance (Euclidean, Manhattan, ...) which aligns the i'th point on one expression with the i'th point on the other will produce a poor similarity score. In this paper we use DTW distance to attain expression's similarity.

The classification performance is assessed by means of a permutation procedure which allows for a direct comparison of the methods, the development of a statistical test, and points out better potential solutions.

J	Chen, TB; Chen, JC; Lu, HHS				Chen, Tai-Been; Chen, Jyh-Cheng; Lu, Henry Horng-Shing			Segmentation of 3D microPET images of the rat brain via the hybrid gaussian mixture method with kernel density estimation	JOURNAL OF X-RAY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						PET; FDG; cerebral cortex; K-Means; Gaussian mixture model; kernel density estimation	TARGET VOLUME DELINEATION; DYNAMIC PET IMAGES; MODEL; RECONSTRUCTION; TUMOR	Segmentation of positron emission tomography (PET) is typically achieved using the K-Means method or other approaches. In preclinical and clinical applications, the K-Means method needs a prior estimation of parameters such as the number of clusters and appropriate initialized values. This work segments microPET images using a hybrid method combining the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with kernel density estimation. Segmentation is crucial to registration of disordered 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) accumulation locations with functional diagnosis and to estimate standardized uptake values (SUVs) of region of interests (ROIs) in PET images. Therefore, simulation studies are conducted to apply spherical targets to evaluate segmentation accuracy based on Tanimoto's definition of similarity. The proposed method generates a higher degree of similarity than the K-Means method. The PET images of a rat brain are used to compare the segmented shape and area of the cerebral cortex by the K-Means method and the proposed method by volume rendering. The proposed method provides clearer and more detailed activity structures of an FDG accumulation location in the cerebral cortex than those by the K-Means method.

Despite applying discriminant analysis can improve target segmentation accuracy; this analytical technique is less adopted. Hence, the underlying purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how cluster analysis in conjunction with discriminant analysis can be applied in a multifaceted business field in tourism research as targeting an optimal market segments is crucial to organization success. With the growth of cross border shopping between the Pearl River Delta Regions in Greater China after the launch of "one year multiple endorsements" of the Individual Visit Scheme by the Chinese government, many popular international brands start to set up shops in Hong Kong and Macau to capture the emerging market. As such, this study adopted hierarchical cluster analysis, followed by K means cluster analysis to classify cross border shoppers into mutually exclusive groups based on their motivation and attitudes in the context. Cross tabulation analysis was then conducted to test if there is any association between the product/service purchased and the cluster membership of respondents. Finally, discriminant analysis was employed to assess the adequacy of classification, and to determine which variables are the best predictors of group membership so that the variables can be used to predict new cases of group membership in the context. To achieve the research purpose, quantitative research design was adopted and data was collected using intercept method with convenience sampling technique. A total of 194 respondents who normally reside in Mainland China were recruited, and their motivation and attitudes on cross-border shopping in Hong Kong were measured. Results of the cluster analysis suggest that there exist three distinct groups of cross-border shoppers based on the motivational and attitudinal criteria. The attitudes towards product price and quality, agglomeration of comprehensive retails, together with age, marital status, education, occupation, types of goods purchased, and frequency of visit are significantly different among the three groups. The cross tabulation analysis reveals that there was an association between cluster membership of respondents and purchase of high involvement products such as photographic equipment, and certain food products. Using discriminant analysis, the group membership of tourists was predicted based on their experience such as comfortable shopping environment, salesperson's product knowledge, easy to cross-border and convenient opening hours; and the product attributes such as product price and quality, and comprehensive agglomeration of retails. This research provides a quantitative basis for formulating marketing plan and helps the industry to reduce the uncertainty in the decision making process and increase the probability of success through a systematic and objective analysis. The practical information can be translatable into operational scheme in terms of targeting, and cross-border shopping can be promoted in a strategic approach.			ruth@ift.edu.mo; wallacey@umac.mo					Asplund M, 2007, J PUBLIC ECON, V91, P141, DOI 10.1016/j.jpubeco.2006.05.006; Blakney V.

J	Malkic, J; Sarajlic, N				Malkic, Jasmin; Sarajlic, Nermin			Distance distribution-based verification of the clusters in a multidimensional space	TECHNICS TECHNOLOGIES EDUCATION MANAGEMENT-TTEM			English	Article						Clustering; cluster verification; k-means; distance distribution		In order to find the similarities and the patterns in multidimensional data space diverse methods of cluster analysis can be applied. The best way of dividing a data space into the clusters would be to identify all possible partitions and to select the best one according to preselected evaluation criterion. This task however is not computationally feasible, so in practice cluster analyses handles a number of assumptions based on statistical and visual analyses of the input data. A valuable asset to such analyses would be if the resulting clusters can be verified in a simple and time undemanding way. Proximity distances of the points in a multidimensional data space without the cluster structure follow the normal distribution, while any deviation from this indicates the underlying cluster structure. A single cluster could be treated as the sub-space that does not possess the further cluster structure. Therefore, we consider clusterization as the process of identifying the distinct divisions of an observed data space that are not likely to be further divided into clusters using the same partition algorithm. Such divisions would then represent the separate areas of data space where the point proximity distances follow the normal distribution, verifying its cluster structure and the specific clusters themselves.

A fast motion vector re-estimation based on a k-means clustering algorithm is proposed for efficiently determining a motion vector and a reference frame. A motion vector refinement technique is used to further improve the rate-distortion performance without additional high complexity. The proposed method significantly reduces the motion vector estimation complexity up to 10 times while the loss of rate distortion performance is negligible with a decrease of 0.1dB in BD-PSNR and 3% increase in the BD-RATE.

As the foundation of image identification, the effective image segmentation plays a significant role during the course of subsequent image processing. Many theories and methods have been presented and discussed about image segmentation, such as K-means and fuzzy C-means methods, method based on regions information, method based on image edge detection, etc. In this work, it is proposed to apply Bayesian decision-making theory based on minimum error probability to gray image segmentation. The approach to image segmentation can guarantee the segmentation error probability minimum, which is generally what we desire. On the assumption that the gray values accord with the probability distribution of Gaussian finite mixture model in image feature space, EM algorithm is used to estimate the parameters of mixture model. In order to improve the convergence speed of EM algorithm, a novel method called weighted equal interval sampling is presented to obtain the contracted sample set. Consequently, the computation burden of EM algorithm is greatly reduced. The final experiments demonstrate the feasibility and high effectiveness of the method.

In order to overcome the disadvantage that k-means algorithm requires initializing parameters, this paper proposes an improved K-means algorithm with a strategy of adjustable parameters. According to the location of wireless sensor networks (WSN), we can obtain clustering results by applying improved K-means algorithm to WSN, and then SVM algorithm is applied to different clusters for anomaly intrusion detection. Simulation results show that the proposed method can detect abnormal behaviors efficiently and has high detection rate and low false positive rate than the current typical intrusion detection schemes of WSN.

The data is derived from intracortical electrodes that transmit EEG recordings that contain substantial amounts of noise. The output for the identification is specifically designed to be fed back into nan artificial intelligence unit the authors have designed that predict seizures in rats within 6 seconds of onset. This data will verify whether or not the prediction as accurate or not. The methodology set forth in this paper reflects the results of an ongoing research program that has investigated multiple techniques that have computational simplicity and are able to identify events with high precision. The paper presents our most recent in-house algorithm for seizure detection. The authors present this novel approach through the analysis of 3 channel EEG recordings from 3 rats that have 10 seizures each. The algorithm uses a Riemann sum analysis that compares the time to zero crossings with the absolute amplitude of the intervening signal. Herein, the authors present a system that incorporates clustering analysis using fuzzy K-means (FCM) and K-medoid clustering that identifies and separates artifact and normal states of animal with states seizure.

Classical classifications such as the prominent Koppen-Geiger (KG) approach rely on heuristic decision rules. Although these heuristics may transport some process understanding, such a discretization may appear "arbitrary" from a data oriented perspective. In this contribution we compare the precision of a KG classification to an unsupervised classification (k-means clustering). Generally speaking, we revisit the problem of "climate classification" by investigating the inherent patterns in multiple data streams in a purely data driven way. One question is whether we can reproduce the KG boundaries by exploring different combinations of climate and remotely sensed vegetation variables. In this context we also investigate whether climate and vegetation variables build similar clusters. In terms of statistical performances, k-means clearly outperforms classical climate classifications. However, a subsequent stability analysis only reveals a meaningful number of clusters if both climate and vegetation data are considered in the analysis. This is a setback for the hope to explain vegetation by means of climate alone. Clearly, classification schemes like Koppen-Geiger will play an important role in the future. However, future developments in this area need to be assessed based on data driven approaches.

Methods: The sample comprised 332 alcoholics that were enrolled in three different pharmacological trials carried out at Sao Paulo University, Brazil. Based on four clinical factors problem drinking onset age, familial alcoholism, alcohol dependence severity, and depression - K-means cluster analysis was performed by using the average silhouette width to determine the number of clusters. A direct logistic regression was performed to analyze the influence of clusters, medication groups, and Alcoholics Anonymous ( AA) attendance in treatment retention. Results: Two clusters were delineated. The cluster characterized by earlier onset age, more familial alcoholism, higher alcoholism severity, and less depression symptoms showed a higher chance of discontinuing the treatment, independently of medications used and AA attendance. Participation in AA was significantly related to treatment retention. Discussion: Health services should broaden the scope of services offered to meet heterogeneous needs of clients, and identify treatment practices and therapists which improve retention. Information about patients' characteristics linked to dropout should be used to make treatment programs more responsive and attractive, combining pharmacological agents with more intensive and diversified psychosocial interventions.

Camshaft grinders play the important role for the camshaft production line which is the massive production type. The camshaft grinders working condition is one of the critical sections which affected the production efficiency and profit of the manufactures. Nowadays the maintenance based on condition is carried out in order to meet the requirements of the market. The Time Between Failures (TBF) could be used for arranging the maintenance schedule. The faults prediction model based on RBF neural network, adopted K-means clustering algorithm to select clustering centre of radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), is proposed for the camshaft grinders which are the key equipment of camshaft production line. The TBF of the camshaft grinders are predicted by using this model, where the distribution density is 1, with the accepted network approximation error. An industrial example is used to illustrate the application of this model. The proposed method is effective and can be used for the suggestions for the practical workshop machines maintenance.

The comparison of four image segmentation methods to get experimental data is necessary. The numerical measurements are required to tag the injured region by segmentations to partition the foreground and background and the mathematical morphological processing is used to smooth the edges and eliminate the holes and spots in the image. Then the calculation of the area by counting the pixels of injured region by scanning of the image is proposed. Therefore, the effective procedure of the area measurement for arbitrary shapes in forensic medical image is given. The result shows that four methods are effective to segment the forensic medical image and the three errors in the injured area of them are less than 0.5%.

Many traditional methods for constraining groundwater flow regimes in karst aquifers are focussed on the faster drainage components and are unable to inform on the smaller fracture or matrix-flow components of the system. Caves however, offer a natural inception point to observe both the long term storage and the preferential movement of water through the unsaturated zone of such fractured carbonate rock by monitoring of drip rates of stalactites, soda straws and seepage from fractures/micro fissures that emerge in the cave ceiling. Here we present the largest spatial survey of automated cave drip rate monitoring published to date with the aim of better understanding both karst drip water hydrogeology and the relationship between drip hydrology and surface climate. By the application of cross correlation functions and multi-dimensional scaling, clustered by k-means technique, we demonstrate the nature of the relationships between drip behaviour and initial surface infiltration and similarity amongst the drip rate time series themselves that may be interpreted in terms of flow regimes and cave chamber morphology and lithology.

This method builds two models of non-speech and speech but not two states, i.e. each model could conclude several states. In the experiments we present the Voice Activity Detection (VAD) results between two states hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) and proposed algorithm. We also compare accuracy and robust between the k-means threshold and the adaptive threshold in high signal to noise rate in the background noise. It presents that k-means threshold is more effective than the adaptive threshold and the proposed method also make a better performance than two states HSMM based VAD, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) environment.

So, there must be a big gap to decide which signal is a abnormal signal. This paper draws the innate character of the signal and then uses the ordered weighted averaging aggregation operators (OWA) and k-means to deal with the datum.

This paper proposes a modular design methodology for achieving sustainable design as well as fulfilling functional requirements. Factors related to function and sustainability of products such as material, manufacturability, component life and so on are defined as modular drivers. Design structure matrix, a structured method which has advantages on representing and analyzing interaction relations among system elements, is employed to establish correlation matrix between components. K-means algorithm is used to integrate the basic components into design modules based on their correlation distance. Furthermore, an evaluation model is established for assessing sustainability of modular products. Finally, a reduction gear is used as a case study example.

This study applied Six Sigma to conduct an empirical study on an optical film processing plant. Combining the Taguchi's parameter design method and the back propagation neural network (BPNN) prediction method, this study used the orthogonal array in experimental design, and employed the Taguchi method to analyse the data obtained from the orthogonal array experiments to study the key factors and their levels, in order to determine the optimal process parameter combinations. The influential process parameters were input into the after 'apicalis' in Pachycondyla apicalis optimise back propagation network (APIBPN) and K-means, the outputs of which were the prediction results of the coating film process capability. The results can provide engineers a reference in quality improvement and decision-making planning. The experimental results suggested that the Cpk was improved from 0.89 to 1.63, indicating a significant improvement in process capability value. The prediction accuracy rate is over 97.6%, which is better than that of the trial and error method, and can improve coating film process capabilities and product quality.

At the Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique (CEA), Cadarache (France), the thermal-hydraulic computer code CATHARE is used to study the reliability of reactor vessels. The code inputs are physical parameters and the outputs are time evolution curves of a few other physical quantities. As the CATHARE code is quite complex and CPU time-consuming, it has to be approximated by a regression model. This regression process involves a clustering step. In the present paper, the CATHARE output curves are clustered using a k-means scheme, with a projection onto a lower dimensional space. We study the properties of the empirically optimal cluster centres found by the clustering method based on projections, compared with the 'true' ones. The choice of the projection basis is discussed, and an algorithm is implemented to select the best projection basis among a library of orthonormal bases. The approach is illustrated on a simulated example and then applied to the industrial problem.

Contour let transform, not only has characteristics of multi-resolution, locality and critical sampling which wavelet has, but also has the characteristics of multiple decomposition directions and anisotropy which wavelets lack. So we combine the modified K-means clustering and Contour let transform to apply for image fusion. Experimental results show that this method is feasible.

Supervised color image segmentation using a Permutation-coded Genetic Algorithm (GA) identifying regions in Hue-Saturation-Intensity (HSI) color space (GAHSI) for desired and undesired raisin detection was successfully implemented. Images were captured to explore the possibility of using GAHSI to locate desired raisin and undesired raisin regions in color space simultaneously. In this research, images were processed separately using three segmentation method, K-Means clustering in L*a*b* color space and GAHSI for single image, GA for single image in Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color space (GARGB). The GAHSI results provided evidence for the existence and separability of such regions. When compared with cluster analysis-based segmentation results, the GAHSI method showed no significant difference.

The user credit assessment model based on clustering ensemble proposed by this paper which integrates the advantages that swarm intelligence clustering is suitable for user credit behavior analysis and K-means clustering could eliminate the scattered users existed in the result of swarm intelligence clustering, thus to realize all the users' credit classification automatically. The model's effective verification experiments are accomplished which are based on standard credit application dataset in UCI machine learning repository, and the statistical results of a comparative experiment with a single model of swarm intelligence clustering indicates this clustering ensemble model has a stronger creditworthiness distinguishing ability, especially in the aspect of predicting to find user clusters with the best credit and worst credit, which will facilitate the operators to take incentive measures or punitive measures accurately. Besides, compared with the experimental results of Logistic regression based model under the same conditions, this clustering ensemble model is robustness and has better prediction accuracy.

We propose an improved feature with optical flow to build our bag of words. This feature is able to reduce the high dimension of the pure optical flow template and also has abundant motion information. Then, we use the topic model of pLSA (probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis) to classify human actions in a special way. We find that the existing methods lead to some mismatching of words due to the k-means clustering approach. To reduce the probability of mismatching, we add the spatial information to each word and improve the training and testing approach. Our approach of recognition is tested on two datasets, the KTH datasets and WEIZMANN datasets. The result shows its good performance.

The dimension and complexity of gene expression data obtained by microarrays create challenging data analysis and management problems ranging from the analysis of images produced by microarray experiments to biological interpretation of results. Therefore, statistical and computational approaches are beginning to assume a substantial position within the molecular biology area. We consider the problem of simultaneously clustering genes and tissue samples (in general conditions) of a microarray data set. This can be useful for revealing groups of genes involved in the same molecular process as well as groups of conditions where this process takes place. The need of finding a subset of genes and tissue samples defining a homogeneous block had led to the application of double clustering techniques on gene expression data. Here, we focus on an extension of standard K-means to simultaneously cluster observations and features of a data matrix, namely double K-means introduced by Vichi (2000). We introduce this model in a probabilistic framework and discuss the advantages of using this approach. We also develop a coordinate ascent algorithm and test its performance via simulation studies and real data set. Finally, we validate the results obtained on the real data set by building resampling confidence intervals for block centroids.

J	Sun, W; Wang, JH; Fang, YX				Sun, Wei; Wang, Junhui; Fang, Yixin			Regularized k-means clustering of high-dimensional data and its asymptotic consistency	ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF STATISTICS			English	Article						K-means; diverging dimension; lasso; selection consistency; variable selection; stability	GENE-EXPRESSION DATA; VARIABLE SELECTION; DIVERGING NUMBER; CLASSIFICATION; PARAMETERS; REGRESSION; LASSO	K-means clustering is a widely used tool for cluster analysis due to its conceptual simplicity and computational efficiency. However, its performance can be distorted when clustering high-dimensional data where the number of variables becomes relatively large and many of them may contain no information about the clustering structure. This article proposes a high-dimensional cluster analysis method via regularized k-means clustering, which can simultaneously cluster similar observations and eliminate redundant variables. The key idea is to formulate the k-means clustering in a form of regularization, with an adaptive group lasso penalty term on cluster centers. In order to optimally balance the trade-off between the clustering model fitting and sparsity, a selection criterion based on clustering stability is developed. The asymptotic estimation and selection consistency of the regularized k-means clustering with diverging dimension is established. The effectiveness of the regularized k-means clustering is also demonstrated through a variety of numerical experiments as well as applications to two gene microarray examples. The regularized clustering framework can also be extended to the general model-based clustering.

Current scene recognition works that adopt BoW as the framework usually use a single codeword to represent the clusters obtained by k-means. Further, most of them often assign a hard value to a certain codeword to construct the BoW histogram. Using a single codeword to represent each cluster in fact is very preliminary since different clusters usually have different mean and covariance values. This causes using only mean value-based codeword will lose the covariance information and also makes the hard assignment to the codeword become biased. Considering this, this paper proposes an effective BoW-based technique to perform scene recognition. It first uses k-means algorithm to cluster the feature vectors into a certain number of clusters, in addition with an occurrence matrix. Gaussian mixed model (GMM) is then used to model the distribution of each cluster. Each GMM will be used as the new "codeword" of the codebook. Finally we propose to establish a new soft BoW histogram to represent each image through the soft assignment of the image features to each GMM. Support vector machine (SVM) is used to train these BoW histograms. Experimental results on the 15 categories dataset show that the proposed new BoW-based approach is very effective for scene/place recognition. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Such method takes effect on guarantee safety operation of vehicle and avoid wheel-set flatness, however it cannot adapt itself to the rail adhesion variation. While wheel-sets slide, the operating status is chaotic time series with certain law, and can be predicted with the law and experiment data in certain time. The predicted values can be used as the input reference signals of vehicle anti-slide control system, to judge and control the slide status of wheel-sets.

With multi-step prediction simulation, the predicted signal with appropriate precision can be used by anti-slide system to trace actively and adjust wheel-set slide tendency, so as to adapt to wheel-rail adhesion variation and reduce the risk of wheel-set blocking.

A particular feature of the framework is that, after an initial cluster configuration has been generated, the agents are able to negotiate with a view to improving on this initial clustering. The framework can be used in the context of a number of clustering paradigms, two are investigated: K-means and KNN. The reported evaluation demonstrates that negotiation can serve to improve on an initial cluster configuration.

This feature space may include opening price, closing price, average bid rate, bid history, seller and buyer reputation, number of bids and many more. In this paper, a price forecasting agent (PFA) is proposed using data mining techniques to forecast the end-price of an online auction for autonomous agent based system. In the proposed model, the input auction space is partitioned into groups of similar auctions by k-means clustering algorithm. The recurrent problem of finding the value of k in k-means algorithm is solved by employing elbow method using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Based on the transformed data after clustering, bid selector nominates the cluster for the current auction whose price is to be forecasted. Regression trees are employed to predict the end-price and designing the optimal bidding strategies for the current auction. Our results show the improvements in the end price prediction using clustering and regression tree approach.

The choice of a good colour palette is crucial as it directly determines the quality of the resulting image. Colour quantisation can also be seen as a clustering problem where the task is to identify those clusters that best represent the colours in an image. In this paper we propose rough c-means and fuzzy rough c-means clustering algorithms for colour quantisation of images. Both approaches utilise the concept of lower and upper approximations of clusters to define palette colours. While in the rough c-means approach cluster centroids are refined iteratively through a linear combination of elements of the lower and upper approximations, the fuzzy rough c-means technique assigns variable membership values to the elements in the boundary region which in turn are incorporated into the calculation of cluster centres. Experimental results on a standard set of images show that these approaches performs significantly better than other, purpose built colour quantisation algorithms	[Schaefer, Gerald] Univ Loughborough, Dept Comp Sci, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England; [Hu, Qinghua] Harbin Inst Technol, Inst Adv Power Control & Reliabil, Harbin, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Huiyu] Queens Univ, Inst Elect Commun & Informat Technol, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Peters, James F.] Univ Manitoba, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada; [Hassanien, Aboul Ella] Cairo Univ, Dept Informat Technol, Cairo, Egypt	Schaefer, G (reprint author), Univ Loughborough, Dept Comp Sci, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.	gerald.schaefer@ieee.org	Hassanien, Aboul Ella/	Hassanien, Aboul Ella/0000-0002-9989-6681			BEZDEK JC, 1980, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V2, P1; Chuang KS, 2006, COMPUT MED IMAG GRAP, V30, P9, DOI 10.1016/j.compmedimag.2005.10.001; DEKKER AH, 1994, NETWORK-COMP NEURAL, V5, P351, DOI 10.1088/0954-898X/5/3/003; Gervautz M., 1990, GRAPHICS GEMS, P287; Heckbert P., 1982, ACM COMPUTER GRAPHIC, V16, P297, DOI 10.1145/965145.801294; Hu Q., 2005, 2 INT C FUZZ SYST KN; Lingras P, 2004, J INTELL INF SYST, V23, P5, DOI 10.1023/B:JIIS.0000029668.88665.1a; Nolle L, 2007, ENG OPTIMIZ, V39, P327, DOI 10.1080/03052150601127958; Pawlak Z., 1982, INT J INFORMATION CO, V11, P145; Peters G, 2006, PATTERN RECOGN, V39, P1481, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2006.02.002; Scheunders P, 1997, PATTERN RECOGN, V30, P859, DOI 10.1016/S0031-3203(96)00131-8; Yao Y., 1994, 3 INT WORKSH ROUGH S	12	2	2	IOS PRESS	AMSTERDAM	NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS	0169-2968			FUND INFORM	Fundam.

Vanishing point detection in corridors: using Hough transform and K-means clustering	IET COMPUTER VISION			English	Article							PERSPECTIVE IMAGES	One of the main challenges in steering a vehicle or a robot is the detection of appropriate heading. Many solutions have been proposed during the past few decades to overcome the difficulties of intelligent navigation platforms. In this study, the authors try to introduce a new procedure for finding the vanishing point based on the visual information and K-Means clustering. Unlike other solutions the authors do not need to find the intersection of lines to extract the vanishing point. This has reduced the complexity and the processing time of our algorithm to a large extent. The authors have imported the minimum possible information to the Hough space by using only two pixels (the points) of each line (start point and end point) instead of hundreds of pixels that form a line. This has reduced the mathematical complexity of our algorithm while maintaining very efficient functioning. The most important and unique characteristic of our algorithm is the usage of processed data for other important tasks in navigation such as mapping and localisation.

We used K-means algorithm to cluster and group the minority kind of sample, and in each cluster we use the genetic algorithm to gain the new sample and to carry on the valid confirmation. Finally, through using KNN and SVM sorter we proved the method validity in the simulation experiment. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 295 students from Polish and Slovenian vocational and technical high schools participated in the study. By applying the k-mean clustering procedure, two distinct clusters of students' motivational orientations were identified based on the SDT theory about autonomous and controlled motivation. Students classified as the good quality motivation group (Cluster II) outperformed students in the low quantity motivation group (Cluster I) in their knowledge gained through the hands-on approach and assessed the hands-on approach more positively with regard to their active participation in learning selected concepts from visible spectrometry. Altogether, the results of the present study confirm previous research findings about the importance of the quality of students' motivation for learning; the results show that hands-on laboratory work with autonomy-supportive teachers could create a motivating learning environment for students to learn with understanding and to cooperate with each other in academic tasks at a higher level of cognitive complexity. The main implication for teachers in chemistry classes is, therefore, to plan their teaching more systematically and creatively in order to provide students with individualised cognitively and motivationally challenging learning situations (both in terms of content and didactical methods) and to foster learning with understanding even within very abstract and cognitively complex learning tasks.

Thirty motivational statements used in the study were reduced with principal component analysis into four underlying themes: Control, Novelty, Relaxation, and Nostalgia. Using hierarchical and K-means cluster analyses, the respondents were segmented by found motivational themes into five groups: Controllers, Indifferent, Nostalgia, Comfort Seekers, and Novelty Seekers. The article brings forth new empirical evidence related to Macionis' (2004) Continuum of Film-Induced Motivation model as results implicate that control, novelty, relaxation, and nostalgia could be motivational push forces for general and specific movie-induced tourists.

Multilayer feed forward and radial basis function neural net works have been used to rapid and simultaneous prediction of cetane number, cetane index, density, viscosity, distillation temperatures at 10% (T10), 50% (T50) and 90% (T90) recovery, con tents of total aromatics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons of commercial diesel fuels. In this study two-phase training procedures for multilayer feed for ward net works we re applied. While first phase training algorithm was constantly the back propagation one, two second phase training algorithms were varied and compared, namely: conjugate gradient and quasi New ton. In case of radial basis function net work, radial layer was trained using K-means radial assignment algorithm and three different radial spread algorithms: explicit, isotropic and K-nearest neighbour. The number of hid den layer neurons and experimental data points used for the training set have been optimized for both neural networks in order to insure good predictive ability by reducing unnecessary experimental work. This work shows that developed artificial neural net work models can determine main pro per ties of diesel fuels simultaneously based on a single and fast IR or Raman measurement.

J	Konicek, AR; Lefman, J; Szakal, C				Konicek, Andrew R.; Lefman, Jonathan; Szakal, Christopher			Automated correlation and classification of secondary ion mass spectrometry images using a k-means cluster method	ANALYST			English	Article							MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; TOF-SIMS IMAGES; SPECTRAL IMAGES; IDENTIFICATION; SEGMENTATION; MEMBRANES; SILICON; CELLS; PCA	We present a novel method for correlating and classifying ion-specific time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) images within a multispectral dataset by grouping images with similar pixel intensity distributions. Binary centroid images are created by employing a k-means-based custom algorithm. Centroid images are compared to grayscale SIMS images using a newly developed correlation method that assigns the SIMS images to classes that have similar spatial (rather than spectral) patterns. Image features of both large and small spatial extent are identified without the need for image pre-processing, such as normalization or fixed-range mass-binning. A subsequent classification step tracks the class assignment of SIMS images over multiple iterations of increasing n classes per iteration, providing information about groups of images that have similar chemistry. Details are discussed while presenting data acquired with ToF-SIMS on a model sample of laser-printed inks. This approach can lead to the identification of distinct ion-specific chemistries for mass spectral imaging by ToF-SIMS, as well as matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI), and desorption electrospray ionization (DESI).

J	Jaafar, A; Sareni, B; Roboam, X				Jaafar, Amine; Sareni, Bruno; Roboam, Xavier			Clustering analysis of railway driving missions with niching	COMPEL-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR COMPUTATION AND MATHEMATICS IN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th International Workshop on Optimization and Inverse Problems in Electromagnetism (OIPE)	SEP 14-18, 2010	Sofia, BULGARIA			Genetic algorithms; Cluster analysis; Data management; Clustering; K-means; Silhouette index; Niching genetic algorithms; Railway locomotive; Driving missions	GENETIC ALGORITHM; VALIDATION; VALIDITY	Purpose - A wide number of applications requires classifying or grouping data into a set of categories or clusters. The most popular clustering techniques to achieve this objective are K-means clustering and hierarchical clustering. However, both of these methods necessitate the a priori setting of the cluster number. The purpose of this paper is to present a clustering method based on the use of a niching genetic algorithm to overcome this problem. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed approach aims at finding the best compromise between the inter-cluster distance maximization and the intra-cluster distance minimization through the silhouette index optimization. It is capable of investigating in parallel multiple cluster configurations without requiring any assumption about the cluster number. Findings - The effectiveness of the proposed approach, is demonstrated on 2D benchmarks with non-overlapping and overlapping clusters. Originality/value - The proposed approach is also applied to the clustering analysis of railway driving profiles in the context of hybrid supply design. Such a method can help designers to identify different system configurations in compliance with the corresponding clusters: it may guide suppliers towards "market segmentation", not only fulfilling economic constraints but also technical design objectives.
