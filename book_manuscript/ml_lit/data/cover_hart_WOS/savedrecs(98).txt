J	Friedman, J; Hastie, T; Tibshirani, R								Additive logistic regression: A statistical view of boosting								ANNALS OF STATISTICS			28	2			337	374		10.1214/aos/1016218223			APR 2000	2000	Boosting is one of the most important recent developments in classification methodology. Boosting works by sequentially applying a classification algorithm to reweighted Versions of the training data and then taking a weighted majority vote of the sequence of classifiers thus produced. For many classification algorithms, this simple strategy results in dramatic improvements in performance. We show that this seemingly mysterious phenomenon can be understood in terms of well-known statistical principles, namely additive modeling and maximum likelihood. For the two-class problem, boosting can be viewed as an approximation to additive modeling on the logistic scale using maximum Bernoulli likelihood as a criterion. We develop more direct approximations and show that they exhibit nearly identical results to boosting. Direct multiclass generalizations based on multinomial likelihood are derived that exhibit performance comparable to other recently proposed multiclass generalizations of boosting in most situations, and far superior in some. We suggest a minor modification to boosting that can reduce computation, often by factors of 10 to 50. Finally, we apply these insights to produce an alternative formulation of boosting decision trees. This approach, based on best-first truncated tree induction, often leads to better performance, and can provide interpretable descriptions of the aggregate decision rule. It is also much faster computationally, making it more suitable to large-scale data mining applications.								1269	58	211	0	1330	0090-5364		WOS:000089669700001

These include algorithms that learn decision trees, classification rules, and distributed networks. However, no investigation has analyzed algorithms that use only specific instances to solve incremental learning tasks. In this paper, we describe a framework and methodology, called instance-based learning, that generates classification predictions using only specific instances. Instance-based learning algorithms do not maintain a set of abstractions derived from specific instances. This approach extends the nearest neighbor algorithm, which has large storage requirements. We describe how storage requirements can be significantly reduced with, at most, minor sacrifices in learning rate and classification accuracy. While the storage-reducing algorithm performs well on several real-world databases, its performance degrades rapidly with the level of attribute noise in training instances. Therefore, we extended it with a significance test to distinguish noisy instances. This extended algorithm's performance degrades gracefully with increasing noise levels and compares favorably with a noise-tolerant decision tree algorithm.								1219	16	113	2	1238	0885-6125		WOS:A1991EW46800002

To provide the vast majority of experimental scientists with a user-friendly tool in these areas, we present a package of Web servers developed recently by hybridizing the 'higher level' approach with the ab initio approach. The package is called Cell-PLoc and contains the following six predictors: Euk-mPLoc, Hum-mPLoc, Plant-PLoc, Gpos-PLoc, Gneg-PLoc and Virus-PLoc, specialized for eukaryotic, human, plant, Gram-positive bacterial, Gram-negative bacterial and viral proteins, respectively. Using these Web servers, one can easily get the desired prediction results with a high expected accuracy, as demonstrated by a series of cross-validation tests on the benchmark data sets that covered up to 22 subcellular location sites and in which none of the proteins included had >= 25% sequence identity to any other protein in the same subcellular-location subset. Some of these Web servers can be particularly used to deal with multiplex proteins as well, which may simultaneously exist at, or move between, two or more different subcellular locations. Proteins with multiple locations or dynamic features of this kind are particularly interesting, because they may have some special biological functions intriguing to investigators in both basic research and drug discovery. This protocol is a step-by-step guide on how to use the Web-server predictors in the Cell-PLoc package. The computational time for each prediction is less than 5 s in most cases.

CLASSIFICATION								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			3	5			776	786		10.1109/72.159066			SEP 1992	1992	A supervised learning neural network classifier that utilizes fuzzy sets as pattern classes is described. Each fuzzy set is an aggregate (union) of fuzzy set hyperboxes. A fuzzy set hyperbox is an n-dimensional box defined by a min point and a max point with a corresponding membership function. The min-max points are determined using the fuzzy min-max learning algorithm, an expansion-contraction process that can learn nonlinear class boundaries in a single pass through the data and provides the ability to incorporate new and refine existing classes without retraining. The use of a fuzzy set approach to pattern classification inherently provides degree of membership information that is extremely useful in higher level decision making. This paper will describe the relationship between fuzzy sets and pattern classification. It explains the fuzzy min-max classifier neural network implementation, it outlines the learning and recall algorithms, and it provides several examples of operation that demonstrate the strong qualities of this new neural network classifier.								382	13	9	0	395	1045-9227		WOS:A1992JQ50600013

Storing too many instances can result in large memory requirements and slow execution speed, and can cause an oversensitivity to noise. This paper has two main purposes. First, it provides a survey of existing algorithms used to reduce storage requirements in instance-based learning algorithms and other exemplar-based algorithms. Second, it proposes six additional reduction algorithms called DROP1-DROP5 and DEL (three of which were first described in Wilson & Martinez, 1997c, as RT1-RT3) that can be used to remove instances from the concept description. These algorithms and 10 algorithms from the survey are compared on 31 classification tasks. Of those algorithms that provide substantial storage reduction, the DROP algorithms have the highest average generalization accuracy in these experiments, especially in the presence of uniform class noise.								373	11	18	3	386	0885-6125		WOS:000085259700002

This paper proposes that machine intelligence needs to include emotional intelligence and demonstrates results toward this goal: developing a machine's ability to recognize human affective state given four physiological signals. We describe difficult Issues unique to obtaining reliable affective data and collect a large set of data from a subject trying to elicit and experience each of eight emotional states, daily, over multiple weeks. This paper presents and compares multiple algorithms for feature-based recognition of emotional state from this data. We analyze four physiological signals that exhibit problematic day-to-day variations: The features of different emotions on the same day tend to cluster more tightly than do the features of the same emotion on different days. To handle the daily variations, we propose new features and algorithms and compare their performance, We find that the technique of seeding a Fisher Projection with the results of Sequential Floating Forward Search improves the performance of the Fisher Projection and provides the highest recognition rates reported to date for classification of affect from physiology: 81 percent recognition accuracy on eight classes of emotion, including neutral.								366	24	23	0	390	0162-8828		WOS:000171586600011	
J	Wilson, DR; Martinez, TR								Improved heterogeneous distance functions								JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			6				1	34					1997	1997	Instance-based learning techniques typically handle continuous and linear input values well, but often do not handle nominal input attributes appropriately. The Value Difference Metric (VDM) was designed to find reasonable distance values between nominal attribute values, but it largely ignores continuous attributes, requiring discretization to map continuous values into nominal values. This paper proposes three new heterogeneous distance functions, called the Heterogeneous Value Difference Metric (HVDM), the Interpolated Value Difference Metric (IVDM), and the Windowed Value Difference Metric (WVDM). These new distance functions are designed to handle applications with nominal attributes, continuous attributes, or both. In experiments on 48 applications the new distance metrics achieve higher classification accuracy on average than three previous distance functions on those datasets that have both nominal and continuous attributes.								351	16	26	0	368	1076-9757		WOS:A1997WE46300001

We have recently demonstrated that expression profiling of leukemic blasts can accurately identify the known prognostic subtypes of ALL, including T-cell lineage ALL (T-ALL), E2A-PBX1, TEL-AML1, MLL rearrangements, BCR-ABL, and hyperdiploid karyotypes with more than 50 chromosomes. As the next step toward developing this methodology into a frontline diagnostic tool, we have now analyzed leukemic blasts from 132 diagnostic samples using higher density oligonucleotide arrays that allow the interrogation of most of the identified genes in the human genome. Nearly 60% of the newly identified subtype discriminating genes are novel markers not identified in our previous study, and thus should provide new insights into the altered biology underlying these leukemias. Moreover, a proportion of the newly selected genes are highly ranked as class discriminators, and when incorporated into class-predicting algorithms resulted in an overall diagnostic accuracy of 97%. The performance of an array containing the identified discriminating genes should now be assessed in frontline clinical trials in order to determine the accuracy, practicality, and cost effectiveness of this methodology in the clinical setting.

Each neighbor of a sample to be classified is considered as an item of evidence that supports certain hypotheses regarding the class membership of that pattern. The degree of support is defined as a function of the distance between the two vectors, The evidence of the k nearest neighbors is then pooled by means of Dempster's rule of combination. This approach provides a global treatment of such issues as ambiguity and distance rejection, and imperfect knowledge regarding the class membership of training patterns, The effectiveness of this classification scheme as compared to the voting and distance-weighted k-NN procedures is demonstrated using several sets of simulated and real-world data.								277	15	50	0	293	0018-9472		WOS:A1995QT09500008

The selection and quality of the features representing each pattern have a considerable bearing on the success of subsequent pattern classification. Feature extraction is the process of deriving new features from the original features in order to reduce the cost of feature measurement, increase classifier efficiency, and allow higher classification accuracy, Many current feature extraction techniques involve linear transformations of the original pattern vectors to new vectors of lower dimensionality. While this is useful for data visualization and increasing classification efficiency, it does not necessarily reduce the number of features that must be measured since each new feature may be a linear combination of all of the features in the original pattern vector, Here, we present a new approach to feature extraction in which feature selection, feature extraction, and classifier training are performed simultaneously using a genetic algorithm, The genetic algorithm optimizes a vector of feature weights, which are used to scale the individual features in the original pattern vectors in either a linear or a nonlinear fashion. A masking vector is also employed to perform simultaneous selection of a subset of the features, We employ this technique in combination with the k nearest neighbor classification rule, and compare the results with classical feature selection and extraction techniques including sequential floating forward feature selection, and linear discriminant analysis. We also present results for the identification of favorable water-binding sites on protein surfaces, an important problem in biochemistry and drug design.								268	7	31	1	275	1089-778X		WOS:000088208600006

Several studies have shown that K-NN's performance is highly sensitive to the definition of its distance function. Many K-NN variants have been proposed to reduce this sensitivity by parameterizing the distance function with feature weights. However, these variants have not been categorized nor empirically compared. This paper reviews a class of weight-setting methods for lazy learning algorithms. We introduce a framework for distinguishing these methods and empirically compare them. We observed four trends from our experiments and conducted further studies to highlight them. Our results suggest that methods which use performance feedback to assign weight settings demonstrated three advantages over other methods: they require less pre-processing, perform better in the presence of interacting features, and generally require less training data to learn good settings. We also found that continuous weighting methods tend to outperform feature selection algorithms for tasks where some features are useful but less important than others.								254	7	14	0	261	0269-2821		WOS:A1997XE77700011

In symbolic domains, a more sophisticated treatment of the feature space is required. We introduce a nearest neighbor algorithm for learning in domains with symbolic features. Our algorithm calculates distance tables that allow it to produce real-valued distances between instances. and attaches weights to the instances to further modify the structure of feature space. We show that this technique produces excellent classification accuracy on three problems that have been studied by machine learning researchers: predicting protein secondary structure, identifying DNA promoter sequences, and pronouncing English text. Direct experimental comparisons with the other learning algorithms show that our nearest neighbor algorithm is comparable or superior in all three domains. In addition, our algorithm has advantages in training speed, simplicity, and perspicuity. We conclude that experimental evidence favors the use and continued development of nearest neighbor algorithms for domains such as the ones studied here.								240	7	9	0	248	0885-6125		WOS:A1993KL35400002

In contrast, the pace is much slower in determining their biological attributes. As a consequence, the gap between sequence-known proteins and attribute-known proteins has become increasingly large. The unbalanced situation, which has critically limited our ability to timely utilize the newly discovered proteins for basic research and drug development, has called for developing computational methods or high-throughput automated tools for fast and reliably identifying various attributes of uncharacterized proteins based on their sequence information alone. Actually, during the last two decades or so, many methods in this regard have been established in hope to bridge such a gap. In the course of developing these methods, the following things were often needed to consider: (1) benchmark dataset construction, (2) protein sample formulation, (3) operating algorithm (or engine), (4) anticipated accuracy, and (5) web-server establishment. In this review, we are to discuss each of the five procedures, with a special focus on the introduction of pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC), its different modes and applications as well as its recent development, particularly in how to use the general formulation of PseAAC to reflect the core and essential features that are deeply hidden in complicated protein sequences.

Of late, there has been increasing interest in building search/index structures for performing similarity search over high-dimensional data, e.g., image databases, document collections, time-series databases, and genome databases. Unfortunately, all known techniques for solving this problem fall prey to the "curse of dimensionality." That is, the data structures scale poorly with data dimensionality; in fact, if the number of dimensions exceeds 10 to 20, searching in k-d trees and related structures involves the inspection of a large fraction of the database, thereby doing no better than brute-force linear search. It has been suggested that since the selection of features and the choice of a distance metric in typical applications is rather heuristic, determining an approximate nearest neighbor should suffice for most practical purposes. In this paper, we examine a novel scheme for approximate similarity search based on hashing. The basic idea is to hash the points from the database so as to ensure that the probability of collision is much higher for objects that are close to each other than for those that are far apart. We provide experimental evidence that our method gives significant improvement in running time over other methods for searching in high-dimensional spaces based on hierarchical tree decomposition. Experimental results also indicate that our scheme scales well even for a relatively large number of dimensions (more than 50).				25th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases	SEP 07-10, 1999	ORACLE; Sun Microsyst; IBM; Microsoft SQL Server; Scottish Widows	EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND	209	28	4	0	236		1-55860-615-7	WOS:000089669900049

Associated with chemometrics, it becomes a powerful tool for the pharmaceutical industry. Indeed, NIRS is suitable for analysis of solid, liquid and biotechnological pharmaceutical forms. Moreover, NIRS can be implemented during pharmaceutical development, in production for process monitoring or in quality control laboratories. This review focuses on chemometric techniques and pharmaceutical NIRS applications. The following topics are covered: qualitative analyses, quantitative methods and on-line applications. Theoretical and practical aspects are described with pharmaceutical examples of NIRS applications. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.								208	17	114	4	223	0731-7085		WOS:000248738200010

The new algorithm is a form of spatially varying statistical classification, in which an explicit anatomical template is used to moderate the segmentation obtained by statistical classification. The algorithm consists of an iterated sequence of spatially varying classification and nonlinear registration, which forms an adaptive, template moderated (ATM). spatially varying statistical classification (SVC), Classification methods and nonlinear registration methods are often complementary, both in the tasks where they succeed and in the tasks where they fail. By integrating these approaches the new algorithm avoids many of the disadvantages of each approach alone while exploiting the combination. The ATM SVC algorithm was applied to several segmentation problems, involving different image contrast mechanisms and different locations in the body. Segmentation and validation experiments were carried out for problems involving the quantification of normal anatomy (MRI of brains of neonates) and pathology of various types (MRI of patients with multiple sclerosis, MRI of patients with brain tumors, MRI of patients with damaged knee cartilage). In each case, the ATM SVC algorithm provided a better segmentation than statistical classification or elastic matching alone. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

This paper presents hybrid approaches to handle three issues together. For feature extraction, we apply the multiresolution wavelet transform to extract waveletface. We also perform the linear discriminant analysis on waveletfaces to reinforce discriminant power. During classification, the nearest feature plane (NFP) and nearest feature space (NFS) classifiers are explored for robust decision in presence of wide facial variations. Their relationships to conventional nearest neighbor and nearest feature line classifiers are demonstrated. In the experiments, the discriminant waveletface incorporated with the NFS classifier achieves the best face recognition performance.								179	28	10	0	206	0162-8828		WOS:000179444600008	
J	Chou, Kuo-Chen; Shen, Hong-Bin				Chou, Kuo-Chen/A-8340-2009				Hum-PLoc: A novel ensemble classifier for predicting human protein subcellular localization								BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			347	1			150	157		10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.06.059			AUG 18 2006	2006	Predicting subcellular localization of human proteins is a challenging problem, especially when unknown query proteins do not have significant homology to proteins of known subcellular locations and when more locations need to be covered. To tackle the challenge, protein samples are expressed by hybridizing the gene ontology (GO) database and amphiphilic pseudo amino acid composition (PseAA). Based on such a representation frame, a novel ensemble classifier, called "Hum-PLoc", was developed by fusing many basic individual classifiers through a voting system. The "engine" of these basic classifiers was operated by the KNN (K-nearest neighbor) rule. As a demonstration, tests were performed with the ensemble classifier for human proteins among the following 12 locations: (1) centriole; (2) cytoplasm; (3) cytoskeleton; (4) endoplasmic reticulum; (5) extracell; (6) Golgi apparatus; (7) lysosome; (8) microsome; (9) mitochondrion; (10) nucleus; (11) peroxisome; (12) plasma membrane. To get rid of redundancy and homology bias, none of the proteins investigated here had >= 25% sequence identity to any other in a same subcellular location. The overall success rates thus obtained via the jackknife cross-validation test and independent dataset test were 81.1% and 85.0%, respectively, which are more than 50% higher than those obtained by the other existing methods on the same stringent datasets. Furthermore, an incisive and compelling analysis was given to elucidate that the overwhelmingly high success rate obtained by the new predictor is by no means due to a trivial utilization of the GO annotations. This is because, for those proteins with "subcellular location unknown" annotation in Swiss-Prot database, most (more than 99%) of their corresponding GO numbers in GO database are also annotated with "cellular component unknown". The information and clues for predicting subcellular locations of proteins are actually buried into a series of tedious GO numbers, just like they are buried into a pile of complicated amino acid sequences although with a different manner and "depth". To dig out the knowledge about their locations, a sophisticated operation engine is needed. And the current predictor is one of these kinds, and has proved to be a very powerful one.

To deal with such a challenging problem, the ensemble classifier was introduced. It was formed by a set of basic classifiers, with each trained in different parameter systems, such as predicted secondary structure, hydrophobicity, van der Waals volume, polarity, polarizability, as well as different dimensions of pseudo-amino acid composition, which were extracted from attaining dataset. The operation engine for the constituent individual classifiers was OET-KNN (optimized evidence-theoretic k-nearest neighbors) rule. Their outcomes were combined through a weighted voting to give a final determination for classifying a query protein. The recognition was to find the true fold among the 27 possible patterns.Results: The overall success rate thus obtained was 62% for a testing dataset where most of the proteins have < 25% sequence identity with the proteins used in training the classifier. Such a rate is 6-21% higher than the corresponding rates obtained by various existing NN (neural networks) and SVM (support vector machines) approaches, implying that the ensemble classifier is very promising and might become a useful vehicle in protein science, as well as proteomics and bioinformatics.								164	4	120	0	170	1367-4803		WOS:000239725900006

First, the precise semantic video object boundary can be found using a combination of human assistance and a morphological segmentation tool. Second, the semantic video objects in the remaining frames are obtained using global perspective motion estimation and compensation of the previous semantic video object plus boundary refinement as used for I frames.								153	24	0	0	175	1051-8215		WOS:000075967500006

However, resistance to this drug develops within a few months in most patients. We aimed to predict resistance to STI571.Methods Total RNA was extracted from 25 bone-marrow samples from 19 patients with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who were enrolled into a phase 11 study. 17 samples were obtained before STI571 treatment was started: ten from individuals who were classified as good responders to STI571 (sensitive), and seven from individuals who did not to respond to STI571 (primary resistance). Eight samples were obtained from patients during treatment with STI571. We analysed six matched samples, which were obtained before and during treatment with STI571. Oligonucleotide microarray analysis of samples was done with high-density microarrays.Findings We identified 95 genes whose expression could be used to predict sensitivity of leukaemic cells to STI571. On this basis, all the STI571-sensitive samples could clearly be distinguished from the resistant cases. 56 highly differentially expressed genes were identified in leukaemic cells that were secondarily resistant to STI571. Resistant leukaemic cells expressed high levels of Bruton's tyrosine kinase and two ATP synthetases (ATP5A1 and ATP5C1), and showed significantly reduced expression of the proapoptotic gene BAK1 and the cell-cycle control gene p15 INK4b,Interpretation We have shown the clinical relevance of gene expression data for the pretreatment assessment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

With a large database of instances classification response time can be slow. When noisy instances are present classification accuracy can suffer. Drawing on the large body of relevant work carried out in the past 30 years, we review the principle approaches to solving these problems. By deleting instances, both problems can be alleviated, but the criterion used is typically assumed to be all encompassing and effective over many domains. We argue against this position and introduce an algorithm that rivals the most successful existing algorithm. When evaluated on 30 different problems, neither algorithm consistently outperforms the other: consistency is very hard. To achieve the best results, we need to develop mechanisms that provide insights into the structure of class definitions. We discuss the possibility of these mechanisms and propose some initial measures that could be useful for the data miner.								144	5	10	1	150	1384-5810		WOS:000173684600003

J	Weinberger, Kilian Q.; Saul, Lawrence K.								Distance Metric Learning for Large Margin Nearest Neighbor Classification								JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			10				207	244					FEB 2009	2009	The accuracy of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classification depends significantly on the metric used to compute distances between different examples. In this paper, we show how to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric for kNN classification from labeled examples. The Mahalanobis metric can equivalently be viewed as a global linear transformation of the input space that precedes kNN classification using Euclidean distances. In our approach, the metric is trained with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same class while examples from different classes are separated by a large margin. As in support vector machines (SVMs), the margin criterion leads to a convex optimization based on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our approach requires no modification or extension for problems in multiway (as opposed to binary) classification. In our framework, the Mahalanobis distance metric is obtained as the solution to a semidefinite program. On several data sets of varying size and difficulty, we find that metrics trained in this way lead to significant improvements in kNN classification. Sometimes these results can be further improved by clustering the training examples and learning an individual metric within each cluster. We show how to learn and combine these local metrics in a globally integrated manner.								141	10	11	0	151	1532-4435		WOS:000270824200005	
J	Chou, Kuo-Chen; Shen, Hong-Bin				Chou, Kuo-Chen/A-8340-2009				Predicting eukaryotic protein subcellular location by fusing optimized evidence-theoretic K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers								JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH			5	8			1888	1897		10.1021/pr060167c			AUG 4 2006	2006	Facing the explosion of newly generated protein sequences in the post genomic era, we are challenged to develop an automated method for fast and reliably annotating their subcellular locations. Knowledge of subcellular locations of proteins can provide useful hints for revealing their functions and understanding how they interact with each other in cellular networking. Unfortunately, it is both expensive and time-consuming to determine the localization of an uncharacterized protein in a living cell purely based on experiments. To tackle the challenge, a novel hybridization classifier was developed by fusing many basic individual classifiers through a voting system. The "engine" of these basic classifiers was operated by the OET-KNN (Optimized Evidence-Theoretic K-Nearest Neighbor) rule. As a demonstration, predictions were performed with the fusion classifier for proteins among the following 16 localizations: (1) cell wall, (2) centriole, (3) chloroplast, (4) cyanelle, (5) cytoplasm, (6) cytoskeleton, (7) endoplasmic reticulum, (8) extracell, (9) Golgi apparatus, (10) lysosome, (11) mitochondria, (12) nucleus, (13) peroxisome, (14) plasma membrane, (15) plastid, and (16) vacuole. To get rid of redundancy and homology bias, none of the proteins investigated here had g25% sequence identity to any other in a same subcellular location. The overall success rates thus obtained via the jack-knife cross-validation test and independent dataset test were 81.6% and 83.7%, respectively, which were 46 similar to 63% higher than those performed by the other existing methods on the same benchmark datasets. Also, it is clearly elucidated that the overwhelmingly high success rates obtained by the fusion classifier is by no means a trivial utilization of the GO annotations as prone to be misinterpreted because there is a huge number of proteins with given accession numbers and the corresponding GO numbers, but their subcellular locations are still unknown, and that the percentage of proteins with GO annotations indicating their subcellular components is even less than the percentage of proteins with known subcellular location annotation in the Swiss- Prot database. It is anticipated that the powerful fusion classifier may also become a very useful high throughput tool in characterizing other attributes of proteins according to their sequences, such as enzyme class, membrane protein type, and nuclear receptor subfamily, among many others. A web server, called " Euk- OET- PLoc", has been designed at http:// 202.120.37.186/ bioinf/ euk- oet for public to predict subcellular locations of eukaryotic proteins by the fusion OET- KNN classifier.								141	3	117	0	144	1535-3893		WOS:000239493700008

In view of this, an ensemble classifier, Plant-PLoc, formed by fusing many basic individual classifiers, has been developed for large-scale subcellular location prediction for plant proteins. Each of the basic classifiers was engineered by the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) rule. Plant-PLoc discriminates plant proteins among the following 11 subcellular locations: (1) cell wall, (2) chloroplast, (3) cytoplasm, (4) endoplasmic reticulum, (5) extracell, (6) mitochondrion, (7) nucleus, (8) peroxisome, (9) plasma membrane, (10) plastid, and (11) vacuole. As a demonstration, predictions were performed on a stringent benchmark dataset in which none of the proteins included has >= 25% sequence identity to any other in a same subcellular location to avoid the homology bias. The overall success rate thus obtained was 32-51 % higher than the rates obtained by the previous methods on the same benchmark dataset. The essence of Plant-PLoc in enhancing the prediction quality and its significance in biological applications are discussed. Plant-PLoc is accessible to public as a free web-server at http://202.1 20.37.186/bioinf/plant. Furthermore, for public convenience, results predicted by Plant-PLoc have been provided in a downloadable file at the same website for all plant protein entries in the Swiss-Prot database that do not have subcellular location annotations, or are annotated as being uncertain. The large-scale results will be updated twice a year to include new entries of plant proteins and reflect the continuous development of Plant-PLoc.								137	2	116	0	140	0730-2312		WOS:000243775700010

Information of subcellular locations of proteins can provide useful insights for revealing their functions and understanding how they interact with each other in cellular network systems. Most of the existing methods in predicting plant protein subcellular localization can only cover three or four location sites, and none of them can be used to deal with multiplex plant proteins that can simultaneously exist at two, or move between, two or more different location sits. Actually, such multiplex proteins might have special biological functions worthy of particular notice. The present study was devoted to improve the existing plant protein subcellular location predictors from the aforementioned two aspects. A new predictor called "Plant-mPLoc'' is developed by integrating the gene ontology information, functional domain information, and sequential evolutionary information through three different modes of pseudo amino acid composition. It can be used to identify plant proteins among the following 12 location sites: (1) cell membrane, (2) cell wall, (3) chloroplast, (4) cytoplasm, (5) endoplasmic reticulum, (6) extracellular, (7) Golgi apparatus, (8) mitochondrion, (9) nucleus, (10) peroxisome, (11) plastid, and (12) vacuole. Compared with the existing methods for predicting plant protein subcellular localization, the new predictor is much more powerful and flexible. Particularly, it also has the capacity to deal with multiple-location proteins, which is beyond the reach of any existing predictors specialized for identifying plant protein subcellular localization. As a user-friendly web-server, Plant-mPLoc is freely accessible at http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/plant-multi/. Moreover, for the convenience of the vast majority of experimental scientists, a step-by-step guide is provided on how to use the web-server to get the desired results. It is anticipated that the Plant-mPLoc predictor as presented in this paper will become a very useful tool in plant science as well as all the relevant areas.								135	2	117	0	136	1932-6203		WOS:000279259900008

CD34 cells were isolated by magnetic cell separation, and high-density oligonucleotide microarray analysis was performed. For confirmation, the expression of selected genes was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Class membership prediction analysis selected 11 genes. Using the expression profile of these genes, we were able to discriminate patients with low-risk from patients with high-risk MDS and both patient groups from the control group by hierarchical clustering (Spearman confidence). The power of these 11 genes was verified by applying the algorithm to an unknown test set containing expression data from 8 additional patients with MDS (3 at low risk, 5 at high risk). Patients at low risk could be distinguished from those at high risk by clustering analysis. In low-risk MDS, we found that the retinoic-acid-induced gene (RAI3), the radiation-inducible, immediate-early response gene (IEX1), and the stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) were down-regulated. These data suggest that CD34(+) cells from patients with low-risk MDS lack defensive proteins, resulting in their susceptibility to cell damage. In summary, we propose that gene expression profiling may have clinical relevance for risk evaluation in MDS at the time of initial diagnosis. Furthermore, this study provides evidence that in MDS, hematopoietic stem cells accumulate defects that prevent normal hematopoiesis.								130	5	99	0	137	0006-4971		WOS:000179158500017	
J	SALZBERG, S				Salzberg, Steven/F-6162-2011				A NEAREST HYPERRECTANGLE LEARNING-METHOD								MACHINE LEARNING			6	3			251	276		10.1023/A:1022661727670			MAY 1991	1991	This paper presents a theory of learning called nested generalized exemplar (NGE) theory, in which learning is accomplished by storing objects in Euclidean n-space, E(n), as hyperrectangles. The hyperrectangles may be nested inside one another to arbitrary depth. In contrast to generalization processes that replace symbolic formulae by more general formulae, the NGE algorithm modifies hyperrectangles by growing and reshaping them in a well-defined fashion. The axes of these hyperrectangles are defined by the variable measured for each example. Each variable can have any range on the real line; thus the theory is not restricted to symbolic or binary values.This paper describes some advantages and disadvantages of NGE theory, positions it as a form of exemplar-based learning, and compares it to other inductive learning theories. An implementation has been tested in three different domains, for which results are presented below: prediction of breast cancer, classification of iris flowers, and prediction of survival times for heart attack patients. The results in these domains support the claim that NGE theory can be used to create compact representations with excellent predictive accuracy.								129	5	2	0	133	0885-6125		WOS:A1991FK36600003

We begin with a short background concerning the necessary learning theoretical foundations of weak learners and their linear combinations. We then point out the useful connection between Boosting and the Theory of Optimization, which facilitates the understanding of Boosting and later on enables us to move on to new Boosting algorithms, applicable to a broad spectrum of problems. In order to increase the relevance of the paper to practitioners, we have added remarks, pseudo code, "tricks of the trade", and algorithmic considerations where appropriate. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of Boosting algorithms by giving an overview of some existing applications. The main ideas are illustrated on the problem of binary classification, although several extensions are discussed.

Liver gene expression signature to predict response to pegylated interferon plus ribavirin combination therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C								GUT			57	4			516	524		10.1136/gut.2007.128611			APR 2008	2008	Background and Aims: The gold standard treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is combined pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Considering side effects and treatment cost, prediction of treatment response before therapy is important. The aim of this study was to identify a liver gene signature to predict sustained virological response in patients with CHC.Methods: Group A (training set) comprised 40 patients with CHC including 14 non-responders (NRs) and 26 sustained virological responders (SVRs). Group B (validation set) comprised 29 patients including 9 NRs and 20 SVRs. Eleven responder-relapsers were also included. A total of 58 genes associated with liver gene expression dysregulation during CHC were selected from the literature. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR assays were used to analyse the mRNA expression of these 58 selected genes in liver biopsy specimens taken from the patients before treatment.Results: From the Group A data, three genes whose expression was significantly increased in NRs compared with SVRs were identified: IFI-6-16/G1P3, IFI27 and ISG15/G1P2. These three genes also showed significant differences in their expression profiles between NRs and SVRs in the independent sample (Group B). Supervised class prediction analysis identified a two-gene (IFI27 and CXCL9) signature, which accurately predicted treatment response in 79.3% (23/29) of patients from the validation set (Group B), with a predictive accuracy of 100% (9/9) and of 70% (14/20) in NRs and SVRs, respectively. The expression profiles of responder-relapsers did not differ significantly from those of NRs and SVRs, and 73% (8/11) of them were predicted as SVRs with the two-gene classifier.Conclusion: NRs and SVRs have different liver gene expression profiles before treatment. The most notable changes occurred mainly in interferon-stimulated genes. Treatment response could be predicted with a two-gene signature (IFI27 and CXCL9).								112	1	90	1	114	0017-5749		WOS:000253877300018

In contrast to the widely held view that less processing reduces accuracy, the study of heuristics shows that less information, computation, and time can in fact improve accuracy. We review the major progress made so far: (a) the discovery of less-is-more effects; (b) the study of the ecological rationality of heuristics, which examines in which environments a given strategy succeeds or fails, and why; (c) an advancement from vague labels to computational models of heuristics; (d) the development of a systematic theory of heuristics that identifies their building blocks and the evolved capacities they exploit, and views the cognitive system as relying on an "adaptive toolbox;'' and (e) the development of an empirical methodology that accounts for individual differences, conducts competitive tests, and has provided evidence for people's adaptive use of heuristics. Homo heuristicus has a biased mind and ignores part of the available information, yet a biased mind can handle uncertainty more efficiently and robustly than an unbiased mind relying on more resource-intensive and general-purpose processing strategies.								104	1	18	0	105	1756-8757		WOS:000283862000006

In these operators the argument ordering process is guided by a variable called the order inducing value. A procedure for learning the weights from data is described. We suggest a number of applications of these induced OWA aggregation operators. First we show its possibilities in modeling nearest-neighbor rules. Next it is applied to the aggregation of complex objects such as matrices. It is also used to establish a new class of information fusion models called "best yesterday models". Finally, we extend the idea of order induced aggregation to the Choquet aggregation resulting in what we call the induced Choquet ordered averaging (I-COA) operator. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

With the avalanche of new protein sequences emerging during the post-genomic era, it is highly desirable to develop an automated method that can serve as a high throughput tool in identifying the types of newly found membrane proteins according to their primary sequences, so as to timely make the relevant annotations on them for the reference usage in both basic research and drug discovery. Based on the concept of pseudo-amino acid composition [K.C. Chou, Proteins: Struct. Funct. Genet. 43 (2001) 246255; Erratum: Proteins: Struct. Funct. Genet. 44 (2001) 60] that has made it possible to incorporate a considerable amount of sequence-order effects by representing a protein sample in terms of a set of discrete numbers, a novel predictor, the so-called "optimized evidence-theoretic K-nearest neighbor" or "OET-KNN" classifier, was proposed. It was demonstrated via the self-consistency test, jackknife test, and independent dataset test that the new predictor, compared with many previous ones, yielded higher success rates in most cases. The new predictor can also be used to improve the prediction quality for, among many other protein attributes, structural class, subcellular localization, enzyme family class, and G-protein coupled receptor type.

For in-depth understanding of the biochemical process of the nucleus, the knowledge of localization of nuclear proteins is very important. With the avalanche of protein sequences generated in the post-genomic era, it is highly desired to develop an automated method for fast annotating the subnuclear locations for numerous newly found nuclear protein sequences so as to be able to timely utilize them for basic research and drug discovery. In view of this, a novel approach is developed for predicting the protein subnuclear location. It is featured by introducing a powerful classifier, the optimized evidence-theoretic K-nearest classifier, and using the pseudo amino acid composition [K.C. Chou, PROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Genetics, 43 (2001) 246], which can incorporate a considerable amount of sequence-order effects, to represent protein samples. As a demonstration, identifications were performed for 370 nuclear proteins among the following 9 subnuclear locations: (1) Cajal body, (2) chromatin, (3) heterochromatin, (4) nuclear diffuse, (5) nuclear pore, (6) nuclear speckle, (7) nucleolus, (8) PcG body, and (9) PML body. The overall success rates thus obtained by both the re-substitution test and jackknife cross-validation test are significantly higher than those by existing classifiers on the same working dataset. It is anticipated that the powerful approach may also become a useful high throughput vehicle to bridge the huge gap occurring in the post-genomic era between the number of gene sequences in databases and the number of gene products that have been functionally characterized.

J	LOWE, DG								SIMILARITY METRIC LEARNING FOR A VARIABLE-KERNEL CLASSIFIER								NEURAL COMPUTATION			7	1			72	85		10.1162/neco.1995.7.1.72			JAN 1995	1995	Nearest-neighbor interpolation algorithms have many useful properties for applications to learning, but they often exhibit poor generalization. In this paper, it is shown that much better generalization can be obtained by using a variable interpolation kernel in combination with conjugate gradient optimization of the similarity metric and kernel size. The resulting method is called variable-kernel similarity metric (VSM) learning. It has been tested on several standard classification data sets, and on these problems it shows better generalization than backpropagation and most other learning methods. The number of parameters that must be determined through optimization are orders of magnitude less than for backpropagation or radial basis function (RBF) networks, which may indicate that the method better captures the essential degrees of variation in learning. Other features of VSM learning are discussed that make it relevant to models for biological learning in the brain.								101	3	5	0	103	0899-7667		WOS:A1995QG83300007

J	Domingos, P								Unifying instance-based and rule-based induction								MACHINE LEARNING			24	2			141	168					AUG 1996	1996	Several well-developed approaches to inductive learning now exist, but each has specific limitations that are hard to overcome. Multi-strategy learning attempts to tackle this problem by combining multiple methods in one algorithm. This article describes a unification of two widely-used empirical approaches: rule induction and instance-based learning. In the new algorithm, instances are treated as maximally specific rules, and classification is performed using a best-match strategy. Rules are learned by gradually generalizing instances until no improvement in apparent accuracy is obtained. Theoretical analysis shows this approach to be efficient. It is implemented in the RISE 3.1 system. In an extensive empirical study, RISE consistently achieves higher accuracies than state-of-the-art representatives of both its parent approaches (PEBLS and CN2), as well as a decision tree learner (C4.5). Lesion studies show that each of RISE's components is essential to this performance. Most significantly, in 14 of the 30 domains studied, RISE is more accurate than the best of PEELS and CN2, showing that a significant synergy can be obtained by combining multiple empirical methods.								98	5	1	0	103	0885-6125		WOS:A1996UZ38000004

In this approach, each neighbor of a pattern to be classified is considered as an item of evidence supporting certain hypotheses concerning the class membership of that pattern. Based on this evidence, basic belief masses are assigned to each subset of the set of classes. Such masses are obtained for each of the k-nearest neighbors of the pattern under consideration and aggregated using the Dempster's rule of combination. In many situations, this method was found experimentally to yield lower error rates than other methods using the same information. However, the problem of tuning the parameters of the classification rule was so far unresolved. In this paper, we determine optimal or near-optimal parameter values from the data by minimizing an error function. This refinement of the original method is shown experimentally to result in substantial improvement of classification accuracy.								97	6	18	0	103	1094-6977		WOS:000074026800008

The MS-NFI utilises NFI field plot data, optical area satellite images and digital maps and produces forest variable estimates from the single pixel level up to the national level. The most important parameters to be selected are: the distance metric, the number of the nearest neighbours, ii, parameters related to the digital elevation model, stratification of the image data, as well as the width of the moving geographical horizontal and vertical reference areas (HRAs and VRAs). The root mean square errors (RMSEs) and significance of biases at pixel level were evaluated in order to find optimal parameters. A leave-one-out cross-validation method was applied. The emphasis is placed on the search for moving geographical HRAs and VRAs, as well as in the stratification of the field plots and the satellite images on the basis of auxiliary data. Stratification reduces the bias of the estimates significantly within each strata. With the current sampling intensity of the Finnish national forest inventory, a geographical HRA with a radius of 40-50 km was found optimal for the total volume estimates and for volumes by tree species in the mineral land map stratum. On the average, there was a sufficient number of field plots to cover the variation of forest variables within the image area to be analysed. The inclusion of field plot data beyond this area introduced bias to the estimates. For the peatland strata, a wider reference area, 60-90 km, was needed. A VRA together with topographic correction of the digital values of images, reduced the standard error of the volume estimates in Northern Finland. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Although the basic structure of biological membrane is provided by the lipid bilayer, membrane proteins perform most of the specific functions. Membrane proteins are putatively classified into five different types. Identification of their types is currently an important topic in bioinformatics and proteomics. In this paper, based on the concept of representing protein samples in terms of their pseudo-amino acid composition (Chou, K.C., 2001. Prediction of protein cellular attributes using pseudo amino acid composition. Proteins: Struct. Funct. Genet. 43, 246-255), the fuzzy K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm has been introduced to predict membrane protein types, and high success rates were observed. It is anticipated that, the current approach, which is based on a branch of fuzzy mathematics and represents a new strategy, may play an important complementary role to the existing methods in this area. The novel approach may also have notable impact on prediction of the other attributes, such as protein structural class, protein subcellular localization, and enzyme family class, among many others.

It is based on results from the "MICCAI 2007 Grand Challenge" workshop, where 16 teams evaluated their algorithms on a common database. A collection of 20 clinical images with reference segmentations was provided to train and tune algorithms in advance. Participants were also allowed to use additional proprietary training data for that purpose. All teams then had to apply their methods to 10 test datasets and submit the obtained results. Employed algorithms include statistical shape models, atlas registration, level-sets, graph-cuts and rule-based systems. All results were compared to reference segmentations five error measures that highlight different aspects of segmentation accuracy. All measures were combined according to a specific scoring system relating the obtained values to human expert variability. In general, interactive methods reached higher average scores than automatic approaches and featured a better consistency of segmentation quality. However, the best automatic methods (mainly based on statistical shape models with some additional free deformation) could compete well on the majority of test images. The study provides an insight in performance of different segmentation approaches under real-world conditions and highlights achievements and limitations of current image analysis techniques.								94	4	16	1	99	0278-0062		WOS:000268525500012

Both narrow and wide bandwidth PD detectors are considered; particular attention is given in regard to their suitability to different types of electrical apparatus and cable specimens under test as well as their applicability to discharge site location and their capability to detect different forms of PD. A rather substantial portion of the discussion is devoted to the use of intelligent machines as applied to PD pattern recognition in terms of either PD pulse-height/discharge epoch (phase) distributions or discharge pulse shape attributes.								92	13	0	0	105	1070-9878		WOS:000178901200023

Therefore, knowledge of the subcellular localization of viral proteins in a host cell or virus-infected cell is very useful for in-depth studying of their functions and mechanisms as well as designing antiviral drugs. An analysis on the Swiss-Prot database (version 50.0, released on May 30, 2006) indicates that only 23.5% of viral protein entries are annotated for their subcellular locations in this regard. As for the gene ontology database, the corresponding percentage is 23.8%. Such a gap calls for the development of high throughput tools for timely annotating the localization of viral proteins within host and virus-infected cells. In this article, a predictor called "Virus-PLoc" has been developed that is featured by fusing many basic classifiers with each engineered according to the K-nearest neighbor rule. The overall jackknife success rate obtained by Virus-PLoc in identifying the subcellular compartments of viral proteins was 80% for a benchmark dataset in which none of proteins has more than 25% sequence identity to any other in a same location site. Virus-PLoc will be freely available as a web-server at http://202.120.37.1861bioinf/ virus for the public usage. Furthermore, Virus-PLoc has been used to provide large-scale predictions of all viral protein entries in Swiss-Prot database that do not have subcellular location annotations or are annotated as being uncertain. The results thus obtained have been deposited in a downloadable file prepared with Microsoft Excel and named "Tab_Virus-PLoc.xls." This file is available at the same website and will be updated twice a year to include the new entries of viral proteins and reflect the continuous development of Virus-PLoc.

J	Shen, Hong-Bin; Chou, Kuo-Chen				Chou, Kuo-Chen/A-8340-2009				Gpos-PLoc: an ensemble classifier for predicting subcellular localization of Gram-positive bacterial proteins								PROTEIN ENGINEERING DESIGN & SELECTION			20	1			39	46		10.1093/protein-gzl053			JAN 2007	2007	A statistical analysis indicated that, of the 35 016 Gram-positive bacterial proteins from the recent Swiss-Prot database, similar to 57% of these entries are without subcellular location annotations. In the gene ontology database, the corresponding percentage is similar to 67%, meaning the percentage of proteins without subcellular component annotations is even higher. With the avalanche of gene products generated in the post-genomic era, the number of such location-unknown entries will continuously increase. It is highly desired to develop an automated method for timely and accurately identifying their subcellular localization because the information thus obtained is very useful for both basic research and drug discovery practice. In view of this, an ensemble classifier called 'Gpos-PLoc' was developed for predicting Gram-positive protein subcellular localization. The new predictor is featured by fusing many basic classifiers, each of which was engineered according to the optimized evidence-theoretic K-nearest neighbors rule. As a demonstration, tests were performed on Gram-positive proteins among the following five subcellular location sites: (1) cell wall, (2) cytoplasm, (3) extracell, (4) periplasm and (5) plasma membrane. To eliminate redundancy and homology bias, only those proteins which have < 25% sequence identity to any other in a same subcellular location were allowed to be included in the benchmark datasets. The overall success rates thus achieved by Gpos-PLoc were > 80% for both jackknife cross-validation test and independent dataset test, implying that Gpos-PLoc might become a very useful vehicle for expediting the analysis of Gram-positive bacterial proteins. Gpos-PLoc is freely accessible to public as a web-server at http://202.120.37.186/bioinf/Gpos/. To support the need of many investigators in the relevant areas, a downloadable file is provided at the same website to list the results identified by Gpos-PLoc for 31898 Gram-positive bacterial protein entries in Swiss-Prot database that either have no subcellular location annotation or are annotated with uncertain terms such as 'probable', 'potential', 'perhaps' and 'by similarity'. Such large-scale results will be updated once a year to include the new entries of Gram-positive bacterial proteins and reflect the continuous development of Gpos-PLoc.								90	2	75	0	92	1741-0126		WOS:000244431200006

However, the response to radiotherapy differs among individual tumors. Our objective here was to identify a set of discriminating genes that can be used for characterization and prediction of response to radiotherapy in rectal cancer. Fifty-two rectal cancer patients who underwent preoperative radiotherapy were studied. Biopsy specimens were obtained from rectal cancer before preoperative radiotherapy. Response to radiotherapy was determined by histopathologic examination of surgically resected specimens and classified as responders or nonresponders. By determining gene expression profiles using human U95Av2 Gene Chip, we identified 33 novel discriminating genes of which the expression differed significantly between responders and nonresponders. Using this gene set, we were able to establish a new model to predict response to radiotherapy in rectal cancer with an accuracy of 82.4%. The list of discriminating genes included growth factor, apoptosis, cell proliferation, signal transduction, or cell adhesion-related genes. Among 33 discriminating genes, apoptosis inducers (lumican, thrombospondin 2, and galectin-1) showed higher expression in responders whereas apoptosis inhibitors (cyclophilin 40 and glutathione peroxidase) showed higher expression in nonresponders. The present study suggested the possibility that gene expression profiling may be useful in predicting response to radiotherapy to establish an individualized tailored therapy for rectal cancer. Global expression profiles of responders and nonresponders may provide insights into the development of novel therapeutic targets.								89	2	53	0	94	0008-5472		WOS:000236657800008

Then new multiplicative and additive classes are defined. We show that each class satisfies five well-known axioms for fuzziness measures, and demonstrate that several existing measures are relatives of these classes. The multiplicative class is based on nan-negative, monotone increasing concave functions. The additive class requires only non-negative concave functions. Some relationships between several existing and the new measures are established, and some new properties are derived. The relative merits and drawbacks of different measures for applications are discussed. A weighted fuzzy entropy which is flexible enough to incorporate subjectivness in the measure of fuzziness is also introduced. Finally, we comment on the construction of measures that may assess all of the uncertainties associated with a physical system.								89	10	3	0	100	1063-6706		WOS:A1994PT98900002

Chou, Kuo-Chen/A-8340-2009				Euk-PLoc: an ensemble classifier for large-scale eukaryotic protein subcellular location prediction								AMINO ACIDS			33	1			57	67		10.1007/s00726-006-0478-8			JUL 2007	2007	With the avalanche of newly-found protein sequences emerging in the post genomic era, it is highly desirable to develop an automated method for fast and reliably identifying their subcellular locations because knowledge thus obtained can provide key clues for revealing their functions and understanding how they interact with each other in cellular networking. However, predicting subcellular location of eukaryotic proteins is a challenging problem, particularly when unknown query proteins do not have significant homology to proteins of known subcellular locations and when more locations need to be covered. To cope with the challenge, protein samples are formulated by hybridizing the information derived from the gene ontology database and amphiphilic pseudo amino acid composition. Based on such a representation, a novel ensemble hybridization classifier was developed by fusing many basic individual classifiers through a voting system. Each of these basic classifiers was engineered by the KNN ( K-Nearest Neighbor) principle. As a demonstration, a new benchmark dataset was constructed that covers the following 18 localizations: ( 1) cell wall, ( 2) centriole, ( 3) chloroplast, ( 4) cyanelle, ( 5) cytoplasm, ( 6) cytoskeleton, ( 7) endoplasmic reticulum, ( 8) extracell, ( 9) Golgi apparatus, ( 10) hydrogenosome, ( 11) lysosome, ( 12) mitochondria, ( 13) nucleus, ( 14) peroxisome, ( 15) plasma membrane, ( 16) plastid, ( 17) spindle pole body, and ( 18) vacuole. To avoid the homology bias, none of the proteins included has >= 25% sequence identity to any other in a same subcellular location. The overall success rates thus obtained via the 5-fold and jackknife cross-validation tests were 81.6 and 80.3%, respectively, which were 40-50% higher than those performed by the other existing methods on the same strict dataset. The powerful predictor, named "Euk-PLoc'', is available as a web-server at http:// 202.120.37.186/ bioinf/euk. Furthermore, to support the need of people working in the relevant areas, a downloadable file will be provided at the same website to list the results predicted by Euk-PLoc for all eukaryotic protein entries ( excluding fragments) in Swiss-Prot database that do not have subcellular location annotations or are annotated as being uncertain. The large-scale results will be updated twice a year to include the new entries of eukaryotic proteins and reflect the continuous development of Euk-PLoc.								87	1	74	0	88	0939-4451		WOS:000248186200006	
J	Pekalska, E; Duin, RPW; Paclik, P								Prototype selection for dissimilarity-based classifiers								PATTERN RECOGNITION			39	2			189	208		10.1016/j.patcog.2005.06.012			FEB 2006	2006	A conventional way to discriminate between objects represented by dissimilarities is the nearest neighbor method. A more efficient and sometimes a more accurate solution is offered by other dissimilarity-based classifiers. They construct a decision rule based on the entire training set, but they need just a small set of prototypes, the so-called representation set, as a reference for classifying new objects. Such alternative approaches may be especially advantageous for non-Euclidean or even non-metric dissimilarities.The choice of a proper representation set for dissimilarity-based classifiers is not yet fully investigated. It appears that a random selection may work well. In this paper, a number of experiments has been conducted on various metric and non-metric dissimilarity representations and prototype selection methods. Several procedures, like traditional feature selection methods (here effectively searching for prototypes), mode seeking and linear programming are compared to the random selection. In general, we find out that systematic approaches lead to better results than the random selection, especially for a small number of prototypes. Although there is no single winner as it depends on data characteristics, the k-centres works well, in general. For two-class problems, an important observation is that our dissimilarity-based discrimination functions relying on significantly reduced prototype sets (3-10% of the training objects) offer a similar or much better classification accuracy than the best k-NN rule on the entire training set. This may be reached for multi-class data as well, however such problems are more difficult. (c) 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Tripathi, Shivam; Srinivas, V. V.; Nanjundiah, Ravi S.								Dowinscaling of precipitation for climate change scenarios: A support vector machine approach								JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			330	3-4			621	640		10.1016/j.jhydrot.2006.04.030			NOV 15 2006	2006	The Climate impact studies in hydrology often rely on climate change information at fine spatial resolution. However, general circulation models (GCMs), which are among the most advanced tools for estimating future climate change scenarios, operate on a coarse scale. Therefore the output from a GCM has to be downscaled to obtain the information relevant to hydrologic studies. In this paper, a support vector machine (SVM) approach is proposed for statistical downscaling of precipitation at monthly time scale. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated through its application to meteorological sub-divisions (MSDs) in India. First, climate variables affecting spatio-temporal variation of precipitation at each MSD in India are identified. Following this, the data pertaining to the identified climate variables (predictors) at each MSD are classified using cluster analysis to form two groups, representing wet and dry seasons. For each MSD, SVM-based downscaling model (DM) is developed for season(s) with significant rainfall using principal components extracted from the predictors as input and the contemporaneous precipitation observed at the MSD as an output. The proposed DM is shown to be superior to conventional downscaling using multi-layer back-propagation artificial neural networks. Subsequently, the SVM-based DM is applied to future climate predictions from the second generation Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM2) to obtain future projections of precipitation for the MSDs. The results are then analyzed to assess the impact of climate change on precipitation over India. It is shown that SVMs provide a promising alternative to conventional artificial neural networks for statistical downscaling, and are suitable for conducting climate impact studies.

J	Zheng, ZJ; Webb, GI				Webb, Geoffrey/A-1347-2008				Lazy learning of Bayesian rules								MACHINE LEARNING			41	1			53	84		10.1023/A:1007613203719			OCT 2000	2000	The naive Bayesian classifier provides a simple and effective approach to classifier learning, but its attribute independence assumption is often violated in the real world. A number of approaches have sought to alleviate this problem. A Bayesian tree learning algorithm builds a decision tree, and generates a local naive Bayesian classifier at each leaf. The tests leading to a leaf can alleviate attribute inter-dependencies for the local naive Bayesian classifier. However, Bayesian tree learning still suffers from the small disjunct problem of tree learning. While inferred Bayesian trees demonstrate low average prediction error rates, there is reason to believe that error rates will be higher for those leaves with few training examples. This paper proposes the application of lazy learning techniques to Bayesian tree induction and presents the resulting lazy Bayesian rule learning algorithm, called LBR. This algorithm can be justified by a variant of Bayes theorem which supports a weaker conditional attribute independence assumption than is required by naive Bayes. For each test example, it builds a most appropriate rule with a local naive Bayesian classifier as its consequent. It is demonstrated that the computational requirements of LBR are reasonable in a wide cross-section of natural domains. Experiments with these domains show that, on average, this new algorithm obtains lower error rates significantly more often than the reverse in comparison to a naive Bayesian classifier, C4.5, a Bayesian tree learning algorithm, a constructive Bayesian classifier that eliminates attributes and constructs new attributes using Cartesian products of existing nominal attributes, and a lazy decision tree learning algorithm. It also outperforms, although the result is not statistically significant, a selective naive Bayesian classifier.								82	12	1	0	94	0885-6125		WOS:000088654300003

The networks are used to classify measurement vectors into a set of predefined categories that represent the various functional and malfunctional states of the process. While the networks can usually produce decision surfaces that correctly classify the training examples, regions of the input space not occupied by training data are classified arbitrarily. As a result, the networks may not accurately extrapolate from the training data. Although extrapolation is not required under ideal circumstances, in practice the network may be required to extrapolate when undersized training sets are used, when parent distributions of fault classes undergo shifts subsequent to training, and when the input data is corrupted by missing or biased sensors. These situations cause relatively high error rates for the neural classifier. A related probem is that the networks cannot detect when they lack the data for a reliable classification, a serious deficiency in many practical applications. Classifiers based on distance metrics assign regions of the input space according to their proximity to the training data, and thus extrapolation is not arbitrary but based on the most relevant data. Distance-based classifiers perform better under nonideal conditions and are to be preferred to neural network classifiers in diagnostic applications.								79	2	1	0	81	0098-1354		WOS:A1990EQ49400002

A traditional way to discriminate between objects represented by dissimilarities is the nearest neighbor method. It suffers, however, from a number of limitations, i.e., high computational complexity, a potential loss of accuracy when a small set of prototypes is used and sensitivity to noise. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose to use a normal density-based classifier constructed on the same representation. We show that such a classifier, based on a weighted combination of dissimilarities, can significantly improve the nearest neighbor rule with respect to the recognition accuracy and computational effort.

J	Chou, Kuo-Chen; Shen, Hong-Bin				Chou, Kuo-Chen/A-8340-2009				Large-scale predictions of gram-negative bacterial protein subcellular locations								JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH			5	12			3420	3428		10.1021/pr060404b			DEC 1 2006	2006	Many species of Gram-negative bacteria are pathogenic bacteria that can cause disease in a host organism. This pathogenic capability is usually associated with certain components in Gram-negative cells. Therefore, developing an automated method for fast and reliabe prediction of Gram-negative protein subcellular location will allow us to not only timely annotate gene products, but also screen candidates for drug discovery. However, protein subcellular location prediction is a very difficult problem, particularly when more location sites need to be involved and when unknown query proteins do not have significant homology to proteins of known subcellular locations. PSORT-B, a recently updated version of PSORT, widely used for predicting Gram-negative protein subcellular location, only covers five location sites. Also, the data set used to train PSORT-B contains many proteins with high degrees of sequence identity in a same location group and, hence, may bear a strong homology bias. To overcome these problems, a new predictor, called "Gneg-PLoc", is developed. Featured by fusing many basic classifiers each being trained with a stringent data set containing proteins with strictly less than 25% sequence identity to one another in a same location group, the new predictor can cover eight subcellular locations; that is, cytoplasm, extracellular space, fimbrium, flagellum, inner membrane, nucleoid, outer membrane, and periplasm. In comparison with PSORT-B, the new predictor not only covers more subcellular locations, but also yields remarkably higher success rates. Gneg-PLoc is available as a Web server at http://202.120.37.186/bioinf/Gneg. To support the demand of people working in the relevant areas, a downloadable file is provided at the same Web site to list the results identified by Gneg-PLoc for 49 907 Gram-negative protein entries in the Swiss-Prot database that have no subcellular location annotations or are annotated with uncertain terms. The large-scale results will be updated twice a year to cover the new entries of Gram-negative bacterial proteins and reflect the new development of Gneg-PLoc.								77	2	64	0	79	1535-3893		WOS:000242427800020

Focusing on anti-spam filtering for mailing lists, a thorough investigation of the effectiveness of a memory-based anti-spam filter is performed using a publicly available corpus. The investigation includes different attribute and distance-weighting schemes, and studies on the effect of the neighborhood size, the size of the attribute set, and the size of the training corpus. Three different cost scenarios are identified, and suitable cost-sensitive evaluation functions are employed. We conclude that memory-based anti-spam filtering for mailing lists is practically feasible, especially when combined with additional safety nets. Compared to a previously tested Naive Bayes filter, the memory-based filter performs on average better, particularly when the misclassification cost for non-spam messages is high.								77	5	0	0	82	1386-4564		WOS:000181823200003

J	Xiao, Xuan; Wang, Pu; Chou, Kuo-Chen				Chou, Kuo-Chen/A-8340-2009				GPCR-2L: predicting G protein-coupled receptors and their types by hybridizing two different modes of pseudo amino acid compositions								MOLECULAR BIOSYSTEMS			7	3			911	919		10.1039/c0mb00170h			2011	2011	G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are among the most frequent targets of therapeutic drugs. With the avalanche of newly generated protein sequences in the post genomic age, to expedite the process of drug discovery, it is highly desirable to develop an automated method to rapidly identify GPCRs and their types. A new predictor was developed by hybridizing two different modes of pseudo-amino acid composition (PseAAC): the functional domain PseAAC and the low-frequency Fourier spectrum PseAAC. The new predictor is called GPCR-2L, where "2L" means that it is a two-layer predictor: the 1st layer prediction engine is to identify a query protein as GPCR or not; if it is, the prediction will be automatically continued to further identify it as belonging to one of the following six types: (1) rhodopsin-like (Class A), (2) secretin-like (Class B), (3) metabotropic glutamate/pheromone (Class C), (4) fungal pheromone (Class D), (5) cAMP receptor (Class E), or (6) frizzled/smoothened family (Class F). The overall success rate of GPCR-2L in identifying proteins as GPCRs or non-GPCRs is over 97.2%, while identifying GPCRs among their six types is over 97.8%. Such high success rates were derived by the rigorous jackknife cross-validation on a stringent benchmark dataset, in which none of the included proteins had >= 40% pairwise sequence identity to any other protein in a same subset. As a user-friendly web-server, GPCR-2L is freely accessible to the public at http://icpr.jci.edu.cn/bioinfo/GPCR-2L, by which one can obtain the 2-level results in about 20 s for a query protein sequence of 500 amino acids. The longer the sequence is, the more time it may usually need. The high success rates reported here indicate that it is a quite effective approach to identify GPCRs and their types with the functional domain information and the low-frequency Fourier spectrum analysis. It is anticipated that GPCR-2L may become a useful tool for both basic research and drug development in the areas related to GPCRs.								73	0	65	0	73	1742-206X		WOS:000287367100036

For example, a speech recognizer may need to determine which of the two word combinations "eat a peach" and "eat a peach" is more likely. Statistical NLP methods determine the likelihood of a word combination from its Frequency in a training corpus. However. the nature of language is such that many word combinations are infrequent and do not occur in any given corpus. In this work we propose a method for estimating the probability of such previously unseen word combinations using available information on "most similar" words.We describe probabilistic word association models based on distributional word similarity, and apply them to two tasks, language modeling and pseudo-word disambiguation. In the language modeling task, a similarity-based model is used to improve probability estimates for unseen bigrams in a back-off language model. The similarity-based method yields a 20% perplexity improvement in the prediction of unseen bigrams and statistically significant reductions in speech-recognition error.We also compare four similarity-based estimation methods against back-off and maximum-likelihood estimation methods on a pseudo-word sense disambiguation task in which we controlled for both unigram and bigram frequency to avoid giving too much weight to easy-to-disambiguate high-frequency configurations. The similarity-based methods perform up to 40% better on this particular task.								73	9	1	0	81	0885-6125		WOS:000079753100003	
J	Ji, CY; Ma, S								Combinations of weak classifiers								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			8	1			32	42					JAN 1997	1997	To obtain classification systems with both good generalization performance and efficiency in space and time, we propose a learning method based on combinations of weak classifiers, where weak classifiers are linear classifiers (perceptrons) which can do a little better than making random guesses. A randomized algorithm is proposed to find the weak classifiers. They are then combined through a majority vote. As demonstrated through systematic experiments, the method developed is able to obtain combinations of weak classifiers with good generalization performance and a fast training time on a variety of test problems and real applications. Theoretical analysis on one of the test problems investigated in our experiments provides insights on when and why the proposed method works. In particular, when the strength of weak classifiers is properly chosen, combinations of weak classifiers can achieve a good generalization performance with polynomial space- and time-complexity.								71	5	4	0	76	1045-9227		WOS:A1997WA61200004

In this paper, we introduce neighborhood rough set model as a uniform framework to understand and implement neighborhood classifiers. This algorithm integrates attribute reduction technique with classification learning. We study the influence of the three norms on attribute reduction and classification, and compare neighborhood classifier with KNN, CART and SVM. The experimental results show that neighborhood-based feature selection algorithm is able to delete most of the redundant and irrelevant features. The classification accuracies based on neighborhood classifier is superior to K-NN, CART in original feature spaces and reduced feature subspaces, and a little weaker than SVM. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a standardized, uniform representation for this class of networks, and introduces a simple modification of the multilayer perceptron with interesting practical properties, especially well suited to cope with pattern classification tasks. The proposed model unifies the two main representation paradigms found in the class of mapping networks for classification, namely, the surface-based and the prototype-based schemes, while retaining the advantage of being trainable by backpropagation. The enhancement in the representation properties and the generalization performance are assessed through results about the worst-case requirement in terms of hidden units and about the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension and Cover capacity. The theoretical properties of the network also suggest that the proposed modification to the multilayer perceptron is in many senses optimal. A number of experimental verifications also confirm theoretical results about the model's increased performances, as compared with the multilayer perceptron and the Gaussian radial basis Functions network.								69	7	0	0	76	1045-9227		WOS:A1997WA61200009	
J	RIZZO, DM; DOUGHERTY, DE								CHARACTERIZATION OF AQUIFER PROPERTIES USING ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS - NEURAL KRIGING								WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			30	2			483	497		10.1029/93WR02477			FEB 1994	1994	A method for pattern completion based on the application of artificial neural networks and possessing many operational objectives of the ordinary kriging approach, neural kriging, is developed. A neural kriging (NK) network is described, implemented in a parallelizing algorithm, and applied to develop maps of discrete spatially distributed fields (e.g., log hydraulic conductivity). NK is, in the case df two discrete field values, similar to indicator kriging. It uses a feed-forward counterpropagation training approach because field observations are available and because fast yet reliable results are obtained. NK is data-driven and requires no estimate of a covariance function. The optimal design of the NK network is found to depend on the number of hidden units in a more complex way than expected. The quality of the estimate of each pixel of the NK maps can be presented as well, as in kriging, to help identify areas in which additional information will be most beneficial. A comparison with a reference field shows that the NK network produces unbiased errors relative to sample bias and reproduces the variogram of a quantized random field with reasonable accuracy. Ordinary kriging (OK) followed by quantization can also perform well; however, estimation errors in the variogram selected for use in OK (in this case the range coefficient in particular) must be carefully examined and treated. The NK method can provide multiple realizations of the estimated field, all of which respect observations; hence conditional simulation is demonstrably possible. The combination of simplicity, interpolation, reasonably accurate prediction statistics, ability to provide conditional simulations, and computational speed suggest that artificial neural networks can be useful tools in geohydrology when applied to specific well-defined problems for which they are well suited, such as aquifer characterization.								68	3	16	0	71	0043-1397		WOS:A1994MV70700027

It is hoped that the evaluation results reported will be useful for designers of practical systems for these two important commercial applications. For the OCR problem, the Karhunen Loeve (K-L) transform of the images is used to generate the input feature set. Similarly for the fingerprint problem, the K-L transform of the ridge directions is used to generate the input feature set. The statistical classifiers used are Euclidean minimum distance, quadratic minimum distance, normal, and k-nearest neighbor. The neural network classifiers used are multi-layer perceptron, radial basis function, and probabilistic neural network- The OCR data consist of 7480 digit images for training and 23,140 digit images for testing. The fingerprint data used consist of 2000 training and 2000 testing images. In addition to evaluation for accuracy. the multi-layer perceptron and radial basis function networks are evaluated for size and generalization capability. For the evaluated datasets the best accuracy obtained for either problem is provided by a probabilistic neural network. Minimum classification error is 2.5% for OCR and 7.2%) for fingerprints.								64	1	1	0	65	0031-3203		WOS:A1994NK59200003	
J	Shen, H.-B.; Chou, K.-C.				Chou, Kuo-Chen/A-8340-2009				Using ensemble classifier to identify membrane protein types								AMINO ACIDS			32	4			483	488		10.1007/s00726-006-0439-2			MAY 2007	2007	Predicting membrane protein type is both an important and challenging topic in current molecular and cellular biology. This is because knowledge of membrane protein type often provides useful clues for determining, or sheds light upon, the function of an uncharacterized membrane protein. With the explosion of newly-found protein sequences in the post-genomic era, it is in a great demand to develop a computational method for fast and reliably identifying the types of membrane proteins according to their primary sequences. In this paper, a novel classifier, the so-called "ensemble classifier", was introduced. It is formed by fusing a set of nearest neighbor (NN) classifiers, each of which is defined in a different pseudo amino acid composition space. The type for a query protein is determined by the outcome of voting among these constituent individual classifiers. It was demonstrated through the self-consistency test, jackknife test, and independent dataset test that the ensemble classifier outperformed other existing classifiers widely used in biological literatures. It is anticipated that the idea of ensemble classifier can also be used to improve the prediction quality in classifying other attributes of proteins according to their sequences.								63	3	48	0	66	0939-4451		WOS:000246636500004

Thus, a computational method for properly predicting the subcellular location of proteins would be significant in interpreting the original data produced by the large-scale genome sequencing projects. The present work tries to explore an effective method for extracting features from protein primary sequence and find a novel measurement of similarity among proteins for classifying a protein to its proper subcellular location. We considered four locations in eukaryotic cells and three locations in prokaryotic cells, which have been investigated by several groups in the past. A combined feature of primary sequence defined as a 430D (dimensional) vector was utilized to represent a protein, including 20 amino acid compositions, 400 dipeptide compositions and 10 physicochemical properties. To evaluate the prediction performance of this encoding scheme, a jackknife test based on nearest neighbor algorithm was employed. The prediction accuracies for cytoplasmic, extracellular, mitochondrial, and nuclear proteins in the former dataset were 86.3%, 89.2%, 73.5% and 89.4%, respectively, and the total prediction accuracy reached 86.3%. As for the prediction accuracies of cytoplasmic, extracellular, and periplasmic proteins in the latter dataset, the prediction accuracies were 97.4%, 860/0, and 79.7, respectively, and the total prediction accuracy of 92.5% was achieved. The results indicate that this method outperforms some existing approaches based on amino acid composition or amino acid composition and dipeptide composition.

The latter are composed of two or more chains (subunits) that are associated with each other through noncovalent interactions and, occasionally, disulfide bonds. Oligomers can be further classified into homo-oligomers (formed by identical subunits) and hetero-oligomers (formed by different subunits), and they form the structural basis of various biological functions such as cooperative effects, the allosteric mechanism and ion-channel gating. Therefore, it would be of less interest or of low priority for crystallographic scientists to crystallize a single protein chain and determine its three-dimensional structure if it is already known as part of an oligomer. However, it is both time-consuming and laborious to acquire such information on the quaternary structure attribute purely by experiment. In particular, with the avalanche of protein sequences generated in the post-genomic age, it is highly desirable to develop an automated method by which crystallographic scientists can rapidly and effectively identify which quaternary attribute a particular protein chain has according to its sequence information. In view of this, a computational method has been developed by hybridizing the approaches of functional domain composition and pseudo amino acid composition. For the convenience of crystallographic scientists, a user-friendly web server, PQSA-Pred, has been established at http://218.65.61.89:8080/bioinfo/pqsa-pred, by which the desired information can be easily obtained.								60	0	58	0	60	0021-8898		WOS:000264292800003	
J	Gao, Qing-Bin; Wang, Zheng-Zhi				Gao, Qing-Bin/G-9825-2011				Classification of G-protein coupled receptors at four levels								PROTEIN ENGINEERING DESIGN & SELECTION			19	11			511	516		10.1093/protein/gzl038			NOV 2006	2006	G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are transmembrane proteins which via G-proteins initiate some of the important signaling pathways in a cell and are involved in various physiological processes. Thus, computational prediction and classification of GPCRs can supply significant information for the development of novel drugs in pharmaceutical industry. In this paper, a nearest neighbor method has been introduced to discriminate GPCRs from non-GPCRs and subsequently classify GPCRs at four levels on the basis of amino acid composition and dipeptide composition of proteins. Its performance is evaluated on a non-redundant dataset consisted of 1406 GPCRs for six families and 1406 globular proteins using the jackknife test. The present method based on amino acid composition achieved an overall accuracy of 96.4% and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.930 for correctly picking out the GPCRs from globular proteins. The overall accuracy and MCC were further enhanced to 99.8% and 0.996 by dipeptide composition-based method. On the other hand, the present method has successfully classified 1406 GPCRs into six families with an overall accuracy of 89.6 and 98.8% using amino acid composition and dipeptide composition, respectively. For the subfamily prediction of 1181 GPCRs of rhodopsin-like family, the present method achieved an overall accuracy of 76.7 and 94.5% based on the amino acid composition and dipeptide composition, respectively. Finally, GPCRs belonging to the amine subfamily and olfactory subfamily of rhodopsin-like family were further analyzed at the type level. The overall accuracy of dipeptide composition-based method for the classification of amine type and olfactory type of GPCRs reached 94.5 and 86.9%, respectively, while the overall accuracy of amino acid composition-based method was very low for both subfamilies. In comparison with existing methods in the literature, the present method also displayed great competitiveness. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on identifying and classifying GPCRs correctly. GPCRsIdentifier, a corresponding stand-alone executable program for GPCR identification and classification was also developed, which can be acquired freely on request from the authors for academic purposes.								60	0	51	0	60	1741-0126		WOS:000241426000005

We also address this problem when distances are measured by the L-1 norm and in the Hamming cube. Significantly improving and extending recent results of Kleinberg, we construct data structures whose size is polynomial in the size of the database and search algorithms that run in time nearly linear or nearly quadratic in the dimension. (Depending on the case, the extra factors are polylogarithmic in the size of the database.).								60	0	0	0	60	0097-5397		WOS:000088166000006

However, intuitive uses of the distinction are subject to theoretical difficulties and their relation to empirical evidence is not clear. We propose a 'core' distinction between rule-and similarity-based processes, in terms of the way representations of stored information are 'matched' with the representation of a novel item. This explication captures the intuitively clear-cut cases of processes of each type, and resolves apparent problems with the rule/similarity distinction. Moreover, it provides a clear target for assessing the psychological and Al literatures. We show that many lines of psychological evidence are less conclusive than sometimes assumed, but suggest that converging lines of evidence may be persuasive. that the Al literature suggests that approaches which combine rules and similarity are an important new focus for empirical work.

Traditional credit scoring methodology has involved the use of techniques such as discriminant analysis, linear or logistic regression, linear programming and decision trees. In this paper we look at the application of the k-nearest-neighbour (k-NN) method, a standard technique in pattern recognition and nonparametric statistics, to the credit scoring problem. We propose an adjusted version of the Euclidean distance metric which attempts to incorporate knowledge of class separation contained in the data. Our k-NN methodology is applied to a real data set and we discuss the selection of optimal values of the parameters k and D included in the method. To assess the potential of the method we make comparisons with linear and logistic regression and decision trees and graphs. We end by discussing a practical implementation of the proposed k-NN classifier.								59	6	0	1	66	0039-0526		WOS:A1996UB94300009

Our primary interest in designing a classifier is in small training sample size situations. Conventional bootstrapping techniques sample the training samples with replacement. On the other hand, our technique generates bootstrap samples by locally combining original training samples. The nearest neighbor classifier is designed on the bootstrap samples and is tested on the test samples independent of training samples. The performance of the proposed classifier is demonstrated on three artificial data sets and one real data set. Experimental results show that the nearest neighbor classifier designed on the bootstrap samples outperforms the conventional k-NN classifiers as well as the edited 1-NN classifiers, particularly in high dimensions.								58	3	3	0	60	0162-8828		WOS:A1997WE52800009

Humans convey emotional information both intentionally and unintentionally via speech patterns. These vocal patterns are perceived and understood by listeners during conversation. This research aims to improve the automatic perception of vocal emotion in two ways. First, we compare two emotional speech data sources: natural, spontaneous emotional speech and acted or portrayed emotional speech. This comparison demonstrates the advantages and disadvantages of both acquisition methods and how these methods affect the end application of vocal emotion recognition. Second, we look at two classification methods which have not been applied in this field: stacked generalisation and unweighted vote. We show how these techniques can yield an improvement over traditional classification methods. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.								57	5	3	0	63	0167-6393		WOS:000245155200002

Nearest neighbor classification (NN) instead, has a well established position among other classification techniques due to its practical and theoretical properties. In this paper, we observe that when we seek a linear representation adapted to improve NN performance, what we obtain not surprisingly is quite close to NDA. Since a hierarchy is provided on the extracted features it also serves as a dimensionality reduction technique that preserves NN performance.

We investigate this phenomenon empirically on a selection of benchmark natural language processing tasks: grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, part-of-speech tagging, prepositional-phrase attachment, and base noun phrase chunking. In a first series of experiments we combine memory-based learning with training set editing techniques, in which instances are edited based on their typicality and class prediction strength. Results show that editing exceptional instances (with low typicality or low class prediction strength) tends to harm generalization accuracy. In a second series of experiments we compare memory-based learning and decision-tree learning methods on the same selection of tasks, and find that decision-tree learning often performs worse than memory-based learning. Moreover, the decrease in performance can be linked to the degree of abstraction from exceptions (i.e., pruning or eagerness).

E-mail and news articles are two natural examples of such streams, each characterized by topics that appear, grow in intensity for a period of time, and then fade away. The published literature in a particular research field can be seen to exhibit similar phenomena over a much longer time scale. Underlying much of the text mining work in this area is the following intuitive premise-that the appearance of a topic in a document stream is signaled by a "burst of activity," with certain features rising sharply in frequency as the topic emerges.The goal of the present work is to develop a formal approach for modeling such " bursts," in such a way that they can be robustly and efficiently identified, and can provide an organizational framework for analyzing the underlying content. The approach is based on modeling the stream using an infinite-state automaton, in which bursts appear naturally as state transitions; it can be viewed as drawing an analogy with models from queueing theory for bursty network traffic. The resulting algorithms are highly efficient, and yield a nested representation of the set of bursts that imposes a hierarchical structure on the overall stream. Experiments with e-mail and research paper archives suggest that the resulting structures have a natural meaning in terms of the content that gave rise to them.				8th ACM/SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	JUL, 2002	ACM; SIGKDD	EDMONTON, CANADA	55	3	6	0	58	1384-5810		WOS:000184358900003

We describe a method of combining classification and compression into a single vector quantizer by incorporating a Bayes risk term into the distortion measure used in the quantizer design algorithm. Once trained, the quantizer can operate to minimize the Bayes risk weighted distortion measure if there is a model providing the required posterior probabilities, or it can operate in a suboptimal fashion by minimizing only squared error. Comparisons are made with other vector quantizer based classifiers, including the independent design of quantization and minimum Bayes risk classification and Kohonen's LVQ, A variety of examples demonstrate that the proposed method can provide classification ability close to or superior to LVQ while simultaneously providing superior compression performance.								55	0	2	0	55	0162-8828		WOS:A1995QW39400002

Developments in computer vision suggest that it may be possible to counter the influence of these factors, by learning to interpolate between stored views of the target object, taken under representative combinations of viewing conditions. Daily life situations, however, typically require categorization, rather than recognition, of objects. Due to the open-ended character of both natural and artificial categories, categorization cannot rely on interpolation between stored examples. Nonetheless, knowledge of several representative members, or prototypes, of each of the categories of interest can still provide the necessary computational substrate for the categorization of new instances. The resulting representational scheme based on similarities to prototypes appears to be computationally viable, and is readily mapped onto the mechanisms of biological vision revealed by recent psychophysical and physiological studies.								53	0	18	0	53	0962-8436		WOS:A1997XU80500009

The decision surface mapping method, which we call DSM, is a fast supervised learning algorithm, and is a member of the LVQ family of algorithms. A relatively small number of prototypes are selected from a training set of correctly classified samples. The training set is then used to adapt these prototypes to map the decision surface separating the classes. This algorithm is compared with NN pattern classification, learning vector quantization (LVQ1) [2], and a two-layer perception trained by error backpropagation [4]. When the class boundaries are sharply defined (i.e., no classification error in the training set) the DSM algorithm outperforms these methods with respect to error rates, learning rates, and the number of prototypes required to describe class boundaries.								53	0	4	0	53	1045-9227		WOS:A1991FB85800017

They regulate diverse functions, such as homeostasis, reproduction, development and metabolism. Therefore, NRs are a very important target for drug development. Nuclear receptors form a superfamily of phylogenetically related proteins and have been subdivided into different subfamilies due to their domain diversity. In this study, a two-level predictor, called NR-2L, was developed that can be used to identify a query protein as a nuclear receptor or not based on its sequence information alone; if it is, the prediction will be automatically continued to further identify it among the following seven subfamilies: (1) thyroid hormone like (NR1), (2) HNF4-like (NR2), (3) estrogen like, (4) nerve growth factor IB-like (NR4), (5) fushi tarazu-F1 like (NR5), (6) germ cell nuclear factor like (NR6), and (7) knirps like (NR0). The identification was made by the Fuzzy K nearest neighbor (FK-NN) classifier based on the pseudo amino acid composition formed by incorporating various physicochemical and statistical features derived from the protein sequences, such as amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, complexity factor, and low-frequency Fourier spectrum components. As a demonstration, it was shown through some benchmark datasets derived from the NucleaRDB and UniProt with low redundancy that the overall success rates achieved by the jackknife test were about 93% and 89% in the first and second level, respectively. The high success rates indicate that the novel two-level predictor can be a useful vehicle for identifying NRs and their subfamilies. As a user-friendly web server, NR-2L is freely accessible at either http://icpr.jci.edu.cn/bioinfo/NR2Lor http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/NR2L. Each job submitted to NR-2L can contain up to 500 query protein sequences and be finished in less than 2 minutes. The less the number of query proteins is, the shorter the time will usually be. All the program codes for NR-2L are available for non-commercial purpose upon request.								52	2	47	0	53	1932-6203		WOS:000293953700027	
J	Chater, N; Oaksford, M; Nakisa, R; Redington, M								Fast, frugal, and rational: How rational norms explain behavior								ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR AND HUMAN DECISION PROCESSES			90	1			63	86		10.1016/S0749-5978(02)00508-3			JAN 2003	2003	Much research on judgment and decision making has focussed on the adequacy of classical rationality as a description of human reasoning. But more recently it has been argued that classical rationality should also be rejected even as normative standards for human reasoning. For example, Gigerenzer and Goldstein (1996) and Gigerenzer and Todd (1999a) argue that reasoning involves "fast and frugal" algorithms which are not justified by rational norms, but which succeed in the environment. They provide three lines of argument for this view, based on: (A) the importance of the environment; (B) the existence of cognitive limitations; and (C) the fact that an algorithm with no apparent rational basis, Take-the-Best, succeeds in an judgment task (judging which of two cities is the larger; based on lists of features of each city). We reconsider (A)-(C), arguing that standard patterns of explanation in psychology and the social and biological sciences, use rational norms to explain why simple cognitive algorithms can succeed. We also present new computer simulations that compare Take-the-Best with other cognitive models (which use connectionist, exemplar-based, and decision-tree algorithms). Although Take-the-Best still performs well, it does not perform noticeably better than the other models. We conclude that these results provide no strong reason to prefer Take-the-Best over alternative cognitive models. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Different GPCR families are responsible for different functions. With the avalanche of protein sequences generated in the post-genomic age, it is highly desired to develop an automated method to address the two problems: given the sequence of a query protein, can we identify whether it is a GPCR? If it is, what family class does it belong to? Here, a two-layer ensemble classifier called GPCR-GIA was proposed by introducing a novel scale called 'grey incident degree'. The overall success rate by GPCR-GIA in identifying GPCR and non-GPCR was about 95%, and that in identifying the GPCRs among their nine family classes was about 80%. These rates were obtained by the jackknife cross-validation tests on the stringent benchmark data sets where none of the proteins has >= 50% pairwise sequence identity to any other in a same class. Moreover, a user-friendly web-server was established at http://218.65.61.89:8080/bioinfo/GPCR-GIA. For user's convenience, a step-by-step guide on how to use the GPCR-GIA web server is provided. Generally speaking, one can get the desired two-level results in around 10 s for a query protein sequence of 300-400 amino acids; the longer the sequence is, the more time that is needed.								51	0	46	0	51	1741-0126		WOS:000271109800007

As a demonstration, a working dataset was generated with a cutoff of 60% sequence identity to avoid redundancy and bias in statistical prediction. The dataset thus constructed contains 39 989 protein sequences, of which 27 469 are non-enzymes and 12 520 enzymes that were further classified into 6 enzyme family classes according to their 6 main EC (Enzyme Con mission) numbers (2314 are oxidoreductases, 3653 transferases, 3246 hydrolases, 1307 lyases, 676 isomerases,and 1324 ligases). The overall success rate by the jackknife test for the identification between enzyme and non-enzyme was 94%, and that for the identification among the 6 enzyme family classes was 98%. It is anticipated that, with the rapid increase of protein sequences entering into databanks, the current method will become a useful automated tool in identifying the enzymatic attribute of a newly found protein sequence.

Vector quantization, the mapping of pixel intensity vectors into binary vectors indexing a limited number of possible reproductions, is a popular image compression algorithm. Compression has traditionally been done with little regard for image processing operations that may precede or follow the compression step. Recent work has used vector quantization both to simplify image processing tasks-such as enhancement, classification, halftoning, and edge detection-and to reduce the computational complexity by performing them simultaneously with the compression. After briefly reviewing the fundamental ideas of vector quantization, we present a survey of vector quantization algorithms that perform image processing.								51	0	1	0	51	0018-9219		WOS:A1993MB64700012

With the number of sequences entering into databanks rapidly increasing, the importance of developing a powerful high-throughput tool to determine protein subcellular location has become self-evident. In view of this, the Nearest Neighbour Algorithm was developed for predicting the protein subcellular location using the strategy of hybridizing the information derived from the recent development in gene ontology with that from the functional domain composition as well as the pseudo amino acid composition.Results: As a showcase, the same plant and non-plant protein datasets as investigated by the previous investigators were used for demonstration. The overall success rate of the jackknife test for the plant protein dataset was 86%, and that for the non-plant protein dataset 91.2%. These are the highest success rates achieved so far for the two datasets by following a rigorous cross-validation test procedure, suggesting that such a hybrid approach (particularly by incorporating the knowledge of gene ontology) may become a very useful high-throughput tool in the area of bioinformatics, proteomics, as well as molecular cell biology.								48	2	41	0	52	1367-4803		WOS:000221139700018

There are domains, however, where the tagging procedure requires significant computation resources or manual labor. In such cases, it may be beneficial for the learner to be active, intelligently selecting the examples for labeling with the goal of reducing the labeling cost. In this paper we present LSS-a lookahead algorithm for selective sampling of examples for nearest neighbor classifiers. The algorithm is looking for the example with the highest utility, taking its effect on the resulting classifier into account. Computing the expected utility of an example requires estimating the probability of its possible labels. We propose to use the random field model for this estimation. The LSS algorithm was evaluated empirically on seven real and artificial data sets, and its performance was compared to other selective sampling algorithms. The experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other methods in terms of average error rate and stability.								48	4	2	0	51	0885-6125		WOS:000188006900002

The aim of the study is to compare classification method accuracies by the use of a McNemar's statistical test. Three qualitative parameters of sugar beet are studied: disease resistance (DR), geographical origins and crop periods. Samples are analyzed by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and by wet chemical analysis (WCA). Firstly, the performances of eight well-known classification methods on NIRS data are compared: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) method, Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy (SIMCA), Discriminant Partial Least Squares (DPLS), Procrustes Discriminant Analysis (PDA), Classification And Regression Tree (CART), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) neural network are computed. Among the three data sets, SIMCA, DPLS and PDA have the highest classification accuracies. LDA and KNN are not significantly different. The non-linear neural methods give the less accurate results. The three most accurate methods are linear, non-parametric and based on modeling methods. Secondly, we want to emphasize the power of near-infrared reflectance data for sample discrimination. McNemar's tests compare classification developed with WCA or with NIRS data. For two of the three data sets, the classification results are significantly improved by the use of NIRS data.

This emerging field offers the potential to lay solid basis on our understanding of the entire living world. However, the taxonomic classification is an essential task in the analysis of metagenomics data sets that it is still far from being solved. We present a novel strategy to predict the taxonomic origin of environmental genomic fragments. The proposed classifier combines the idea of the k-nearest neighbor with strategies from kernel-based learning.Results: Our novel strategy was extensively evaluated using the leave-one-out cross validation strategy on fragments of variable length (800 bp - 50 Kbp) from 373 completely sequenced genomes. TACOA is able to classify genomic fragments of length 800 bp and 1 Kbp with high accuracy until rank class. For longer fragments >= 3 Kbp accurate predictions are made at even deeper taxonomic ranks (order and genus). Remarkably, TACOA also produces reliable results when the taxonomic origin of a fragment is not represented in the reference set, thus classifying such fragments to its known broader taxonomic class or simply as "unknown". We compared the classification accuracy of TACOA with the latest intrinsic classifier PhyloPythia using 63 recently published complete genomes. For fragments of length 800 bp and 1 Kbp the overall accuracy of TACOA is higher than that obtained by PhyloPythia at all taxonomic ranks. For all fragment lengths, both methods achieved comparable high specificity results up to rank class and low false negative rates are also obtained.Conclusion: An accurate multi-class taxonomic classifier was developed for environmental genomic fragments. TACOA can predict with high reliability the taxonomic origin of genomic fragments as short as 800 bp. The proposed method is transparent, fast, accurate and the reference set can be easily updated as newly sequenced genomes become available. Moreover, the method demonstrated to be competitive when compared to the most current classifier PhyloPythia and has the advantage that it can be locally installed and the reference set can be kept up-to-date.								47	1	46	0	48	1471-2105		WOS:000264007900001

We then propose modified K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms to overcome the perceived problem. The approach is similar in spirit to Tangent Distance, but with invariances inferred from the local neighborhood rather than prior knowledge. Experimental results on real world classification tasks suggest that the modified KNN algorithms often give a dramatic improvement over standard KNN and perform as well or better than SVMs.				15th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS)	DEC 03-08, 2001		VANCOUVER, CANADA	47	1	3	0	48	1049-5258	0-262-04208-8	WOS:000180520100123

General criteria for improving the performance of such systems are based on estimating the reliability associated with the decision of each expert, so as to suitably weight its response in the combination phase. According to the methods proposed to-date, when the expert assigns a sample to a class, the reliability of such a decision is estimated on the basis of the recognition rate obtained by the expert on the chosen class during the training phase. As a consequence, the same reliability value is associated with every decision attributing a sample to a same class, even though it seems reasonable ro take into account: its dependence on the quality of the specific sample. We propose a method for estimating the reliability of each single recognition act of an expert on the basis of information directly derived from its output. In this way, the reliability value of a decision is more properly estimated, thus allowing a more precise weighting during the combination phase. The definition of the reliability parameters for widely used classification paradigms is discussed, together with the combining rules employing them for weighting the expert opinions. The results obtained by combining four experts in order to recognise handwritten numerals from a standard character database are presented. Comparison with classical combining rules is also reported, and the advantages of the proposed approach outlined.								47	0	3	0	47	1433-7541		WOS:000083707500001

The training samples are nodes of a complete graph, whose arcs are weighted by the distances between the feature vectors of their nodes. Prototypes are identified in all classes and the minimization of a connectivity function by dynamic programming assigns to each training sample a minimum-cost path from its most strongly connected prototype. This competition among prototypes partitions the graph into an optimum-path forest rooted at them. The class of the samples in an optimum-path tree is assumed to be the same of its root. A test sample is classified similarly, by identifying which tree would contain it, if the sample were part of the training set. By choice of the graph model and connectivity function, one can devise other optimum-path forest classifiers. We present one of them, which is fast, simple, multiclass, parameter independent, does not make any assumption about the shapes of the classes, and can handle some degree of overlapping between classes. We also propose a general algorithm to learn from errors on an evaluation set without increasing the training set, and show the advantages of our method with respect to SVM, ANN-MLP, and k-NN classifiers in several experiments with datasets of various types.

This is because rules may help us understand more about the application in addition to performing an accurate classification. In this paper, we discover novel rules that describe the gene expression profiles of more than six subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. We also introduce a new classifier, named PCL, to make effective use of the rules. PCL is accurate and can handle multiple parallel classifications. We evaluate this method by classifying 327 heterogeneous ALL samples. Our test error rate is competitive to that of support vector machines, and it is 71% better than C4.5, 50% better than Naive Bayes, and 43% better than k-nearest neighbour. Experimental results on another independent data sets are also presented to show the strength of our method.								46	8	18	0	56	1367-4803		WOS:000180463900011

One powerful index for retrieval is the text appearing in them. It enables content-based browsing. We present our new methods for automatic segmentation of text in digital videos. The algorithms we propose make use of typical characteristics of text in videos in order to enable and enhance segmentation performance. The unique features of our approach are the tracking of characters and words over their complete duration of occurrence in a video and the integration of the multiple bitmaps of a character over time into a single bitmap. The output of the text segmentation step is then directly passed to a standard OCR software package in order to translate the segmented text into ASCII. Also, a straightforward indexing and retrieval scheme is introduced. It is used in the experiments to demonstrate that the proposed text segmentation algorithms together with existing text recognition algorithms are suitable for indexing and retrieval of relevant video sequences in and from a video database. Our experimental results are very encouraging and suggest that these algorithms can be used in video retrieval applications as well as to recognize higher level semantics in videos.								46	12	1	0	58	0942-4962		WOS:000085069600006	
J	Veenman, CJ; Reinders, MJT								The nearest subclass classifier: A compromise between the nearest mean and nearest neighbor classifier								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			27	9			1417	1429		10.1109/TPAMI.2005.187			SEP 2005	2005	We present the Nearest Subclass Classifier (NSC), which is a classification algorithm that unifies the flexibility of the nearest neighbor classifier with the robustness of the nearest mean classifier. The algorithm is based on the Maximum Variance Cluster algorithm and, as such, it belongs to the class of prototype- based classifiers. The variance constraint parameter of the cluster algorithm serves to regularize the classifier, that is, to prevent overfitting. With a low variance constraint value, the classifier turns into the nearest neighbor classifier and, with a high variance parameter, it becomes the nearest mean classifier with the respective properties. In other words, the number of prototypes ranges from the whole training set to only one per class. In the experiments, we compared the NSC with regard to its performance and data set compression ratio to several other prototype- based methods. On several data sets, the NSC performed similarly to the k-nearest neighbor classifier, which is a well-established classifier in many domains. Also concerning storage requirements and classification speed, the NSC has favorable properties, so it gives a good compromise between classification performance and efficiency.								45	1	0	0	46	0162-8828		WOS:000230463300005

Microarray data are characterized by a high dimension, high signal-to-noise ratio, and high correlations between genes, but with a relatively small sample size. Current methods for dimensional reduction can further be improved for the scenario of the presence of a single (or a few) high influential gene(s) in which its effect in the feature subset would prohibit inclusion of other important genes. We have formalized a robust gene selection approach based on a hybrid between genetic algorithm and support vector machine. The major goal of this hybridization was to exploit fully their respective merits (e.g., robustness to the size of solution space and capability of handling a very large dimension of feature genes) for identification of key feature genes (or molecular signatures) for a complex biological phenotype. We have applied the approach to the microarray data of diffuse large B cell lymphoma to demonstrate its behaviors and properties for mining the high-dimension data of genome-wide gene expression profiles. The resulting classifier(s) (the optimal gene subset(s)) has achieved the highest accuracy (99%) for prediction of independent microarray samples in comparisons with marginal filters and a hybrid between genetic algorithm and K nearest neighbors.

This paper attempts to review research in modern multiple hypothesis testing with particular attention to the false discovery proportion, loosely defined as the number of false rejections divided by the number of rejections. We review the main ideas, stepwise and augmentation procedures; and resampling based testing. We also discuss the problem of dependence among the test statistics. Simulations make a comparison between the procedures and with Bayesian methods. We illustrate the procedures in applications in DNA microarray data analysis.

Since then SVMs have been successfully applied to real-world data analysis problems, often providing improved results compared with other techniques. The SVMs operate within the framework of regularization theory by minimizing an empirical risk in a well-posed and consistent way. A clear advantage of the support vector approach is that sparse solutions to classification and regression problems are usually obtained: only a few samples are involved in the determination of the classification or regression functions. This fact facilitates the application of SVMs to problems that involve a large amount of data, such as text processing and bioinformatics tasks. This paper is intended as an introduction to SVMs and their applications, emphasizing their key features. In addition, some algorithmic extensions and illustrative real-world applications of SVMs are shown.								43	0	8	1	43	0883-4237		WOS:000243776200003

We present three closely related studies of machine-printed character recognition that rely on synthetic data generated pseudorandomly in accordance with an explicit stochastic model of document image degradations. The unusually large scale of experiments-involving several million samples-that this methodology makes possible has allowed us to compute sharp estimates of the intrinsic difficulty (Bayes risk) of concrete image recognition problems, as well as the asymptotic accuracy and domain of competency of classifiers.								41	0	0	0	41	0162-8828		WOS:A1997YB67800003	
J	Wang, H				jia, lp/H-5750-2011				Nearest neighbors by neighborhood counting								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			28	6			942	953					JUN 2006	2006	Finding nearest neighbors is a general idea that underlies many artificial intelligence tasks, including machine learning, data mining, natural language understanding, and information retrieval. This idea is explicitly used in the k- nearest neighbors algorithm ( kNN), a popular classification method. In this paper, this idea is adopted in the development of a general methodology, neighborhood counting, for devising similarity functions. We turn our focus from neighbors to neighborhoods, a region in the data space covering the data point in question. To measure the similarity between two data points, we consider all neighborhoods that cover both data points. We propose to use the number of such neighborhoods as a measure of similarity. Neighborhood can be defined for different types of data in different ways. Here, we consider one definition of neighborhood for multivariate data and derive a formula for such similarity, called neighborhood counting measure or NCM. NCM was tested experimentally in the framework of kNN. Experiments show that NCM is generally comparable to VDM and its variants, the state- of- the- art distance functions for multivariate data, and, at the same time, is consistently better for relatively large k values. Additionally, NCM consistently outperforms HEOM ( a mixture of Euclidean and Hamming distances), the " standard" and most widely used distance function for multivariate data. NCM has a computational complexity in the same order as the standard Euclidean distance function and NCM is task independent and works for numerical and categorical data in a conceptually uniform way. The neighborhood counting methodology is proven sound for multivariate data experimentally. We hope it will work for other types of data.								40	5	1	0	45	0162-8828		WOS:000236734400008

This opens the window to improve upon, in a cost-effective manner, biological performance of any surface used in the human body. Unfortunately, the interplay between surface topographies and cell behavior is complex and still incompletely understood. Rational approaches to search for bioactive surfaces will therefore omit previously unperceived interactions. Hence, in the present study, we use mathematical algorithms to design nonbiased, random surface features and produce chips of poly(lactic acid) with 2,176 different topographies. With human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) grown on the chips and using high-content imaging, we reveal unique, formerly unknown, surface topographies that are able to induce MSC proliferation or osteogenic differentiation. Moreover, we correlate parameters of the mathematical algorithms to cellular responses, which yield novel design criteria for these particular parameters. In conclusion, we demonstrate that randomized libraries of surface topographies can be broadly applied to unravel the interplay between cells and surface topography and to find improved material surfaces.								39	0	21	0	39	0027-8424		WOS:000295536000023

Of these proteins, some bear the multi-locational feature, i.e., occur in more than one location. However, so far all the existing methods in predicting protein subcellular location were developed to deal with only the mono-locational case where a query protein is assumed to belong to one, and only one, subcellular location. To stimulate the development of subcellular location prediction, an augmentation procedure is formulated that will enable the existing methods to tackle the multi-locational problem as well. It has been observed thru a jackknife cross-validation test that the success rate obtained by the augmented GO-FnD-PseAA algorithm [BBRC 320 (2004) 1236] is overwhelmingly higher than those by the other augmented methods. It is anticipated that the augmented GO-FunD-PseAA predictor will become a very useful tool in predicting protein subcellular localization for both basic research and practical application.

Rather than using distance, we make use of the frequency of an instance's subsets of features and the frequency-change rate of the subsets among training classes to perform both knowledge discovery and classification. We name the system DeEPs. Whenever an instance is considered, DeEPs can efficiently discover those patterns contained in the instance which sharply differentiate the training classes from one to another. DeEPs can also predict a class label for the instance by compactly summarizing the frequencies of the discovered patterns based on a view to collectively maximize the discriminating power of the patterns. Many experimental results are used to evaluate the system, showing that the patterns are comprehensible and that DeEPs is accurate and scalable.								39	3	0	0	42	0885-6125		WOS:000188006900001

Since experimental determination of the network of substrate-enzyme-product triad (whether the substrate can be transformed into the product with a given enzyme) is both time-consuming and expensive, it would be very useful to develop a computational approach for predicting the network of substrate-enzyme-product triads.Results: A mathematical model for predicting the network of substrate-enzyme-product triads was developed. Meanwhile, a benchmark dataset was constructed that contains 744,192 substrate-enzyme-product triads, of which 14,592 are networking triads, and 729,600 are non-networking triads; i.e., the number of the negative triads was about 50 times the number of the positive triads. The molecular graph was introduced to calculate the similarity between the substrate compounds and between the product compounds, while the functional domain composition was introduced to calculate the similarity between enzyme molecules. The nearest neighbour algorithm was utilized as a prediction engine, in which a novel metric was introduced to measure the "nearness" between triads. To train and test the prediction engine, one tenth of the positive triads and one tenth of the negative triads were randomly picked from the benchmark dataset as the testing samples, while the remaining were used to train the prediction model. It was observed that the overall success rate in predicting the network for the testing samples was 98.71%, with 95.41% success rate for the 1,460 testing networking triads and 98.77% for the 72,960 testing non-networking triads.Conclusions: It is quite promising and encouraged to use the molecular graph to calculate the similarity between compounds and use the functional domain composition to calculate the similarity between enzymes for studying the substrate-enzyme-product network system.

J	Manns, Joseph R.; Eichenbaum, Howard								A cognitive map for object memory in the hippocampus								LEARNING & MEMORY			16	10			616	624		10.1101/lm.1484509			OCT 2009	2009	The hippocampus has been proposed to support a cognitive map, a mental representation of the spatial layout of an environment as well as the nonspatial items encountered in that environment. In the present study, we recorded simultaneously from 43 to 61 hippocampal pyramidal cells as rats performed an object recognition memory task in which novel and repeated objects were encountered in different locations on a circular track. Multivariate analyses of the neural data indicated that information about object identity was represented secondarily to the primary information dimension of object location. In addition, the neural data related to performance on the recognition memory task. The results suggested that objects were represented as points of interest on the hippocampal cognitive map and that this map was useful in remembering encounters with particular objects in specific locations.								38	3	32	0	41	1072-0502		WOS:000270368500007

This paper presents a technique for dimensionality reduction to deal with hyperspectral images. The proposed method is based on a hierarchical clustering structure to group bands to minimize the intracluster variance and maximize the intercluster variance. This aim is pursued using information measures, such as distances based on mutual information or Kullback-Leibler divergence, in order to reduce data redundancy and nonuseful information among image bands. Experimental results include a comparison among some relevant and recent methods for hyperspectral band selection using no labeled information, showing their performance with regard to pixel image classification tasks. The technique that is presented has a stable behavior for different image data sets and a noticeable accuracy, mainly when selecting small sets of bands.								38	4	0	0	40	0196-2892		WOS:000251339500012	
J	Tahir, Muhammad Atif; Bouridane, Ahmed; Kurugollu, Fatih								Simultaneous feature selection and feature weighting using Hybrid Tabu Search/K-nearest neighbor classifier								PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			28	4			438	446		10.1016/j.patrec.2006.08.016			MAR 1 2007	2007	Feature selection and feature weighting are useful techniques for improving the classification accuracy of K-nearest-neighbor (K-NN) rule. The term feature selection refers to algorithms that select the best subset of the input feature set. In feature weighting, each feature is multiplied by a weight value proportional to the ability of the feature to distinguish pattern classes. In this paper, a novel hybrid approach is proposed for simultaneous feature selection and feature weighting of K-NN rule based on Tabu Search (TS) heuristic. The proposed TS heuristic in combination with K-NN classifier is compared with several classifiers on various available data sets. The results have indicated a significant improvement in the performance in classification accuracy. The proposed TS heuristic is also compared with various feature selection algorithms. Experiments performed revealed that the proposed hybrid TS heuristic is superior to both simple TS and sequential search algorithms. We also present results for the classification of prostate cancer using multispectral images, an important problem in biomedicine. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We establish universal weak consistency of a nearest neighbor-type classifier based on n independent copies (X-i, Y-i) of the pair (X, Y), extending the classical result of Stone to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Under a mild condition on the distribution of X, we also prove strong consistency. We reduce the infinite dimension of X by considering only the first d coefficients of a Fourier series expansion of each X-i, and then we perform k-nearest neighbor classification in R-d. Both the dimension and the number of neighbors are automatically selected from the data using a simple data-splitting device. An application of this technique to a signal discrimination problem involving speech recordings is presented.								38	1	4	0	39	0018-9448		WOS:000229451600017

We propose a cluster-based tree algorithm to accelerate k-NN classification without any presuppositions about the metric form and properties of a dissimilarity measure. A mechanism of early decision making and minimal side-operations for choosing searching paths largely contribute to the efficiency of the algorithm. The algorithm is evaluated through extensive experiments over standard NIST and MNIST databases.								38	6	1	0	44	0162-8828		WOS:000220102800009

Thus, a growing interest has developed in the last decade in the automated analysis of digitized images obtained by epiluminescence microscopy techniques to assist clinicians in differentiating early melanoma from benign skin lesions.Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate diagnostic accuracy provided by different statistical classifiers on a large set of pigmented skin lesions grabbed by four digital analyzers located in two different dermatological units.Experimental Design: Images of 391melanomas and 449 melanocytic nevi were included in the study. A linear classifier was built by using the method of receiver operating characteristic curves to identify a threshold value for a fixed sensitivity of 95%. A K-nearest-neighbor classifier, a non-parametric method of pattern recognition, was constructed using all available image features and trained for a sensitivity of 98% on a large exemplar set of lesions.Results: On independent test sets of lesions, the linear classifier and the K-nearest-neighbor classifier produced a mean sensitivity of 95% and 98% and a mean specificity of 78% and of 79%, respectively.Conclusions: In conclusion, our study suggests that computer-aided differentiation of melanoma from benign pigmented lesions obtained with DB-Mips is feasible and, above all, reliable. In fact, the same instrumentations used in different units provided similar diagnostic accuracy. Whether this would improve early diagnosis of melanoma and/or reducing unnecessary surgery needs to be demonstrated by a randomized clinical trial.								38	0	11	0	38	1078-0432		WOS:000220337600003

This paper proposes methods for overcoming each of these weaknesses and combines the methods into a comprehensive learning system called the Integrated Decremental Instance-Based Learning Algorithm (IDIBL) that seeks to reduce storage, improve execution speed, and increase generalization accuracy, when compared to the basic nearest neighbor algorithm and other learning models. IDIBL tunes its own parameters using a new measure of fitness that combines confidence and cross-validation accuracy in order to avoid discretization problems with more traditional leave-one-out cross-validation. Tn our experiments IDIBL achieves higher generalization accuracy than other less comprehensive instance-based learning algorithms, while requiring less than one-fourth the storage of the nearest neighbor algorithm and improving execution speed by a corresponding factor. In experiments on twenty-one data sets, IDIBL also achieves higher generalization accuracy than that reported for sixteen major machine learning and neural network models.								38	1	1	0	39	0824-7935		WOS:000085703300001

Digital libraries, news sources and inner data of companies surge more and more. Automatic text categorization becomes more and more important for dealing with massive data. However the major problem of text categorization is the high dimensionality of the feature space. At present there are many methods to deal with text feature selection. To improve the performance of text categorization, we present another method of dealing with text feature selection. Our study is based on Gini index theory and we design a novel Gini index algorithm to reduce the high dimensionality of the feature space. A new measure function of Gini index is constructed and made to fit text categorization. The results of experiments show that our improvements of Gini index behave better than other methods of feature selection. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

By using monolithic scintillator crystals (e.g., 20 mm x 10 mm x 10 mm LSO), loss of efficiency due to inter-crystal reflective material is minimized. Readout of such crystals can be performed by means of one or more avalanche photo-diode (APD) arrays optically coupled to the crystal. The entry point of a gamma photon on the crystal surface can be estimated from the measured distribution of the scintillation light over the APD array(s). By estimating the entry point, correction for the depth-of-interaction (DOI) is automatically provided. We are studying the feasibility of such detector modules. To this end, a 64-channel test setup has been developed. Experiments to determine the effect on the spatial resolution of crystal surface finish and detector geometry have been carried out. The first results of these experiments are presented and compared to simulation results. The crystal surface finish has only a small influence on the spatial resolution. The spatial resolution of 20 mm x 10 nun x 10 mm detectors is significantly better when read out on the front side than when read out on the back side. With a 20 mm x 10 mm x 20 mm crystal coupled to two APD arrays, a very small resolution degradation of only similar to 0.2 min is observed for an incidence angle of 30 degrees compared to normal incidence.								37	0	9	0	37	0018-9499		WOS:000238582000002	
J	James, GM								Variance and bias for general loss functions								MACHINE LEARNING			51	2			115	135		10.1023/A:1022899518027			MAY 2003	2003	When using squared error loss, bias and variance and their decomposition of prediction error are well understood and widely used concepts. However, there is no universally accepted definition for other loss functions. Numerous attempts have been made to extend these concepts beyond squared error loss. Most approaches have focused solely on 0-1 loss functions and have produced significantly different definitions. These differences stem from disagreement as to the essential characteristics that variance and bias should display. This paper suggests an explicit list of rules that we feel any "reasonable" set of definitions should satisfy. Using this framework, bias and variance definitions are produced which generalize to any symmetric loss function. We illustrate these statistics on several loss functions with particular emphasis on 0-1 loss. We conclude with a discussion of the various definitions that have been proposed in the past as well as a method for estimating these quantities on real data sets.								37	0	0	0	37	0885-6125		WOS:000181638700001

Intrinsic depth-of-interaction (DOI) correction is achieved by deriving the entry points of annihilation photons on the front surface of the crystal from the light sensor signals. Here we characterize the next generation of these detectors, consisting of a 20 mm thick rectangular or trapezoidal LYSO:Ce crystal read out on the front and the back (double-sided readout, DSR) by Hamamatsu S8550SPL avalanche photodiode (APD) arrays optimized for DSR. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the detector point-spread function (PSF) obtained with a rectangular crystal at normal incidence equals similar to 1.05 mm at the detector centre, after correction for the similar to 0.9 mm diameter test beam of annihilation photons. Resolution losses of several tenths of a mm occur near the crystal edges. Furthermore, trapezoidal crystals perform almost equally well as rectangular ones, while improving system sensitivity. Due to the highly accurate DOI correction of all detectors, the spatial resolution remains essentially constant for angles of incidence of up to at least 30 degrees. Energy resolutions of similar to 11% FWHM are measured, with a fraction of events of up to 75% in the full-energy peak. The coincidence timing resolution is estimated to be 2.8 ns FWHM. The good spatial, energy and timing resolutions, together with the excellent DOI correction and high detection efficiency of our detectors, are expected to facilitate high and uniform PET system resolution.								36	0	14	0	36	0031-9155		WOS:000264292500003	
J	Linial, M; Linial, N; Tishby, N; Yona, G								Global self-organization of all known protein sequences reveals inherent biological signatures								JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			268	2			539	556		10.1006/jmbi.1997.0948			MAY 2 1997	1997	A global classification of all currently known protein sequences is performed. Every protein sequence is partitioned into segments of 50 amino acid residues and a dynamic programming distance is calculated between each pair of segments. This space of segments is initially embedded into Euclidean space. The algorithm that we apply embeds every finite metric space into Euclidean space so that (1) the dimension of the host space is small, (2) the metric distortion is small. A novel self-organized, cross-validated clustering algorithm is then applied to the embedded space with Euclidean distances. We monitor the validity of our clustering by randomly splitting the data into two parts and performing an hierarchical clustering algorithm independently on each part. At every level of the hierarchy we cross-validate the clusters in one part with the clusters in the other. The resulting hierarchical tree of clusters offers a new representation of protein sequences and families, which compares favorably with the most updated classifications based on functional and structural data about proteins. Same of the known families clustered into well distinct clusters. Motifs and domains such as the zinc finger, EF hand, homeobox, EGF-like and others are automatically correctly identified, and relations between protein families are revealed by examining the splits along the tree. This clustering leads to a novel representation of protein families, from which functional biological kinship of protein families can be deduced, as demonstrated for the transporter family. Finally, we introduce a new concise representation for complete proteins that is very useful in presenting multiple alignments, and in searching for close relatives in the database. The self-organization method presented is very general and applies to any data with a consistent and computable measure of similarity between data items.

LIBS, which is presently undergoing rapid research and development as a technology for geochemical analysis, has attractive potential as a field tool for rapid man-portable and/or stand-off chemical analysis. In LIBS, a pulsed laser beam is focused such that energy absorption produces a high-temperature microplasma at the sample surface resulting in the dissociation and ionization of small amounts of material, with both continuum and atomic/ionic emission generated by the plasma during cooling. A broadband spectrometer-detector is used to spectrally and temporally resolve the light from the plasma and record the intensity of elemental emission lines. Because the technique is simultaneously sensitive to all elements, a single laser shot can be used to track the spectral intensity of specific elements or record the broadband LIBS emission spectra, which are unique chemical 'fingerprints' of a material. In this study, a broad spectrum of geological materials was analyzed using a commercial bench-top LIBS system with broadband detection from similar to 200-965 nm, with multiple single-shot spectra acquired. The subsequent use of statistical signal processing approaches to rapidly identify and classify samples highlights the potential of LIBS for 'geochemical fingerprinting' in a variety of geochemical, mineralogical, and environmental applications that would benefit from either real-time or in-field chemical analysis.

Each view may capture a specific aspect of the data and hence satisfy the needs of a particular group of users. Collectively, multiple views provide a comprehensive description and understanding of the data. In this paper, we propose a multiview framework of intelligent data analysis based on modal-style data operators. The classes of the data operators include basic set assignment, sufficiency, dual sufficiency, necessity and possibility operators. They demonstrate various types of data relationships and characterize various features and granulated views of the data. It is shown that different structures of the data can also be constructed based on the different data operators. Crown Copyright (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Genotoxic endpoints for each compound were determined using the SOS Chromotest in both the presence and absence of an S9 rat liver homogenate. Compounds were considered genotoxic if assay results indicated a positive genotoxicity hit for either the S9 inactivated or S9 activated assay. Each compound in the data set was encoded through the calculation of numerical descriptors that describe various aspects of chemical structure (e.g. topological, geometric, electronic, polar surface area). Furthermore, five additional descriptors that focused on the secondary and aromatic nitrogen atoms in each molecule were calculated specifically for this study. Descriptor subsets were examined using a genetic algorithm search engine interfaced with a k-Nearest Neighbor fitness evaluator to find the most information-rich subsets, which ultimately served as the final predictive models. Models were chosen for their ability to minimize the total number of misclassifications, with special attention given to those models that possessed fewer occurrences of positive toxicity hits being misclassified as nontoxic (false negatives). In addition, a subsetting procedure was used to form an ensemble of models using different combinations of compounds in the training and prediction sets. This was done to ensure that consistent results could be obtained regardless of training set composition. The procedure also allowed for each compound to be externally validated three times by different training set data with the resultant predictions being used in a "majority rules" voting scheme to produce a consensus prediction for each member of the data set.

Several discriminant algorithms were utilized, including it nearest neighbors (kNN, with K = 1), linear discriminant analysis (LDA, or Fisher's linear discriminant), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), regularized discriminant analysis (RDA, a hybrid of LDA and QDA), partial least squares, and soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA). H2O and D2O were perfectly classified by most of the discriminants when a separate training and test set was used. As expected, discrimination performance decreased as the analyte concentration decreased, and performance decreased as the composition of the analyte mixtures became more similar. RDA was the overall best-performing discriminant, and LDA was the best-performing discriminant that did not require several cross-validations for optimization.								35	0	5	0	35	0003-2700		WOS:000166366000028

The MINOS experiment has taken data with an accelerator beam optimized for (nu) over bar (mu) production, accumulating an exposure of 1.71 x 10(20) protons on target. In the Far Detector, 97 charged current (nu) over bar (mu) events are observed. The no-oscillation hypothesis predicts 156 events and is excluded at 6.3 sigma. The best fit to oscillation yields vertical bar Delta(m) over bar (2)vertical bar = [3.36(-0.40)(+0.46)(stat) +/- 0.06(sys)] x 10(-3) eV(2), sin(2)(2 (theta) over bar) = 0.86(-0.12)(+0.11)(stat) +/- 0.01(syst). The MINOS nu(mu) and (nu) over bar (mu) measurements are consistent at the 2.0% confidence level, assuming identical underlying oscillation parameters.								34	0	0	0	34	0031-9007		WOS:000292392400007	
J	KULKARNI, SR; POSNER, SE								RATES OF CONVERGENCE OF NEAREST-NEIGHBOR ESTIMATION UNDER ARBITRARY SAMPLING								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY			41	4			1028	1039		10.1109/18.391248			JUL 1995	1995	Rates of convergence for nearest neighbor estimation are established in a general framework in terms of metric covering numbers of the underlying space. Our first result is to find explicit finite sample upper bounds for the classical independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random sampling problem in a separable metric space setting. The convergence rate is a function of the covering numbers of the support of the distribution. For example, for bounded subsets of R(r), the convergence rat is O(1/n(2/r)). Our main result is to extend the problem to allow samples drawn from a completely arbitrary random process in a separable metric space and to examine the performance in terms of the individual sample sequences. We show that for every sequence of samples the asymptotic time-average of nearest neighbor risks equals twice the time-average of the conditional Bayes risks of the sequence. Finite sample upper bounds under arbitrary sampling are again obtained in terms of the covering numbers of the underlying space. In particular, for bounded subsets of R(r) the convergence rate of the time-averaged risk is O(1/n(2/r)). We then establish a consistency result for k(n)-nearest neighbor estimation under arbitrary sampling and prove a convergence rate matching established rates for i.i.d. sampling. Finally, we show how our arbitrary sampling results lead to some classical i.i.d. sampling results and in fact extend them to stationary sampling. Our framework and results are quite general while the proof techniques are surprisingly elementary.				1994 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory	JUN 27-JUL 01, 1994	IEEE	TRONDHEIM, NORWAY	34	0	1	0	34	0018-9448		WOS:A1995RF59900012

There has been relatively little work, however, examining ROC for more than two classes. Here we discuss and present an extension to the standard two-class ROC for multi-class problems.We define the ROC surface for the Q-class problem in terms of a multi-objective optimisation problem in which the goal is to simultaneously minimise the Q(Q-1) misclassification rates, when the misclassification costs and parameters governing the classifier's behaviour are unknown. We present an evolutionary algorithm to locate the Pareto front-the optimal trade-off surface between misclassifications of different types. The use of the Pareto optimal surface to compare classifiers is discussed and we present a straightforward multi-class analogue of the Gini coefficient. The performance of the evolutionary algorithm is illustrated on a synthetic three class problem, for both k-nearest neighbour and multi-layer perceptron classifiers. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

An important problem that we can find is the scaling up problem that appears evaluating the Evolutionary Prototype Selection algorithms in large size data sets. In this paper, we offer a proposal to solve the drawbacks introduced by the evaluation of large size data sets using evolutionary prototype selection algorithms. In order to do this we have proposed a combination of stratified strategy and CHC as representative evolutionary algorithm model. This study includes a comparison between our proposal and other non-evolutionary prototype selection algorithms combined with the stratified strategy. The results show that stratified evolutionary prototype selection consistently outperforms the non-evolutionary ones, the main advantages being: better instance reduction rates, higher classification accuracy and reduction in resources consumption. &COPY; 2004 Elsevier B.V.

We extend the capabilities of the Choquet integral aggregation by allowing the ordering to be induced by some values other then those being aggregated. This allows us to consider an induced Choquet Choquet integral aggregation operator. We look at the properties of this operator. We then look at its applications Among the applications considered are aggregations guided by linguistic and other ordinal structures. We look at the use of induced aggregation in nearest neighbor methods. We also consider the Choquet aggregation of complex objects such as matrices and vectors.								33	1	0	0	34	0218-4885		WOS:000220807100007

However, despite decades of efforts, except for the filtering approach such as the VA-file [31], the current solutions to find exact kNNs are far from satisfactory for large d. The filtering approach represents vectors as compact approximations and by first scanning these smaller approximations, only a small fraction of the real vectors are visited. In this paper, we introduce the local polar coordinate file (LPC-file) using the filtering approach for nearest-neighbor searches in high-dimensional image databases. The basic idea is to partition the vector space into rectangular cells and then to approximate vectors by polar coordinates on the partitioned local cells. The LPC information significantly enhances the discriminatory power of the approximation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the LPC-file, we conducted extensive experiments and compared the performance with the VA-file and the sequential scan by using synthetic and real data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that the LPC-file outperforms both of the VA-file and the sequential scan in total elapsed time and in the number of disk accesses and that the LPC-file is robust in both "good" distributions (such as random) and "bad" distributions (such as skewed and clustered).								33	5	0	0	38	1520-9210		WOS:000173995500008

The presence of vascular invasion (VI) in pathology specimens is a well-known unfavorable prognostic factor for HCC recurrence. Though some VI-related genes have been reported, their association with recurrence-free survival is not known. We hypothesized that a gene expression profile for VI can predict the recurrence of HCC after liver resection.Methods: Eighteen patients receiving complete HCC resection were included as a "training group". Genome-wide gene expression profile was obtained for each tumor using a microarray technique. Datasets were subjected to clustering analysis supervised by the presence or absence of VI to obtain 14 discriminative genes. We then applied those genes to execute pattern recognition using the k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classification method, and the best model for this VI gene signature to predict recurrence-free survival in the training group was obtained. The resulting model was then tested in an independent "test group" of 35 patients.Results: A 14-gene profile was extracted which could accurately separate ten patients with VI and eight patients without VI in the "training group". In the "test group", significant difference in disease-free survival was found between patients predicted to have and not to have recurrence (P = .02823). In patients with stage_1 disease, this model can also predict outcomes (P = .000205).Conclusions: Using the 14-gene expression profile extracted from microarrays based on the presence of VI can effectively predict recurrence after HCC resection. This approach might facilitate "personalized medicine" for HCC patients after surgical resection.								32	1	18	0	34	1068-9265		WOS:000242803000017

Here, we describe and validate an automated method for calculation of flow cytometric data from several multicolor stainings of the same cell sample-i.e., the merging of data from different aliquots stained with partially overlapping combinations of Mab reagents (focusing on >= 1 cell populations)-into one data file as if it concerned a single "super" multicolor staining. Evaluation of the performance of the method described was done in a group of 60 B-CLPD studied at diagnosis with 18 different reagents in a panel containing six different 3- and 4-color stainings, which systematically contained CD19 for the identification of B-cells. Our results show a high degree of correlation and agreement between originally measured and calculated data about cell surface stainings, providing a basis for the use of this approach for the generation of flow cytometric data files containing information about a virtually infinite number of stainings for each individual cellular event measured in a sample, using a limited number of fluorochrome stainings.

It relies on the assumption of locally constant class conditional probabilities. This assumption becomes invalid in high dimensions with a finite number of examples due to the curse of dimensionality. Severe bias can be introduced under these conditions when using the nearest neighbor rule. The employment of a locally adaptive metric becomes crucial in order to keep class conditional probabilities close to uniform, thereby minimizing the bias of estimates. We propose a technique that computes a locally flexible metric by means of support vector machines (SVMs). The decision function constructed by SVMs is used to determine the most discriminant direction in a neighborhood around the query. Such a direction provides a local feature weighting scheme. We formally show that our method increases the margin in the weighted space where classification takes place. Moreover, our method has the important advantage of online computational efficiency over competing locally adaptive techniques for nearest neighbor classification. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method using both real and simulated data.								31	3	1	0	34	1045-9227		WOS:000230505600011

A new method has been developed to predict the enzymatic attribute of proteins by introducing the functional domain composition to formulate a given protein sequence. The advantage by doing so is that both the sequence-order-related features and the function-related features are naturally incorporated in the predictor. As a demonstration, the jackknife cross-validation test was performed on a dataset that consists of proteins with only less than 20% sequence identity to each other in order to get rid of any homologous bias. The overall success rate thus obtained was 85% in identifying the enzyme family classes (including the identification of nonenzyme protein sequences as well). The success rate is significantly higher than those obtained by the other methods on such a stringent dataset. This indicates that using the functional domain composition to represent protein samples for statistical prediction is indeed very promising, and will become a powerful tool in bioinformatics and proteomics.								31	1	29	0	33	1535-3893		WOS:000227287000013

The extraordinary progress in the computer field has made NN techniques, once considered impractical from a computational viewpoint, feasible for consideration in rime-constrained, real-world applications. This study accordingly addresses the issue of minimising the computational resource requirements of NN techniques, memory as well as time, through the: use of prototype reduction techniques such as Minimal Consistent Sec (;MCS) selection while preserving the performance quality through suitable editing techniques, such as Proximity Graphs (PG). The tools employed in this investigation are first described briefly. Results of experiments conducted on well known data sets in the literature with various combinations of editing and condensing tools are then presented and discussed to assess the benefits of synergy among these tools. These results demonstrate the: potential benefits of such synergy, and highlight the desirability of a more thorough exploration of combinations of other alternative editing and condensing tools that have been reported in the literature over the past few decades.								31	0	1	0	31	1433-7541		WOS:000086242100002

It can be used to identify Gram-negative bacterial proteins among the following eight locations: (1) cytoplasm, (2) extracellular, (3) fimbrium, (4) flagellum, (5) inner membrane, (6) nucleoid, (7) outer membrane, and (8) periplasm. It can also be used to deal with the case when a query protein may simultaneously exist in more than one location. Compared with the original predictor called Gneg-PLoc, the new predictor is much more powerful and flexible. For a newly constructed stringent benchmark dataset in which none of proteins included has >= 25% pairwise sequence identity to any other in a same subset (location), the overall jackknife success rate achieved by Gneg-mPLoc was 85.5%, which was more than 14% higher than the corresponding rate by the Gneg-PLoc.

The FCNN rule has some interesting properties: it is order independent, its worst-case time complexity is quadratic but often with a small constant prefactor, and it is likely to select points very close to the decision boundary. Furthermore, its structure allows for the triangle inequality to be effectively exploited to reduce the computational effort. The FCNN rule outperformed even here-enhanced variants of existing competence preservation methods both in terms of learning speed and learning scaling behavior and, often, in terms of the size of the model while it guaranteed the same prediction accuracy. Furthermore, it was three orders of magnitude faster than hybrid instance-based learning algorithms on the MNIST and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Face databases and computed a model of accuracy comparable to that of methods incorporating a noise-filtering pass.								30	2	2	0	32	1041-4347		WOS:000249563900002

Rotation invariance is achieved by a regrouping of these invariants at a constant radius followed by a second stage of invariant extraction, Rotation invariance is thus converted to translation invariance in the second step, Results using synthetic and actual images show that isolated, compact clusters are formed in feature space, These clusters are linearly separable, indicating that the nonlinearity required in the mapping from the input space to the classification space is incorporated well into the feature extraction stage, The use of higher order spectra results in good noise immunity, as verified with synthetic and real images, Classification of images using the higher order spectra-based algorithm compares favorably to classification using the method of moment invariants.								30	0	5	0	30	1057-7149		WOS:A1997WU72600007

It is also shown that the performance of these systems scale consistently with the size of the training database, where the error rate is cut by more than half for every tenfold increase in the size of the training set from 10 to 100,000 examples. Three distance metrics for the standard Nearest Neighbor classification system are investigated: a simple Hamming distance metric, a pixel distance metric, and a metric based on the extraction of penstroke features. Systems employing these metrics were trained and tested on a standard, publicly available, database of nearly 225,000 digits provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Additionally, a confidence metric is both introduced by the authors and also discovered and optimized by the system. The new confidence measure proves to be superior to the commonly used Nearest Neighbor distance.								30	4	1	0	34	0162-8828		WOS:A1994PE80200009

Remote sensing data considered include those from multispectral, hyperspectral, radar, optical, and infrared sensors. Classification is often one of the major tasks in information processing. For example, we need to identify vegetations, waterways, and man-made structures from remote sensing of earth. The large amount of data available makes remote sensing data uniquely suitable for statistical pattern recognition. This paper will address several issues on statistical pattern recognition that are related to information processing in remote sensing. Though the paper is largely tutorial in nature, some specific issues considered are image models for characterization of contextual information, neural networks for image classification, and the performance measures.Either to supplement the capability of sensors or to effectively utilize the enormous amount of sensor data, many advances in statistical pattern recognition can be very useful in machine recognition of the data. The potentials and opportunities of using statistical pattern recognition in remote sensing are indeed unlimited. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed method relies on classifying a given unlabeled sample by first finding its k-nearest training samples. A local partition of the input feature space is then carried out by means of local support vector machine (SVM) decision boundaries determined after training a multiclass SVM classifier on the considered k training samples. The labeling of the unknown sample is done by looking at the local decision region to which it belongs. The method is characterized by resulting global decision boundaries of the piecewise linear type. However, the entire process can be kernelized through the determination of the k-nearest training samples in the transformed feature space by using a distance function simply reformulated on the basis of the adopted kernel. To illustrate the performance of the proposed method, an experimental analysis on three different remote sensing datasets is reported and discussed.								29	3	3	0	32	0196-2892		WOS:000256056100024

Starting with an initial selection of a small number of prototypes, it iteratively adjusts both the position (features) of these prototypes and the corresponding local-metric weights. The resulting prototypes/metric combination minimizes a suitable estimation of the classification error probability. Good performance of this algorithm is assessed through experiments with a number of benchmark data sets and with a real task consisting in the verification of images of human faces.

J	Garrow, AG; Agnew, A; Westhead, DR								TMB-Hunt: An amino acid composition based method to screen proteomes for beta-barrel transmembrane proteins								BMC BIOINFORMATICS			6						56	10.1186/1471-2105-6-56			MAR 15 2005	2005	Background: Beta-barrel transmembrane (bbtm) proteins are a functionally important and diverse group of proteins expressed in the outer membranes of bacteria ( both gram negative and acid fast gram positive), mitochondria and chloroplasts. Despite recent publications describing reasonable levels of accuracy for discriminating between bbtm proteins and other proteins, screening of entire genomes remains troublesome as these molecules only constitute a small fraction of the sequences screened. Therefore, novel methods are still required capable of detecting new families of bbtm protein in diverse genomes.Results: We present TMB-Hunt, a program that uses a k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) algorithm to discriminate between bbtm and non-bbtm proteins on the basis of their amino acid composition. By including differentially weighted amino acids, evolutionary information and by calibrating the scoring, an accuracy of 92.5% was achieved, with 91% sensitivity and 93.8% positive predictive value (PPV), using a rigorous cross-validation procedure.A major advantage of this approach is that because it does not rely on beta-strand detection, it does not require resolved structures and thus larger, more representative, training sets could be used. It is therefore believed that this approach will be invaluable in complementing other, physicochemical and homology based methods. This was demonstrated by the correct reassignment of a number of proteins which other predictors failed to classify. We have used the algorithm to screen several genomes and have discussed our findings.Conclusion: TMB-Hunt achieves a prediction accuracy level better than other approaches published to date. Results were significantly enhanced by use of evolutionary information and a system for calibrating k-NN scoring. Because the program uses a distinct approach to that of other discriminators and thus suffers different liabilities, we believe it will make a significant contribution to the development of a consensus approach for bbtm protein detection.								29	1	28	0	31	1471-2105		WOS:000228346600001

Semiotic symbols are defined by a triadic relation between forms, meanings and referents, thus having an implicit relation to the real world. Anchors are formed between these three elements rather than between 'traditional' symbols and sensory images. This allows an optimization between the form (i.e. the 'traditional' symbol) and the referent. A robotic experiment based on adaptive language games illustrates how the anchoring of semiotic symbols can be achieved in a bottom-up fashion. The paper concludes that applying semiotic symbols is a potentially valuable approach toward anchoring. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Parzen classifiers use the distances of an unknown vector to all N prototype samples, and consequently exhibit O(N) behavior in both memory and time. We describe four techniques for expediting the nearest neighbor methods: replacing the linear search with a new kd tree method, exhibiting approximately O(N-1/2) behavior; employing an L-infinity instead of L-2 distance metric; using variance-ordered features; and rejecting prototypes by evaluating distances in low dimensionality subspaces. We demonstrate that variance-ordered features yield significant efficiency gains over the same features linearly transformed to have uniform variance. We give results for a large OCR problem, but note that the techniques expedite recognition for arbitrary applications. Three of four techniques preserve recognition accuracy.

In general, a good feature selection method should consider domain and algorithm characteristics. As the Naive Bayesian classifier is very simple and efficient and highly sensitive to feature selection, so the research of feature selection specially for it is significant. This paper presents two feature evaluation metrics for the Naive Bayesian classifier applied on multi-class text datasets: Multi-class Odds Ratio (MOR), and Class Discriminating Measure (CDM). Experiments of text classification with Naive Bayesian classifiers were carried out on two multi-class texts collections. As the results indicate, CDM and MOR gain obviously better selecting effect than other feature selection approaches. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Frigui, Hichem; Gader, Paul								Detection and Discrimination of Land Mines in Ground-Penetrating Radar Based on Edge Histogram Descriptors and a Possibilistic K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS			17	1			185	199		10.1109/TFUZZ.2008.2005249			FEB 2009	2009	This paper describes an algorithm for land mine detection using sensor data generated by a ground-penetrating radar (GPR) system that uses edge histogram descriptors for feature extraction and a possibilistic K-nearest neighbors (K-NNs) rule for confidence assignment. The algorithm demonstrated the best performance among several high-performance algorithms in extensive testing on a large real-world datasets associated with the difficult problem of land mine detection. The superior performance of the algorithm is attributed to the use of the possibilistic K-NN algorithm, thereby providing important evidence supporting the use of possibilistic methods in real-world applications. The GPR produces a 3-D array of intensity values, representing a volume below the surface of the ground. First, a computationally inexpensive pre-screening algorithm for anomaly detection is used to focus attention and identify candidate signatures that resemble mines. The identified regions of interest are processed further by a feature extraction algorithm to capture their salient features. We use translation-invariant features that are based on the local edge distribution of the 3-D GPR signatures. Specifically, each 3-D signature is divided into subsignatures, and the local edge distribution for each subsignature is represented by a histogram. Next, the training signatures are clustered to identify prototypes. The main idea is to identify few prototypes that can capture the variations of the signatures within each class. These variations could be due to different mine types, different soil conditions, different weather conditions, etc. Fuzzy memberships are assigned to these representatives to capture their degree of sharing among the mines and false alarm classes. Finally, a possibilistic K-NN-based rule is used to assign a confidence value to distinguish true detections from false alarms. The proposed algorithm is implemented and integrated within a complete land mine prototype system. It is trained, field-tested, evaluated, and compared using a large-scale cross-validation experiment that uses a diverse dataset acquired from four outdoor test sites at different geographic locations. This collection covers over 41807 m(2) of ground and includes 1593 mine encounters.								28	0	0	0	28	1063-6706		WOS:000263225100016	
J	Dixon, Sarah J.; Brereton, Richard G.								Comparison of performance of five common classifiers represented as boundary methods: Euclidean Distance to Centroids, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Learning Vector Quantization and Support Vector Machines, as dependent on data structure								CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS			95	1			1	17		10.1016/j.chemolab.2008.07.010			JAN 15 2009	2009	Five methods for discrimination are described, namely Euclidean Distance to centroids (EDC), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) (based on the Mahalanobis distance and pooled variance covariance matrix), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) (based on the Mahalanobis distance and individual class variance covariance matrix - non-Bayesian form), Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (using soft boundaries and Radial Basis Functions), and illustrated graphically as boundary methods. The performance of each method was determined using four synthetic datasets each consisting of 200 samples half belonging to one of two classes, and a further two synthetic datasets containing 400 samples, again equally split between the two classes. In datasets 1 to 3. five variables were distributed multinormally, in dataset 1 the classes are distributed roughly circularly but with a significant degree of overlap, in dataset 2. the distribution is in elongated hyperellipsoids with small overlap, and in dataset 3 there is a region of complete overlap between classes. In dataset 4 two variables are distributed in a crescent shape. In datasets 5 and 6, 100 variables were generated from multinormal populations, some of which were potential discriminators, however a large proportion of the variables were designed to be uninformative. The methods were optimised using a training set and their performance evaluated using a test set: this was repeated 100 times for different test and training set splits. The average % correctly classified was computed for each class and model, as well as the model stability for each sample (the proportion of times the sample is classified into the same group over all 100 iterations). The conclusions are that the performance of the classifiers depends very much on the distribution of data. Approaches such as LVQ and SVMs that try to determine complex boundaries perform best when the data is not normally distributed such as in dataset 4, but can be prone to overfitting otherwise. QDA tends to perform best on multinormal data although it can be influenced by non-discriminative variables which show a difference in variance. It is recommended to look at the data structure prior to model building to determine the optimal type of model. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

It has been shown in various studies that SVM provides higher accuracy level than the local model in the chaotic time series analysis. Chaotic time series analysis usually requires a long data record and it is therefore computationally time consuming in addition to possible storage capacity problems. In this study a ridge linear regression is applied in a feature space. The feature space dimension of Gaussian kernel is infinite. With the use of a data sample set, the number of dimensions of feature space of Gaussian kernel can be estimated. The scheme can computationally be guaranteed to be faster and, at the same time, stable while the accuracy remains close to or much better than other existing techniques. Existing techniques used for comparisons are: (1) standard chaos technique; (2) Naive; (3) ARIMA; (4) Inverse Approach; and (5) SVM coupled the decomposition method. The parameters involved are calibrated with an evolutionary algorithm, Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE). The performance of the proposed method is tested on Tryggevaelde catchment runoff and Mississippi river flow. Significantly higher prediction accuracies are obtained from the proposed scheme than from other existing techniques. In addition, the training speed of the scheme is very much faster than that of its counterparts (197 words < 300 words). (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

J	Liu, HF; Lussier, YA; Friedman, C								Disambiguating ambiguous biomedical terms in biomedical narrative text: An unsupervised method								JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			34	4			249	261		10.1006/jbin.2001.1023			AUG 2001	2001	With the growing use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for information extraction and concept indexing in the biomedical domain, a method that quickly and efficiently assigns the correct sense of an ambiguous biomedical term in a given context is needed concurrently. The current status of word sense disambiguation (WSD) in the biomedical domain is that handcrafted rules are used based on contextual material. The disadvantages of this approach are (i) generating WSD rules manually is a time-consuming and tedious task, (ii) maintenance of rule sets becomes increasingly difficult over time, and (iii) handcrafted rules are often incomplete and perform poorly in new domains comprised of specialized vocabularies and different genres of text. This paper presents a two-phase unsupervised method to build a WSD classifier for an ambiguous biomedical term W The first phase automatically creates a sense-tagged corpus for W, and the second phase derives a classifier for W using the derived sense-tagged corpus as a training set. A formative experiment was performed, which demonstrated that classifiers trained on the derived sense-tagged corpora achieved an overall accuracy of about 97%, with greater than 90% accuracy for each individual ambiguous term.

J	HARDIN, PJ								PARAMETRIC AND NEAREST-NEIGHBOR METHODS FOR HYBRID CLASSIFICATION - A COMPARISON OF PIXEL ASSIGNMENT ACCURACY								PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING			60	12			1439	1448					DEC 1994	1994	Nearest-neighbor classifiers have not been widely used for pixel assignment, probably because their computational requirements make them too slow for practical application to large images. Regardless, when properly specified, the nearest-neighbor classifier is a Bayesian classifier, and does not require conditions of multivariate normality as a prerequisite for optimum pixel assignment. In this study, six nearest-neighbor classifiers and four parametric classifiers are applied to six Landsat images embracing a broad variety of land cover. The accuracy of the parametric- and neighbor-based methods is compared for significant differences in the assignment of pixels to spectral-classes, In a majority of hybrid experiments, classifiers predicated on spectral neighborhoods were significantly superior to parametric classifiers for pixel assignment when training sample proportions matched the true population proportions. In experiments where this condition was violated, there was no clear advantage to choosing a neighbor-based classifier in preference to a linear discriminant function employing prior probabilities.								28	1	12	0	30	0099-1112		WOS:A1994PY04500004

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs): Detection instead of classification								JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			167	1			51	62		10.1016/j.jneumeth.2007.08.010			JAN 15 2008	2008	Many studies over the past two decades have shown that people can use brain signals to convey their intent to a computer through brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). These devices operate by recording signals from the brain and translating these signals into device commands. They can be used by people who are severely paralyzed to communicate without any use of muscle activity. One of the major impediments in translating this novel technology into clinical applications is the current requirement for preliminary analyses to identify the brain signal features best suited for communication. This paper introduces and validates signal detection, which does not require such analysis procedures, as a new concept in BCI signal processing. This detection concept is realized with Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) that are used to model resting brain activity so that any change in relevant brain signals can be detected. It is implemented in a package called SIGFRIED (SIGnal modeling For Real-time Identification and Event Detection). The results indicate that SIGFRIED produces results that are within the range of those achieved using a common analysis strategy that requires preliminary identification of signal features. They indicate that such laborious analysis procedures could be replaced by merely recording brain signals during rest. In summary, this paper demonstrates how SIGFRIED could be used to overcome one of the present impediments to translation of laboratory BCI demonstrations into clinically practical applications.

In this approach, a strength of connectedness is assigned to every pair of image elements. This is done by finding the strongest among all possible connecting paths between the two elements in each pair. The strength assigned to a particular path is defined as the weakest affinity between successive pairs of elements along the path. Affinity specifies the degree to which elements hang together locally ill the image. A scale is determined at every element in the image that indicates the size of the largest homogeneous hyperball region centered at the element. In determining affinity between any two elements, all elements within their scale regions are considered. This method has been effectively utilized in several medical applications. In this paper, we generalize this method from scalar images to vectorial images. In a vectorial image, scale is defined as the radius of the largest hyperball contained in the same homogeneous region under a predefined condition of homogeneity of the image vector field. Two different components of affinity, namely homogeneity-based affinity and object-feature-based affinity, are devised in a fully vectorial manner. The original relative fuzzy connectedness algorithm is utilized to delineate a specified object via a competing strategy among multiple objects. We have presented several studies to evaluate the performance of this method based on simulated MR images, 20 clinical MR images, and 250 mathematical phantom images. These studies indicate that the fully vectorial fuzzy connectedness formulation has generally overall better accuracy than the method using some intermediate ad hoc steps to fit the vectorial image to a scalar fuzzy connectedness formulation, and precision and efficiency are similar for these two methods.

This representation for a protein is a vector, where each of the non-zero entries in the vector indicates a significant match between the sequence of interest and the SBASE domain. The machine learning methods nearest neighbour algorithm (NNA) and support vector machines are used for predicting protein functional classes from this information. We find that the best results are found using the SBASE-A database and the NNA, namely 72% accuracy for 79% coverage. We tested an assigning function based on searching for InterPro sequence motifs and by taking the most significant BLAST match within the dataset. We applied the functional domain composition method to predict the functional class of 2018 currently unclassified yeast open reading frames.								27	2	19	0	29	1367-4803		WOS:000221556100011

As human activities continue to force substantial impacts on coral reef ecosystems, the management of inshore fisheries has become an increasingly important priority. Knowledge of the distribution, biology and habitat requirements of a species can significantly enhance conservation efforts. The sea cucumber (Holothuria leucospilota) forms an important part of the traditional subsistence fishery on Rarotonga, Cook Islands, yet little is known of this species' present spatial distribution and abundance around the island.We apply two machine learning approaches and a classical statistical approach to predict the number of sea cucumber individuals from site characteristics. The machine learning methods used are induction of regression trees and instance-based learning. These are compared to the classical statistical approach of linear regression. The most accurate predictions are obtained using instance-based learning, while the most understandable descriptions are obtained using regression tree induction. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

J	Gora, G; Wojna, A								RIONA: A new classification system combining rule induction and instance-based learning								FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE			51	4			369	390					AUG 2002	2002	The article describes a method combining two widely-used empirical approaches to learning from examples: rule induction and instance-based learning. In our algorithm (RIONA) decision is predicted not on the basis of the whole support set of all rules matching a test case. but the support set restricted to a neighbourhood of a test case. The size of the optimal neighbourhood is automatically induced during the learning phase. The empirical study shows the interesting fact that it is enough to consider a small neighbourhood to achieve classification accuracy comparable to an algorithm considering the whole learning set. The combination of k-NN and a rule-based algorithm results in a significant acceleration of the algorithm using all minimal rules. Moreover, the presented classifier has high accuracy for both kinds of domains: more suitable for k-NN classifiers and more suitable for rule based classifiers.								27	1	0	0	28	0169-2968		WOS:000180094600003

Landsat data, SPOT image and IRS image are considered as input. The superiority of these classifiers over k-NN rule, Bayes' maximum likelihood classifier and multilayer perceptron (MLP) for partitioning different landcover types is established. Results based on producer's accuracy (percentage recognition score), user's accuracy and kappa values are provided. Incorporation of the concept of variable length chromosomes and chromosome discrimination led to superior performance in terms of automatic evolution of the number of hyperplanes for modelling the class boundaries, and the convergence time. This non-parametric classifier requires very little a priori information, unlike k-NN rule and MLP (where the performance depends heavily on the value of k and the architecture, respectively), and Bayes' maximum likelihood classifier (where assumptions regarding the class distribution functions need to be made).								27	4	5	0	32	0143-1161		WOS:000170557000008

Aggregated solutions were evaluated for percent aggregation, particle counts, size distribution, morphology, changes in secondary and tertiary structure, surface hydrophobicity, metal content, and reversibility. Chemical modifications were also identified in a separate report (Luo, Q., Joubert, M. K., Stevenson, R., Narhi, L. O., and Wypych, J. (2011) J. Biol. Chem. 286, 25134-25144). Aggregates were categorized into seven discrete classes, based on the traits described. Several additional molecules (from the IgG(1) and IgG(2) subtypes as well as intravenous IgG) were stressed and found to be defined with the same classification system. The mechanism of protein aggregation and the type of aggregate formed depends on the nature of the stress applied. Different IgG molecules appear to aggregate by a similar mechanism under the same applied stress. Aggregates created by harsh mechanical stress showed the largest number of subvisible particles, and the class generated by thermal stress displayed the largest number of visible particles. Most classes showed a disruption of the higher order structure, with the degree of disorder depending on the stress process. Particles in all classes (except thermal stress) were at least partially reversible upon dilution in pH 5 buffer. High copper content was detected in isolated metal-catalyzed aggregates, a stress previously shown to produce immunogenic aggregates. In conclusion, protein aggregates can be a very heterogeneous population, whose qualities are the result of the type of stress that was experienced.								26	0	22	0	26	0021-9258		WOS:000292547900060

Experimental study on prototype optimisation algorithms for prototype-based classification in vector spaces								PATTERN RECOGNITION			39	10			1827	1838		10.1016/j.patcog.2006.04.005			OCT 2006	2006	Prototype-based classification relies on the distances between the examples to be classified and carefully chosen prototypes. A small set of prototypes is of interest to keep the computational complexity low, while maintaining high classification accuracy. An experimental study of some old and new prototype optimisation techniques is presented, in which the prototypes are either selected or generated from the given data. These condensing techniques are evaluated on real data, represented in vector spaces, by comparing their resulting reduction rates and classification performance.Usually the determination of prototypes is studied in relation with the nearest neighbour rule. We will show that the use of more general dissimilarity-based classifiers can be more beneficial. An important point in our study is that the adaptive condensing schemes here discussed allow the user to choose the number of prototypes freely according to the needs. If such techniques are combined with linear dissimilarity-based classifiers, they provide the best trade-off of small condensed sets and high classification accuracy.

J	Li, F; Wechsler, H								Open set face recognition using transduction								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			27	11			1686	1697					NOV 2005	2005	This paper motivates and describes a novel realization of transductive inference that can address the Open Set face recognition task. Open Set operates under the assumption that not all the test probes have mates in the gallery. It either detects the presence of some biometric signature within the gallery and finds its identity or rejects it, i.e., it provides for the "none of the above" answer. The main contribution of the paper is Open Set TCM-kNN (Transduction Confidence Machine-k Nearest Neighbors), which is suitable for multiclass authentication operational scenarios that have to include a rejection option for classes never enrolled in the gallery. Open Set TCM-kNN, driven by the relation between transduction and Kolmogorov complexity, provides a local estimation of the likelihood ratio needed for detection tasks. We provide extensive experimental data to show the feasibility, robustness, and comparative advantages of Open Set TCM-kNN on Open Set identification and watch list (surveillance) tasks using challenging FERET data. Last, we analyze the error structure driven by the fact that most of the errors in identification are due to a relatively small number of face patterns. Open Set TCM-kNN is shown to be suitable for PSEI (pattern specific error inhomogeneities) error analysis in order to identify difficult to recognize faces. PSEI analysis improves biometric performance by removing a small number of those difficult to recognize faces responsible for much of the original error in performance and/ or by using data fusion.								26	1	0	0	27	0162-8828		WOS:000231826300001	
J	Bencic-Nagale, S; Walt, DR								Extending the longevity of fluorescence-based sensor arrays using adaptive exposure								ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			77	19			6155	6162		10.1021/ac0505021			OCT 1 2005	2005	Fluorescent microbead sensor arrays were prepared to determine sensor array longevity. Sensor longevity is limited by photobleaching of the dyes attached to the microbeads and presents one of the biggest drawbacks of most fluorescent dye-based arrays. Responses of an array of organic vapor sensors were acquired for 2 weeks to evaluate the sensor performance over time. Photobleaching effects were overcome in two ways: (1) by limiting the excitation light power and gradually increasing the power at a rate comparable to the sensor photobleaching rates and (2) by illuminating subsections of the array through an optical slit. Both approaches extended the longevity of a sensor array. During the longevity study, the sensor arrays were employed to test their ability to correctly distinguish between responses to seven vapors. A high classification accuracy (99.8%) was obtained after 17 700 exposures for vapor responses collected over two weeks using only similar to 8% of the array's surface area.								26	0	9	0	27	0003-2700		WOS:000232443700019	
J	Granger, E; Rubin, MA; Grossberg, S; Lavoie, P								A What-and-Where fusion neural network for recognition and tracking of multiple radar emitters								NEURAL NETWORKS			14	3			325	344		10.1016/S0893-6080(01)00019-3			APR 2001	2001	A neural network recognition and tracking system is proposed for classification of radar pulses in autonomous Electronic Support Measure systems. Radar type information is considered with position-specific information from active emitters in a scene. Type-specific parameters of the input pulse stream are fed to a neural network classifier trained on samples of data collected in the field. Meanwhile, a clustering algorithm is used to separate pulses from different emitters according to position-specific parameters of the input pulse stream. Classifier responses corresponding to different emitters are separated into tracks, or trajectories, one per active emitter, allowing for more accurate identification of radar types based on multiple views of emitter data along each emitter trajectory. Such a What-and-Where fusion strategy is motivated by a similar subdivision of labor in the brain.The fuzzy ARTMAP neural network is used to classify streams of pulses according to radar type using their functional parameters. Simulation results obtained with a radar pulse data set indicate that fuzzy ARTMAP compares favorably to several other approaches when performance is measured in terms of accuracy and computational complexity. Incorporation into fuzzy ARTMAP of negative match tracking (from ARTMAP-IC) facilitated convergence during training with this data set. Other modifications improved classification of data that include missing input pattern components and missing training classes. Fuzzy ARTMAP was combined with a bank of Kalman filters to group pulses transmitted from different emitters based on their position-specific parameters, and with a module to accumulate evidence from fuzzy ARTMAP responses corresponding to the track defined for each emitter. Simulation results demonstrate that the system provides a high level of performance on complex, incomplete and overlapping radar data. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The 1st layer is to identify the query protein as monomer, homo-oligomer, or hetero-oligomer. If the result thus obtained turns out to be homo-oligomer or hetero-oligomer, then the prediction will be automatically continued to further identify it belonging to one of the following six subtypes: (1) dimer, (2) trimer, (3) tetramer, (4) pentamer, (5) hexamer, and (6) octamer. The overall success rate of Quat-2L for the 1st layer identification was 71.14%; while the overall success rates of the 2nd layer for homo-oligomers and hetero-oligomers were 76.91 and 82.52%, respectively. These rates were derived by the jackknife cross-validation tests on the stringent benchmark data set in which none of proteins has >= 60% pairwise sequence identity to any other in the same subset. As a web-server, Quat-2L is freely accessible to the public via http://icpr.jci.jx.cn/bioinfo/Quat-2L, where one can get 2-level results in about 15 s.								25	0	24	0	25	1381-1991		WOS:000288460200013

However, the performance of this spatial filter depends on the operational frequency band of the EEG. Thus, setting a broad frequency range, or manually selecting a subject-specific frequency range, are commonly used with the CSP algorithm. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) to perform autonomous selection of key temporal-spatial discriminative EEG characteristics. After the EEG measurements have been bandpass-filtered into multiple frequency bands, CSP features are extracted from each of these bands. A feature selection algorithm is then used to automatically select discriminative pairs of frequency bands and corresponding CSP features. A classification algorithm is subsequently used to classify the CSP features. A study is conducted to assess the performance of a selection of feature selection and classification algorithms for use with the FBCSP. Extensive experimental results are presented on a publicly available dataset as well as data collected from healthy subjects and unilaterally paralyzed stroke patients. The results show that FBCSP, using a particular combination feature selection and classification algorithm, yields relatively higher cross-validation accuracies compared to prevailing approaches.

J	Lee, Heesung; Kim, Euntai; Park, Mignon								A genetic feature weighting scheme for pattern recognition								INTEGRATED COMPUTER-AIDED ENGINEERING			14	2			161	171					2007	2007	This paper proposes a new pattern recognition scheme, combining a new adaptive feature weighting and modified k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) rule. The proposed feature weighting method named adaptive-3FW. It uses three non-uniform weight levels (zero weight, middle weight and full weight) to weight each feature. The middle weight value is determined using genetic algorithms (GAs). The proposed adaptive-3FW overcomes overfitting issues and achieves high recognition performance. Novel GA operators tailored for this formulation are introduced to implement the proposed scheme. Further, a modified k-NN is proposed which uses a class-dependent feature weighting strategy. Whilst the conventional pattern recognition systems use the same set of feature weights for all classes, the proposed algorithm uses different sets of feature weights for different classes. Experiments were performed with the UCI repository for machine learning databases and the unconstrained handwritten numeral database of Concordia University in Canada to show the performance of the proposed method.								25	0	1	0	25	1069-2509		WOS:000246043800004

However, the traditional implementation of this method is computationally expensive. In this paper we develop two effective techniques, namely, template condensing and preprocessing, to significantly speed up k-NN classification while maintaining the level of accuracy. Our template condensing technique aims at "sparsifying" dense homogeneous clusters of prototypes of any single class. This is implemented by iteratively eliminating patterns which exhibit high attractive capacities. Our preprocessing technique filters a large portion of prototypes which are unlikely to match against the unknown pattern. This again accelerates the classification procedure considerably, especially in cases where the dimensionality of the feature space is high. One of our case studies shows that the incorporation of these two techniques to k-NN rule achieves a seven-fold speed-up without sacrificing accuracy. CD 2002 Pattern Recognition Society.

The formulation combines the generalized fuzzy version of the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory (DSET) and the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm. Each of the K nearest neighbors provides evidence on the belongingness of the input pattern to be classified, and it is evaluated based on a measure of disapproval to achieve the adaptive capability during the classification process. The disapproval measure quantifies the lack of support with respect to the belongingness of the input pattern to a given class. Pieces of evidence are ranked based on their degree of disapproval and fused in a sequential manner. The pignistic Shannon entropy is used to estimate the degree of consensus among pieces of evidence provided by nearest neighbors and as a criterion for terminating the evidence fusion process. The paper reports the results of experimental work conducted to evaluate the proposed classification scheme using real multichannel remote sensing images. As will be demonstrated using the experimental results, the proposed classification scheme demonstrated robust performance and outperformed commonly used methods such as the K-nearest neighbor algorithm of Cover and Hart (1967), the fuzzy K-nearest neighbor algorithm of Keller et aL (1985), the evidence-theoretic K-nearest neighbor algorithm of Denoex (1995), and its fuzzy version of Zouhal and Denoex (1997). The performance of these techniques is examined with respect to the K-parameter and classification accuracy.								24	1	1	0	25	0196-2892		WOS:000230761000018

Unfortunately some databases contain noisy data which perturb the generalization of the models. An important source of noise consists of mislabelled training instances. We offer a new approach which deals with improving classification accuracies by using a preliminary filtering procedure. An example is suspect when in its neighbourhood defined by a geometrical graph the proportion of examples of the same class is not significantly greater than in the database itself. Such suspect examples in the training data can be removed or relabelled. The filtered training set is then provided as input to learning algorithms. Our experiments on ten benchmarks of UCI Machine Learning Repository using 1-NN as the final algorithm show that removal gives better results than relabelling. Removing allows maintaining the generalization error rate when we introduce from 0 to 20% of noise on the class, especially when classes are well separable. The filtering method proposed is finally compared to the relaxation relabelling schema.				13th International Symposium on Methodologies for Intelligent Systems (ISMIS 2002)	JUN 27-29, 2002	Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Univ Lumiere Lyon 2; Inst Natl Sci Appl Lyon	LYON, FRANCE	24	1	4	0	25	0925-9902		WOS:000185571500006

Twenty-two variables were analysed considering both chemical properties and mineral profile. Honey samples were found to meet the international specifications for the evaluated parameters.Classification of honey in according to its geographical provenance (North/South) was achieved by pattern recognition techniques applied to 15 out of 22 variables. Glucose. pH, free acidity, free amino acids, calcium and zinc were selected by stepwise discriminant analysis, explaining the classification of honey according to their geographical origin. Application of k-nearest-neighbour classification procedure to these six selected variables produced a successful assignation (99% correct) of honey to its provenance. On the other hand only 83% right assignation was observed, when the 15 variables were used, confirming that the use of all available features is unnecessary to get good geographical discrimination.

J	Yu, Jie; Amores, Jaume; Sebe, Nicu; Radeva, Petia; Tian, Qi								Distance learning for similarity estimation								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			30	3			451	462		10.1109/TPAMI.2007.70714			MAR 2008	2008	In this paper, we present a general guideline to find a better distance measure for similarity estimation based on statistical analysis of distribution models and distance functions. A new set of distance measures are derived from the harmonic distance, the geometric distance, and their generalized variants according to the Maximum Likelihood theory. These measures can provide a more accurate feature model than the classical euclidean and Manhattan distances. We also find that the feature elements are often from heterogeneous sources that may have different influence on similarity estimation. Therefore, the assumption of single isotropic distribution model is often inappropriate. To alleviate this problem, we use a boosted distance measure framework that finds multiple distance measures, which fit the distribution of selected feature elements best for accurate similarity estimation. The new distance measures for similarity estimation are tested on two applications: stereo matching and motion tracking in video sequences. The performance of boosted distance measure is further evaluated on several benchmark data sets from the UCI repository and two image retrieval applications. In all the experiments, robust results are obtained based on the proposed methods.								23	1	1	0	24	0162-8828		WOS:000252286100007

II. quantifying photometric redshifts for quasars using instance-based learning					1			ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			663	2			774	780		10.1086/518362			JUL 10 2007	2007	We apply instance- based machine learning in the form of a k- nearest neighbor algorithm to the task of estimating photometric redshifts for 55,746 objects spectroscopically classified as quasars in the Fifth Data Release of the SloanDigital Sky Survey. We compare the results obtained to those froman empirical color- redshift relation ( CZR). In contrast to previously published results using CZRs, we find that the instance- based photometric redshifts are assigned with no regions of catastrophic failure. Remaining outliers are simply scattered about the ideal relation, in a manner similar to the pattern seen in the optical for normal galaxies at redshifts z less than or similar to 1. The instance- based algorithm is trained on a representative sample of the data and pseudoYblind- tested on the remaining unseen data. The variance between the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts is sigma(2) =0.123 +/- 0: 002 ( compared to sigma (2) =0.265 +/- 0. 006 for the CZR), and 54. 9% +/- 0: 7%, 73. 3% +/- 0.6%, and 80.7% +/- 0.3% of the objects are within Delta z < 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3, respectively. We also match our sample to the Second Data Release of the Galaxy Evolution Explorer legacy data, and the resulting 7642 objects show a further improvement, giving a variance of sigma(2) = 0.054 +/- 0. 005, with 70. 8% +/- 1. 2%, 85.8% +/- 1. 0%, and 90. 8% +/- 0.7% of objects within Delta z < 0. 1, 0.2, and 0.3. We show that the improvement is indeed due to the extra information provided by GALEX, by training on the same data set using purely SDSS photometry, which has a variance of sigma (2) = 0. 090 +/- 0. 007. Each set of results represents a realistic standard for application to further data sets for which the spectra are representative.								23	1	0	0	24	0004-637X		WOS:000248001500007	
J	Gao, Qing-Bin; Wang, Zheng-Zhi				Gao, Qing-Bin/G-9825-2011				Center-based nearest neighbor classifier								PATTERN RECOGNITION			40	1			346	349		10.1016/j.patcog.2006.06.033			JAN 2007	2007	In this paper, a novel center-based nearest neighbor (CNN) classifier is proposed to deal with the pattern classification problems. Unlike nearest feature line (NFL) method, CNN considers the line passing through a sample point with known label and the center of the sample class. This line is called the center-based line (CL). These lines seem to have more capacity of representation for sample classes than the original samples and thus can capture more information. Similar to NFL, CNN is based on the nearest distance from an unknown sample point to a certain CL for classification. As a result, the computation time of CNN can be shortened dramatically with less accuracy decrease when compared with NFL. The performance of CNN is demonstrated in one simulation experiment from computational biology and high classification accuracy has been achieved in the leave-one-out test. The comparisons with nearest neighbor (NN) classifier and NFL classifier indicate that this novel classifier achieves competitive performance. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society.

The cation solutions were tested in a series of concentrations and the fold-change in effective absorbance was analyzed by principal-component analysis (PCA), hierarchical-cluster analysis (HCA), and nearest-neighbor decision to determine both identity and quantity of the analytes. Apart from alkali-metal ions (Na+, K+, Li+, Cs+, and Rb+), which behave very similarly to each other due mainly to their low response, most of the cations were clearly distinguishable at 10 mm concentration. The practical detection limit of each analyte was also determined by a sequential dilution and the nearest-neighbor decision method. In the finalized working analyte concentration range (approximately 10 mm down to 0.33 mu m), by considering alkali metals as one analyte group, most of the analytes were correctly identified (99.4%). Furthermore, the success rate at which the concentration of each analyte was correctly determined was also high (96.8 %).								23	1	9	0	24	0947-6539		WOS:000239481600004

The operator advisory system involves the integration of two fundamentally different artificial intelligence techniques: expert systems and neural networks. A diagnostic strategy based on the hierarchical use of neural networks is used as a first-level filter to diagnose faults commonly encountered in chemical process plants. Once the faults are localized within the process by the neural networks, the deep knowledge expert system analyzes the results, and either confirms the diagnosis or else offers an alternative solution. The model-based expert system contains information of the plant's structure and function within its object-oriented knowledge base. The diagnostic strategy can handle multiple faults, novel or previously unencountered faults, and noisy process sensory measurements. The operator advisory system is demonstrated using a multi-column distillation plant as a case study.								23	4	0	1	28	0098-1354		WOS:A1993LN36800005

In this paper, a simple nonparametric classifier based on the local mean vectors is proposed. The proposed classifier is compared with the I-NN, k-NN, Euclidean distance (ED), Parzen, and artificial neural network (ANN) classifiers in terms of the error rate on the unknown patterns, particularly in small training sample size situations. Experimental results show that the proposed classifier is promising even in practical situations. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.								22	2	2	0	24	0167-8655		WOS:000238018200012

This information can in fact be used to improve the efficiency of handoff algorithms, as we do in our new handoff algorithms using statistical pattern recognition. Handoff algorithms with both a negligible number of unnecessary handoffs and a negligible decision delay can therefore be realized.								22	1	0	0	23	0733-8716		WOS:000088719300017

In the literature it has been shown, however, that the performance of the method improves if complex, often locally defined metrics are chosen. In this paper we demonstrate that in many real world discrimination problems comparable or even better classification results can be obtained with a simple global metric based on the Box-Cox transformation. In three case studies this is demonstrated: synthetic data, the IRIS data and real radar data In the latter experiment, a large reduction in classification error of more than a factor four is achieved.

The performance of the bootstrap estimators, e0 and 0.632B, is considered relative to leaving-one-out and other cross-validation estimators. Monte Carlo simulations are used to measure the performance of the error rate estimators. The experimental results are compared to previously reported simulations for both nearest neighbor classifiers and alternative classifiers. It is shown that each of the estimators has strengths and weaknesses for varying apparent and true error rate situations. A combined estimator that corrects the leaving-one-out estimator (by combining bootstrap and cross-validation estimators) gave strong results over a broad range of situations and warrants further investigation for other classifiers.								22	0	7	0	22	0162-8828		WOS:A1991FG36000008

On the k-NN performance in a challenging scenario of imbalance and overlapping								PATTERN ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS			11	3-4			269	280		10.1007/s10044-007-0087-5			SEP 2008	2008	A two-class data set is said to be imbalanced when one (minority) class is heavily under-represented with respect to the other (majority) class. In the presence of a significant overlapping, the task of learning from imbalanced data can be a very difficult problem. Additionally, if the overall imbalance ratio is different from local imbalance ratios in overlap regions, the task can become in a major challenge. This paper explains the behaviour of the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) rule when learning from such a complex scenario. This local model is compared to other machine learning algorithms, attending to how their behaviour depends on a number of data complexity features (global imbalance, size of overlap region, and its local imbalance). As a result, several conclusions useful for classifier design are inferred.								21	1	1	0	22	1433-7541		WOS:000258579900005	
J	Marcelloni, F								Feature selection based on a modified fuzzy C-means algorithm with supervision								INFORMATION SCIENCES			151				201	226		10.1016/S0020-0255(02)00402-4			MAY 2003	2003	In this paper we propose a new approach to feature selection based on a modified fuzzy C-means algorithm with supervision (MFCMS). MFCMS completes the unsupervised learning of classical fuzzy C-means with labeled patterns. The labeled patterns allow MFCMS to accurately model the shape of each cluster and consequently to highlight the features which result to be particularly effective to characterize a cluster. These features are distinguished by a low variance of their values for the patterns with a high membership degree to the cluster. If, with respect to these features, the distance between the prototype of the cluster and the prototypes of the other clusters is high, then these features have the property of discriminating between the cluster and the other clusters. To take these two aspects into account, for each cluster and each feature, we introduce a purposely defined index: the higher the value of the index, the higher the discrimination capability of the feature for the cluster. We execute MFCMS on the training set considering all patterns as labeled. Then, we retain the features which are associated, at least for one cluster, with an index larger than a threshold T.We applied MFCMS to several real-world pattern classification benchmarks. We used the well-known k-nearest neighbors as learning algorithm. We show that feature selection performed by MFCMS achieved an improvement in generalization on all data sets.

Algorithm development								TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			43	6			1695	1702					NOV-DEC 2000	2000	Watercore is an internal disorder that leads to breakdown of tissue and possibly loss or downgrade of the product. It is very difficult to determine whether an apple contains watercore or not, especially in the early stages, based solely on external information, since watercore does not alter external texture until after severe internal breakdown. In this study, we explored the possibility of using two-dimensional (2-D) X-ray imaging to detect internal watercore damage in apples. The algorithm to detect Red 'Delicious' watercore apples consists of two stages, the first stage extracts features from the apple x-ray. image and the second stage categorizes apples into different watercore levels using the features identified. A total of eight features were extracted from an x-ray scanned apple image and these features were fed into neural network classifier to categorize them into three different classes, clean, mild, and severe. The results showed that the system was able to correctly recognize apples into clean and severe categories within 5-8% false positive and negative ratios. The result also showed that the algorithm was able to recognize apples independent of apple orientation, but only if the stem-calyx axis made a fixed angle with the x-ray beam. Sorting at random apple orientation was not tested. The estimated speed of the system, if implemented on a DSP board, will be fast enough to keep up with the current apple processing line.								21	3	8	0	25	0001-2351		WOS:000166972800045

In addition to being of interest in applications, this problem serves as a paradigm within which most of the areas of active research in statistical signal processing arise. In particular, the methodologies of nonlinear signal processing, higher order statistical analysis, signal representations, and learning algorithms, all can be juxtaposed quite naturally in this framework.								21	0	0	0	21	0018-9219		WOS:A1994NX70700010

This system consists of a sensor array of quartz-crystal microbalances coated with plasma polymer films. The films, synthesized by radio-frequency sputtering, are useful because of their high density of radical sites and unsaturated bonds. When this sensor array is exposed to a gas, the adsorption and desorption of the target gas causes a dynamic frequency response in each piezoelectric sensor. The sensor response is analysed by an autoregressive model typically used to estimate the parameters of dynamic systems. This model's coefficients reflect the sensor dynamics, providing pattern vectors that characterize the target gas. Based on this model, classification maps for single gases can be created with these pattern vectors. These maps show that the dynamic sensor response provides useful information for gas classification. This model also confirms that our sensing system can identify and quantify the components of a gas mixture.				7th International Conference on Solid-State Sensors and Actuators (Transducers 93)	JUN 07-10, 1993		YOKOHAMA, JAPAN	21	0	0	0	21	0925-4005		WOS:A1994PK67200024

Typically, data analysis is performed separately for each stained aliquot of a sample; subsequently, an expert interprets the overall immunophenotypic profile (IP) of neoplastic B-cells and assigns it to specific diagnostic categories. We constructed a principal component analysis (PCA)-based tool to guide immunophenotypic classification of B-CLPD. Three reference groups of immunophenotypic data files-FB-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (B-CLL; n = 10), mantle cell (MCL; n = 10) and follicular lymphomas (FL; n = 10)-were built. Subsequently, each of the 175 cases studied was evaluated and assigned to either one of the three reference groups or to none of them (other B-CLPD). Most cases (89%) were correctly assigned to their corresponding WHO diagnostic group with overall positive and negative predictive values of 89 and 96%, respectively. The efficiency of the PCA-based approach was particularly high among typical B-CLL, MCL and FL vs other B-CLPD cases. In summary, PCA-guided immunophenotypic classification of B-CLPD is a promising tool for standardized interpretation of tumor IP, their classification into well-defined entities and comprehensive evaluation of antibody panels.

This method builds a dissimilarity space using information theoretic measures, in particular conditional mutual information between features with respect to a relevant variable that represents the class labels. Applying a hierarchical clustering, the algorithm searches for a compression of the information contained in the original set of features. The proposed technique is compared with other state of art methods also based on information measures. Eventually, several experiments are presented to show the effectiveness of the features selected from the point of view of classification accuracy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The algorithm uses the local image features of shape index and curvedness in order to detect candidate structures in the lung volume and applies two successive k-nearest-neighbour classifiers in the reduction of false-positives.The nodule detection system is trained and tested on three databases extracted from a large-scale experimental screening study. The databases are constructed in order to evaluate the algorithm on both randomly chosen screening data as well as data containing higher proportions of nodules requiring follow-up. The system results are extensively evaluated including performance measurements on specific nodule types and sizes within the databases and on lesions which later proved to be malignant. In a random selection of 813 scans from the screening study a sensitivity of 80% with an average 4.2 false-positives per scan is achieved. The detection results presented are a realistic measure of a CAD system performance in a low-dose screening study which includes a diverse array of nodules of many varying sizes, types and textures.

An analysis of how training data complexity affects the nearest neighbor classifiers								PATTERN ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS			10	3			189	201		10.1007/s10044-007-0061-2			AUG 2007	2007	The k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier is one of the most popular supervised classification methods. It is very simple, intuitive and accurate in a great variety of real-world domains. Nonetheless, despite its simplicity and effectiveness, practical use of this rule has been historically limited due to its high storage requirements and the computational costs involved. On the other hand, the performance of this classifier appears strongly sensitive to training data complexity. In this context, by means of several problem difficulty measures, we try to characterize the behavior of the k-NN rule when working under certain situations. More specifically, the present analysis focuses on the use of some data complexity measures to describe class overlapping, feature space dimensionality and class density, and discover their relation with the practical accuracy of this classifier.								20	0	2	0	20	1433-7541		WOS:000248383000003

And it is also vitally important for environmental protection. However, it is an important and difficult task to recognize plant species on earth. Designing a convenient and automatic recognition system of plants is necessary and useful since it can facilitate fast classifying plants, and understanding and managing them. In this paper, a leaf database from different plants is firstly constructed. Then, a new classification method, referred to as move median centers (MMC) hypersphere classifier, for the leaf database based on digital morphological feature is proposed. The proposed method is more robust than the one based on contour features since those significant curvature points are hard to find. Finally, the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method in recognizing different plants is demonstrated by experiments. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Popular cross-validation techniques often fail to guide us well in selecting k mainly due to the presence of multiple minimizers of the estimated misclassification rate. This article investigates a Bayesian method in this connection, which solves the problem of multiple optimizers. The utility of the proposed method is illustrated using some benchmark data sets.

J	Yu, XJ; Wang, C; Li, YX								Classification of protein quaternary structure by functional domain composition								BMC BIOINFORMATICS			7						187	10.1186/1471-2105-7-187			APR 4 2006	2006	Background: The number and the arrangement of subunits that form a protein are referred to as quaternary structure. Quaternary structure is an important protein attribute that is closely related to its function. Proteins with quaternary structure are called oligomeric proteins. Oligomeric proteins are involved in various biological processes, such as metabolism, signal transduction, and chromosome replication. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop some computational methods to automatically classify the quaternary structure of proteins from their sequences.Results: To explore this problem, we adopted an approach based on the functional domain composition of proteins. Every protein was represented by a vector calculated from the domains in the PFAM database. The nearest neighbor algorithm ( NNA) was used for classifying the quaternary structure of proteins from this information. The jackknife cross-validation test was performed on the non-redundant protein dataset in which the sequence identity was less than 25%. The overall success rate obtained is 75.17%. Additionally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, we predicted the proteins in an independent dataset and achieved an overall success rate of 84.11%Conclusion: Compared with the amino acid composition method and Blast, the results indicate that the domain composition approach may be a more effective and promising high-throughput method in dealing with this complicated problem in bioinformatics.								20	0	14	0	20	1471-2105		WOS:000237201700001	
J	Lee, Y; Wahba, G; Ackerman, SA								Cloud classification of satellite radiance data by multicategory support vector machines								JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY			21	2			159	169		10.1175/1520-0426(2004)021<0159:CCOSRD>2.0.CO;2			FEB 2004	2004	Two-category support vector machines (SVMs) have become very popular in the machine learning community for classification problems and have recently been shown to have good optimality properties for classification purposes. Treating multicategory problems as a series of binary problems is common in the SVM paradigm. However, this approach may fail under a variety of circumstances. The multicategory support vector machine (MSVM), which extends the binary SVM to the multicategory case in a symmetric way, and has good theoretical properties, has recently been proposed. The proposed MSVM in addition provides a unifying framework when there are either equal or unequal misclassification costs, and when there is a possibly nonrepresentative training set.Illustrated herein is the potential of the MSVM as an efficient cloud detection and classification algorithm for use in Earth Observing System models, which require knowledge of whether or not a radiance profile is cloud free. If the profile is not cloud free, it is valuable to have information concerning the type of cloud, for example, ice or water. The MSVM has been applied to simulated MODIS channel data to classify the radiance profiles as coming from clear sky, water clouds, or ice clouds, and the results are promising. It can be seen in simple examples, and application to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations, that the method is an improvement over channel-by-channel partitioning. It is believed that the MSVM will be a very useful tool for classification problems in atmospheric sciences.								20	2	1	0	21	0739-0572		WOS:000189391100002

Corn samples from a single genotype (RWA2, blanks, and contaminated with Fusarium graminearum) were ground, sieved and, after appropriate sample preparation, subjected to mid-infrared spectroscopy using two different accessories (diffuse reflection and attenuated total reflection). The measured spectra were evaluated with principal component analysis (PCA) and the blank and contaminated samples were classified by cluster analysis. Reference data for fungal metabolites were obtained with conventional methods. After extraction and clean-up, each sample was analyzed for the toxin deoxynivalenol (DON) by gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD) and ergosterol (a parameter for the total fungal biomass) by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD). The concentration ranges for contaminated samples were 880-3600 mug/kg for ergosterol and 300-2600 mug/kg for DON. Classification efficiency was 100% for ATR spectra. DR spectra did not show as obvious a clustering of contaminated and blank samples. Results and trends were also observed in single spectra plots. Quantification using a PLS1 regression algorithm showed good correlation with DON reference data, but a rather high standard error of prediction (SEP) with 600 mug/kg (DR) and 490 mug/kg (ATR), respectively, for ergosterol. Comparing measurement procedures and results showed advantages for the ATR technique, mainly owing to its ease of use and the easier interpretation of results that were better with respect to classification and quantification.								20	0	12	0	20	1618-2642		WOS:000187132600033

We assume that she can form a ranking given any memory that consists of finitely many past cases. Mild consistency requirements on these rankings imply that they have a numerical representation via a matrix assigning numbers to eventuality-case pairs, as follows. Given a memory, each eventuality is ranked according to the sum of the numbers in its row, over cases in memory. The number attached to an eventuality-case pair can be interpreted as the degree of support that the past case lends to the plausibility of the eventuality. Special instances of this result may be viewed as axiomatizing kernel methods for estimation of densities and for classification problems. Interpreting the same result for rankings of theories or hypotheses, rather than of specific eventualities, it is shown that one may ascribe to the predictor subjective conditional probabilities of cases given theories, such that her rankings of theories agree with rankings by the likelihood functions.								20	0	0	0	20	0012-9682		WOS:000180543900001

General properties of uncertainties are systematically studied, Many characteristics of distributions introduced previously in statistical physics, mathematical statistics, econometrics and information theory are shown to be particular examples of uncertainties, New examples are introduced, and traditional as well as some new methods for obtaining uncertainties are discussed, The information defined by decrease of uncertainty resulting from an observation is investigated and related to previous concepts of information, Further, statistical inference about uncertainties is investigated, based on independent observations of system states. In particular, asymptotic distributions of maximum likelihood estimates of uncertainties and uncertainty-related funtions are derived, and asymptotically alpha-level Neyman-Pearson tests of hypotheses about these system characteristics are presented.								20	0	0	0	20	1083-4427		WOS:A1996VP07800002

A problem with many current neural models is that with realistically large input patterns learning time explodes. This is a problem inherent in a notion of learning that is based almost entirely on statistical estimation. We propose here a different learning style where significant relations in the input pattern are recognized and expressed by the unsupervised self-organization of dynamic links. The power of this mechanism is due to the very general a priori principle of conservation of topological structure. We demonstrate that style with a system that learns to classify mirror symmetric pixel patterns from single examples.								20	1	6	0	21	0899-7667		WOS:A1993LR84300004

Facing the avalanche of new protein sequences discovered in the post genomic era, we are challenged to develop automated methods for quickly and accurately predicting the location sites of viral proteins in a host cell; the information thus acquired is particularly important for medical science and antiviral drug design. In view of this, a new fusion classifier called "Virus-mPLoc" was established by hybridizing the gene ontology information. Functional domain information, and sequential evolutionary information. The new predictor not only can more accurately predict the location sites of viral proteins in a host cell, but also have the capacity to identify the multiple-location virus proteins, which is beyond the reach of any existing predictors specialized for viral proteins. For reader's convenience, a user-friendly web-server for Virus-mPLoc was designed that is freely accessible at http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/virus-multi/.								19	1	18	0	20	0739-1102		WOS:000280567800004	
J	Lo, Pechin; Sporring, Jon; Ashraf, Haseem; Pedersen, Jesper J.

We propose a voxel classification approach for the appearance model, which uses a classifier that is trained to differentiate between airway and non-airway voxels. This is in contrast to previous works that use either intensity alone or hand crafted models of airway appearance. We show that the appearance model can be trained with a set of easily acquired, incomplete, airway tree segmentations. A vessel orientation similarity measure is introduced, which indicates how similar the orientation of an airway candidate is to the orientation of the neighboring vessel. We use this vessel orientation similarity measure to overcome regions in the airway tree that have a low response from the appearance model. The proposed method is evaluated on 250 low dose computed tomography images from a lung cancer screening trial. Our experiments showed that applying the region growing algorithm on the airway appearance model produces more complete airway segmentations, leading to on average 20% longer trees, and 50% less leakage. When combining the airway appearance model with vessel orientation similarity, the improvement is even more significant (p < 0.01) than only using the airway appearance model, with on average 7% increase in the total length of branches extracted correctly.

In this paper, we introduce a classifier to predict the small molecule- enzyme interaction, i.e., whether they can interact with each other. Small molecules are represented by their chemical functional groups, and enzymes are represented by their biochemical and physicochemical properties, resulting in a total of 160 features. These features are input into the AdaBoost classifier, which is known to have good generalization ability to predict interaction. As a result, the overall prediction accuracy, tested by tenfold cross-validation and independent sets, is 81.76% and 83.35%, respectively, suggesting that this strategy is effective. In this research, we typically choose interactions between small molecules and enzymes involved in metabolism to ultimately improve further understanding of metabolic pathways.

It thus plays a key role in deciding which case to select, and therefore, in deciding which solution will be eventually applied. In CBR, there are many retrieval techniques. One feature shared by most is that case retrieval is based on attribute similarity and importance. However, there are other crucial factors that should be considered, such as the possible consequences of a given solution, in other words its potential loss and gain. As their name clearly implies, these concepts are defined as functions measuring loss and gain when a given retrieval case solution is applied. Moreover, these functions help the user to choose the best solution so that when a mistake is made the resulting loss is minimal. In this way, the highest benefit is always obtained.

In practice. the choice of k is determined by the cross-validation method. In this work, we propose a new method for neighborhood size selection that is based on the concept of statistical confidence. We define the confidence associated with a decision that is made by the majority rule from a finite number of observations and use it as a criterion to determine the number of nearest neighbors needed. The new algorithm is tested on several real-world datasets and yields results comparable to the k-nearest-neighbor rule. However, in contrast to the k-nearest-neighbor rule that uses a fixed number of nearest neighbors throughout the feature space, our method locally adjusts the number of nearest neighbors until a satisfactory level of confidence is reached. In addition, the statistical confidence provides a natural way to balance the trade-off between the reject rate and the error rate by excluding patterns that have low confidence levels. We believe that this property of our method can be of great importance in applications where the confidence with which a decision is made is equally or more important than the overall error rate.

The self-organizing map (SOM) describes a family otnonlinear, topology preserving mapping methods with attributes of both vector quantization and clustering that provides Visualization options unavailable with other nonlinear methods. In contrast to most chemometric methods, the supervised SOM (sSOM) is shown to be relatively insensitive to noise and feature redundancy. Additionally, sSOMs can make use of descriptors having only nominal linear correlation with the tar et property. Results herein are contrasted to partial least squares, stepwise Multiple linear regression, the genetic functional algorithm, and genetic partial least Squares, collectively referred to throughout as the "standard methods". The k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classification method was also performed to provide a direct comparison with a different classification method. The widely studied dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibition data set of Hansch and Silipo is Used to evaluate the ability of sSOMs to classify unknowns as a function of increasing class resolution. The contribution of the sSOM neighborhood kernel to its predictive ability is assessed in two experiments: ( 1) training with the k-rneans Clustering limit, where the neighborhood radius is zero throughout the training regimen, and (2) training the sSOM until the neighborhood radius is reduced to zero. Results demonstrate that sSOMs provide more accurate predictions than standard linear QSAR methods.								19	0	8	0	20	1549-9596		WOS:000233689400039

One of the most well known such rules is the k-nearest-neighbor decision rule (also known as lazy learning) in which an unknown pattern is classified into the majority class among its k nearest neighbors in the training set. Several questions related to this rule have received considerable attention over the years. Such questions include the following. How can the storage of the training set be reduced without degrading the performance of the decision rule? How should the reduced training set be selected to represent the different classes? How large should k be? How should the value of k be chosen? Should all k neighbors be equally weighted when used to decide the class of an unknown pattern? If not, how should the weights be chosen? Should all the features (attributes) we weighted equally and if not how should the feature weights be chosen? What distance metric should be used? How can the rule be made robust to overlapping classes or noise present in the training data? How can the rule be made invariant to scaling of the measurements? How can the nearest neighbors of a new point be computed efficiently? What is the smallest neural network that can implement nearest neighbor decision rules? Geometric proximity graphs such as Voronoi diagrams and their many relatives provide elegant solutions to these problems, as well as other related data mining problems such as outlier detection. After a non-exhaustive review of some of the classical canonical approaches to these problems, the methods that use proximity graphs are discussed, some new observations are made, and open problems are listed.

It is very simple, intuitive and accurate in a great variety of real-world applications. Despite its simplicity and effectiveness, practical use of this rule has been historically limited due to its high storage requirements and the computational costs involved, as well as the presence of outliers. In order to overcome these drawbacks, it is possible to employ a suitable prototype selection scheme, as a way of storage and computing time reduction and it usually provides some increase in classification accuracy. Nevertheless, in some practical cases prototype selection may even produce a degradation of the classifier effectiveness. From an empirical point of view, it is still difficult to know a priori when this method will provide an appropriate behavior. The present paper tries to predict how appropriate a prototype selection algorithm will result when applied to a particular problem, by characterizing data with a set of complexity measures.				2nd Iberian Conference on Pattern Recongnition and Image Analysis	JUN 07-09, 2005	Fund Oriente; Fund Cienc Tecnol; HP Portugal; Inst Syst & Robotics; Int Assoc Pattern Recognit	Estoril, PORTUGAL	19	0	1	0	19	0302-9743	3-540-26154-0	WOS:000230027000004	
S	Wojna, A						Peters, JF; Skowron, A		Analogy-based reasoning in classifier construction								TRANSACTIONS ON ROUGH SETS IV	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		3700				277	374					2005	2005	Analogy-based reasoning methods in machine learning make it possible to reason about properties of objects on the basis of similarities between objects. A specific similarity based method is the k nearest neighbors (k-nn) classification algorithm. In the k-nn algorithm, a decision about a new object x is inferred on the basis of a fixed number k of the objects most similar to x in a given set of examples. The primary contribution of the dissertation is the introduction of two new classification models based on the k-nn algorithm.The first model is a hybrid combination of the k-nn algorithm with rule induction. The proposed combination uses minimal consistent rules defined by local reducts of a set of examples. To make this combination possible the model of minimal consistent rules is generalized to a metric-dependent form. An effective polynomial algorithm implementing the classification model based on minimal consistent rules has been proposed by Bazan. We modify this algorithm in such a way that after addition of the modified algorithm to the k-nn algorithm the increase of the computation time is inconsiderable. For some tested classification problems the combined model was significantly more accurate than the classical k-nn classification algorithm.For many real-life problems it is impossible to induce relevant global mathematical models from available sets of examples. The second model proposed in the dissertation is a method for dealing with such sets based on locally induced metrics. This method adapts the notion of similarity to the properties of a given test object. It makes it possible to select the correct decision in specific fragments of the space of objects. The method with local metrics improved significantly the classification accuracy of methods with global models in the hardest tested problems.The important issues of quality and efficiency of the k-nn based methods are a similarity measure and the performance time in searching for the most similar objects in a given set of examples, respectively. In this dissertation both issues are studied in detail and some significant improvements are proposed for the similarity measures and for the search methods found in the literature.								19	0	0	0	19	0302-9743	3-540-29830-4	WOS:000234424800011

Various approaches, including statistical and graph theoretical methods, data mining, and computational pattern recognition, have been applied to this task with varying degrees of success. Using a novel classifier based on the Bayes discriminant function, we present a hybrid algorithm that employs feature selection and extraction to isolate salient features from large medical and other biological data sets.We have previously shown that a genetic algorithm coupled with a k-nearest-neighbors classifier performs well in extracting information about protein-water binding from X-ray crystallographic protein structure data. The effectiveness of the hybrid EC-Bayes classifier is demonstrated to distinguish the features of this data set that are the most statistically relevant and to weight these features appropriately to aid in the prediction of solvation sites.

Performance comparisons are presented on synthetic and real examples versus k-nearest neighbors, Fisher's linear discriminant and support vector machines.

It has also demonstrated itself to be one of the most useful algorithms in data mining in spite of its simplicity. However, the nearest neighbor classifier suffers from several drawbacks such as high storage requirements, low efficiency in classification response, and low noise tolerance. These weaknesses have been the subject of study for many researchers and many solutions have been proposed. Among them, one of the most promising solutions consists of reducing the data used for establishing a classification rule ( training data) by means of selecting relevant prototypes. Many prototype selection methods exist in the literature and the research in this area is still advancing. Different properties could be observed in the definition of them, but no formal categorization has been established yet. This paper provides a survey of the prototype selection methods proposed in the literature from a theoretical and empirical point of view. Considering a theoretical point of view, we propose a taxonomy based on the main characteristics presented in prototype selection and we analyze their advantages and drawbacks. Empirically, we conduct an experimental study involving different sizes of data sets for measuring their performance in terms of accuracy, reduction capabilities, and runtime. The results obtained by all the methods studied have been verified by nonparametric statistical tests. Several remarks, guidelines, and recommendations are made for the use of prototype selection for nearest neighbor classification.								18	3	2	0	21	0162-8828		WOS:000299381600001

Data miners can learn defect predictors from static code features which can be used to control QA resources; e.g. to focus on the parts of the code predicted to be more defective.Recent results show that better data mining technology is not leading to better defect predictors. We hypothesize that we have reached the limits of the standard learning goal of maximizing area under the curve (AUC) of the probability of false alarms and probability of detection "AUC(pd, pf)"; i.e. the area under the curve of a probability of false alarm versus probability of detection.Accordingly, we explore changing the standard goal. Learners that maximize "AUC(effort, pd)" find the smallest set of modules that contain the most errors. WHICH is a meta-learner framework that can be quickly customized to different goals. When customized to AUC(effort, pd), WHICH out-performs all the data mining methods studied here. More importantly, measured in terms of this new goal, certain widely used learners perform much worse than simple manual methods.Hence, we advise against the indiscriminate use of learners. Learners must be chosen and customized to the goal at hand. With the right architecture (e.g. WHICH), tuning a learner to specific local business goals can be a simple task.								18	2	0	0	20	0928-8910		WOS:000280257100002

These pairs are coded by PseAA composition, resulting in 114 features. A hybrid feature selection system, mRMR-KNNs-wrapper, is applied to obtain an optimized feature set by excluding poor-performed and/or redundant features, resulting in 103 remaining features. Using the optimized 103-feature subset, a prediction model is trained and tested in the k-nearest neighbors (KNNs) learning system. This prediction model achieves an overall accurate prediction rate of 76.18%, evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation test, which is 1.46% higher than using the initial 114 features and is 6.51% higher than the 20 features, coded by amino acid compositions.

In spite of their considerable public health impact, little is known about the population structures of these species. In this study, a battery of C. parvum and C. hominis isolates from seven countries was genotyped using a nine-locus DNA subtyping scheme. To assess the existence of geographical partitions, the multilocus genotype data were mined using a cluster analysis based on the nearest-neighbor principle. Within each country, the population genetic structures were explored by combining diversity statistical tests, linkage disequilibrium, and eBURST analysis. For both parasite species, a quasi-complete phylogenetic segregation was observed among the countries. Cluster analysis accurately identified recently introduced isolates. Rather than conforming to a strict paradigm of either a clonal or a panmictic population structure, data are consistent with a flexible reproductive strategy characterized by the cooccurrence of both propagation patterns. The relative contribution of each pattern appears to vary between the regions, perhaps dependent on the prevailing ecological determinants of transmission.								18	0	15	0	18	0099-2240		WOS:000261030400017

CHOICE OF NEIGHBOR ORDER IN NEAREST-NEIGHBOR CLASSIFICATION								ANNALS OF STATISTICS			36	5			2135	2152		10.1214/07-AOS537			OCT 2008	2008	The kth-nearest neighbor rule is arguably the simplest and most intuitively appealing nonparametric classification procedure. However, application of this method is inhibited by lack of knowledge about its properties, in particular, about the manner in which it is influenced by the value of k; and by the absence of techniques for empirical choice of k. In the present paper we detail the way in which the value of k determines the misclassification error. We consider two models, Poisson and Binomial, for the training samples. Under the first model, data are recorded in a Poisson stream and are "assigned" to one or other of the two populations in accordance with the prior probabilities. In particular, the total number of data in both training samples is a Poisson-distributed random variable. Under the Binomial model, however, the total number of data in the training samples is fixed, although again each data value is assigned in a random way. Although the values of risk and regret associated with the Poisson and Binomial models are different, they are asymptotically equivalent to first order, and also to the risks associated with kernel-based classifiers that are tailored to the case of two derivatives. These properties motivate new methods for choosing the value of k.								18	2	0	0	20	0090-5364		WOS:000260554100005

This is the second of two papers on profiling gene expression in zebrafish (Danio rerio) treated with endocrine-disrupting chemicals of different modes of action, with a focus on comparative analysis of microarray data for gene classifier discovery. Various combinations of gene feature selection/class prediction algorithms were evaluated. with the use of microarray data organized by a chemical stressor or tissue type, for their accuracy in determining the class memberships of independent test samples. Two-way clustering of gene classifiers and treatment conditions offered another alternative to assess the performance of these potential biomarkers. Both gene feature selection methods and class prediction algorithms were shown to be important in identifying successful gene classifiers. The genetic algorithm and support vector machine yielded classifiers with the best prediction accuracy, regardless of sample size, nature of class prediction, and data complexity. A chemical stressor significantly altering the expression of a greater number of genes tended to generate gene classifiers with better performance. All combinations of gene feature selection/class prediction algorithms performed similarly well with data of high signal to noise ratio. Gene classifier discovery and application on the basis of individual sampling and sample data pooling, respectively, were found to enhance class predictions. Gene expression profiles of the top gene classifiers, identified from both microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays, displayed greater similarity between fadrozole and 17 beta-trenbolone than either one to 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol. These gene classifiers could serve as potential biomarkers of exposure to specific classes of endocrine disruptors.								18	1	18	0	19	0730-7268		WOS:000253374500022

This rule implicitly partitions space into a red set and a blue set that are separated by a red-blue decision boundary. In this paper we develop output-sensitive algorithms for computing this decision boundary for point sets on the line and in R-2. Both algorithms run in time O(n log k), where k is the number of points that contribute to the decision boundary. This running time is the best possible when parameterizing with respect to n and k.								18	0	1	0	18	0179-5376		WOS:000228502600003

Megavariate analysis (unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis [HCA]; principal components analysis [PCA]) of serum metabolites reproducibly distinguish DR from ad libitum fed rats. Component-based approaches (i.e., PCA) consistently perform as well as or better than distance-based metrics (i.e., HCA). We therefore tested the following: (A) Do identified subsets of serum metabolites contain sufficient information to construct mathematical models of class membership (i.e., expert systems)? (B) Do component-based metrics out-perform distance-based metrics? Testing was conducted using KNN (k-nearest neighbors, supervised HCA) and SIMCA (soft independent modeling of class analogy, supervised PCA). Models were built with single cohorts, combined cohorts or mixed samples from previously studied cohorts as training sets. Both algorithms over-fit models based on single cohort training sets. KNN models had >85% accuracy within training/test sets, but were unstable (i.e., values of k could not be accurately set in advance). SIMCA models had 100% accuracy within all training sets, 89% accuracy in test sets, did not appear to over-fit mixed cohort training sets, and did not require post-hoc modeling adjustments. These data indicate that (i) previously defined metabolites are robust enough to construct classification models (expert systems) with SIMCA that can predict unknowns by dietary category; (ii) component-based analyses outperformed distance-based metrics; (iii) use of over-fitting controls is essential; and (iv) subtle inter-cohort variability may be a critical issue for high data density biomarker studies that lack state markers.								18	3	13	0	22	1536-2310		WOS:000224836700003

A reduced set is obtained which is used instead of the training set when nearest neighbour classification is used. Prototypes are added in an incremental fashion, where at each step of the algorithm, the number of prototypes selected keeps on increasing. The number of patterns in the training data classified correctly also keeps on increasing till all patterns are classified properly. After this, a deletion operator is used where some prototypes which are not so useful are removed. This method has been used to obtain the prototypes for a variety of benchmark data sets and results have been presented. (C) 2001 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The resulting rules are used to improve knowledge base system performance. The second experiment reports on patterns of attribute value combinations occurring for specific classification classes. These patterns can be used to elicit new knowledge in the domain and lead to a form of knowledge discovery. This process is commonly referred to as 'data mining'. The third experiment measures the effect of an additional electromagnetic data layer on the knowledge base system. Again, our efforts yield novel knowledge discovery results from the application of data mining techniques.

RuleNet is a feedforward network model with a supervised learning algorithm, a dynamic architecture and discrete outputs. The main characteristics of RuleNet are its efficient learning and propagation algorithms and the possibility to translate symbolic knowledge into the network and vice versa without loss of information.Fuzzy RuleNet is an extension to RuleNet with Fuzzy Logic. The main application area of this neuro-fuzzy model is fuzzy classification. An important characteristic of Fuzzy RuleNet is the possibility of knowledge transfer into and from the network without loss of information, therefore it can also be used for the generation of fuzzy systems (i.e. fuzzy rules and the corresponding membership functions).RuleNet and Fuzzy RuleNet have been applied to a hierarchic behavior based navigation system for mobile robots. As a first step, a wall following behavior has been implemented utilizing these network models. The achieved results in the simulation environment as well as on a mobile robot experimental platform are very encouraging.

First, the preprocessing components determine the most relevant features for stock market prediction, remove the noise, and separate the remaining patterns into two disjoint sets. Next, the two neural networks predict the market's rate of return, with one network trained to recognize positive and the other negative returns. Finally, the decision rule base takes both return predictions and determines a buy/sell recommendation. Daily and monthly experiments are conducted and performance measured by computing the annual rate of return and the return per trade. Comparison of the results achieved by the dual neural network system to that of the single neural network shows that the dual neural network system gives much larger returns with fewer trades. In addition, dual neural network experiments with the appropriately selected filtering and decision thresholds managed to achieve an almost twice larger annual rate of return when compared to that of the buy and hold strategy over a seventy month period. However, no claims are made that the proposed system is better than the buy and hold strategy when considering transaction costs.								18	0	0	0	18	0925-2312		WOS:A1996UH42800005

In this case the use of pollen data to achieve a correct geographic classification of the honey samples is not necessary.								18	0	14	0	19	0021-8561		WOS:A1993KY52800011

J	Uguz, Harun								A two-stage feature selection method for text categorization by using information gain, principal component analysis and genetic algorithm								KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			24	7			1024	1032		10.1016/j.knosys.2011.04.014			OCT 2011	2011	Text categorization is widely used when organizing documents in a digital form. Due to the increasing number of documents in digital form, automated text categorization has become more promising in the last ten years. A major problem of text categorization is its large number of features. Most of those are irrelevant noise that can mislead the classifier. Therefore, feature selection is often used in text categorization to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space and to improve performance. In this study, two-stage feature selection and feature extraction is used to improve the performance of text categorization. In the first stage, each term within the document is ranked depending on their importance for classification using the information gain (IG) method. In the second stage, genetic algorithm (GA) and principal component analysis (PCA) feature selection and feature extraction methods are applied separately to the terms which are ranked in decreasing order of importance, and a dimension reduction is carried out. Thereby, during text categorization, terms of less importance are ignored, and feature selection and extraction methods are applied to the terms of highest importance; thus, the computational time and complexity of categorization is reduced. To evaluate the effectiveness of dimension reduction methods on our purposed model, experiments are conducted using the k-nearest neighbour (KNN) and C4.5 decision tree algorithm on Reuters-21,578 and Classic3 datasets collection for text categorization. The experimental results show that the proposed model is able to achieve high categorization effectiveness as measured by precision, recall and F-measure. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Although both processes are defined separately, it is possible to apply them simultaneously.This paper proposes an evolutionary model to perform feature and instance selection in nearest neighbor classification. It is based on cooperative coevolution, which has been applied to many computational problems with great success.The proposed approach is compared with a wide range of evolutionary feature and instance selection methods for classification. The results contrasted through non-parametric statistical tests show that our model outperforms previously proposed evolutionary approaches for performing data reduction processes in combination with the nearest neighbor rule.

Here, we introduce a computational approach to address this problem. The new approach is based on AdaBoost method and featured by function group composition to the metabolic pathway analysis, which can fast and automatically map the small chemical molecules back to the possible metabolic pathway that they belong to. As a result, jackknife cross validation test and independent set test on the model reached 73.7% and 73.8%, respectively. It can be concluded that the current approach is very promising for mapping some unknown molecules' possible metabolic pathway.

Assuming independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples, the new estimator is proved to be asymptotically unbiased and mean-square consistent. In experiments with high-dimensional data, the k-NN approach generally exhibits faster convergence than previous algorithms. It is also shown that the speed of convergence of the k-NN method can be further improved by an adaptive choice of k.

Due to its usability and adaptability, k-NN has been Successfully applied to a wide range of applications. However, in practice, one has to set important model parameters only empirically: the number of neighbors (k) and weights to those neighbors. In this paper, we propose structured ways to set these parameters, based on locally linear reconstruction (LLR). We then employed sequential minimal optimization (SMO) for solving quadratic programming step involved in LLR for classification to reduce the computational complexity. Experimental results from 11 classification and eight regression tasks were Promising enough to merit further investigation: not only did LLR Outperform the conventional weight allocation methods without much additional computational cost, but also LLR Was found to be robust to the change of k.

Scattered colorimetry is used to authenticate various types of extra virgin olive oil and beer, while a fiber-optic-based device for UV-VIS-NIR absorption spectroscopy is exploited in order to obtain the hyperspectral optical signature of olive oil. This is done not only for authentication purposes, but also so as to correlate the spectral data with the content of fatty acids, which are important nutritional factors. A micro-optic sensor for the detection of olive oil aroma that is capable of distinguishing different ageing levels of extra virgin olive oil is also presented. It shows effective potential for acting as a smart cap of bottled olive oil in order to achieve a nondestructive olfactory perception of oil ageing.

J	Marchiori, Elena								Hit miss networks with applications to instance selection								JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			9				997	1017					JUN 2008	2008	In supervised learning, a training set consisting of labeled instances is used by a learning algorithm for generating a model (classifier) that is subsequently employed for deciding the class label of new instances (for generalization). Characteristics of the training set, such as presence of noisy instances and size, influence the learning algorithm and affect generalization performance. This paper introduces a new network-based representation of a training set, called hit miss network (HMN), which provides a compact description of the nearest neighbor relation over pairs of instances from each pair of classes. We show that structural properties of HMN's correspond to properties of training points related to the one nearest neighbor (1-NN) decision rule, such as being border or central point. This motivates us to use HMN's for improving the performance of a 1-NN classifier by removing instances from the training set (instance selection). We introduce three new HMN-based algorithms for instance selection. HMN-C, which removes instances without affecting accuracy of 1-NN on the original training set, HMN-E, based on a more aggressive storage reduction, and HMN-EI, which applies iteratively HMN-E. Their performance is assessed on 22 data sets with different characteristics, such as input dimension, cardinality, class balance, number of classes, noise content, and presence of redundant variables. Results of experiments on these data sets show that accuracy of 1-NN classifier increases significantly when HMN-EI is applied. Comparison with state-of-the-art editing algorithms for instance selection on these data sets indicates best generalization performance of HMN-EI and no significant difference in storage requirements. In general, these results indicate that HMN's provide a powerful graph-based representation of a training set, which can be successfully applied for performing noise and redundance reduction in instance-based learning.								17	2	4	0	19	1532-4435		WOS:000258646300002	
J	Bondugula, Rajkumar; Xu, Dong								MUPRED: A tool for bridging the gap between template based methods and sequence profile based methods for protein secondary structure prediction								PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND BIOINFORMATICS			66	3			664	670		10.1002/prot.21177			FEB 15 2007	2007	Predicting secondary structures from a protein sequence is an important step for characterizing the structural properties of a protein. Existing methods for protein secondary structure prediction can be broadly classified into template based or sequence profile based methods. We propose a novel framework that bridges the gap between the two fundamentally different approaches. Our framework integrates the information from the fuzzy k-nearest neighbor algorithm and position-specific scoring matrices using a neural network. It combines the strengths of the two methods and has a better potential to use the information in both the sequence and structure databases than existing methods. We implemented the framework into a software system MUPRED. MUPRED has achieved three-state prediction accuracy (Q(3)) ranging from 79.2 to 80.14%, depending on which benchmark dataset is used. A higher Q(3) can be achieved if a query protein has a significant sequence identity (> 25%) to a template in PDB. MUPRED also estimates the prediction accuracy at the individual residue level more quantitatively than existing methods.

At early stages of discovery programs, purely exploratory methodologies coupled with fast screening tools should be employed. This should lead to opportunities to find unexpected catalytic results and identify the "groups" of catalyst outputs, providing well-defined boundaries for future optimizations. However, very few new papers deal with strategies that guide exploratory studies. Mostly, traditional designs, homogeneous covering, or simple random samplings are exploited. Typical catalytic output distributions exhibit unbalanced datasets for which an efficient learning is hardly carried out, and interesting but rare classes are usually unrecognized. Here is suggested a new iterative algorithm for the characterization of the search space structure, working independently of learning processes. It enhances recognition rates by transferring catalysts to be screened from "performance-stable" space zones to "unsteady" ones which necessitate more experiments to be well-modeled. The evaluation of new algorithm attempts through benchmarks is compulsory due to the lack of past proofs about their efficiency. The method is detailed and thoroughly tested with mathematical functions exhibiting different levels of complexity. The strategy is not only empirically evaluated, the effect or efficiency of sampling on future Machine Learning performances is also quantified. The minimum sample size required by the algorithm for being statistically discriminated from simple random sampling is investigated.								17	0	2	0	17	1520-4766		WOS:000237343900007

The task of this system was to automatically recognize a brand of the product. To analyze the measurement set-up responses various non-parametric classifiers such as k-nearest neighbours, a feedforward neural network and a probabilistic neural network were used. In order to enhance the classification ability of the system, standard model solutions of salts were measured (in order to take into account any variation in time of the working parameters of the sensors). This system was capable of recognizing the brand of the products with accuracy ranging from 68% to 100% (in the case of the best classifier).				8th Optoelectronic and Electronic Sensors Conference	JUN 27-30, 2004		Wroclaw, POLAND	17	1	7	0	18	0957-0233		WOS:000234953600003

A major issue in k-nearest neighbor classification is how to find an optimal value of the neighborhood parameter k. In practice, this value is generally estimated by the method of cross-validation. However, the ideal value of k in a classification problem not only depends on the entire data set, but also on the specific observation to be classified. Instead of using any single value of k, this paper studies results for a finite sequence of classifiers indexed by k. Along with the usual posterior probability estimates, a new measure, called the Bayesian measure of strength, is proposed and investigated in this paper as a measure of evidence for different classes. The results of these classifiers and their corresponding estimated misclassification probabilities are visually displayed using shaded strips. These plots provide an effective visualization of the evidence in favor of different classes when a given data point is to be classified. We also propose a simple weighted averaging technique that aggregates the results of different nearest neighbor classifiers to arrive at the final decision. Based on the analysis of several benchmark data sets, the proposed method is found to be better than using a single value of k.								17	1	0	0	18	0162-8828		WOS:000231086700007	
J	Tsiriga, V; Virvou, M								A framework for the initialization of student models in Web-based intelligent tutoring systems								USER MODELING AND USER-ADAPTED INTERACTION			14	4			289	316		10.1023/B:USER.0000043396.14788.cc			2004	2004	Initializing a student model for individualized tutoring in educational applications is a difficult task, since very little is known about a new student. On the other hand, fast and efficient initialization of the student model is necessary. Otherwise the tutoring system may lose its credibility in the first interactions with the student. In this paper we describe a framework for the initialization of student models in Web-based educational applications. The framework is called ISM. The basic idea of ISM is to set initial values for all aspects of student models using an innovative combination of stereotypes and the distance weighted k-nearest neighbor algorithm. In particular, a student is first assigned to a stereotype category concerning her/ his knowledge level of the domain being taught. Then, the model of the new student is initialized by applying the distance weighted k-nearest neighbor algorithm among the students that belong to the same stereotype category with the new student. ISM has been applied in a language learning system, which has been used as a test-bed. The quality of the student models created using ISM has been evaluated in an experiment involving classroom students and their teachers. The results from this experiment showed that the initialization of student models was improved using the ISM framework.								17	0	1	1	18	0924-1868		WOS:000224158800001

The algorithm patterns by ordered projections (POP), has some interesting characteristics: important reduction of the number of instances from the dataset; lower computational cost (Theta(mn log n)) with respect to other typical algorithms due to the absence of distance calculations; conservation of the decision boundaries, especially from the point of view of the application of axis-parallel classifiers. POP works well in practice with both continuous and discrete attributes. The performance of POP is analysed in two ways: percentage of reduction and classification. POP has been compared to IB2, ENN and SHRINK concerning the percentage of reduction and the computational cost. In addition, we have analysed the accuracy of k-NN and C4.5 after applying the reduction techniques. An extensive empirical study using datasets with continuous and discrete attributes from the UCI repository shows that POP is a valuable preprocessing method for the later application of any axis-parallel learning algorithm.

The basic hypothesis of the work is that the intensity of motion activity of a video segment is a direct indication of its "summarizability," which we experimentally verify using the MPEG-7 [MPEG-7 Visual Committee Draft URL: http.,//www.cselt.it/mpeg/working documents.htm official MPEG site] motion activity descriptor and the fidelity measure proposed in H. S. Chang, S. Sull, and S. U. Lee, "Efficient video indexing scheme for content-based retrieval, " IEEE Trans, Circuits Syst. Video Technol. 9(8), (1999). Note that the compressed domain extraction of motion activity intensity is much simpler than the color-based calculations. We are thus able to quickly identify easy to summarize segments of a video sequence since they have a low intensity of motion activity. We are able to easily summarize these segments by simply choosing their first frames. We can then apply conventional color-based summarization techniques to the remaining segments. We thus speed up color-based summarization by reducing the number of segments processed. Our results also motivate a simple and novel key-frame extraction technique that relies on a motion activity based nonuniform sampling of the frames. Our results indicate that it can either be used by itself or to speed up color-based techniques as explained earlier. (C) 2001 SPIE and IS&T.								17	1	0	0	18	1017-9909		WOS:000172355200008

This paper discusses the qualitative and quantitative performance of several machine learning and statistical methods to discover knowledge patterns in data. The methods are tested and compared on a wastewater treatment data set. The methods used are: induction of decision trees, two different techniques of rule induction and two memory-based learning methods: instance-based learning and case-based learning. All the knowledge patterns discovered by the different methods are compared in terms of predictive accuracy, the number of attributes and examples used, and the meaningful-ness to domain experts.				2nd Workshop on Binding Environmental Science and Artificial Intelligence (BESAI '2000)	2000		BERLIN, GERMANY	17	0	3	0	17	0921-7126		WOS:000168269900006

The influence of these factors can be countered by learning to interpolate between stored views of the target object, taken under representative combinations of viewing conditions. Difficulties of another kind arise in daily life situations that require categorization, rather than recognition, of objects. Although categorization cannot rely on interpolation between stored examples, we show that knowledge of several representative members, or prototypes, of each of the categories of interest can provide the necessary computational substrate for the categorization of new instances. We describe a system that represents input shapes by their similarities to several prototypical objects, and show that it can recognize new views of the familiar objects, discriminate among views of previously unseen shapes, and attribute the latter to familiar categories.								17	0	2	0	17	0920-5691		WOS:000083299800003

The method is based on the estimation of the reliability of each classification act and on the evaluation of the convenience of rejecting the input sample when the reliability is under a threshold, evaluated on the basis of the requirements of the application domain. The adaptability to the given domain represents an original feature since, till now, the problem of defining a reject rule for an MES has not been systematically introduced, and the few existing proposals seldom take into account the requirements of the domain. The met:hod has been widely tested with reference to the recognition of handwritten characters coming from a standard database. The results are also compared with those provided by employing the well-known Chow's rule. (C) 1999 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

A major drawback often associated with neural networks is the difficulty in understanding the knowledge represented by a trained network. This paper describes an approach that can extract symbolic rules from neural networks. We illustrate how the approach successfully extracted rules from a data set collected from a survey of the service sectors in the United Kingdom. The extracted rules were then used to distinguish between organizations using computers from those that do not. The classification scheme based on these rules was used to identify specific segments of a market for promoting adoption of information technology The extracted rules are not only concise but also outperform discriminant analysis in terms of predictive accuracy.

This neural network consists of two types of nodes in the hidden layer. The prototype nodes and exemplar nodes represent cluster centroids and exceptions in the feature space, respectively. This classifier automatically generates and refines prototypes for distinct clusters in the feature space. The number and sizes of these prototypes are not restricted, so the prototypes will form near-optimal decision regions to meet the distribution of input patterns and classify as many input patterns as possible. Next, exemplars will be created and expanded to learn the patterns that cannot be classified by the prototypes. Such a training strategy can reduce the memory requirement and speed up the process of non-linear classification. In addition, on-line learning is supplied in this classifier and the computational load is lightened. The experimental results manifest that this model can reduce the number of hidden nodes by determining the appropriate number of prototype nodes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Diterpenes ale organic compounds of low molecular weight with a skeleton of 20 caibon atoms. They are of significant chemical and commercial interest because of their use as lead compounds in the search for new pharmaceutical effectors. The interpretation of diterpene C-13 NMR spectra normally requires specialists with detailed spectroscopic knowledge and substantial experience in natural products chemistry, specifically knowledge on peak patterns and chemical structures. Given a database of peak patterns for diterpenes with known structure, we apply several ILP approaches to discover correlations between peak patterns and chemical structure. The approaches used include first-order inductive learning, relational instance based learning, induction of logical decision trees, and inductive constraint logic. Performance close to that of domain experts is achieved, which suffices for practical use.								17	1	0	0	18	0883-9514		WOS:000074448200002	
J	Kleinberg, EM								An overtraining-resistant stochastic modeling method for pattern recognition								ANNALS OF STATISTICS			24	6			2319	2349					DEC 1996	1996	We will introduce a generic approach for solving problems in pattern recognition based on the synthesis of accurate multiclass discriminators from large numbers of very inaccurate ''weak'' models through the use of discrete stochastic processes. Contrary to the standard expectation held for the many statistical and heuristic techniques normally associated with the field, a significant feature of this method of ''stochastic modeling'' is its resistance to so-called ''overtraining.'' The drop in performance of any stochastic model in going from training to test data remains comparable to that of the component weak models from which it is synthesized; and since these component models are very simple, their performance drop is small, resulting in a stochastic model whose performance drop is also small despite its high level of accuracy.								17	1	4	0	18	0090-5364		WOS:A1996WK45900002

J	Huang, Tao; Wang, Junjie; Cai, Yu-Dong; Yu, Hanry; Chou, Kuo-Chen				Chou, Kuo-Chen/A-8340-2009				Hepatitis C Virus Network Based Classification of Hepatocellular Cirrhosis and Carcinoma								PLOS ONE			7	4					e34460	10.1371/journal.pone.0034460			APR 6 2012	2012	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a main risk factor for liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, particularly to those patients with chronic liver disease or injury. The similar etiology leads to a high correlation of the patients suffering from the disease of liver cirrhosis with those suffering from the disease of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the biological mechanism for the relationship between these two kinds of diseases is not clear. The present study was initiated in an attempt to investigate into the HCV infection protein network, in hopes to find good biomarkers for diagnosing the two diseases as well as gain insights into their progression mechanisms. To realize this, two potential biomarker pools were defined: (i) the target genes of HCV, and (ii) the between genes on the shortest paths among the target genes of HCV. Meanwhile, a predictor was developed for identifying the liver tissue samples among the following three categories: (i) normal, (ii) cirrhosis, and (iii) hepatocellular carcinoma. Interestingly, it was observed that the identification accuracy was higher with the tissue samples defined by extracting the features from the second biomarker pool than that with the samples defined based on the first biomarker pool. The identification accuracy by the jackknife validation for the between-genes approach was 0.960, indicating that the novel approach holds a quite promising potential in helping find effective biomarkers for diagnosing the liver cirrhosis disease and the hepatocellular carcinoma disease. It may also provide useful insights for in-depth study of the biological mechanisms of HCV-induced cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.								16	0	15	0	16	1932-6203		WOS:000305012700034

DATA MINING AND MACHINE LEARNING IN ASTRONOMY								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS D			19	7			1049	1106		10.1142/S0218271810017160			JUL 2010	2010	We review the current state of data mining and machine learning in astronomy. Data Mining can have a somewhat mixed connotation from the point of view of a researcher in this field. If used correctly, it can be a powerful approach, holding the potential to fully exploit the exponentially increasing amount of available data, promising great scientific advance. However, if misused, it can be little more than the black box application of complex computing algorithms that may give little physical insight, and provide questionable results. Here, we give an overview of the entire data mining process, from data collection through to the interpretation of results. We cover common machine learning algorithms, such as artificial neural networks and support vector machines, applications from a broad range of astronomy, emphasizing those in which data mining techniques directly contributed to improving science, and important current and future directions, including probability density functions, parallel algorithms, Peta-Scale computing, and the time domain. We conclude that, so long as one carefully selects an appropriate algorithm and is guided by the astronomical problem at hand, data mining can be very much the powerful tool, and not the questionable black box.								16	3	1	0	17	0218-2718		WOS:000280500600001

J	Perez, Aritz; Larranaga, Pedro; Inza, Inaki				Larranaga, Pedro/F-9293-2013				Supervised classification with conditional Gaussian networks: Increasing the structure complexity from naive Bayes								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			43	1			1	25		10.1016/j.ijar.2006.01.002			SEP 2006	2006	Most of the Bayesian network-based classifiers are usually only able to handle discrete variables. However, most real-world domains involve continuous variables. A common practice to deal with continuous variables is to discretize them, with a subsequent loss of information. This work shows how discrete classifier induction algorithms can be adapted to the conditional Gaussian network paradigm to deal with continuous variables without discretizing them. In addition, three novel classifier induction algorithms and two new propositions about mutual information are introduced. The classifier induction algorithms presented are ordered and grouped according to their structural complexity: naive Bayes, tree augmented naive Bayes, k-dependence Bayesian classifiers and semi naive Bayes. All the classifier induction algorithms are empirically evaluated using predictive accuracy, and they are compared to linear discriminant analysis, as a continuous classic statistical benchmark classifier. Besides, the accuracies for a set of state-of-the-art classifiers are included in order to justify the use of linear discriminant analysis as the benchmark algorithm. In order to understand the behavior of the conditional Gaussian network-based classifiers better, the results include bias-variance decomposition of the expected misclassification rate. The study suggests that semi naive Bayes structure based classifiers and, especially, the novel wrapper condensed semi naive Bayes backward, outperform the behavior of the rest of the presented classifiers. They also obtain quite competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms included. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.								16	1	2	0	17	0888-613X		WOS:000240181200001	
J	Sinha, SK; Fieguth, PW								Neuro-fuzzy network for the classification of buried pipe defects								AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			15	1			73	83		10.1016/j.autcon.2005.02.005			JAN 2006	2006	Pipeline infrastructure is decaying at an accelerating rate due to reduced funding and insufficient quality control resulting in poor installation, little or no inspection and maintenance, and a general lack of uniformity and improvement in design, construction and operation practices. The current practice that is being followed to inspect the conditions of pipes is usually time consuming, tedious and expensive. It may also lead to diagnostic errors due to lack of concentration of human operators. Buried pipe defect classification is thus a practical and important pattern classification problem. These defects appear in the form of randomly shaped cracks and holes, broken joints and laterals, and others. This paper proposes a new neuro-fuzzy classifier that combines neural networks and concepts of fuzzy logic for the classification of defects by extracting features in segmented buried pipe images. A comparative evaluation of the K-NN, fuzzy K-NN, conventional backpropagation network, and proposed neuro-fuzzy projection network classifiers is carried out. Among the five neural methods implemented and tested, the proposed neuro-fuzzy classifier performs the best, with classification accuracies around 90% on real concrete pipe images.

J	Wang, M; Chen, S								Enhanced FMAM based on empirical kernel map								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			16	3			557	564		10.1109/TNN.2005.847839			MAY 2005	2005	The existing morphological auto-associative memory models based on the morphological operations, typically including morphological auto-associative memories (auto-MAM) proposed by Ritter et al. and our fuzzy morphological auto-associative memories (auto-FMAM), have many attractive advantages such as unlimited storage capacity, one-shot recall speed and good noise-tolerance to single erosive or dilative noise. However, they suffer from the extreme vulnerability to noise of mixing erosion and dilation, resulting in great degradation on recall performance. To overcome this shortcoming, we focus on FMAM and propose an enhance FMAM (EFMAM) based on the empirical kernel map. Although it is simple, EFMAM can significantly improve the auto-FMAM with respect to the recognition accuracy under hybrid-noise and computational effort. Experiments conducted on the thumbnail-sized faces (28 x 23 and 14 x 11) scaled from the ORL database show the average accuracies of 92%, 90%, and 88% with 40 classes under 10%, 20%, and 30% randomly generated hybrid-noises, respectively, which are far higher than the auto-FMAM (67%, 46%, 31%) under the same noise levels.								16	4	0	0	20	1045-9227		WOS:000228909900005	
J	Lee, C; Lee, J; Lee, C								Korean adult male voxel model KORMAN segmented from magnetic resonance images								MEDICAL PHYSICS			31	5			1017	1022		10.1118/1.1689013			MAY 2004	2004	A voxel model of Korean adult male, KORMAN, was developed by processing whole-body magnetic resonance (MR) images of a healthy volunteer who represents an approximately average Korean in height and weight. Layer by layer the MR images were semi-automatically segmented and indexed using a graphic software and digitizer to construct data arrays consisting of 250 X 120 X 170 voxels of a size of 2 X 2 X 10 mm(3). To assess the utility of the model, some illustrative dosimetric calculations were made to obtain organ absorbed doses and effective doses to the KORMAN placed in broad parallel photon fields with energies ranging from 0.05 to 10 MeV. The results were compared with those based on the medical internal radiation dose (MIRD)-type models given in ICRP74. The effective doses of ICRP74 were higher than those of KORMAN with percent differences ranging from 6% (LLAT, 10 MeV) to 30% (PA, 0.05 MeV). Significant differences of more than 40% were observed in organ absorbed doses for some organs including bone surface (AP), stomach (PA), and testes (LAT) for low photon energy. These are mainly caused by difference in trunk thickness between MIRD-type model and KORMAN, and differences in organ positions in the body.

Every photon and electron emitted was followed in detail, event by event, down to 10 eV. From the spatial information on the track structures, absorbed dose distributions per I-131 and I-121 decay were calculated in and around water spheres simulating micrometastases as well as in the tissue surrounding such metastases. These radionuclides were assumed to be distributed uniformly inside spheres of different diameters (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 nun). The respective electron degradation spectra, the nearest-neighbor distance distributions between inelastic events, and the distance distributions for all activations for both iodine radionuclides were calculated. The absorbed fractions of the initial electron energies, absorbed doses and energy depositions, and single-event distributions, F-1(epsilon), inside the six water spheres described above and in the surrounding tissue were also calculated. The absorbed doses per decay inside the six water spheres, i.e., the calculated S values (listed from 0.01 to 3.0 nun), were 6.8 x 10(-4), 7.2 x 10(-5), 5.5 x 10(-6), 4.9 x 10(-7), 3.1 x 10(-8) and 1.8 x 10(-9) Gy Bq(-1) s(-1) for I-131, and 3.4 x 10(-3), 1.7 x 10(-4), 5.1 x 10(-6), 2.0 x 10(-1), 5.6 x 10(-9) and 2.2 x 10(-11) Gy Bq(-1) s(-1) for I-125. It is concluded that in the treatment of thyroid cancer, the geometrical track structure properties of I-125 might be superior to those of I-131 in micrometastases with diameters less than 0.1 nun; however, in this medical context, many other factors also have to be considered.

SILVA FENNICA			35	3			309	328					2001	2001	A multi-source forest inventory method is applied to the estimation of forest resources in the area of the Hebei Forest Bureau in Heilongjiang province in North-East China. A stratified systematic cluster sampling design was utilised in field measurements. The design was constructed on the basis of information from earlier stand-level inventories, aerial orthophotographs, experiences from other sampling inventories and the available budget. Sample tree volumes were estimated by means of existing models. New models were constructed and their parameters estimated for tallied tree volumes and volume increments. The estimates for the area of the Bureau were computed from field measurements. and for the areas of the forest farms estimated from field measurements and satellite images. A k-nearest neighbour method was utilised. This method employing satellite image data makes it possible to estimate all variables, particularly for smaller areas than that possible using field measurements only. The methods presented, or their modifications, could also be applied to the planning and realisation of forest inventories elsewhere in Temperate or Boreal zones. The inventory in question gave an estimate of 114 m(3)/ha (the multi-source inventory 119 m(3)/ha) instead of 72 m(3)/ha as previously estimated from available information. Totally nineteen tree species, genera of species or tree species groups were identified (Appendix 1). The forests were relatively young, 60% of them younger than 40 years and 85% younger than 60 years.								16	0	14	0	18	0037-5330		WOS:000171581900005

Performance addresses the generalization capability of a learning machine on randomly chosen samples that are not included in a training set. Efficiency deals with the complexity of a learning machine in both space and time. As these two issues are general to various learning machines nod learning approaches, we focus on a special type of adaptive learning systems with a neural architecture. We discuss four types of learning approaches. training all individual model; combinations of several well-trained models; combinations of many weak models; and evolutionary computation of models. We explore advantages and weaknesses of each approach and their inter relations, and we pose open questions for possible future research.								16	1	0	0	17	0018-9219		WOS:000082176700006

The number of samples misclassified N-m is evaluated. The minimum of N-m in the the NN rule proposed is found to be nearly equal to or less than those in the k-NN, distance-weighted k-NN and fuzzy k-NN rules.

This paper illustrates an implementation of a global system for mobile communications (GSM) receiver in which channel equalization and demodulation are realized by means of the nearest neighbor (NN) classifier algorithm. The most important advantage in using such techniques is the significant reduction in terms of computational complexity compared with the maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) equalizer. The proposed approach involves symbol-by-symbol interpretation and the knowledge of the channel is embedded in the mapping process of the received symbols over the symbols of the training sequence. This means that no explicit channel estimation need be carried out, either with correlative blocks or using neural networks thus speeding up the entire process. The performance of the proposed receiver, evaluated through a channel simulator for mobile radio communications, is compared with the results obtained by means of a 16-state Viterbi algorithm and other suboptimal receivers. It is shown that the presented algorithm increases the bit error rate (BER) compared with the MLSE demodulator, but the performance degradation, despite the simplicity of the receiver, is kept within the limits imposed by the GSM specifications.								16	0	0	0	16	0733-8716		WOS:000078004600005

Since certain attributes are more discriminative, while others can be less or totally irrelevant, attributes should be weighed differently in the distance function. Most previous studies on weight setting for NN learning algorithms are empirical. In this paper we describe our attempt on deciding theoretically optimal weights that minimize the predictive error for NN algorithms. Assuming a uniform distribution of examples in a 2-d continuous space, we first derive the average predictive error introduced by a linear classification boundary, and then determine the optimal weight setting for any polygonal classification region. Our theoretical results of optimal attribute weights can serve as a baseline or lower bound for comparing other empirical weight setting methods.								16	0	1	0	16	0269-2821		WOS:A1997XE77700010

These low-dimensional features facilitate in situ decision-making in diverse applications, such as computer vision, structural health monitoring, and robotics. Wavelet transforms of time series have been widely used for feature extraction owing to their time-frequency localization properties. In this regard, this paper presents a symbolic dynamics-based method to model surface images, generated by wavelet coefficients in the scale-shift space. These symbolic dynamics-based models (e.g., probabilistic finite state automata (PFSA)) capture the relevant information, embedded in the sensor data, from the associated Perron-Frobenius operators (i.e., the state-transition probability matrices). The proposed method of pattern classification has been experimentally validated on laboratory apparatuses for two different applications: (i) early detection of evolving damage in polycrystalline alloy structures, and (ii) classification of mobile robots and their motion profiles.

Its simplest version has several drawbacks, such as low efficiency, high storage requirements and sensitivity to noise. Data reduction techniques have been used to alleviate these shortcomings. Among them, prototype selection and generation techniques have been shown to be very effective. Positioning adjustment of prototypes is a successful trend within the prototype generation methodology.Evolutionary algorithms are adaptive methods based on natural evolution that may be used for searching and optimization. Positioning adjustment of prototypes can be viewed as an optimization problem, thus it can be solved using evolutionary algorithms. This paper proposes a differential evolution based approach for optimizing the positioning of prototypes. Specifically, we provide a complete study of the performance of four recent advances in differential evolution. Furthermore, we show the good synergy obtained by the combination of a prototype selection stage with an optimization of the positioning of prototypes previous to nearest neighbor classification. The results are contrasted with non-parametrical statistical tests and show that our proposals outperform previously proposed methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Alippi, Cesare; Roveri, Manuel								Just-in-Time Adaptive Classifiers-Part II: Designing the Classifier								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			19	12			2053	2064		10.1109/TNN.2008.2003998			DEC 2008	2008	Aging effects, environmental changes, thermal drifts, and soft and hard faults affect physical systems by changing their nature and behavior over time. To cope with a process evolution adaptive solutions must be envisaged to track its dynamics; in this direction, adaptive classifiers are generally designed by assuming the stationary hypothesis for the process generating the data with very few results addressing nonstationary environments. This paper proposes a methodology based on k-nearest neighbor (NN) classifiers for designing adaptive classification systems able to react to changing conditions just-in-time (JIT), i.e., exactly when it is needed. k-NN classifiers have been selected for their computational-free training phase, the possibility to easily estimate the model complexity k and keep under control the computational complexity of the classifier through suitable data reduction mechanisms. A JIT classifier requires a temporal detection of a (possible) process deviation (aspect tackled in a companion paper) followed by an adaptive management of the knowledge base (KB) of the classifier to cope with the process change. The novelty of the proposed approach resides in the general framework supporting the real-time update of the KB of the classification system in response to novel information coming from the process both in stationary conditions (accuracy improvement) and in nonstationary ones (process tracking) and in providing a suitable estimate of k. It is shown that the classification system grants consistency once the change targets the process generating the data in a new stationary state, as it is the case in many real applications.								15	1	1	0	16	1045-9227		WOS:000261544900006	
J	Sun, Tingkai; Chen, Songcan								Class label versus sample label-based CCA								APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION			185	1			272	283		10.1016/j.amc.2006.06.103			FEB 1 2007	2007	When correlating the samples with the corresponding class labels, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) can be used for supervised feature extraction and subsequent classification. Intuitively, different encoding modes for class label can result in different classification performances. However, actually, when the samples in each class share a common class label as in usual cases, a unified formulation of CCA is not only derived naturally, but also more importantly from it, we can get some insight into the shortcoming of the existing feature extraction using CCA for sequent classification: the existing encodings for class label fail to reflect the difference among the samples such as in central region of class and those in mixture overlapping region among classes, consequently resulting in its equivalence to the traditional linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for some commonly-used class-label encodings. To reflect such a difference between the samples, we elaborately design an independent soft label for each sample of each class rather than a common label for all the samples of the same class. A purpose of doing so is to try to promote CCA classification performance.

J	Ghosh, AK; Chaudhuri, P; Sengupta, D								Classification using kernel density estimates: Multiscale analysis and visualization								TECHNOMETRICS			48	1			120	132		10.1198/004017005000000391			FEB 2006	2006	The use of kernel density estimates in discriminant analysis is quite well known among scientists and engineers interested in statistical pattern recognition. Using a kernel density estimate involves properly selecting the scale of smoothing, namely the bandwidth parameter. The bandwidth that is optimum for the mean integrated square error of a class density estimator may riot always be good for discriminant analysis, where the main emphasis is on the minimization of misclassification rates. On the other hand,, cross-validation-based methods for bandwidth selection, which try to minimize estimated misclassification rates, may require huge computation when there are several competing populations. Besides, such methods usually allow only one bandwidth for each Population density estimate, whereas in a classification problem, the Optimum bandwidth for a class density estimate may vary significantly, depending on its competing class densities and their prior probabilities. Therefore, in a multiclass problem, it would be more meaningful to have different bandwidths for a class density when it is compared with different competing class densities. Moreover, good choice of bandwidths should also depend on the specific observation to be classified. Consequently, instead of concentrating on a single optimum bandwidth for each population density estimate. it is more useful in practice to look at the results for different scales of smoothing for the kernel density estimates. This article presents such a multiscale approach along with a graphical device leading to a more informative discriminant analysis than the usual approach based on a single optimum scale of smoothing for each class density estimate. When there are more than two competing classes, this method splits the problem into a number of two-class problems, which allows the flexibility of using different bandwidths for different pairs of competing classes and at the same time reduces the computational burden that one faces for usual cross-validation-based bandwidth selection in the presence of several competing populations. We present some benchmark examples to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed methodology.								15	0	0	0	15	0040-1706		WOS:000235129800012

The system measures the colour of the food product as it cooks by examining the reflected visible light from the surface as well as in the core of the product. Accurate classification has been previously obtained using a multi layer perceptron (MLP) with a backpropagation learning algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA) as a method of feature extraction but the k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) method is investigated in order to simplify the classification techniques, especially since principal component analysis already generates disjoint clusters. Two products are used to illustrate the principal of the method of this investigation, namely minced beef burgers and pastry although it is equally applicable to many other food products. In this investigation experimentally obtained spectral data was taken from the surface of the food and then analysed allowing direct comparison of the two classification methods. Results show that although the neural network proved superior when the input spectra deviated slightly in shape from the spectra used in training, the k-NN classifier may have prove advantageous in applications where there is less deviation in the sampled product spectrum.

This procedure is based on a fuzzy scoring function for choosing a subset of prototypes, which represent the closest resemblance with an object to be assigned. It then applies the majority-voting rule to assign an object to a class. We also present a medical application of this procedure as an aid to assist the diagnosis of central nervous system tumours. The results are compared with those obtained by other classification methods, reported on the same data set, including decision tree, production rules, neural network, k nearest neighbor, multilayer perceptron and logistic regression. Our results are very encouraging and show that the multicriteria decision analysis approach can be successfully used to help medical diagnosis. Crown Copyright (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

We have evaluated two computer-assisted techniques: MSA multispectral automatic technique that is based on bayesian classification of brain tissue and NIH image analysis technique that is based on local (lesion by lesion) thresholding, to establish reliability and repeatability values for each technique. Brain MRIs were obtained for 30 clinically definite relapsing-remitting MS patients using a 2.0 Tesla MR scanner with contiguous, 3 mm thick axial, T1, T2 and PD weighted modalities. Digital (Dicom 3) images were analyzed independently by three observers; each analyzed the images twice, using the two different techniques (Total 360 analyses). Accuracy of lesion load measurements using phantom images of known volumes showed significantly better results for the MSA multispectral technique (p < 0.001). The mean intra-and inter-observer variances were, respectively, 0.04 +/- 0.4 (range 0.04-0.13), and 0.09 +/- 0.6 (range 0.01-0.26) for the multispectral MSA analysis technique, 0.24 +/- 2.27 (range 0.23-0.72) and 0.33 +/- 3.8 (range 0.47-1.36) for the NIH threshold technique. These data show that the MSA multispectral technique is significantly more accurate in lesion volume measurements, with better results of within and between observers' assessments, and the lesion load measurements are not influenced by increased disease burden. Measurements by the MSA multispectral technique were also faster and decreased analysis time by 43%. The MSA multispectral technique is a promising tool for evaluating MS patients. Non-biased recognition and delineation algorithms enable high accuracy, low intra-and inter-observer variances and fast assessment of MS related lesion load. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

High-resolution MRI was performed in 5 normal individuals, in 12 patients with brain multiple sclerosis (MS), and 9 patients with malignant brain tumors. Three inputs (proton-density, TB-weighted fast spin-echo, and T1-weighted spin-echo MR images) were routinely utilized. As a fourth input, either magnetization transfer MRT was used or T1-weighted post-contrast MRI tin patients only). A modified k-nearest neighbor segmentation algorithm was optimized for maximum computation speed and highquality segmentation. In that regard, we a) discarded the redundant seed points; b) discarded the points within 0.5 standard deviation from the cluster center that were nonoverlapping with other tissue; and c) removed outlying seed points outside 5 times the standard deviation from the cluster center of each tissue class. After segmentation, a stack of color-coded segmented images was created. Our new technique utilizing all four MRI Inputs provided better segmentation than that based on three inputs (P < 0.001 for FAS and P < 0.001 for tumors). The tissues were smoother due to the reduction of statistical noise, and the delineation of the tissues became sharper. Details that were previously blurred or invisible now became apparent. In normal persons a detailed depiction of deep gray matter nuclei was obtained, In malignant tumors, up to five abnormal tissue types were identified: 1) solid tumor core, 2) cyst, 3) edema In white matter 4) edema in gray matter, and 5) necrosis. Delineation of MS plaque in different stages of demyelination became much sharper. In conclusion, the proposed methodology warrants further development and clinical evaluation, (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.								15	0	4	0	15	1053-1807		WOS:000080867000003

Examples of early LFERs and ETRs include the Bronsted, Hammett, Taft, and Hansch relationships.Much of the early development of chemometrics derives from this equivalence. Thus, the interpretation and derivation of LFERs and ETRs as the first terms of serial expansions of perturbation theory applied to moderate structural change lead first to the SIMCA method for classification and discriminant analysis (pattern recognition), then to the approach of principal properties for the characterization of structural fragments, compounds, and materials, and finally also strongly influenced the development of PLS and its use in structure-effect relationships such as quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs).The interpretation of chemical data by a combination of physical organic chemistry models and chemometric principles often leads to interesting conclusions as illustrated by some examples.								15	0	8	0	15	0904-213X		WOS:000073417200001

When a labeled VQ is adopted as a classifier, we have to design it in such a way that high classification performance is obtained by a given number of code vectors, In this paper we propose a learning algorithm which optimizes the position of labeled code vectors in the observation space under the minimum average misclassification risk criterion.								15	0	0	0	15	1045-9227		WOS:000071490200016	
J	Weng, J; Ahuja, N; Huang, TS								Learning recognition and segmentation using the Cresceptron								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER VISION			25	2			109	143		10.1023/A:1007967800668			NOV 1997	1997	This paper presents a framework called Cresceptron for view-based learning, recognition and segmentation. Specifically, it recognizes and segments image patterns that are similar to those learned, using a stochastic distortion model and view-based interpolation, allowing other view points that are moderately different from those used in learning. The learning phase is interactive. The user trains the system using a collection of training images. For each training image, the user manually draws a polygon outlining the region of interest and types in the label of its class. Then, from the directional edges of each of the segmented regions, the Cresceptron uses a hierarchical self-organization scheme to grow a sparsely connected network automatically, adaptively and incrementally during the learning phase. At each level, the system detects new image structures that need to be learned and assigns a new neural plane for each new feature. The network grows by creating new nodes and connections which memorize the new image structures and their context as they are detected. Thus, the structure of the network is a function of the training exemplars. The Cresceptron incorporates both individual learning and class learning; with the former, each training example is treated as a different individual while with the latter, each example is a sample of a class. In the performance phase, segmentation and recognition are tightly coupled. No foreground extraction is necessary, which is achieved by backtracking the response of the network down the hierarchy to the image parts contributing to recognition. Several stochastic shape distortion models are analyzed to show why multilevel matching such as that in the Cresceptron can deal with more general stochastic distortions that a single-level matching scheme cannot. The system is demonstrated using images from broadcast television and other video segments to learn faces and other objects, and then later to locate and to recognize similar, but possibly distorted, views of the same objects.								15	0	0	0	15	0920-5691		WOS:A1997YG83600002

We apply this model using the nearest-neighbor learning algorithm, and develop upper and lower bounds on sample complexity for several different concept classes. For some concept classes, the sample complexity turns out to be exponential even using this best-case model, which implies that the concept class is inherently difficult for the NN algorithm. We identify several geometric properties that make learning certain concepts relatively easy. Finally we discuss the relation of our work to helpful teacher models, its application to decision tree learning algorithms, and some of its implications for current experimental work.								15	0	0	0	15	0162-8828		WOS:A1995QZ94000005

An exact integral expression is derived for the m-sample risk R(m) given that a reference m-sample of labeled points is available to the classifier. The statistical setup assumes that the pattern classes arise in nature with fixed a priori probabilities and that points representing the classes are drawn from Euclidean n-space according to fixed class-conditional probability distributions. The sample is assumed to consist of m independently generated class-labeled points. For a family of smooth class-conditional distributions characterized by asymptotic expansions in general form, it is shown that the m-sample risk R(m) has a complete asymptotic series expansion[GRAPHICS]where R(infinity) denotes the nearest neighbor risk in the infinite-sample limit and the coefficients c(k) are distribution-dependent constants independent of the sample size m. This analysis thus provides further analytic validation of Bellman's curse of dimensionality. Numerical simulations corroborating the formal results are included, and extensions of the theory discussed. The analysis also contains a novel application of Laplace's asymptotic method of integration to a multidimensional integral where the integrand attains its maximum on a continuum of points.								15	0	0	0	15	0018-9448		WOS:A1994PA61100019

EMG signals were superficially recorded by eight pairs of electrodes from the stumps of five transradial amputees and forearms of five able-bodied participants and used online to control a robot hand. Seven finger movements (not involving the wrist) were investigated in this study. The first objective was to understand whether and to which extent it is possible to control continuously and in real-time, the finger postures of a prosthetic hand, using superficial EMG, and a practical classifier, also taking advantage of the direct visual feedback of the moving hand. The second objective was to calculate statistical differences in the performance between participants and groups, thereby assessing the general applicability of the proposed method. The average accuracy of the classifier was 79% for amputees and 89% for able-bodied participants. Statistical analysis of the data revealed a difference in control accuracy based on the aetiology of amputation, type of prostheses regularly used and also between able-bodied participants and amputees. These results are encouraging for the development of noninvasive EMG interfaces for the control of dexterous prostheses.								14	0	2	0	14	1534-4320		WOS:000291403500005

Specifically, the class conditional nearest neighbor (ccnn) relation over pairs of points in a labeled training set is introduced. For a given class label c, this relation associates to each point a its nearest neighbor computed among only those points with class label c (excluded a). A characterization of ccnn in terms of two graphs is given. These graphs are used for defining a novel scoring function over instances by means of an information-theoretic divergence measure applied to the degree distributions of these graphs. The scoring function is employed to develop an effective large margin instance selection method, which is empirically demonstrated to improve storage and accuracy performance of the 1NN rule on artificial and real-life data sets.								14	4	4	0	18	0162-8828		WOS:000272741500013

Accordingly, this paper presents a novel evolving neuro-fuzzy DSS, the generic self-organizing fuzzy neural network realizing Yager inference (GenSoFNN-Yager), that emulates the sequential learning paradigm of the hippocampus in the brain to synthesize from low-level numerical data to high-level declarative fuzzy rules. The proposed system exhibits simple and conceptually firm computational steps that correspond closely to a plausible human logical reasoning and decision-making. Experimental results on sample benchmark problems and realistic medical diagnosis applications show the potential of the proposed system as a competent DSS. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A possible approach to combine past observations of X and Y with the current values of X to generate an assessment of Y is similarity-weighted averaging. It suggests that the predicted value of Y, (Y) over bar (s)(p), be the weighted average of all previously P observed values Y-i, where the weight of Y-i for every i = 1,..., n, is the similarity between the vector X-p(1),....,X-p(m), associated with Y-p, and the previously observed vector, X-i(l),..., X-m(i). We axiomatize this rule. We assume that, given every database, a predictor has a ranking over possible values, and we show that certain reasonable conditions on these rankings imply that they are determined by the proximity to a similarity-weighted average for a certain similarity function. The axiontatization does not suggest a particular similarity function, or even a particular form of this function. We therefore proceed to suggest that the similarity function be estimated from past observations. We develop tools of statistical inference for parametric estimation of the similarity function, for the case of a continuous as well as a discrete variable. Finally, we discuss the relationship of the proposed method to other methods of estimation and prediction.								14	0	0	0	14	0034-6535		WOS:000241330600002

We propose and explore the behavior of a learning algorithm that uses linear interpolation and the principle of maximum entropy (LIME). We consider some theoretical properties of the LIME algorithm: LIME weights have exponential form; the estimates are consistent; and the estimates are robust to additive noise. In relation to bias reduction, we show that near-neighbors contain a test point in their convex hull asymptotically. The common linear interpolation solution used for regression on grids or look-up-tables is shown to solve a related maximum entropy problem. LIME simulation results support use of the method, and performance on a pipeline integrity classification problem demonstrates that the proposed algorithm has practical value.								14	1	0	0	15	0162-8828		WOS:000235885700008	
J	Podsiadlo, P; Stachowiak, GW								Fractal-wavelet based classification of tribological surfaces								WEAR			254	11			1189	1198		10.1016/S0043-1648(03)00333-8			OCT 2003	2003	Classification of the topography of freshly machined, worn and damaged surfaces (e.g. damaged by adhesion, scoring, abrasion, pitting) is still a problem in machine failure analysis. Tribological surfaces often exhibit both a multiscale nature (i.e. different length scales of surface features) and a non-stationary nature (i.e. features which are superimposed on each other and located at different positions on a surface). The most widely used approaches to surface classification are based on the Fourier transform or statistical functions and parameters. Often these approaches are inadequate and provide incorrect classification of the tribological surfaces. The main reason is that these techniques fail to simultaneously capture the multiscale nature and the non-stationary nature of the surface data. A new method, called a hybrid fractal-wavelet method, has recently been developed for the characterization of tribological surfaces in a multiscale and non-stationary manner. In contrast to other methods, this method combines both the wavelets' inherent ability to characterize surfaces at each individual scale and the fractals' inherent ability to characterize surfaces in a scale-invariant manner. The application of this method to the classification of artificially generated fractal and tribological surfaces (e.g. worn surfaces) is presented in this paper. The newly developed method has been further modified to better suit tribological surface data, including a new measure of differences between initial and decoded images. The accuracy of this method in the classification of surfaces was assessed.

The leukocyte-vessel wall interactions are studied in post capillary vessels by intraviral video microscopy during in vivo animal experiments. Sequences of video images are obtained and digitized with a frame grabber. A method for automatic detection and characterization of leukocytes in the video images is developed. Individual leukocytes are detected using a neural network that is trained with synthetic leukocyte images generated using a novel stochastic model. This model makes it feasible to generate images of leukocytes with different shapes and sizes under various lighting conditions. Experiments indicate that neural networks trained with the synthetic leukocyte images perform better than networks trained with images of manually detected leukocytes. The best performing neural network trained with synthetic leukocyte images resulted in an 18% larger area under the ROC curve than the best performing neural network trained with manually detected leukocytes.								14	1	4	0	15	0018-9294		WOS:000087793800014	
J	Ng, HT; Zelle, J								Corpus-based approaches to semantic interpretation in natural language processing								AI MAGAZINE			18	4			45	64					WIN 1997	1997	In recent years, there has been a flurry of research into empirical, corpus-based learning approaches to natural language processing (NLP). Most empirical NLP work to date has focused on relatively low-level language processing such as part-of-speech lagging, text segmentation, and syntactic parsing. The success of these approaches has stimulated research in using empirical learning techniques in other facets of NLP, including semantic analysis-uncovering the meaning of an utterance. This article is an introduction to some of the emerging research in the application of corpus-based learning techniques to problems in semantic interpretation. In particular, we focus on two important problems in semantic interpretation, namely, word-sense disambiguation and semantic parsing.								14	0	0	0	14	0738-4602		WOS:000071153200006

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) techniques were employed. Physicochemical properties such as log P, molecular volume, atomic charge and quantum chemical parameters were calculated for a group of synthetic substances for which the biological activities against leishmaniasis are known. Only about half a dozen out of more than twenty parameters were found to be efficient for the classification of the compounds into active and inactive groups.								14	0	2	1	14	0166-1280		WOS:A1995RU76500016

In many practical situations there may be errors among the labels of the training sequence, that is, "the teacher may sometimes lie". In this paper we investigate the behavior of two widely used methods in this situation under very general conditions. One of these methods is based on the maximization of the estimated a posteriori probabilities, the other is the nearest neighbor classification.								14	0	2	0	14	0031-3203		WOS:A1992GY73600007

Previous studies either have not justified their choice in sequence distance used to bin small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene sequences amplified from environmental samples into OTUs, or have used a value based on the average across a broad sampling of microbial eukaryotes. Here, we analyse distances (320 922 pairwise comparisons) among sequences just from identified ciliates, and compare these with their taxonomic hierarchy. Our results show that no single sequence similarity value can always and unambiguously delineate species boundaries and higher taxa. Nevertheless, we suggest the use of 98% similarity to delineate ciliate OTUs because this threshold at least accounts for intra-specific polymorphism among multiple rRNA cistron copies. However, we suggest refraining from reconciling SSU rRNA gene-based OTUs and ciliate morphotypes; these OTUs should be used to analyse ciliate phylotype diversity, not ciliate species diversity.								13	0	13	0	13	1758-2229		WOS:000288503400002	
J	Bellifemine, Fabio; Fortino, Giancarlo; Giannantonio, Roberta; Gravina, Raffaele; Guerrieri, Antonio; Sgroi, Marco								SPINE: A domain-specific framework for rapid prototyping of WBSN applications								SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE			41	3			237	265		10.1002/spe.998			MAR 2011	2011	Wireless body sensor networks (WBSNs) enable a broad range of applications for continuous and real-time health monitoring and medical assistance. Programming WBSN applications is a complex task especially due to the limitation of resources of typical hardware platforms and to the lack of suitable software abstractions. In this paper, SPINE (signal processing in-node environment), a domain-specific framework for rapid prototyping of WBSN applications, which is lightweight and flexible enough to be easily customized to fit particular application-specific needs, is presented. The architecture of SPINE has two main components: one implemented on the node coordinating the WBSN and one on the nodes with sensors. The former is based on a Java application, which allows to configure and manage the network and implements the classification functions that are too heavy to be implemented on the sensor nodes. The latter supports sensing, computing and data transmission operations through a set of libraries, protocols and utility functions that are currently implemented for TinyOS platforms. SPINE allows evaluating different architectural choices and deciding how to distribute signal processing and classification functions over the nodes of the network. Finally, this paper describes an activity monitoring application and presents the benefits of using the SPINE framework.

An observation Xi is said to be a layered nearest neighbour (LNN) of a point x if the hyperrectangle defined by x and Xi contains no other data points. We first establish consistency results on L(x), the number of LNN of x. Then, given a sample (X, Y), (X(1), Y(1)),, (X(n), Y(n)) of independent identically distributed random vectors from Rd x R, one may estimate the regression function r(x) = E[Y] X = x by the LNN estimate r(n)(x), defined as an average over the Y's corresponding to those X, which are LNN of x. Under mild conditions on r, we establish the consistency of El r (x) r(x) towards 0 as n -> infinity, for almost all x and all p >= 1, and discuss the links between r and the random forest estimates of Breiman (2001) [8]. We finally show the universal consistency of the bagged (bootstrap-aggregated) nearest neighbour method for regression and classification. (c) 0 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Traditional methods of predicting liver metastasis are limited in their accuracy, suggesting the need to develop new predictors. We developed a 10-gene signature that is closely associated with the development of liver metastasis after colorectal cancer.Patients and methods: We examined a total of 189 frozen specimens of primary colorectal cancers using both microarray and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. Initially, we studied gene expression in colorectal cancer tissue from 160 randomly selected patients who had undergone surgical resection of colorectal cancer and evaluated the association between the level of gene expression and the occurrence of liver metastasis. We developed a gene-expression model for the prediction of liver metastasis based on the RT-PCR findings. We then used specimens from 29 other patients for validation.Results: The expression of 14 genes was correlated with liver metastasis according to both microarray and RT-PCR analysis. We constructed an accurate predictive model based on the results for 10 of these genes, which included epiregulin (EREG), amphiregulin (AREG), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK). The 10-gene signature was an independent predictor of liver metastasis. The model was validated in the independent set of 29 patients. The predictive accuracy of the model in a test set of patients was 86.2%.Conclusion: The 10-gene signature identified in this study is closely associated with the occurrence of liver metastasis in colorectal cancer patients.

This work introduces the kernel based Bayesian network paradigm for supervised classification. This paradigm is a Bayesian network which estimates the true density of the continuous variables using kernels. Besides, tree-augmented naive Bayes, k-dependence Bayesian classifier and complete graph classifier are adapted to the novel kernel based Bayesian network paradigm. Moreover, the strong consistency properties of the presented classifiers are proved and an estimator of the mutual information based on kernels is presented. The classifiers presented in this work can be seen as the natural extension of the flexible naive Bayes classifier proposed by John and Langley [G.H. John, P. Langley, Estimating continuous distributions in Bayesian classifiers, in: Proceedings of the 11th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, 1995, pp. 338-345], breaking with its strong independence assumption.Flexible tree-augmented naive Bayes seems to have superior behavior for supervised classification among the flexible classifiers. Besides, flexible classifiers presented have obtained competitive errors compared with the state-of-the-art classifiers. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

These techniques are particularly useful in those cases exhibiting a highly nonlinear relationship between variables. In most studies, the distance measure is adopted a priori. In contrast, we propose a general procedure to find Euclidean metrics in a low-dimensional space (i.e., one in which the number of dimensions is less than the number of predictor variables) whose main characteristic is to minimize the variance of a given class label of all those pairs of points whose distance is less than a predefined value. k-NN is used in each embedded space to determine the possibility that a query belongs to a given class label. The class estimation is carried out by an ensemble of predictions. To illustrate the application of this technique, a typical land cover classification using a Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper scene is presented. Experimental results indicate substantial improvement with regard to the classification accuracy as compared with approaches such as maximum likelihood, linear discriminant analysis, standard k-NN, and adaptive quasi-conformal kernel k-NN.								13	0	0	0	13	0196-2892		WOS:000257285200023

The procedure utilizes its previous knowledge base-also called a case base-to select an effective subset for adaptation. In particular, the procedure explores a space of N variables and generates a reduced space of M dimensions. This is achieved through clustering and compaction. The clustering stage involves the minimization of distances among individuals within the same class while maximizing the distances among different classes. The compaction stage involves the elimination of the irrelevant or redundant feature dimensions.To achieve these two goals concurrently through the evolutionary process, new measures of fitness have been developed. The metrics lead to procedures which exhibit superior characteristics in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. The efficiency springs from a reduction in the number of features required for analysis, thereby saving on computational cost as well as data collection requirements. The utility of the new techniques is validated against a variety of data sets from natural and commercial sources. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

A neural network is used to classify individual pixels by a convolution operation based on a feature vector. We design eight features chat characterise the local texture in the neighbourhood of a pixel. Four of the features are based on co occurrence matrices computed from the neighbourhood. The true class label of the pixels in the radiographs are obtained from annotations made by an experienced radiologist. Neural networks and self-organising feature maps are trained to perform the segmentation cask. The experiments confirm che feasibility of using a feature-based neural network for finding pathologic bone changes in radiographic images. An analysis of the eight features indicates that the presence of edges and transitions, the complexity of the texture, as well as the amount of high frequencies in che texture, are che main features discriminating (soft) tissue from pathologic bone, the two classes most likely to be confused.								13	0	1	0	13	1433-7541		WOS:000083707400007	
J	VanderMeer, F				Van der Meer, Marga/A-4273-2010				Classification of remotely-sensed imagery using an indicator kriging approach: Application to the problem of calcite-dolomite mineral mapping								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			17	6			1233	1249					APR 1996	1996	A new image classification technique for analysis of remotely-sensed data based on geostatistical indicator kriging is introduced. Conventional classification techniques require ground truth information, use only the spectral characteristics of an unknown pixel in comparison, rely on a Gaussian probability distribution for the spectral signature of the training data, and work on a pixel support or spatial resolution without allowing classification on larger or smaller volumes. The indicator kriging classifier overcomes such problems because: (1) it relies on spectral information from laboratory studies rather than on ground truth data, (2) through the kriging estimation variances an estimate of uncertainty is derived, (3) it incorporates spatial aspects because it uses local estimation techniques, (4) it is distribution-free, (5) and may be applied on different supports if the data are corrected for support changes. Comparison of classification results applied to the problem of mapping calcite and dolomite from GER imaging spectrometry data shows that indicator kriging performs better than the conventional classification algorithms and gives insight in the accuracy of the results without prior held knowledge.								13	0	3	0	13	0143-1161		WOS:A1996UG09500009

The AP detection was performed in two steps: first, peaks were detected in raw optical data, and, second, the peaks were classified by the neural network into APs, noise and undecided peaks. The network was optimized and trained by the backpropagation learning algorithm, employing some thousands of manually classified peaks. The performance of the optimized network was found to be not completely satisfactory, although it was better than the classification by template matching and nearest-neighbor rules. The addition of a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a peak to the network classification improved the classification performance: in comparison with the manual classification results, 96% of manually classified APs were detected. The causes of classification errors were discussed. In spite of the fact that the program required a slight amount of human intervention for undecided peaks, the program could allow mostly automatic AP detection.								13	0	9	0	13	0165-0270		WOS:A1992JG37100003

This algorithm is based on the fuzzy labeling of samples by means of a membership function. As long as the membership function carries more information than the classical characteristic function, the concepts of clustering and discrimination are extended to the fuzzy field. First the learning set is fuzzily clustered. The membership function is based on a weighted k-nearest neighbors rule and does not require the optimization of any criterion. Second the test set is analyzed and a new membership function is proposed. As the learning set is generally incomplete, the creation of new fuzzy classes is studied. The measure of fuzziness involves some analogies with Statistical Thermodynamics, and the link between the membership function and the Fermi-Dirac statistical function is discussed. Finally results on simulated data are reported.								13	1	0	0	14	0165-0114		WOS:A1991GR25200002

However, while typical GWAS analysis techniques treat markers individually, complex diseases (cancers, diabetes, and Alzheimers, amongst others) are unlikely to have a single causative gene. Thus, there is a pressing need for multi-SNP analysis methods that can reveal system-level differences in cases and controls. Here, we present a novel multi-SNP GWAS analysis method called Pathways of Distinction Analysis (PoDA). The method uses GWAS data and known pathway-gene and gene-SNP associations to identify pathways that permit, ideally, the distinction of cases from controls. The technique is based upon the hypothesis that if a pathway is related to disease risk, cases will appear more similar to other cases than to controls (or vice versa) for the SNPs associated with that pathway. By systematically applying the method to all pathways of potential interest, we can identify those for which the hypothesis holds true, i.e., pathways containing SNPs for which the samples exhibit greater within-class similarity than across classes. Importantly, PoDA improves on existing single-SNP and SNP-set enrichment analyses, in that it does not require the SNPs in a pathway to exhibit independent main effects. This permits PoDA to reveal pathways in which epistatic interactions drive risk. In this paper, we detail the PoDA method and apply it to two GWAS: one of breast cancer and the other of liver cancer. The results obtained strongly suggest that there exist pathway-wide genomic differences that contribute to disease susceptibility. PoDA thus provides an analytical tool that is complementary to existing techniques and has the power to enrich our understanding of disease genomics at the systems-level.								12	2	10	0	14	1553-7390		WOS:000292386300020

The models are obtained by recursively partitioning the data space and fitting a simple prediction model within each partition. As a result, the partitioning can be represented graphically as a decision tree. Classification trees are designed for dependent variables that take a finite number of unordered values, with prediction error measured in terms of misclassification cost. Regression trees are for dependent variables that take continuous or ordered discrete values, with prediction error typically measured by the squared difference between the observed and predicted values. This article gives an introduction to the subject by reviewing some widely available algorithms and comparing their capabilities, strengths, and weakness in two examples.

However, they present several shortcomings such as time response, noise sensitivity, and storage requirements. Data reduction techniques are suitable to alleviate these drawbacks. Prototype generation is an appropriate process for data reduction, which allows the fitting of a dataset for nearest neighbor (NN) classification. This brief presents a methodology to learn iteratively the positioning of prototypes using real parameter optimization procedures. Concretely, we propose an iterative prototype adjustment technique based on differential evolution. The results obtained are contrasted with nonparametric statistical tests and show that our proposal consistently outperforms previously proposed methods, thus becoming a suitable tool in the task of enhancing the performance of the NN classifier.								12	1	0	0	13	1045-9227		WOS:000285053800012

One of the most popular solutions is missing data imputation by the K nearest neighbours (KNN) algorithm. In this article, we propose a novel KNN imputation procedure using a feature-weighted distance metric based on mutual information (MI). This method provides a missing data estimation aimed at solving the classification task, i.e., it provides an imputed dataset which is directed toward improving the classification performance. The MI-based distance metric is also used to implement an effective KNN classifier.

Predicting development of recurrence may guide the need for intensive follow-up and/or adjuvant chemotherapy in such patients. The authors' objective was to identify a set of discriminating genes that could predict recurrence in stage III colorectal cancer. METHODS: Thirty-six stage III colorectal cancer patients were studied. Tumor samples were obtained from surgically resected specimens. Thirteen patients developed recurrence, whereas 23 patients did not. Gene expression profiles were determined using human HG-U133 Plus 2.0 Gene Chip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, Calif). RESULTS: The authors identified 45 discriminating genes between patients with and without recurrence. By using this gene set, they established a new model to predict recurrence with an accuracy of 90.9%. The discriminating genes included calcineurin-binding protein 1 (CABIN1), whose expression differed remarkably between patients with and without recurrence (P = .0073). The authors further examined the DNA copy number of CABIN1 and were able to show a significant relation with recurrence (P < .012). Patients having CABIN1 gene loss demonstrated a higher risk of recurrence (odds ratio, 18.8). DNA copy number of CABIN1 alone could predict recurrence with an accuracy of 80.0%. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrated that gene expression profiling is useful in predicting recurrence in stage III colorectal cancer. The authors identified CABIN1 among discriminating genes that may play a key role in the development of recurrence. These results may help to establish an individualized therapy for stage III colorectal cancer. Cancer 2009;115:28392.

J	Li, Haiquan; Dai, Xinbin; Zhao, Xuechun								A nearest neighbor approach for automated transporter prediction and categorization from protein sequences								BIOINFORMATICS			24	9			1129	1136		10.1093/bioinformatics/btn099			MAY 1 2008	2008	Motivation: Membrane transport proteins play a crucial role in the import and export of ions, small molecules or macromolecules across biological membranes. Currently, there are a limited number of published computational tools which enable the systematic discovery and categorization of transporters prior to costly experimental validation. To approach this problem, we utilized a nearest neighbor method which seamlessly integrates homologous search and topological analysis into a machine-learning framework.Results: Our approach satisfactorily distinguished 484 transporter families in the Transporter Classification Database, a curated and representative database for transporters. A five-fold cross-validation on the database achieved a positive classification rate of 72.3 on average. Furthermore, this method successfully detected transporters in seven model and four non-model organisms, ranging from archaean to mammalian species. A preliminary literature-based validation has cross-validated 65.8 of our predictions on the 11 organisms, including 55.9 of our predictions overlapping with 83.6 of the predicted transporters in TransportDB.Availability and Supplementary information: http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://bioinfo.noble.org/manuscript-support/transporter/Contact: pzhao@noble.org.								12	2	9	0	14	1367-4803		WOS:000255313900002	
J	Kong, Xiangrong; Mas, Valeria; Archer, Kellie J.				Kong, Xiangrong/B-5098-2010				A non-parametric meta-analysis approach for combining independent microarray datasets: application using two microarray datasets pertaining to chronic allograft nephropathy								BMC GENOMICS			9						98	10.1186/1471-2164-9-98			FEB 26 2008	2008	Background: With the popularity of DNA microarray technology, multiple groups of researchers have studied the gene expression of similar biological conditions. Different methods have been developed to integrate the results from various microarray studies, though most of them rely on distributional assumptions, such as the t-statistic based, mixed-effects model, or Bayesian model methods. However, often the sample size for each individual microarray experiment is small. Therefore, in this paper we present a non-parametric meta-analysis approach for combining data from independent microarray studies, and illustrate its application on two independent Affymetrix GeneChip studies that compared the gene expression of biopsies from kidney transplant recipients with chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) to those with normal functioning allograft.Results: The simulation study comparing the non-parametric meta-analysis approach to a commonly used t-statistic based approach shows that the non-parametric approach has better sensitivity and specificity. For the application on the two CAN studies, we identified 309 distinct genes that expressed differently in CAN. By applying Fisher's exact test to identify enriched KEGG pathways among those genes called differentially expressed, we found 6 KEGG pathways to be over-represented among the identified genes. We used the expression measurements of the identified genes as predictors to predict the class labels for 6 additional biopsy samples, and the predicted results all conformed to their pathologist diagnosed class labels.Conclusion: We present a new approach for combining data from multiple independent microarray studies. This approach is non-parametric and does not rely on any distributional assumptions. The rationale behind the approach is logically intuitive and can be easily understood by researchers not having advanced training in statistics. Some of the identified genes and pathways have been reported to be relevant to renal diseases. Further study on the identified genes and pathways may lead to better understanding of CAN at the molecular level.								12	0	10	1	12	1471-2164		WOS:000254607600001	
J	Kasapoglu, N. Goekhan; Ersoy, Okan K.								Border vector detection and adaptation for classification of multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing images					1			IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			45	12			3880	3893		10.1109/TGRS.2007.900699			DEC 2007	2007	Effective partitioning of the feature space for high classification accuracy with due attention to rare class members is often a difficult task. In this paper, the border vector detection and adaptation (BVDA) algorithm is proposed for this purpose. The BVDA consists of two parts. In the first part of the algorithm, some specially selected training samples are assigned as initial reference vectors called border vectors. In the second part of the algorithm, the border vectors are adapted by moving them toward the decision boundaries. At the end of the adaptation process, the border vectors are finalized. The method next uses the minimum distance to border vector rule for classification. In supervised learning, the training process should be unbiased to reach more accurate results in testing. In the BVDA, decision region borders are related to the initialization of the border vectors and the input ordering of the training samples. Consensus strategy can be applied with cross validation to reduce these dependencies. The performance of the BVDA and consensual BVDA were studied in comparison to other classification algorithms including neural network with backpropagation learning, support vector machines, and some statistical classification techniques.				4th International Workshop on Pattern Recognition in Remote Sensing	AUG   20, 2006	Int Assoc Pattern Recognit; IEEE Geosci; Remote Sensing Soc	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	12	0	0	0	12	0196-2892		WOS:000251339400004	
J	Koukal, Tatjana; Suppan, Franz; Schneider, Werner								The impact of relative radiometric calibration on the accuracy of kNN-predictions of forest attributes								REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			110	4			431	437		10.1016/j.rse.2006.08.016			OCT 30 2007	2007	The k-nearest-neighbour (kNN) algorithm is widely applied for the estimation of forest attributes using remote sensing data. It requires a large amount of reference data to achieve satisfactory results. Usually, the number of available reference plots for the kNN-prediction is limited by the size of the area covered by a terrestrial reference inventory and remotely sensed imagery collected from one overflight. The applicability of kNN could be enhanced if adjacent images of different acquisition dates could be used in the same estimation procedure. Relative radiometric calibration is a prerequisite for this. This study focuses on two empirical calibration methods. They are tested on adjacent LANDSAT TM scenes in Austria. The first, quite conventional one is based on radiometric control points in the overlap area of two images and on the determination of transformation parameters by linear regression. The other, recently developed method exploits the kNN-cross-validation procedure. Performance and applicability of both methods as well as the impact of phenology are discussed.

Eighteen pelvic radiographs of patients with verified unilateral hip OA, were digitized and enhanced employing custom developed software. Two Rots corresponding to osteoarthritic and contralateral-physiological radiographic Hip Joint Spaces (HJSs) were determined on each radiograph. Textural features were extracted from the HJS-ROIs utilizing the run-length matrices and Laws textural measures. A k-Nearest Neighbour based hierarchical tree structure was designed for classifying hips into three OA severity categories labeled as "Normal", "Mild/Moderate", and "Severe". Employing the run-length features, the overall classification accuracy of the hierarchical tree structure was 86.1%. The utilization of Laws' textural measures improved the system classification performance, providing an overall classification accuracy of 94.4%. The proposed method maybe of value to physicians in assessing the severity of hip OA. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

J	Dutta, D; Guha, R; Jurs, PC; Chen, T								Scalable partitioning and exploration of chemical spaces using geometric hashing								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			46	1			321	333		10.1021/ci050403o			JAN-FEB 2006	2006	Virtual screening (VS) has become a preferred tool to augment high-throughput screening(1) and determine new leads in the drug discovery process. The core of a VS informatics pipeline includes several data mining algorithms that work on huge databases of chemical compounds containing millions of molecular structures and their associated data. Thus, scaling traditional applications such as classification, partitioning, and outlier detection for huge chemical data sets without a significant loss in accuracy is very important. In this paper, we introduce a data mining framework built on top of a recently developed fast approximate nearest-neighbor-finding algorithm(2) called locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) that can be used to mine huge chemical spaces in a scalable fashion using very modest computational resources. The core LSH algorithm hashes chemical descriptors so that points close to each other in the descriptor space are also close to each other in the hashed space. Using this data structure, one can perform approximate nearest-neighbor searches very quickly, in sublinear time. We validate the accuracy and performance of our framework on three real data sets of sizes ranging from 4337 to 249 071 molecules. Results indicate that the identification of nearest neighbors using the LSH algorithm is at least 2 orders of magnitude faster than the traditional k-nearest-neighbor method and is over 94% accurate for most query parameters. Furthermore, when viewed as a data-partitioning procedure, the LSH algorithm lends itself to easy parallelization of nearest-neighbor classification or regression. We also apply our framework to detect outlying (diverse) compounds in a given chemical space this algorithm is extremely rapid in determining whether a compound is located in a sparse region of chemical space or not, and it is quite accurate when compared to results obtained using principal-component-analysis-based heuristics.				4th Indo-US Workshop on Mathematical Chemistry	JAN 08-12, 2005		Pune, INDIA	12	1	6	0	15	1549-9596		WOS:000235021200036	
J	Phan, John H.; Quo, Chang-Feng; Wang, May D.								Functional genomics and proteomics in the clinical neurosciences: data mining and bioinformatics								FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS AND PROTEOMICS IN THE CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCES	PROGRESS IN BRAIN RESEARCH		158				83	108		10.1016/S0079-6123(06)58004-5			2006	2006	The goal of this chapter is to introduce some of the available computational methods for expression analysis. Genomic and proteomic experimental techniques are briefly discussed to help the reader understand these methods and results better in context with the biological significance. Furthermore, a case study is presented that will illustrate the use of these analytical methods to extract significant biomarkers from high-throughput microarray data.Genomic and proteomic data analysis is essential for understanding the underlying factors that are involved in human disease. Currently, such experimental data are generally obtained by high-throughput microarray or mass spectrometry technologies among others. The sheer amount of raw data obtained using these methods warrants specialized computational methods for data analysis.Biomarker discovery for neurological diagnosis and prognosis is one such example. By extracting significant genomic and proteomlic biomarkers in controlled experiments, we come closer to understanding how biological mechanisms contribute to neural degenerative diseases such as Alzheimers' and how drug treatments interact with the nervous system.In the biomarker discovery process, there are several computational methods that must be carefully considered to accurately analyze genomic or proteomic data. These methods include quality control, clustering, classification, feature ranking, and validation.Data quality control and normalization methods reduce technical variability and ensure that discovered biomarkers are statistically significant. Preprocessing steps must be carefully selected since they may adversely affect the results of the following expression analysis steps, which generally fall into two categories: unsupervised and supervised.Unsupervised or clustering methods can be used to group similar genomic or proteomic profiles and therefore can elucidate relationships within sample groups. These methods can also assign biomarkers to sub-groups based on their expression profiles across patient samples. Although clustering is useful for exploratory analysis, it is limited due to its inability to incorporate expert knowledge.On the other hand, classification and feature ranking are supervised, knowledge-based machine learning methods that estimate the distribution of biological expression data and, in doing so, can extract important information about these experiments. Classification is closely coupled with feature ranking, which is essentially a data reduction method that uses classification error estimation or other statistical tests to score features. Biomarkers can subsequently be extracted by eliminating insignificantly ranked features.These analytical methods may be equally applied to genetic and proteomic data. However, because of both biological differences between the data sources and technical differences between the experimental methods used to obtain these data, it is important to have a firm understanding of the data sources and experimental methods.At the same time, regardless of the data quality, it is inevitable that some discovered biomarkers are false positives. Thus, it is important to validate discovered biomarkers. The validation process may be slow; yet, the overall biomarker discovery process is significantly accelerated due to initial feature ranking and data reduction steps. Information obtained from the validation process may also be used to refine data analysis procedures for future iteration. Biomarker validation may be performed in a number of ways - bench-side in traditional labs, web-based electronic resources such as gene ontology and literature databases, and clinical trials.								12	0	9	0	13	0079-6123		WOS:000247003700004	
J	Saha, Soma; Heber, Steffen								In silico prediction of yeast deletion phenotypes								GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			5	1			224	232					2006	2006	Analysis of gene deletions is a fundamental approach for investigating gene function. We evaluated an algorithm that uses classification techniques to predict the phenotypic effects of gene deletions in yeast. We used a modified simulated annealing algorithm for feature selection and weighting. The selected features with high weights were phylogenetic conservation scores for bacteria, fungi (excluding Ascomycota), Ascomycota (excluding Saccharomyces cerevisiae), plants, and mammals, degree of paralogy, and number of protein-protein interactions. Classification was performed by weighted k-nearest neighbor and with support vector machine algorithms. To demonstrate how this approach might complement existing experimental procedures, we applied our algorithm to predict essential genes and genes causing morphological alterations in yeast.								12	0	9	0	12	1676-5680		WOS:000203011700027	
J	Gao, QB; Wang, ZZ				Gao, Qing-Bin/G-9825-2011				Using nearest feature line and tunable nearest neighbor methods for prediction of protein subcellular locations								COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			29	5			388	392		10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2005.08.002			OCT 2005	2005	The subcellular location of a protein is closely correlated with it biological function. In this paper, two new pattern classification methods termed as Nearest Feature Line (NFL) and Tunable Nearest Neighbor (TNN) have been introduced to predict the subcellular location of proteins based on their amino acid composition alone. The simulation experiments were performed with the jackknife test on a previously constructed data set, which consists of 2427 eukaryotic and 997 prokaryotic proteins. All protein sequences in the data set fall into four eukaryotic subcellular locations and three prokaryotic subcellular locations. The NFL classifier reached the total prediction accuracies of 82.5% for the eukaryotic proteins and 91.0% for the prokaryotic proteins. The TNN classifier reached the total prediction accuracies of 83.6 and 92.2%, respectively. It is clear that high prediction accuracies have been achieved. Compared with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Nearest Neighbor methods, these two methods display similar or even higher prediction accuracies. Hence, we conclude that NFL and TNN can be used as complementary methods for prediction of protein subcellular locations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hall, P; Samworth, RJ								Properties of bagged nearest neighbour classifiers					3			JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY			67				363	379		10.1111/j.1467-9868.2005.00506.x			2005	2005	It is shown that bagging, a computationally intensive method, asymptotically improves the performance of nearest neighbour classifiers provided that the resample size is less than 69% of the actual sample size, in the case of with-replacement bagging, or less than 50% of the sample size, for without-replacement bagging. However, for larger sampling fractions there is no asymptotic difference between the risk of the regular nearest neighbour classifier and its bagged version. In particular, neither achieves the large sample performance of the Bayes classifier. In contrast, when the sampling fractions converge to 0, but the resample sizes diverge to infinity, the bagged classifier converges to the optimal Bayes rule and its risk converges to the risk of the latter. These results are most readily seen when the two populations have well-defined densities, but they may also be derived in other cases, where densities exist in only a relative sense. Cross-validation can be used effectively to choose the sampling fraction. Numerical calculation is used to illustrate these theoretical properties.								12	0	1	0	12	1369-7412		WOS:000229902600003	
J	Vogt, P								On the acquisition and evolution of compositional languages: Sparse input and the productive creativity of children								ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR			13	4			325	346		10.1177/105971230501300403			2005	2005	This paper investigates the productive creativity of children in a computational model of the emergence and evolution of compositional structures in language. In previous models it was shown that compositional structures can emerge in language when the language is transmitted from one generation to the next through a transmission bottleneck. Due to the fact that in these models language is transmitted only in a vertical direction where adults only speak to children and children only listen, this bottleneck needs to be imposed by the experimenter. In the current study, this bottleneck is removed and instead of having a vertical transmission of language, the language is-in most simulations-transmitted horizontally (i.e., any agent can speak to any other agent). It is shown that Such a horizontal transmission scenario does not need an externally imposed bottleneck, because the children face an implicit bottleneck when they start speaking early in life. The model is compared with the recent development of Nicaraguan Sign Language, where it is observed that children are a driving force for inventing grammatical (or compositional) structures, possibly due to a sparseness of nput (i.e., an implicit bottleneck). The results show that in the studied model children are indeed the creative driving force for the emergence and stable evolution of compositional languages, thus suggesting that this implicit bottleneck may-in part-explain why children are so typically good at acquiring language and, moreover, why they may have been the driving force for the emergence of grammar in language.				16th Annual Meeting of the Human-Behavior-and-Evolution-Society (HBES)	JUL 21-25, 2004	Human Behav & Evolut Soc	Berlin, GERMANY	12	0	4	0	12	1059-7123		WOS:000233740700006

But the original NMF in which the basis vectors are unit ones in L-1 norm, does not increase the sparseness of learned features. This paper generalizes NMF to L-p-NMF where the basis vectors are unit ones in L-p norm. Experiments demonstrate how p affects the sparseness of learned features and the final classification accuracy. And the results show that L-2-NMF is superior one for practical implementation.

Yet, map usefulness is substantially reduced without reliable accuracy estimates. In this article, we introduce a method of estimating the accuracy of a classified map that does not utilize a test sample in the usual sense, but instead estimates the probability of correct classification for each map unit using only the classification rule and the map unit covariates. We argue that the method is an improvement over conventional estimators, though it does not eliminate the need for probability sampling. The method also provides a new and simple method of constructing accuracy maps. We illustrate some of problems associated with accuracy assessment of broad-scale land cover maps, and our method, with a set of nine Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite image-based land cover maps from Montana and Wyoming, USA.								12	0	3	0	12	1352-8505		WOS:000184715300003

Various types of nearest neighbor rules are investigated including those based on a linguistic specification. The situation in which the value of interest lies in an ordinal set is also considered. It is shown that the weighted median provides a useful tool for constructing nearest neighbor rules in this case.								12	1	0	0	13	1083-4419		WOS:000176909200011

The decisions of these rules can be straight-forwardly explained as the conclusions drawn by a case-based reasoner. Our system is named FAN, an acronym for finding accurate inductions. It starts from a collection of training examples and produces propositional rules able to classify unseen cases following a minimum-distance criterion in their evaluation procedure. In this way, we combine the advantages of instance-based algorithms and the conciseness of rule (or decision-tree) inducers, The algorithm followed by FAN can be seen as the result of successive steps of pruning heuristics. The main tool employed is that of the impurity level, a measure of the classification quality of a rule, inspired by a similar measure used in IB3. Finally, a number of experiments were conducted with standard benchmark datasets of the UCI repository to test the performance of our system, successfully comparing FAN with a wide collection of machine-learning algorithms.

The proposed process involves an iterative mechanism where type traits are successively defined and computationally represented using knowledge engineering methodologies, scored by a set of trained human experts and finally, analysed by means of four reputed machine learning algorithms. The results thus achieved serve as feed back to the next iteration in order to improve the accuracy and efficacy of the proposed assessment system. A sample of 260 conformation records of the Asturiana de los Valles beef cattle breed is shown to illustrate the methodology. Three sources of inconsistency were detected: (a) the existence of different interpretations of the trait's definition, increasing the subjectivity of the assessment; (b) the narrow range of variation of some of the anatomical traits assessed; (c) the inclusion of some complex traits in the assessment system. In this sense, the reopening of the evaluated Asturiana de los Valles assessment system is recommended. In spite of the difficulty of collecting data from live animals, further implications of the artificial intelligence systems on morphological assessment are pointed out.								12	0	6	0	12	1357-7298		WOS:000170317200006

Neither algorithm consistently outperforms the other, with each performing well on different problems.

Cerebral evoked potentials are stimulus-induced, averaged EEG potentials that have been found useful in patients with dementing illness. A recent report using the P300 auditory evoked potential shows that simple latency and waveform criteria result in classification accuracy of 65% for multiple sclerosis (MS) patients versus 91% for control subjects. Analysis on the same data set was performed using an artificial neural network (ANN) and a nearest neighbor (NN) classifier. An ANN classifier demonstrated a classification accuracy of 75% versus 87% on MS and control subject groups. Thus prediction accuracy was improved on average, compared with that obtained by NN classifiers or P300 statistical analysis. The classification strategy discovered by a trained ANN was analyzed by a weight pattern analysis method and compared with the P300 latency criteria.								12	0	9	0	12	0010-4825		WOS:A1993LH55200005

J	McRoberts, Ronald E.								Estimating forest attribute parameters for small areas using nearest neighbors techniques								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			272		SI		3	12		10.1016/j.foreco.2011.06.039			MAY 15 2012	2012	Nearest neighbors techniques have become extremely popular, particularly for use with forest inventory data. With these techniques, a population unit prediction is calculated as a linear combination of observations for a selected number of population units in a sample that are most similar, or nearest, in a space of ancillary variables to the population unit requiring the prediction. Nearest neighbors techniques are appealing for multiple reasons: they can be used with categorical response variables for which the objective is classification and with continuous response variables for which the objective is prediction; they can be used for both univariate and multivariate prediction; they are non-parametric in the sense that no assumptions regarding the distributions of response or predictor variables are necessary; they are synthetic in the sense that they can readily use information external to the geographic area for which an estimate is sought; they are useful for map construction, small area estimation, and inference; and they can be used with a wide variety of data sets. Recent advances and emerging issues in nearest neighbors techniques are reviewed for four topic areas: (1) distance metrics, (2) optimization, (3) diagnostic tools, and (4) inference. The focus of the study is estimation of mean forest stem volume per unit area for small areas using a combination of forest inventory observations and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. However, the concepts and techniques are generally applicable for all nearest neighbors problems. Published by Elsevier B.V.								11	0	8	0	11	0378-1127		WOS:000303090200002	
J	Masud, Mohammad M.; Gao, Jing; Khan, Latifur; Han, Jiawei; Thuraisingham, Bhavani								Classification and Novel Class Detection in Concept-Drifting Data Streams under Time Constraints								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			23	6			859	874		10.1109/TKDE.2010.61			JUN 2011	2011	Most existing data stream classification techniques ignore one important aspect of stream data: arrival of a novel class. We address this issue and propose a data stream classification technique that integrates a novel class detection mechanism into traditional classifiers, enabling automatic detection of novel classes before the true labels of the novel class instances arrive. Novel class detection problem becomes more challenging in the presence of concept-drift, when the underlying data distributions evolve in streams. In order to determine whether an instance belongs to a novel class, the classification model sometimes needs to wait for more test instances to discover similarities among those instances. A maximum allowable wait time T(c) is imposed as a time constraint to classify a test instance. Furthermore, most existing stream classification approaches assume that the true label of a data point can be accessed immediately after the data point is classified. In reality, a time delay T(l) is involved in obtaining the true label of a data point since manual labeling is time consuming. We show how to make fast and correct classification decisions under these constraints and apply them to real benchmark data. Comparison with state-of-the-art stream classification techniques prove the superiority of our approach.								11	0	0	0	11	1041-4347		WOS:000289624600005	
J	Schmeja, S.								Identifying star clusters in a field: A comparison of different algorithms								ASTRONOMISCHE NACHRICHTEN			332	2			172	184		10.1002/asna.201011484			FEB 2011	2011	Star clusters are often hard to find, as they may lie in a dense field of background objects or, because in the case of embedded clusters, they are surrounded by a more dispersed population of young stars. This paper discusses four algorithms that have been developed to identify clusters as stellar density enhancements in a field, namely stellar density maps from star counts, the nearest neighbour method and the Voronoi tessellation, and the separation of minimum spanning trees. These methods are tested and compared to each other by applying them to artificial clusters of different sizes and morphologies. While distinct centrally concentrated clusters are detected by all methods, clusters with low overdensity or highly hierarchical structure are only reliably detected by methods with inherent smoothing (star counts and nearest neighbour method). Furthermore, the algorithms differ strongly in computation time and additional parameters they provide. Therefore, the method to choose primarily depends on the size and character of the investigated area and the purpose of the study. (C) 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In the LDP algorithm, the overlap among the class-specific manifolds is approximated by an invader graph, and a locality discriminant criterion is proposed to find the projections that best preserve the within-class local structures while decrease the between-class overlap. The feasibility of the LDP algorithm has been successfully tested in text data and visual recognition experiments. Experiment results show it is an effective technique for data modeling and classification comparing to linear discriminant analysis, locality preserving projection, and marginal Fisher analysis.

Unlike conventional single-task learning (STL) modeling focused only on a single target property without any relations to other properties, in the framework of inductive transfer approach, the individual models are viewed as nodes in the network of interrelated models built in parallel (MTL) or sequentially (FN). It has been demonstrated that MTL and FN techniques are extremely useful in structure-property modeling on small and structurally diverse data sets, when conventional STL modeling is unable to produce any predictive model. The predictive STL individual models were obtained for 4 out of I I TAPC, whereas application of inductive knowledge transfer techniques resulted in models for 9 TAPC. Differences in prediction performances of the models as a function of the machine-learning method, and of the number of properties simultaneously involved in the learning, has been discussed.								11	0	5	0	11	1549-9596		WOS:000262818500015

To apply them for more wide studies, the comparability across generations and experimental environments is an important research topic. This paper particularly investigates the issue of cross-generation/laboratory predictions. That is, whether models built upon data of one generation (laboratory) can differentiate data of another. We consider eight public sets of three cancers. They are from different laboratories and are across various generations of Affy human microarrays. Each cancer has certain subtypes, and we investigate if a model trained from one set correctly differentiates another. We propose a simple rank-based approach to make data from different sources more comparable. Results show that it leads to higher prediction accuracy than using expression values. We further investigate normalization issues in preparing training/testing data. In addition, we discuss some pitfalls in evaluating cross-generation/laboratory predictions. To use data from various sources one must be cautious on some important but easily neglected steps. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.								11	0	7	0	11	1532-0464		WOS:000257924400006

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are often the first choice. The so-called instance-based learning (IBL) has received relatively little attention, and the present paper explores the applicability of these methods in the field of hydrological forecasting. Their performance is compared with that of ANNs, M5 model trees and conceptual hydrological models. Four short-term flow forecasting problems were solved for two catchments. Results showed that the IBL methods often produce better results than ANNs and M5 model trees, especially if used with the Gaussian kernel function. The study showed that IBL is an effective data-driven method that can be successfully used in hydrological forecasting.

A training set is interpreted as a complete graph with at least one prototype in each class. They compete among themselves and each prototype defines an optimum-path tree, whose nodes are the samples more strongly connected to it than to any other. The result is an optimum-path forest in the training set. A test sample is assigned to the class of the prototype which offers it the optimum path in the forest. The classifier is designed to achieve zero classification errors in the training set, without over-fitting, and to learn from its errors. A comparison with several datasets shows the advantages of the method in accuracy and efficiency with respect to support vector machines.				12th International Workshop on Combinatorial Image Analysis	APR 07-09, 2008		Buffalo, NY	11	0	0	0	11	0302-9743	978-3-540-78274-2	WOS:000254600100012

Temporal abstraction for feature extraction: A comparative case study in prediction from intensive care monitoring data								ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			41	1			1	12		10.1016/j.artmed.2007.06.003			SEP 2007	2007	Objectives: To compare two temporal abstraction procedures for the extraction of meta features from monitoring data. Feature extraction prior to predictive modeling is a common strategy in prediction from temporal data. A fundamental dilemma in this strategy, however, is the extent to which the extraction should be guided by domain knowledge, and to which extent it should be guided by the available data. The two temporal abstraction procedures compared in this case study differ in this respect.Methods and material: The first temporal abstraction procedure derives symbolic descriptions from the data that are predefined using existing concepts from the medical language. In the second procedure, a large space of numerical meta features is searched through to discover relevant features from the data. These procedures were applied to a prediction problem from intensive care monitoring data. The predictive value of the resulting meta features were compared, and based on each type of features, a class probability tree model was developed.Results: The numerical meta features extracted by the second procedure were found to be more informative than the symbolic meta features of the first procedure in the case study, and a superior predictive performance was observed for the associated tree model.Conclusion: The findings indicate that for prediction from monitoring data, induction of numerical meta features from data is preferable to extraction of symbolic meta features using existing clinical concepts.

Initially, six of the cell lines were categorized into radioresistant (RG) or nonradioresistant (NRG) groups according to the radiation dose required to reduce their survival to 10% (D-10). Genes for which expression was specific to each group at 1 or 3 h after irradiation were identified using statistical procedures including analysis of variance and a two-dimensional hierarchical clustering method. The remaining nine cell lines were subjected to the k-nearest neighbor pattern classification.Results: The nine test cell lines were successfully classified by their D-10 value using 46 and 44 genes for which transcription levels had significantly changed at 1 and 3 h after irradiation, respectively. Of these genes, 25 showed altered expression at both time points in the NRG or RG, but independently were unable to classify the test cell lines.Conclusions: Radioresistant cell lines analyzed in this study showed certain radiation-induced changes in gene expression profiles that are different from the profile changes of the more-sensitive cell lines.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the development of this syndrome are currently unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize aberrant gene expression in CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells from patients with AMM. We used oligonucleotide microarrays to analyze gene expression profiles in CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells from patients with AMM compared with expression in CD34(+) cells from healthy individuals. We identified 95 highly differentially expressed genes (48 upregulated and 47 downregulated) that are potentially involved in regulating abnormal hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation and confirmed many of them by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Using; class membership prediction analysis, we identified 75 genes whose expression profiles can accurately differentiate AMM samples from the controls. Using these 75 genes, we were able to discriminate patients with AMM from the controls by hierarchical clustering (Spearman's confidence correlation). The predictive power of these genes was verified by applying the algorithm to an unknown test set containing expression data from eight additional CD34(+) samples (four AMM, four control). Our results indicate that a subset of genes may be used to differentiate patients with AMM from healthy individuals. Furthermore, we identify 95 genes whose aberrant expression may be involved in AMM.								11	0	11	0	12	1066-5099		WOS:000229025200004

These diseases lead to important inflammatory symptoms resulting in an important functional impairment. This paper introduces a self-organizing artificial neural network combined with a case-based reasoning evaluation criterion to predict diagnosis in patients with early arthritis. Results show that 47.2% of the sample space can be predicted with an accuracy of 84.0% and attaining a high confidence level. 37.7% of the sample space is classified with an overall accuracy of 65.0%. The remaining group was labeled as "undetermined". A general prediction accuracy of 75.6% is reached, exceeding the performance of other approaches such as a backpropagation neural network and the Quest decision tree program. Furthermore, by using this new method, more specifically case-based reasoning, as a helpful tool to classify patients with early arthritis, the possibility of a confidence measure is given, indicating a degree of "belief" of the system in its results. This is often an important feature when dealing with diagnosis in human patients. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.								11	0	4	0	11	0933-3657		WOS:000222256000003

In this paper, we propose a decision framework that combines multiple models or techniques in a complementary fashion to provide input to managers who make such decisions on a routine basis. We illustrate the framework by specifically using five different classification techniques-neural networks, discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and multinomial logistic regression analysis (MNL). Application of the decision framework to an actual retail department store data shows that it is most useful in those cases where uncertainty is high and a priori classification cannot be made with a high degree of reliability. The proposed framework thus enhances the value of exception reporting, and provides managers additional insights into the phenomenon being studied. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	TODD, BS; STAMPER, R								THE RELATIVE ACCURACY OF A VARIETY OF MEDICAL DIAGNOSTIC PROGRAMS								METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			33	4			402	416					OCT 1994	1994	Acute abdominal pain is one of the most widely studied applications of computer-aided diagnosis. The usual approach is to apply Bayes' theorem with the assumption of conditional independence (''independence Bayes''). We compared various approaches to designing diagnostic programs for abdominal pain of suspected gynaecological origin. The methods range from statistical to knowledge-based. All programs were evaluated using a database of 1,270 cases collected retrospectively. Our results suggest that in this application no significant improvement in accuracy can be made by taking interactions into account, either by statistical or by knowledge-based means; independence Bayes is near-optimal. As far as accuracy is concerned, there appears to be little point in pursuing knowledge-based approaches. However, the ''nearest neighbours'' method using a new metric appears to be at least as accurate as independence Bayes. We argue that the nearest neighbours method is more suitable than independence Bayes for clinical use because of greater accountability.								11	0	2	0	11	0026-1270		WOS:A1994PN89900012

Plasma polymer films have unsaturated bonds and radical sites which cause several unique characteristics. These films contain high concentrations of unsaturated bonds and radical sites, which act as interactive sites. These sites, scattered throughout an inert fluorocarbon framework, are believed to induce specific interactions with small molecules through pi and spin interactions. We have tried to apply our knowledge of these interactions to molecular recognition. For sensing small molecules, these films are deposited on both sides of an AT-cut quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) with a resonant frequency of 9 MHz by radio-frequency (rf) sputtering of polymers such as polychlorotrifluoroethylene. The QCM is connected to an oscillator circuit and its resonant shift is proportional to the mass of the adsorbed molecules. The affinity of plasma polymer films can be shifted by changing sputtering conditions such as the target materials, temperature, or rf power. The chemical sensing system studied here uses a sensor array having modified films with various sensitivities. Because the sensor films have an affinity for several kinds of gases, a pattern recognition algorithm is needed to discern unique gas information from sensors that have overlapping selectivities. The equilibrium mass of adsorbed gas and a time constant are first extracted from the time-dependent sensor outputs, which show that the adsorption process resembles Langmuir adsorption, and then the parameters are mapped to a classification space and used for classification. The addition of a time constant increases the selectivity of our sensor system for single-gas analysis and mixture analysis.								11	0	0	0	11	1045-389X		WOS:A1994NQ32200004

Principal components analysis was used in conjunction with a cardiologist's deterministic classification of 90 ECG traces to fix the number of trace classes to 5 (ventricular fibrillation/flutter, sinus rhythm, ventricular rhythms with aberrant complexes and 2 classes of artefact). Forty of the 90 traces were then defined as a test set; 5 different learning sets (numbering 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45 traces) were randomly selected from the remaining 50 traces; each learning set was used to parametrize both the classification algorithms using both fuzzy clustering algorithms and the parametrized classification algorithms were then applied to the test set. Optimal K for K-nearest-neighbor algorithms and optimal cluster volumes for Fuzzy Covariance algorithms were sought by trial error to minimize classification differences with respect to the cardiologist's classification. Fuzzy Covariance clustering afforded significantly better perception of cluster structure than the Fuzzy C-Means algorithm, and the classifiers performed correspondingly with an overall empirical error ratio of just 0.10 for the K-nearest-neighbor algorithm parametrized by Fuzzy Covariance.								11	0	4	0	11	0020-7101		WOS:A1991EZ24600005

In such cases, we are dealing with the so-called imbalanced data sets. One of the most used techniques to deal with this problem consists of preprocessing the data previously to the learning process. This paper proposes a method belonging to the family of the nested generalized exemplar that accomplishes learning by storing objects in Euclidean n-space. Classification of new data is performed by computing their distance to the nearest generalized exemplar. The method is optimized by the selection of the most suitable generalized exemplars based on evolutionary algorithms. An experimental analysis is carried out over a wide range of highly imbalanced data sets and uses the statistical tests suggested in the specialized literature. The results obtained show that our evolutionary proposal outperforms other classic and recent models in accuracy and requires to store a lower number of generalized examples. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
