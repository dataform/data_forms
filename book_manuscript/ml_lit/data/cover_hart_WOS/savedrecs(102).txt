B	Zhang, B; Srihari, SN			IEEE; IEEE					A fast algorithm for finding k-nearest neighbors with non-metric dissimilarity								EIGHTH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON FRONTIERS IN HANDWRITING RECOGNITION: PROCEEDINGS							13	18					2002	2002	Fast nearest neighbor (NN)finding has been extensively studied. While some fast NN algorithms using metrics rely on the essential properties of metric spaces, the others using non-metric measures fail for large-size templates. However in some applications with very large size templates, the best performance is achieved by NN methods based on the dissimilarity measures resulting in a special space where computations cannot be pruned by the algorithms based-on the triangular inequality. For such NN methods, the existing fast algorithms except condensing algorithms are not applicable. In this paper, a fast hierarchical search algorithm is proposed to find k-NNs using a non-metric measure in a binary feature space, Experiments with handwritten digit recognition show that the new algorithm reduces on average dissimilarity computations by more than 90% while losing the accuracy by less than 0.1%, with a 10% increase in memory.				8th International Workshop on Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition	AUG 06-08, 2002	Univ Buffalo, CEDAR; Microsoft; Siemens; Hitachi; Motorola; US Postal Serv; A2iA; Int Assoc Pattern Recognit	ONTARIO, CANADA	0	0	0	0	0		0-7695-1692-0	WOS:000177665000002

We aim to develop a method capable of precision measurements on systems made up of four coupled electric machines hermetically enclosed, each having three possible states of operation. The main problem comes from the impossibility of making direct measurements inside the enclosure, the only measurable quantity being the global input signal. The method introduces a technique to separate the states of operation from that of failure, using an analysis in Fourier space of the small variations of the input signal.								0	0	0	0	0	0008-4204		WOS:000168172000006	
B	Dahbur, K; Muscarello, T						Chung, A		Cascaded system for criminal pattern classification								COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN INDUSTRY AND ENGINEERING							13	18					2001	2001	Data mining is a field in computer science that specializes in extracting implicit information that is distributed across the stored data records and/or exists as associations among groups of records. Discovering serial criminal patterns in crime databases is, in general, a clustering activity in the area of data mining that is concerned with detecting trends in the data by classifying and grouping similar records.In this paper, we report on the different statistical and neural network approaches to the clustering problem in data mining in general, and as it applies to our crime domain in particular. We discuss our approach of using a cascaded network of Kohonen neural networks followed by heuristic processing of the networks outputs. We address the issues in this project and the reasoning behind this approach, including: the choice of neural networks, in general, over statistical algorithms as the main tool, and the use of Kohonen networks in particular, the choice for the cascaded approach instead of the direct approach, and the choice of a heuristics subsystem as a back-end subsystem to the neural networks.				14th International Conference on Computer Applications in Industry and Engineering	NOV 27-29, 2001	Int Soc Comp & Their Applicat	LAS VEGAS, NV	0	0	0	0	0		1-880843-40-4	WOS:000179289400004

The method we are presenting enables the system to enhance its base with models, which are performant in recognition. This method also enables to get rid of models regularly doubtable it? efficiency when it comes to interpretation of the characters studied. This ride is similar to the one used in the "Death by, suffocation" game of life of Conway. We based ourselves oil the theory of k-nearest neighbours to develop a new approach we named, epsilon -adaptive neighbourhood. It makes an adjustment of classes possible, according to confidence rate in each model of the learning base. These rates which are practically, represented as weights are taken into account by the stage of the recognition system during the character recognition phase. The use of weight as a model selection factor, useful for recognition, enables the system to Manage the evolution of the learning base.				4th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Multimedia Applications (ICCIMA 2001)	OCT 30-NOV 01, 2001	CS, Natl Defense Acad; CIRL, Griffith Univ; SCS, Univ Birmingham; EE, Univ Las Vegas; CS, Univ Sao Paulo	YOKUSIKA, JAPAN	0	0	0	0	0		0-7695-1312-3	WOS:000173022300070

Before the learning of neural networks, a genetic-algorithm-based instance and feature selection method is applied for reducing the size of training data. Nearest neighbor classification is used for evaluating the classification ability of subsets of training data in instance and feature selection. Neural networks are trained by the selected subset (i.e., reduced training data). In this paper, we first explain our GA-based instance and feature selection method. Then we examine the effect of instance and feature selection on the generalization ability of trained neural networks through computer simulations on various artificial and real-world pattern classification problems.				9th International-Fuzzy-Systems-Association World Congress/20th North-American-Fuzzy-Information-Processing-Society, International Conference	JUL 25-28, 2001	Int Fuzzy Syst Assoc; N Amer Fuzzy Informat Proc Soc; IEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc; IEEE, Neural Networks Council	VANCOUVER, CANADA	0	0	0	0	0		0-7803-7078-3	WOS:000173245100371

Various approaches, including statistical and graph theoretical methods, data mining, and computational pattern recognition, have been applied to this task with varying degrees of success. We have previously shown that a genetic algorithm coupled with a k-nearest-neighbors classifier performs well in extracting information about protein-water binding from X-ray crystallographic protein structure data. Using a novel classifier based on the Bayes discriminant function, we present a hybrid algorithm that employs feature selection and extraction to isolate salient features from large biological data sets. The effectiveness of this algorithm is demonstrated on various biological and medical data sets.				2nd IEEE International Symposium on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE 2001)	NOV 04-06, 2001	IEEE Comp Soc; IEEE CS Virtual Intelligence Task Force; Wright State Univ, Informat Technol Res Inst; AIIS Inc	BETHESDA, MD	0	0	0	0	0		0-7695-1423-5	WOS:000172674600031

The algorithm described herein automatically segments three different tissues: Muscle cell tissue (MT), Pure collagen fiber deposit (CD) and cellular infiltrates surrounded by loose collagen deposit (CI), by using a statistical classifier based on the k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) decision rule in the RGB color space. The algorithm is trained by selecting a number of correctly classified pixels from each class. The k-NN rule classifies other pixels in the class that is most represented among the k nearest training samples in the RGB space, which is efficiently implemented with a fast k-distance transform algorithm. All extracted areas are quantified in absolute (mum(2)) and relative (%) values. For validation of this method, the different tissues were manually segmented and their quantifications statistically compared with those obtained automatically. Statistical analysis showed inter-operator variability in manual segmentation. Automatic quantifications of the same areas did not differ significantly from their mean manual evaluations. In conclusion, this method produce fast, reliable and reproducible results.				23rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society	OCT 25-28, 2001	Natl Sci Fdn; TUBITAK, Sci & Tech Res Ctr Turkey; ISIK Univ; COMNET; EREL Techno Grp; GUZEL SANATLAR Printinghouse; JOHNSON&JOHNSON Med; PFIZER; SIEMENS Med; TURKCELL Iletism Hizmetler A S; ALSTOM Elect Ltd Co; GANTEK Technol & SUN Microsyst; TURCOM Co Grp	ISTANBUL, TURKEY	0	0	0	0	0	1094-687X	0-7803-7211-5	WOS:000178871900710

Classically, the overlap of the tissue probability distribution functions for voxel intensities can be reduced by using multi-component (T1w,T2w,Pd....) MR images, but at a much higher cost for image acquisition. Instead, we generate an artificial image component as the distance from the edges of the segmented brain. The non-parametric k-Nearest Neighbors rule (k-NN) is used since it requires no a priori on the probability distribution of this distance component. The k-NN rule is also tested using different metrics (Euclidean, weighted Euclidean, Mahalanobis) in the classification space to define what "nearest neighbors" are.The results are twofold: firstly we show that all metrics perform well in ideal conditions, but that the Mahalanobis (and to some extent the weighted Euclidean) metric is more robust in case of under-training of the classifier. Secondly we show that using the relative anatomical location in combination with the intensity information improves the classification of the tissues.

These approaches mediate this problem with the aid of a collection of data objects about which we have fun knowledge. These methods require the calculation of the similarity between the target and the data objects and then the fusion of the known values guided by the similarities. Here we concentrate on a mixed scale situation, the similarities are numeric values but the missing information is drawn from an ordinal scale. We shown that the weighted median provides a fusion operation that can be used in this mixed scale environment. We look at some classes of nearest neighbor rules that can be expressed using this framework. Finally we turn to the problem of learning weighted median type rules and provide a learning algorithm.				9th International-Fuzzy-Systems-Association World Congress/20th North-American-Fuzzy-Information-Processing-Society, International Conference	JUL 25-28, 2001	Int Fuzzy Syst Assoc; N Amer Fuzzy Informat Proc Soc; IEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc; IEEE, Neural Networks Council	VANCOUVER, CANADA	0	0	0	0	0		0-7803-7078-3	WOS:000173245100171

However, it has some disadvantages. In this article, a modified version of CLUSTER/2 is proposed. Background knowledge can be conveyed to the system through semantic networks; differentiation among objects is calculating using semantic distance. A different quality evaluation is used to measure the quality of clustering in a more sensible way. The order dependence problem of overlap resolution is eliminated with a fuzzy k-nearest neighborhood technique. Finally, a hill-climbing algorithm is applied to determine the number of clusters automatically. These improvements provide a more stable and user-friendly clustering environment for the user, without changing the system architecture of CLUSTER/2.								0	0	0	0	0	0883-9514		WOS:000165217200001

A comparison study is done between two prototype representation schemes. The prototype search is done by a genetic algorithm which is able to generate novel prototypes (i.e. prototypes which are not among the training samples). It is shown that the generalized representation scheme is more powerful, giving significantly larger normalized interclass distances. It is also shown that both representation schemes with genetic algorithm give significantly better prototypes than a direct prototype selection algorithm, which can select only among the training samples.				15th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR-2000)	SEP 03-07, 2000	Int Assoc Pattern Recognit; Assoc Pattern Recognit & Image Anal; Ctr Visio Comp; Univ Autonoma Barcelona; Univ Politecn Catalunya; Comissionat Universitats Recerca, Generalitat Catalunya Dept Presidencia; Minist Ciencia Tecnol; Fdn Catalana Recerca; HP Invent	BARCELONA, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	1051-4651	0-7695-0751-4	WOS:000166814800182

Emerging patterns are associated with two data sets, and can be used to describe significant changes between the two data sets. To discover all EPs embedded in high-dimension and large-volume databases is a challenging problem due to the number of candidates. We describe a special type of EP, called jumping emerging patterns (JEPs) and review some properties of JEP spaces (the spaces of jumping emerging patterns). We describe efficient border-based algorithms to derive the boundary elements of JEP spaces. Moreover, we describe a new classifier, called DeEPs, which makes use of the discriminating power of emerging patterns. The experimental results show that the accuracy of DeEPs is much better than that of k-nearest neighbor and that of C5.0.				6th Asian Computing Science Conference	NOV 25-27, 2000	Asian Int Technol; Univ Sains Malaysia; Penang State Govt; INRIA; Natl Univ Singapore; UNU, IIST	GEORGE TOWN, MALAYSIA	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	3-540-41428-2	WOS:000171236800003

A new editing approach.								15TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION, VOL 2, PROCEEDINGS: PATTERN RECOGNITION AND NEURAL NETWORKS	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION						25	28					2000	2000	It is well known that editing techniques can be applied to (large) sets of prototypes in order to bring the error rate of the Nearest Neighbour classifier close to the optimal Bayes risk. However, in practice, the behaviour of these techniques uses to be much worse than expected from the asymptotic predictions. A novel editing technique is introduced here which explicitly aims at obtaining a good editing rule for each given prototype set. This is achieved by first learning an adequate assignment of a weight to each prototype and then pruning out those prototypes having large weights. Experiments are presented which clearly show the superiority of this new method, specially for small data sets and/or large dimensions.				15th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR-2000)	SEP 03-07, 2000	Int Assoc Pattern Recognit; Assoc Pattern Recognit & Image Anal; Ctr Visio Comp; Univ Autonoma Barcelona; Univ Politecn Catalunya; Comissionat Universitats Recerca, Generalitat Catalunya Dept Presidencia; Minist Ciencia Tecnol; Fdn Catalana Recerca; HP Invent	BARCELONA, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	1051-4651	0-7695-0751-4	WOS:000166814800006

To perform the method we have used 6 subjects and the calibration set is composed of 50 signatures for each class. The recognition process consists on the computation of 48 features for each image of the calibration set. Second, a feature extraction process, based in canonical variables analysis, is carried out in order to reduce the number of variables to be used. Finally, the classification process is performed by using different statistical methods: PCR, PLS, LDA, SIMCA, DASCO, and others. Results obtained show that incorrect signature detection errors are less than 3 % in all the techniques considered. However, by using LDA (linear discriminant analysis) the total error is less than 0.2 %. Moreover, the use of LDA is suggested due to the speed of the algorithm. These results prove the utility of this technique for signature automatic recognition.				15th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR-2000)	SEP 03-07, 2000	Int Assoc Pattern Recognit; Assoc Pattern Recognit & Image Anal; Ctr Visio Comp; Univ Autonoma Barcelona; Univ Politecn Catalunya; Comissionat Universitats Recerca, Generalitat Catalunya Dept Presidencia; Minist Ciencia Tecnol; Fdn Catalana Recerca; HP Invent	BARCELONA, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	1051-4651	0-7695-0751-4	WOS:000166814800224

Based upon a Markov random field model, this approach transforms the set of multidimensional observations into a normalised discret binary set, which represents the observable field. The field of classes is then represented by connex components corresponding to the cores, or prototypes, inside the samples.

The objective of the framework is to improve the performance of a base learning algorithm. It has the potential to be used for different types of base learning algorithms. LAZYRULE performs attribute elimination and training case selection using cross-validation to generate the most appropriate rule for each test case. At the consequent of the rule, it applies the base learning algorithm on the selected training subset and the remaining attributes to construct a classifier to make a prediction. This combined action seeks to build a better performing classifier for each test case than the classifier trained using all attributes and all training cases. We show empirically that LAZYRULE improves the performances of naive Bayesian classifiers and majority vote.				19th SGES International Conference on Knowledge-Based Systems and Applied Artificial Intelligence (ES99)	DEC 13-15, 1999	SGES; Appl AI	CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND	0	0	0	0	0		1-85233-231-X	WOS:000086321700008

We demonstrate that it is advantageous to first detect those ambiguous areas with the help of training data and then to re-classify those data in these areas as ambiguous before making class predictions on rest sets. This scheme is demonstrated with a simple example and benchmarked on two real world applications.

The possibility is left open, however, that limited, careful abstraction in memory-based learning may be harmless to generalization, as long as the disjunctivity of language data is preserved. We test this hypothesis, by comparing empirically a range of careful abstraction methods, focusing particularly on methods that (i) generalize instances and (ii) perform oblivious (partial) decision-tree abstraction. These methods are applied to a selection of language learning tasks, and their generalization performance as well as memory item compression rates are collected. On the basis of the results we conclude that when combined with feature weighting or value distance metrics, careful abstraction equals or outperforms pure memory-based learning, yet mainly on small data sets. In the concluding case study involving large data sets, we find that the FAMBL algorithm, a new careful abstractor which merges families of instances, performs close to pure memory-based learning, though it equals it only on three of the six tasks. On the basis of the gathered empirical results, we discuss the incorporation of the notion of instance families, i.e. carefully generalized instances, in memory-based language learning.								0	0	0	0	0	0952-813X		WOS:000082858000003

B	Blanzieri, E; Ricci, F						Bratko, I; Dzeroski, S		A minimum risk metric for Nearest Neighbor classification								MACHINE LEARNING, PROCEEDINGS							22	31					1999	1999	Nearest Neighbor is a well-known algorithm extensively studied by the Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning communities and widely exploited in Case Based Reasoning applications. The notion of metric is central to Nearest Neighbor's working and different feature weighting metrics have been proposed in order to increase its performance. In this work we present an original Probability Based Metric, i.e. a metric for classification tasks that relies on estimates of the posterior probabilities, called Minimum Risk Metric (MRM). MRM is optimal but it optimizes directly the finite misclassification risk whereas the Short and Fukunaga Metric minimize the difference between finite risk and asymptotic risk. An experimental comparison of MRM with Short and Fukunaga Metric, Value Difference Metric, and Euclidean-Hamming metrics on benchmark datasets shows that MRM outperforms the other metrics and performs comparably to the Bayes Classifier based on the same probability estimates. The results suggests that MRM can be useful in applications were the retrieval of a nearest neighbor is required (e.g. Case Based Reasoning).				16th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 99)	JUN 27-30, 1999	HERMES SoftLab; DaimlerChrysler Res & Technol Ctr; JerovsekComp; Jozef Stefan Inst; Micro Res; MLNET-II ESPRIT IV Project 29288; Slovenian Minist Sci & Technol; TEMIDA; TSE TRADE	BLED, SLOVENIA	0	0	0	0	0		1-55860-612-2	WOS:000178755300003

The proposed system is designed to operate on-line and to deal with the following characteristics: on-line adaptation of classes, detection of slow or abrupt changes and stabilization in a new state, on-line creation of new classes. To meet these requirements, classes are constructed sequentially with a fuzzy agglomerative clustering procedure. Such a clustering procedure requires only one pass through the data, the fuzzy prototypes are created or adapted as new observations are gathered. A prototype is labelled as it is created by using a k-Nearest Neighbours rule with a distance reject option. This labelling rule is well adapted for stationnary states and abrupt changes. However, this rule does not operate in case of incipient faults. To deal with this limitation, we define the concept of temporary prototype. To decide if this prototype is representative of a stationary state or a transient one we introduce a progressive hypotheses test based on the activation rate of the prototype. The results of a robustness study are presented. Finally, the diagnosis system operation is demonstrated on a simulated example.				18th International Conference of the North-American-Fuzzy-Information-Processing-Society (NAFIPS 99)	JUN 10-12, 1999	N Amer Fuzzy Informat Proc Soc; IEEE Neural Networks Council; IEEE Syst Man & Cybernet Soc	NEW YORK, NY	0	0	0	0	0		0-7803-5211-4	WOS:000081666600050

This paper considers the formal task of deriving such a classification function based on samples at different conditions. When the size of these samples is small relative to 1/p*, previously proposed methods incorrectly classify conditions that surpass the threshold by orders of magnitude. This paper derives general conditions for consistent and robust classifiers and presents specific methods that meet these conditions.

In many applications, however, the initial classification of the training set is a costly process, and an intelligently selection of training examples from unlabeled data is done by an active learner.This paper proposes a lookahead algorithm for example selection and addresses the problem of active learning in the context of nearest neighbor classifiers. The proposed approach relies on using a random field model for the example labeling, which implies a dynamic change of the label estimates during the sampling process.The proposed selective sampling algorithm was evaluated empirically on artificial and real data sets. The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms other methods in most cases.				16th National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-99)/11th Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI-99)	JUL 18-22, 1999	Amer Assoc Artificial Intelligence; ACM,SIGART; US Def, Adv Res Projects Agcy; Microsoft Corp; USN, Res Lab; USN, Off Naval Res; NASA, Ames Res Ctr; NSF; Rent Comp	ORLANDO, FL	0	0	0	0	0		0-262-51106-1	WOS:000089853000052

In this paper, we propose two learning algorithms for the fuzzy nearest neighbor classifiers: one is the learning of the certainty grade of each fuzzy if-then rule, and the other is the learning of the radius of its antecedent fuzzy set (i.e., the radius of the circular-cone type membership function). These two algorithms are based on a reward-punishment scheme. When a pattern is correctly classified the certainty grade of the winner fuzzy if-then rule and/or the radius of its antecedent fuzzy set ale increased. On the other hand, the certainty grade and/or the radius of the winner fuzzy if-then rule are decreased when a pattern is misclassified. We examine the learning algorithms by computer simulations on real-world pattern classification problems. We demonstrate that the performance of the fuzzy nearest neighbor classifiers is improved by the learning.				18th International Conference of the North-American-Fuzzy-Information-Processing-Society (NAFIPS 99)	JUN 10-12, 1999	N Amer Fuzzy Informat Proc Soc; IEEE Neural Networks Council; IEEE Syst Man & Cybernet Soc	NEW YORK, NY	0	0	0	0	0		0-7803-5211-4	WOS:000081666600075

J	Skerl, V								Human extracellular proteins display a different pattern of local sequence similarity with the four classes of human T-cell receptor V regions than foreign proteins and human intracellular proteins: a preliminary report								IMMUNOLOGY LETTERS			60	2-3			67	72		10.1016/S0165-2478(97)00139-9			FEB 1998	1998	A pool of 110 randomly selected/generated amino acids sequences was used to perform specific local sequence similarity alignment analysis with the pool of 279 reported sequences of human T-cell receptor (TCR) V-regions. The 110 analyzed sequences were divided, according to their origin and nature, into six protein groups, as: human intracellular (hi), extracellular/transmembrane (he) and extracellular adhesive matrix (ha) proteins, 'average' human proteins (hum), proteins of non-human origin (nhum) and randomly generated quasi-protein sequences (r). These sequences were decomposed into all their overlapping 11-mer segments, generating a total of 56 836 derived peptides (at least 8000 per group). Each derived peptide was aligned with the 279 human TCR V-regions and assigned to the category (alpha-like, beta-like, gamma-like or delta-like) corresponding to the class (V alpha, V beta, V gamma or V delta) of the V-region encompassing the most similar segment, as determined by the performed similarity-search. The six protein groups were found to differ significantly in their distribution of derived peptides among the four categories. According to the binomial tests results, human proteins from the extracellular compartment (he, ha) comprise a higher proportion of delta-like segments (P = 2.3 x 10(-2) and P < 10(-8), respectively) than the 'average' human proteins (hum). In addition, and in accordance with this finding, proteins that are normally not found in that topological compartment comprise a lower proportion of delta-like peptides (P = 1.4 x 10(-5) and P < 10(-8) for groups nhum and hi, respectively) than the 'average' human proteins (hum). In contrast, these proteins comprise a higher proportion of gamma-like segments (P = 8.3 x 10(-3), P = 1.4 x 10(-3) and P = 1.7 x 10(-4), for groups r, nhum and hi, respectively) than the 'average' human proteins (hum). These findings indicate significant differences between proteins encountered in the extracellular compartment-that are normally immunologically tolerated-and those the presence of which is usually non-tolerated. The results suggest that the discrimination and the reaction of the human immune network to proteins found in the extracellular compartment correlate with the proteins' pattern of preferential local sequence similarity with the V gamma and V delta classes of human TCR V-regions, implying a specific and an important role of gamma delta-cells in the maintenance of the immune homeostasis. Whether this implication represents a rule associated with self-tolerance, will be investigated by future analyses. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

It consists of five elementary steps: region pre-processing, region extraction, region-based motion estimation, region classification and region post-processing. Region pre-processing simplifies the input data. Region extraction finds the basic elements for classification. Region-based motion estimation provides the trajectory information about each basic element. Region classification determines the interior/exterior parts of semantic video objects. Finally, region post-processing cleans the results. We will show solid performance of this generic tracking system with pixel-wise accuracy for internet applications.

However, these studies only consider numerical similarity measures whereas there are other kinds of similarity measure for different tasks. Among:these measures, HYPO system [2, 3] in a legal domain uses a similarity measure based on set inclusion of differences of attributes in cases.In this paper, we give an analysis of representability of boolean functions in case-based classification using the above set inclusion based similarity. We show that such case-based classification has a strong connection between monotone theory studied in [4, 11]. Monotone theory is originated from computational learning theory and is used to show learnability of boolean function with polynomial DNF size and polynomial CNF size [4] and is used for deductive reasoning as well [11]. In this paper, we analyze a case-based representability of boolean functions by using the above relationship between the case-based classification by set inclusion based similarity and the monotone theory. We show that any boolean function is representable by a casebase whose size is bounded in polynomial of its DNF size and its CNF size and thus, k-term DNF, k-clause CNF can be efficiently representable in a casebase using set inclusion similarity.				9th International Conference on Algorithnic Learning Theory	OCT 08-10, 1998	Japanese Soc Artificial Intelligence; Univ Kaiserslautern	OTZENHAUSEN, GERMANY	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	3-540-65013-X	WOS:000083674100014

The performance of case-based reasoners is dependent upon the size of the case base such that as case bases increase in size, it is usually reasonable to expect accuracy to improve but computational performance to degrade. Given one of these large case bases, it is advantageous to attempt to induce structure from the case base whereby the diagnostic process can be made more efficient. In addition, certainty properties of case based reasoning make fault diagnosis difficult, in which case inducing structure and applying a method for reasoning under uncertainty becomes advantageous. In this chapter, we discuss an approach to analyzing a diagnostic case base and inducing a compact knowledge base using the diagnostic inference model with which efficient diagnostics can be performed. We then apply an approach to reasoning using Dempster-Shafer theory to improve the diagnostics further with the resultant model.				2nd International Workshop on System Test and Diagnosis	APR , 1998		ALEXANDRIA, VA	0	0	0	0	0		0-7923-8263-3	WOS:000081415400005

Traditional handoff algorithms generally cannot keep both the average number of unnecessary handoffs and the handoff decision delay low. They do not exploit the relative constancy of path loss and shadow fading effects at any given location around a base station. This information can in fact be used to improve the efficiency of handoff algorithms, as we do in our new handoff algorithms using pattern recognition. Handoff algorithms with both a negligible number of unnecessary handoffs and a negligible decision delay can therefore be realized.

S	Dzeroski, S; Schulze-Kremer, S; Heidtke, KR; Siems, K; Wettschereck, D						Muggleton, S		Applying ILP to diterpene structure elucidation from C-13 NMR spectra								INDUCTIVE LOGIC PROGRAMMING	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		1314				41	54					1997	1997	We present a novel application of ILP to the problem of diterpene structure elucidation from C-13 NMR spectra. Diterpenes are organic compounds of low molecular weight that are based on a skeleton of 20 carbon atoms. They are of significant chemical and commercial interest because of their use as lead compounds in the search for new pharmaceutical effecters. The structure elucidation of diterpenes based on C-13 NMR spectra is usually done manually by human experts with specialized background knowledge on peak patterns and chemical structures. In the process, each of the 20 skeletal atoms is assigned an atom number that; corresponds to its proper place in the skeleton and the diterpene is classified into one of the possible skeleton types. We address the problem of learning classification rules from a database of peak patterns for diterpenes with known structure. Recently, propositional learning was successfully applied to learn classification rules from spectra with assigned atom numbers. As the assignment of atom numbers is a difficult process in itself (and possibly indistinguishable from the classification process), we apply ILP, i.e., relational learning, to the problem of classifying spectra without assigned atom numbers.				6th International Workshop on Logic Program Synthesis and Transformation (LOPSTR 96) / 6th Inductive Logic Programming Workshop (ILP 96)	AUG 28-30, 1996	Network Computat Log; European Commiss, ESPRIT Compulog Net	STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	3-540-63494-0	WOS:000082727500003

The conceptual ship design process begins with selecting previously designed reference ships of the same type with similar sizes and speeds. These reference ships are used for deriving an initial design of a new ship, and then the initial design is kept modified and repaired until the design reaches a level of satisfactory quality. The selection of good reference ships is essential for deriving a good initial design, and the quality of the initial design affects the efficiency and quality of the whole conceptual design process. The selection of reference ships has so far been done by design experts relying on their experience and engineering knowledge of ship design and structural mechanics. We developed an MBL method that can build an effective indexing scheme for retrieving good reference cases from a case base of previous ship designs. Empirical results show that the indexing scheme generated by MBL outperforms those by other learning methods such as the decision tree learning.				2nd International Conference on Case-Based Reasoning (ICCBR-97)	JUL 25-27, 1997		PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND	0	0	0	0	0		3-540-63233-6	WOS:000073947800008	
B	Okamoto, S; Yugami, N						Leake, DB; Plaza, E		Theoretical analysis of case retrieval method based on neighborhood of a new problem								CASE-BASED REASONING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		1266				349	358					1997	1997	The retrieval of similar cases is often performed by using the neighborhood of a new problem. The neighborhood is usually defined by a certain fixed number of most similar cases (Ic nearest neighbors) to the problem. This paper deals with an alternative definition of neighborhood that comprises the cases within a certain distance, d, from the problem. We present an average-case analysis of a classifier, the d-nearest neighborhood method (d-NNh); that retrieves cases in this neighborhood and predicts their majority class as the class of the problem. Our analysis deals with m-of-n/l target concepts, and handles three types of noise. We formally compute the expected classification accuracy of d-NNh, then we explore the predicted behavior of d-NNh. By combining this exploration for d-NNh and one for k-nearest neighbor method (k-NN) in our previous study, we compare the predicted behavior of each in noisy domains. Our formal analysis is supported with Monte Carlo simulations.				2nd International Conference on Case-Based Reasoning (ICCBR-97)	JUL 25-27, 1997		PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND	0	0	0	0	0		3-540-63233-6	WOS:000073947800033

As such, we are concerned with circumventing the "curse of dimensionality." Our approach, termed "approximate distance clustering," is motivated by dimensionality reduction methods which embed points from a high-dimensional Euclidean space into a lower dimensional space while approximately preserving pairwise distances between points. The methodology involves non-linear projections based on inter-point distances to random subsets. Combinatorial algorithms are developed and theoretical, simulation, and experimental results are presented indicating that approximate distance clustering has application in many challenging pattern recognition scenarios.				29th Symposium on the Interface between Computing Science and Statistics	MAY 14-17, 1997	Univ Texas M D Anderson Cancer Ctr; Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr; Sch Public Hlth; W M Keck Ctr Computational Biol	HOUSTON, TX	0	0	0	0	0		1-886658-04-8	WOS:000079222400085

High resolution MR imaging was performed in five normals, six patients with brain MS, and six with malignant brain tumors. Three inputs: proton density, T2 weighted fast spin-echo, T1-weighted spin echo MR images were routinely utilized. As a fourth input, either magnetization transfer MRI was used in normals and some patients or T1 weighted post contract MRI in other patients. Modified k-Nearest Neighbor segmentation algorithm was optimized for maximum computation speed and high quality segmentation. In that regard: 1) we discarded the redundant seed points, 2) discarded the points within 0.5 standard deviation from the cluster center that were non overlapping with other tissue classes, 3) we removed outlying seed points outside 5 times the standard deviation from the cluster center of each tissue class. Our new technique utilizing all four MRI inputs provided better segmentation than that based on three inputs. (p<0.001) The tissues were smoother and the delineation of the tissues was increased. Details that were previously blurred or invisible now became apparent. In normals, detailed depiction of deep gray matter nuclei was obtained. In malignant tumors, up to five abnormal tissue were identified: 1) solid tumor core, 2) cyst, 3) edema in white matter 4) edema in gray matter and 5) necrosis. Delineation of MS plaque in different stages of demyelination, became much sharper. In conclusion, proposed methodology warrants further development and clinical evaluation.

Earlier experiments have demonstrated the utility of background knowledge when learning rules for early diagnosis of rheumatic diseases. A particular form of background knowledge comprising typical co-occurrences of several groups of attributes was provided by a medical expert. This paper explores the possibility to automate the process of acquiring background knowledge of this kind. A method based on function decomposition is proposed that identifies typical co-occurrences for a given set of attributes, The method is evaluated by comparing the typical co-occurrences it identifies, as well as their contribution to the performance of machine learning algorithms, to the ones provided by a medical expert.				6th Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Europe (AIME 97)	MAR 23-26, 1997	Univ Joseph fourier, Grenoble; CNRS; Grenoble Isere Dev, France; Assoc Francaise Intelligence Artificielle	GRENOBLE, FRANCE	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	3-540-62709-X	WOS:A1997BJ62U00010

Computer programs have been written in the MATLAB environment for the following purposes: automatic retrieval of SAMS data from NASA CDROM disks, computation of power spectral densities for SAMS data and construction of input patterns for the training of a multi-layer neural network (MNN). The MNN has been trained using the backpropagation learning algorithm and the SAMS data collected on the STS-50 Space Shuttle mission for three crew exercise events. It is found that the trained MNN is highly successful in classifying events. In addition, the performance of MNN is found to be better than that of the nearest neighbor classifier.								0	0	0	0	0	0938-0108		WOS:A1996WM69300009

This study is motivated by possible applications for on-line event selection. Networks consisting of linear threshold units are generated by a constructive learning algorithm, the Patch algorithm. As a non-constructive counterpart the back-propagation algorithm is applied. This algorithm makes use of analogue neurons. The generalization capabilities of the neural networks resulting from both methods are compared to those of nearest-neighbour classifiers and of Probabilistic Neural Networks implementing Parzen-windows. The latter non-parametric statistical method is applied to estimate the optimal Bayesian classifier. For all methods the generalization capabilities are determined for different ways of pre-processing of the input data. The complexity of the feed-forward neural networks studied does not grow with the training set size. This favours a hardwired implementation of these neural networks as any implementation of the other two methods grows linearly with the training set size.								0	0	0	0	0	0168-9002		WOS:A1995QJ70600051

The Neural Network provides for every input character a fuzzy character built up with the ouput unit values. The fuzzy characters are the inputs for the Deformed System which is defined as an automaton representing the dictionary and whose behaviour is fuzzily constrained by fuzzy inputs. Therefore the classification and contextual processes are computed together. Experimental results show good performance for the system.

This paper studies the problem to find an efficient S such that all tasks in T can be fulfilled using the smallest I. The individual evolutionary algorithm (IEA) is proposed to solve this problem. By IEA, each individual finds and adapts itself to a class of tasks through evolution, and an efficient S can be obtained automatically. The EIA consists of four operations: competition, gain, less and retraining. Competition tests the performance of the recent I and the fitness of each individual; gain increases the performance of I by adding new individuals; loss makes I more compact by removing individuals with very low fitness, and individuals are adjusted by retraining to make them better. An evolution cycle is: competition boolean AND (gain boolean OR loss) boolean AND retraining, and the evolution is performed cycle after cycle until some criterion is satisfied. The performance of IEA is verified by applying it to the learning of nearest neighbor based multilayer perceptrons.

The most common such learning technique is the nearest neighbor method, in which new instances are classified according to the closest training instance. A critical element of any such method is the metric used to determine distance between instances. Euclidean distance is by far the most commonly used metric; no one, however, has systematically considered whether a different metric, such as Manhattan distance, might perform equally well on naturally occurring data sets. Some evidence from psychological research indicates that Manhattan distance might be preferable in some circumstances. This paper examines three different distance metrics and presents experimental comparisons using data from three domains: malignant cancer classification, heart disease diagnosis, and diabetes prediction. The results of these studies indicate that the Manhattan distance metric works works quite well, although not better than the Euclidean metric that has become a standard for machine learning experiments. Because the nearest neighbor technique provides a good benchmark for comparisons with other learning algorithms, the results below include a number of such comparisons, which show that nearest neighbor, using any distance metric, compares quite well to other machine learning techniques.								0	0	0	0	0			WOS:A1991KV08300041
