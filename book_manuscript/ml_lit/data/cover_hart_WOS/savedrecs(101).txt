J	Domshlak, Carmel; Karpas, Erez; Markovitch, Shaul								Online Speedup Learning for Optimal Planning								JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			44				709	755					2012	2012	Domain-independent planning is one of the foundational areas in the field of Artificial Intelligence. A description of a planning task consists of an initial world state, a goal, and a set of actions for modifying the world state. The objective is to find a sequence of actions, that is, a plan, that transforms the initial world state into a goal state. In optimal planning, we are interested in finding not just a plan, but one of the cheapest plans. A prominent approach to optimal planning these days is heuristic state-space search, guided by admissible heuristic functions. Numerous admissible heuristics have been developed, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and it is well known that there is no single "best" heuristic for optimal planning in general. Thus, which heuristic to choose for a given planning task is a difficult question. This difficulty can be avoided by combining several heuristics, but that requires computing numerous heuristic estimates at each state, and the tradeoff between the time spent doing so and the time saved by the combined advantages of the different heuristics might be high. We present a novel method that reduces the cost of combining admissible heuristics for optimal planning, while maintaining its benefits. Using an idealized search space model, we formulate a decision rule for choosing the best heuristic to compute at each state. We then present an active online learning approach for learning a classifier with that decision rule as the target concept, and employ the learned classifier to decide which heuristic to compute at each state. We evaluate this technique empirically, and show that it substantially outperforms the standard method for combining several heuristics via their pointwise maximum.								0	0	0	0	0	1076-9757		WOS:000307805400001

As usual, simplicity and high performance are two sides of a same coin. Our aim is to explore an easy-to-use classifier without losing its effectiveness. On this account, a single attribute based classification (SAC) algorithm is proposed. SAC first splits the original data set into multi one-dimensional data sets. After that, it creates a base classifier, e.g. C4.5, for each one-dimensional data, and then selects all classifiers having the highest accuracy. At last, SAC uses these selected classifiers to make prediction and the most frequent label is assigned to the new instance. Results of classification accuracy on 16 data sets from UCI machine learning repository indicate that the proposed method performs better in comparison with classical OneR algorithm. Experiments on high-dimensional data are also conducted to evaluate the proposed method, which demonstrates its scalability.

The new classifier is called as limited nearest feature line (LNFL). The purpose of LNFL is to improve the miss-classification of nearest feature line when the prototypes in NFL are far away from the query sample. A lot of experiments are executed on ORL and AR face database. And the detailed comparison result is given to show that LNFL is better than nearest feature line and nearest neighbor.				3rd International Conference on Information Security and Intelligent Control (ISIC)	AUG 14-16, 2012	IEEE; Natl Chiayi Univ; Natl Penghu Univ Sci & Technol (NPU); Natl Sci Council (NSC); Minist Educ (MOE); IEEE Signal Proc Soc	Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol (YunTech), Yunlin, TAIWAN	0	0	0	0	0		978-1-4673-2588-2	WOS:000317434500079

In that context, grazing, mowing and a mix of these two managements are commonly used by the farmers on grassland fields. These practices and their intensity of use have different environmental impact. Thus, the objectives of this study are, firstly, to identify grassland management practices using a time series of optical and radar imagery at high spatial resolution and, secondly, to evaluate the contribution of radar data to improve identification of farming practices on grasslands. Because of cloud coverage and revisit frequency of satellite, the number of available optical data is limited during the vegetation period. Thus, radar data can be considered as an ideal complement. The present study is based on the use of SPOT, Landsat and RADARSAT-2 data, acquired in 2010 during the growing period. After a pre-processing step, several vegetation indices, biophysical variables, backscattering coefficients and polarimetric discriminators were computed on the data set. Then, with the help of some statistics, the most discriminating variables have been identified and used to classify grassland fields. In addition, to take into account the temporal variation of variables, dedicated indexes as first and second order derivatives were used. Classification process was based on training samples resulting from field campaigns and computed according six methods: Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbor, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, the Naive Bayes Classifier and Linear Discriminant Analysis. Results show that combined use of optical and radar remote sensing data is not more efficient for grassland management identification.

APPLICATION TO OSTEOPOROSIS DIAGNOSIS ON BONE RADIOGRAPHS								2012 9TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON BIOMEDICAL IMAGING (ISBI)							1487	1490					2012	2012	In this paper(1), we propose a new method based on texture analysis for trabecular bone disease diagnosis. For this purpose, we present a working model based on a preprocessing step followed by a projection on a 1D oriented axis at a defined angle. First, the dual-tree transform M-band is applied on the 1D obtained signal. Then, the Renyi based information measure is computed on sub-bands coefficients in order to characterize the anisotropy which is strongly present in our application related to bone radiograph characterization. Finally, the Wilcoxon test is used on the Renyi entropies obtained for each subband and the K nearest neighborhoods classifier is used with the Renyi divergence as a distance. Applied on two different populations composed of osteoporotic (OP) patients and control (CT) subjects, a classification rate of 98% is achieved which provides a good discrimination between OP patients and CT subjects.				9th IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) - From Nano to Macro	MAY 02-05, 2012	IEEE; IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS); IEEE Signal Proc Soc	Barcelona, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0		978-1-4577-1858-8	WOS:000312384100385

Thus some classification tasks that constantly need a training procedure may favor k-NN if high efficiency is needed. However, k-NN is prone to be affected by the underlying data distribution. In this paper, we define a new neighborhood relationship, called passive nearest neighbors, which is deemed to be able to counteract with the variation of data densities. Based on which we develop a new classifier called active and passive nearest neighbor algorithm (APNNA). The classifier is evaluated by 10-fold cross-validation on 10 randomly chosen benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that APNNA performs better than other classifiers on some datasets and worse on some other datasets, indicating that APNNA is a good complement to the current state-of-the-art of classification.				7th International Conference on Intelligent Computing (ICIC)	AUG 11-14, 2011	IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc; Int Neural Network Soc; Natl Sci Fdn China	Zhengzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-642-25943-2	WOS:000306498200025

J	Guo, Yu; Balasubramanian, Raji								Comparative Evaluation of Classifiers in the Presence of Statistical Interactions between Features in High Dimensional Data Settings								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOSTATISTICS			8	1					17	10.1515/1557-4679.1373			2012	2012	Background: A central challenge in high dimensional data settings in biomedical investigations involves the estimation of an optimal prediction algorithm to distinguish between different disease phenotypes. A significant complicating aspect in these analyses can be attributed to the presence of features that exhibit statistical interactions. Indeed, in several clinical investigations such as genetic studies of complex diseases, it is of interest to specifically identify such features. In this paper, we compare the performance of four commonly used classifiers (K-Nearest Neighbors, Prediction Analysis for Microarrays, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines) in settings involving high dimensional datasets including statistically interacting feature subsets. We evaluate the performance of these classifiers under conditions of varying sample size, levels of signal-to-noise ratio and strength of statistical interactions among features. We summarize two datasets from studies in diabetes and cardiovascular disease involving gene expression, metabolomics and proteomics measurements and compare results obtained using the four classifiers.Results: Simulation studies revealed that the classifier Prediction Analysis of Microarrays had the highest classification accuracy in the absence of noise, statistical interactions and when feature distributions were multivariate Gaussian within each class. In the presence of statistical interactions, modest effect sizes and the absence of noise, Support Vector Machines achieved the best performance followed closely by Random Forests. Random Forests was optimal in settings that included both significant levels of high dimensional noise features and statistical interactions between biomarker pairs. The data applications revealed similar trends in the relative performances of each classifier.Conclusion: Random Forests had the highest classification accuracy among the four classifiers and was successful in incorporating interaction effects between features in the presence of noise in high dimensional datasets.								0	0	0	0	0	1557-4679		WOS:000305953300005

Surprisingly, the space used by the data-structure is (O) over tilde (n/k); that is, the space used is sublinear in the input size if k is sufficiently large. Our approach provides a novel way to summarize geometric data, such that meaningful proximity queries on the data can be carried out using this sketch. Using this we provide a sublinear space data-structure that can estimate the density of a point set under various measures, including: (i) sum of distances of k closest points to the query point, and (ii) sum of squared distances of k closest points to the query point. Our approach generalizes to other distance based estimation of densities of similar flavor.

Well log denoising and geological enhancement based on discrete wavelet transform and hybrid thresholding								ENERGY EXPLORATION & EXPLOITATION			30	3			417	433					2012	2012	Well logging is an important tool for the characterization of subsurface rocks, being commonly used in the study of reservoir geology. It is well known that signals obtained as responses from geological media contain noise that can affect their interpretation, and that wavelet transform is more suitable than the Fourier transform to denoise non-stationary signals, as the ones obtained from well logs. On the other hand, there are several parameters that must be considered when working with wavelet transform, such as the choice of the wavelet basis function (mother wavelet), the decomposition level and also the function and rules that "control" which and how the coefficients will be used for signal reconstruction. This study analyzes the process of denoising well log data by discrete wavelet transform. Since the well log data are usually used in lithological classification, we propose a method associated with the k-nearest neighbor classification algorithm to investigate how different combinations of parameters affect the output signals and its performance in the classification, thus making it a data driven process. We propose a new thresholding function that shows better results when compared with traditional ones. The potential of wavelet transform as a tool to aid geological interpretation is evidenced by the identification of important geological features of the Namorado Field, Campos Basin, Brazil.								0	0	0	0	0	0144-5987		WOS:000304683500006

IEEE					Application of Data Mining to Candidate Screening								2012 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED COMMUNICATION CONTROL AND COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES (ICACCCT)							287	290					2012	2012	Classification models are supervised learning methods used for predicting the value of a categorical target attribute. These models use a set of examples, called the training set, to learn to predict the target class of a future example whose class is unknown. The development of learning algorithms capable of learning from past experience is an important step in emulating inductive learning in humans. Classification finds application in many domains, of which selection of customers for a marketing campaign, fraud detection, diagnosis of diseases, image recognition, and spam e-mail filtering are just a few examples. In this paper, we present a comparative study of the application of the Naive Bayes and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classification methods to the problem of screening candidates for a vacant position in an organization. The observable attributes of a candidate profile are first established. In the training phase, a training set of example profiles is used for learning the classification rules of the organization. In the test phase, the accuracy of the classification model is assessed by classifying example profiles not included in the training set, but for which the target class is already known. In the prediction phase, a profile whose target class is not known is classified. We present the results of the comparison of the Naive Bayes method with the kNN method.

One problem with this algorithm is the choice of k value. Different k values can have a large impact on the predictive accuracy of the algorithm, and picking a good value is generally unintuitive by looking at the data set. Cross-validation over multiple folds is often used to find the best value for k in kNN based on prediction results. In this paper, we propose automatic selection of neighboring instances as defined by a dynamic local region unique to each instance, as opposed to the traditional approach of considering the manually specified k nearest neighbors. Removing the need to select an appropriate k value removes the cross-validation step, which improves the computational performance of the algorithm. Classification accuracy achieved by this approach is only slightly lower than the results of using kNN with an optimally selected k value.				13th IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration (IEEE IRI) / DIM / WICSOC / IEEE EM- RITE / IRI-HI	AUG 08-10, 2012	IEEE Syst Man & Cybernet Soc (IEEE SMC); Soc Informat Reuse & Integrat (SIRI); IEEE	Las Vegas, NV	0	0	0	0	0		978-1-4673-2284-3	WOS:000312540300017

In SG systems, voltage, current, frequency and phase measurements can be collected in real-time using phasor measurement units (PMUs). Based on the wavelet analysis of these measurements, the signal features can be extracted by computing the maximum wavelet transform coefficients (WTCs) and further processing them with a new hybrid clustering algorithm. The clustered signal features then form a fault contour map which can be used to locate faults in the SG system accurately. Both long-term and short-term faults of transmission line, transformer, generator, and load, which are major components of SG systems, are simulated in PSCAD and PowerWorld using the IEEE New England 39-bus system to verify the proposed method. The numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed method for accurate fault localization in SG systems.				46th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers	NOV 04-07, 2012	Naval Postgraduate Sch; ATK Miss Res; IEEE Signal Proc Soc	Pacific Grove, CA	0	0	0	0	0	1058-6393	978-1-4673-5051-8	WOS:000320768400070

This undertaking requires developing algorithms that integrate genome-scale data, even for model organisms. Gene relevance networks have emerged as a powerful representative of the structure of the data. Such networks can be used for intra-species transfer of gene annotations following the guilt-by-association principle. An analogous principle can serve as a basis for inter-species transfer of gene annotations by comparing well-defined subnetworks. In this review, we compare and contrast the concepts of relevance and proximity networks and briefly review the concept of semantic similarity. We then provide a detailed account of quantitative guilt-by-association inference in the setting of genome-scale relevance networks. Moreover, we systematically survey the existing network-based approaches for automated gene function annotation and categorize them under one umbrella in terms of employed methodology. Furthermore, we discuss suitable data selection strategies required for deriving meaningful and unbiased genome-scale networks from large transcriptomics compendia. Lastly, by simulating gene function prediction with a classical network-based algorithm, we show how the number of genes of unknown function influences prediction within a species and pinpoint the need and the requirements for inter-species knowledge transfer.								0	0	0	0	0	1742-206X		WOS:000307014300001

By combining two types of classifiers with varying parameterizations to ensembles, we reduce the classification error, and increase the robustness of the classifier. In the experimental part we consider a field study with household appliances, and compare the classifiers w.r.t. various training set and neighborhood sizes. It turns out that the ensembles belong to the best classifiers in all training set scenarios.				7th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligent Systems (HAIS)	MAR 28-30, 2012	IEEE-Secc Espana; IEEE Syst; Man & Cybernet-Capitulo Espanol; AEPIA; World Federat Soft Comp; MIR Labs; IT4 Innovat Ctr Excellence; Int Federat Computat Log; Ministerio Economia Competitividad; Junta Castilla Leon; Ayuntamiento Salamanca; Univ Salamanca	Salamanca, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-642-28941-5	WOS:000309166900029

Conventionally, in classification problems, the roles of feature extraction and classification have been distinct, i.e., a feature extraction method and a classifier are applied sequentially to classify input variable into several categories. In this paper, these two steps are combined into one resulting in a good classification performance. More specifically, each principal component is treated as a weak classifier in Adaboost algorithm to constitute a strong classifier for binary classification problems. The proposed algorithm is applied to UCI data set and showed better recognition rates than sequential application of feature extraction and classification methods such as PCA+1NN and PCA+SVM.

The method is based on probability maps derived from a K-Nearest Neighbours classification. These are used as a non parametric likelihood in a Bayesian formulation with a prior that assumes connectivity of neighbouring voxels. The formulation is solved using the method of Iterated Conditional Modes (ICM). The parameters of the method are found through leave-one-out cross validation on training data after which it is evaluated on previously unseen test data. The multi modal features investigated are 3 structural MRI modalities, the diffusion MRI measures of Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Mean Diffusivity (MD) and several spatial features. Results show a benefit from the inclusion of diffusion primarily to the most difficult cases. Results shows that combining probabilistic K-Nearest Neighbour with a Markov Random Field formulation leads to a slight improvement of segmentations.				9th International Conference on Image Analysis and Recognition (ICIAR)	JUN 25-27, 2012	Assoc Image & Machine Intelligence (AIMI)	Aveiro, PORTUGAL	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-642-31298-4	WOS:000323559300019

In many applications today, user interaction is moving away from traditional keyboards and mouses and is becoming much more physical, pervasive and intuitive. This paper examines hand gestures as an alternative or supplementary input modality for mobile devices. A new gesture recognition system based on the use of acceleration sensor, that is nowadays being featured in a growing number of consumer electronic devices, is presented. Accelerometer sensor readings can be used for detection of hand movements and their classification into previously trained gestures. The proposed system utilizes Mahalanobis distance metric learning to improve the accuracy of nearest neighbour classification. In the approach we adopted, the objective function for metric learning is convex and, therefore, the required optimization can be cast as an instance of semidefinite programming. The experiments, carried out to evaluate system performance, demonstrate its efficacy.				22nd IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP)	SEP 23-26, 2012	IEEE; IEEE Signal Proc Soc	Santander, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0		978-1-4673-1026-0	WOS:000311966000008	
S	Mi, Jian-Xun						Huang, D; Gan, Y; Premaratne, P; Han, K		A New Subspace Approach for Face Recognition								BIO-INSPIRED COMPUTING AND APPLICATIONS	Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics		6840				551	557					2012	2012	In this paper, we proposed a new linear regression-based approach for face recognition, called farthest subspace classification. In previous literatures, it was believed that the facial images from a specific object class tend to lie on a linear subspace, i.e. the class-specific subspace. Therefore a query image will be considered belonging to its nearest subspace (NS) of a class. The distance from a query image to each class-specific subspace is calculated simply by the linear regression. In this paper, we proposed a novel notion of face recognition that in the complete feature space spanned by all the gallery images, each class-specific subspace has not only common subspace shared by every class-specific subspace, but also its unique coordinate bases, which are available discriminative information. Based on this notion, we develop farthest subspace (FS) classifier to perform face recognition. The experimental results supported the proposed novel concept. Furthermore, we proposed nearest-farthest subspace (NFS) classification using both NS and FS rules, which outperform NS used alone.				7th International Conference on Intelligent Computing (ICIC)	AUG 11-14, 2011	IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc; Int Neural Network Soc; Natl Sci Fdn China	Zhengzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-642-24552-7	WOS:000314259000073

As prototype selection (PS) is a combinatorial problem we attempt, in this paper, to address it using an Ant Colony algorithm. This work proposes an Ant Prototype Reducing algorithm (Ant-PR). The goal of this algorithm is to reduce the training set of the 1NN classifier. We compared the Ant-PR performances to two classical well-known kNN condensing algorithms. The results provide evidence that: (1) Ant-PR is competitive with the well-known kNN algorithms; (2) The condensed sets computed by Ant-PR offers better classification accuracy then those obtained by the compared algorithms.				15th IEEE International Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) / 10th IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (EUC)	DEC 05-07, 2012	IEEE; IFIP; IEEE Comp Soc; Univ Cyprus; IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Scalable Comp (TCSC)	Paphos, CYPRUS	0	0	0	0	0	1949-0828	978-1-4673-5165-2	WOS:000317475000040

J	Morales, Domingo; Vajda, Igor								GENERALIZED INFORMATION CRITERIA FOR BAYES DECISIONS								KYBERNETIKA			48	4			714	749					2012	2012	This paper deals with Bayesian models given by statistical experiments and standard loss functions. Bayes probability of error and Bayes risk are estimated by means of classical and generalized information criteria applicable to the experiment. The accuracy of the estimation is studied. Among the information criteria studied in the paper is the class of posterior power entropies which include the Shannon entropy as special case for the power alpha = 1. It is shown that the most accurate estimate is in this class achieved by the quadratic posterior entropy of the power alpha = 2. The paper introduces and studies also a new class of alternative power entropies which in general estimate the Bayes errors and risk more tightly than the classical power entropies. Concrete examples, tables and figures illustrate the obtained results.								0	0	0	0	0	0023-5954		WOS:000310190200006

To compensate, a number of variant algorithms have been developed that condense the model size of the k-NN classifier at the expense of accuracy. To increase the accuracy of these condensed models, we present a direct boosting algorithm for the k-NN classifier that creates an ensemble of models with locally modified distance weighting. An empirical study conducted on 10 standard databases from the UCI repository shows that this new Boosted k-NN algorithm has increased generalization accuracy in the majority of the datasets and never performs worse than standard k-NN.

In this paper, we consider the problem of human identification using eye movement information. This problem, which is usually called the eye movement identification problem, can be solved by training a multi-class classification model to predict a person's identity from his or her eye movements. In this work, we propose using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) to encode various features for the classification model. Our experiments show that using MFCCs to represent useful features such as eye position, eye difference, and eye velocity would result in a much better accuracy than using Fourier transform, cepstrum, or raw representations. We also compare various classification models for the task. From our experiments, linear-kernel SVMs achieve the best accuracy with 93.56% and 91.08% accuracy on the small and large datasets respectively. Besides, we conduct experiments to study how the movements of each eye contribute to the final classification accuracy.

A comparison study of nonparametric imputation methods								STATISTICS AND COMPUTING			22	1			273	285		10.1007/s11222-010-9223-y			JAN 2012	2012	Consider estimation of a population mean of a response variable when the observations are missing at random with respect to the covariate. Two common approaches to imputing the missing values are the nonparametric regression weighting method and the Horvitz-Thompson (HT) inverse weighting approach. The regression approach includes the kernel regression imputation and the nearest neighbor imputation. The HT approach, employing inverse kernel-estimated weights, includes the basic estimator, the ratio estimator and the estimator using inverse kernel-weighted residuals. Asymptotic normality of the nearest neighbor imputation estimators is derived and compared to kernel regression imputation estimator under standard regularity conditions of the regression function and the missing pattern function. A comprehensive simulation study shows that the basic HT estimator is most sensitive to discontinuity in the missing data patterns, and the nearest neighbors estimators can be insensitive to missing data patterns unbalanced with respect to the distribution of the covariate. Empirical studies show that the nearest neighbor imputation method is most effective among these imputation methods for estimating a finite population mean and for classifying the species of the iris flower data.								0	0	0	0	0	0960-3174		WOS:000297543400019

The proposed method is called Nearest Cluster Classifier (NCC). Inspiring the traditional K-NN algorithm, the main idea is to classify a test sample according to the tag of its nearest neighbor. First, the train set is clustered into a number of partitions. By obtaining a number of partitions employing several runnings of a simple clustering algorithm, NCC algorithm extracts a large number of clusters out of the partitions. Then, the label of each cluster center produced in the previous step is determined employing the majority vote mechanism between the class labels of the patterns in the cluster. The NCC algorithm iteratively adds a cluster to a pool of the selected clusters that are considered as the train set of the final 1-NN classifier as long as the 1-NN classifier performance over a set of patterns included the train set and the validation set improves. The selected set of the most accurate clusters are considered as the train set of final 1-NN classifier. After that, the class label of a new test sample is determined according to the class label of the nearest cluster center. Computationally, the NCC is about K times faster than KNN. The proposed method is evaluated on some real datasets from UCI repository. Empirical studies show an excellent improvement in terms of both accuracy and time complexity in comparison with KNN classifier.				7th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligent Systems (HAIS)	MAR 28-30, 2012	IEEE-Secc Espana; IEEE Syst; Man & Cybernet-Capitulo Espanol; AEPIA; World Federat Soft Comp; MIR Labs; IT4 Innovat Ctr Excellence; Int Federat Computat Log; Ministerio Economia Competitividad; Junta Castilla Leon; Ayuntamiento Salamanca; Univ Salamanca	Salamanca, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-642-28941-5	WOS:000309166900024

Number of cells in an ICC image is considered as one of the most important indicators in the examination process. In this paper, an image analysis approach is proposed in order to count the number of cells in an ICC images. For this purpose, morphological filtering is done to clean up noise. Then, nucleuses and antibodies are separated by classifying relevant colors using a Nearest Neighbor classifier. Finally, the adherent cells are segmented by learning a Genetic model and the number of cells has been counted. The experiments have been conducted on a dataset of ICC images which are collected for this research.

Proper identification of insulation failure in power transformer is vital to take appropriate corrective measure. In the present work, seven types of series insulation failures are simulated in EMTP based digital model of 33 kV winding of 3 MVA power transformer. Resultant winding currents of each insulation failures are acquired following the tank current method for the time span of 0-500 mu s. By correlating healthy and faulty winding currents of 3 MVA transformer, significant time-frequency domain features are extracted by employing cross-wavelet transform. Using extracted features, the k - Nearest Neighbor classifier has successfully identified and localized all seven different types of disc-to-disc insulation failures within +/- 9% winding length with acceptable accuracy. Simulation of insulation failures, feature extraction and fault identification are explained.				10th IEEE International Conference on the Properties and Applications of Dielectric Materials (ICPADM)	JUL 24-28, 2012	IEEE, DEIS; Cent Power Res Inst	Bangalore, INDIA	0	0	0	0	0		978-1-4673-2850-0	WOS:000310350500092

Through simulation it was shown that one could make use of low resolution descriptor patterns to decrease the total time requirements of recalling a learnt association. However, such a method introduced a dependence on a set of new parameters which define the structure of the hierarchy. In this work we compute the expected retrieval time for the random neural activity regime which maximises the capacity of the Willshaw model and we study the task of finding the optimal hierarchy parametrisation with respect to the derived temporal expectation. Still in regard to this performance measure, we investigate some asymptotic properties of the algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.								0	0	0	0	0	0893-6080		WOS:000298725900009

Thus, ensemble of classifiers has emerged as one of the hot topics in multiclass classification tasks for imbalance problem for data mining and machine learning domain. Ensemble learning is an effective technique that has increasingly been adopted to combine multiple learning algorithms to improve overall prediction accuraciesand may outperform any single sophisticated classifiers.

These sites offer new approaches for customers that have demonstrated a strong tendency towards making last minute reservations. This scenario has dramatically affected the task of predicting hotel bookings, making these estimations is now much more complex using the traditional forecasting models. Given the importance of this estimation, it is crucial to find more accurate prediction models that take into account these new situations. This work aims to develop an application to predict hotel room reservations that tackles the consequences of last-minute reservations. Our proposal combines genetic algorithms optimization and truncated mean k-nearest neighbours regressor.

Sequences of operational codes are extracted as features from malware and benign files. These sequences are used to produce three different data sets with different configurations. A set of learning algorithms is evaluated on the data sets and the predictions are combined by the ensemble algorithm. The predicted output is decided on the basis of veto voting.

Ensemble learning is one of widely used techniques for improving the generalization ability of classification models. In this paper, rough set and decision tree ensemble is combined to construct the hybrid classification approach to increase the performance of the prediction of agricultural data. In the proposed approach, rough set theory is employed as a preprocessor to reduce the redundant attributes with no information loss, then a collection of decision tree classifiers is built from bootstrap samples to construct ensemble. An experimental evaluation of different methods is carried out on several publicly available agricultural datasets.

IEEE					Age Invariant Face Recognition with Occlusion								2012 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED COMMUNICATION CONTROL AND COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES (ICACCCT)							83	87					2012	2012	In face recognition system age variation causes the serious problem. In this work discriminative model of face recognition is used to deal with age invariant problem. Feature extraction is done by densely sampled local image descriptors such as Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Multi scale Local Binary Pattern (MLBP) which gives the discriminatory information useful to detect the edge direction of the image which is robust to illumination, pose, expression and occlusion. SIFT and MLBP features used to recognize the occluded face images also. Since the extracted features are with high dimensionality new technique called Multi Feature Discriminant Analysis (MFDA) is used to reduce the feature space. MFDA is similar to LDA, where multiple features are combined with two different random sampling methods, multiple LDA based classifiers are constructed and then result from each classifier are combined by fusion rule for final decision. Another method to reduce the dimensionality of extracted features is PCA and classification is done by nearest neighbor method. Finally the results of two methods are compared. Images are taken from FG-NET database.

IEEE					Leveraging RGB-D Data: Adaptive Fusion and Domain Adaptation for Object Detection								2012 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION (ICRA)							4469	4474					2012	2012	Vision and range sensing belong to the richest sensory modalities for perception in robotics and related fields. This paper addresses the problem of how to best combine image and range data for the task of object detection. In particular, we propose a novel adaptive fusion approach, hierarchical Gaussian Process mixtures of experts, able to account for missing information and cross-cue data consistency. The hierarchy is a two-tier architecture that for each modality, each frame and each detection computes a weight function using Gaussian Processes that reflects the confidence of the respective information. We further propose a method called cross-cue domain adaptation that makes use of large image data sets to improve the depth-based object detector for which only few training samples exist. In the experiments that include a comparison with alternative sensor fusion schemes, we demonstrate the viability of the proposed methods and achieve significant improvements in classification accuracy.

Farkas, DL; Nicolau, DV; Leif, RC		Classification of retinopathic injury using image cytometry and vasculature complexity								IMAGING, MANIPULATION, AND ANALYSIS OF BIOMOLECULES, CELLS, AND TISSUES X	Proceedings of SPIE		8225						822526	10.1117/12.908598			2012	2012	Retinopathic injuries are a common symptom of many diseases. However, if detected early, much of the damage caused by these injuries can be prevented, or in some cases reversed. In this study, images of retinas were classified as normal or injured using the vascular cell count, vasculature coverage, and vessel caliber. To model retinal vasculopathies, retinal vasculature from mice with the BCL-2 gene either partially or completely knocked out were compared. The bcl-2 gene is a critical regulator of apoptosis and angiogenesis, and therefore its absence has a significant impact on the number of vascular cells and vasculature complexity. When the aforementioned features were extracted from the images, classification was performed using a majority vote between a linear classifier, k-nearest-neighbors classification, and a support vector machine. This resulted in a classification accuracy of 81% using the "leave one out" error determination method.

In many problems, however, the observed data is related to a natural set of latent variables through a non-trivial sensing process. A common approach in such cases is to either ignore the sensing process or to invert it and then proceed with dimensionality reduction and classifier design. Inversion can be costly and may be unnecessary if the end goal is classification. Rather than either ignoring sensing structure or using it for explicit inversion, we propose using "structured random projections" whose correlation explicitly accounts for the sensing structure. We show examples comparing the performance of independent random projections of observed data, independent random projections of reconstructed data, and our new structured random projections of observed data which demonstrate the benefits of our approach.

Most distance-based methods become impaired due to the distance concentration of many widely used metrics in high-dimensional spaces. One recently proposed approach suggests that using secondary distances based on the number of shared k-nearest neighbors between different points might partly resolve the concentration issue, thereby improving overall performance. Nevertheless, the curse of dimensionality also affects the k-nearest neighbor inference in severely negative ways, one such consequence being known as hubness. The impact of hubness on forming shared neighbor distances has not been discussed before and it is what we focus on in this paper. Furthermore, we propose a new method for calculating the secondary distances which is aware of the underlying neighbor occurrence distribution. Our experiments suggest that this new approach achieves consistently superior performance on all considered high-dimensional data sets. An additional benefit is that it essentially requires no extra computations compared to the original methods.				7th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligent Systems (HAIS)	MAR 28-30, 2012	IEEE-Secc Espana; IEEE Syst; Man & Cybernet-Capitulo Espanol; AEPIA; World Federat Soft Comp; MIR Labs; IT4 Innovat Ctr Excellence; Int Federat Computat Log; Ministerio Economia Competitividad; Junta Castilla Leon; Ayuntamiento Salamanca; Univ Salamanca	Salamanca, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-642-28930-9	WOS:000309173800012

In general, the traditional IDS relies on the extensive knowledge of security experts, in particular, on their familiarity with the computer system to be protected. To reduce this dependence, various data-mining and machine learning techniques have been used in the literature. The experiments and evaluations of the proposed intrusion detection system are performed with the NSL-KDD intrusion detection dataset. We will apply different learning algorithms on NSL-KDD data set, to recognize between normal and attack connections and compare their performing in different scenarios-discretization, features selections and algorithm method for classification-using a powerful statistical analysis: ANOVA. In this study, both the accuracy of the configuration of different system and methodologies used, and also the computational time and complexity of the methodologies are analyzed.

IEEE					MULTIPLE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM FOR FRACTURE DETECTION IN HUMAN BONE X-RAY IMAGES								2012 THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING COMMUNICATION & NETWORKING TECHNOLOGIES (ICCCNT)	International Conference on Computing Communication and Network Technologies												2012	2012	X-Ray is one the oldest and frequently used devices, that makes images of any bone in the body, including the hand, wrist, arm, elbow, shoulder, foot, ankle, leg (shin), knee, thigh, hip, pelvis or spine. A typical bone ailment is the fracture, which occurs when bone cannot withstand outside force like direct blows, twisting injuries and falls. Automatic detection of fractures in bone x-ray images is considered important, as humans are prone to miss-diagnosis. The main focus of this paper is to automatically detect fractures in long bones and in particular, leg bone (often referred as Tibia), from plain diagnostic X-rays using a multiple classification system. Two types of features (texture and shape) with three types of classifiers (Back Propagation Neural Network, K-Nearest Neightbour, Support Vector Machine) are used during the design of multiple classifiers. A total of 12 ensemble models are proposed. Experiments proved that ensemble models significantly improve the quality of fracture identification.				3rd International Conference on Computing Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT)	JUL 26-28, 2012		Coimbatore, INDIA	0	0	0	0	0	2162-7665	*****************	WOS:000320608600032

The time complexity to find a density at a point in the data set is O(n) where n is the size of the data set, hence these non-parametric methods are not scalable for large data sets. A two level rough fuzzy weighted leader based classifier has been developed which is a scalable and efficient method for classification. However, a generalized model does not exist to estimate density non-parametrically that can be used for density based classification and clustering. This paper presents a generalized model which proposes a single level rough fuzzy weighted leader clustering method to condense data set inorder to reduce computational burden and use these rough-fuzzy weighted leaders to estimate density at a point in the data set for classification and clustering. We show that the proposed rough fuzzy weighted leader based non-parametric methods are fast and efficient when compared with related existing methods interms of accuracy and computational time.

Using fuzzy rough set theory, the noise level of each instance is measured, and instances for which the noise level exceeds a certain threshold level are deleted. The threshold is determined using a wrapper approach that evaluates the training Area Under the Curve of candidate subsets. This proposal aims to clean noisy data before applying SMOTE, such that SMOTE can generate high quality artificial data.Experiments on artificial data show that FRIPS in combination with SMOTE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and that it particularly performs well in the presence of noise.				13th Biennial Ibero-American Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AI)	NOV 13-16, 2012	Univ Nacl Colombia; Soc Colombiana Computacion (SCo2); Univ Tecnologica Bolivar Cartagena; Univ Caldas; Univ Tecnologica Pereira; Soc Brasileira Computacao (SBC); Asociacion Espanola Inteligencia Artificial (AEPIA); Soc Mexicana Inteligencia Artificial (SMIA); Assoc Portuguesa Inteligencia Artificial (APPIA); Soc Cubana Matematica & Computacion (SCMC); Soc Peruana Inteligencia Artificial (SPIA); Asociacion Argentina Inteligencia Artificial (AAIA); Soc Brasileira Inteligencia Computacion (SBIC)	Cartagena de Indias, COLOMBIA	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-642-34653-8	WOS:000314227700018

(Shawn)			IEEE					Test-Data Volume Optimization for Diagnosis								2012 49TH ACM/EDAC/IEEE DESIGN AUTOMATION CONFERENCE (DAC)	Design Automation Conference DAC						567	572					2012	2012	Test data collection for a failing integrated circuit (IC) can be very expensive and time consuming. Many companies now collect a fix amount of test data regardless of the failure characteristics. As a result, limited data collection could lead to inaccurate diagnosis, while an excessive amount increases the cost not only in terms of unnecessary test data collection but also increased cost for test execution and data-storage. In this work, the objective is to develop a method for predicting the precise amount of test data necessary to produce an accurate diagnosis. By analyzing the failing outputs of an IC during its actual test, the developed method dynamically determines which failing test pattern to terminate testing, producing an amount of test data that is sufficient for an accurate diagnosis analysis. The method leverages several statistical learning techniques, and is evaluated using actual data from a population of failing chips and five standard benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that test-data collection can be reduced by > 30% (as compared to collecting the full-failure response) while at the same time ensuring > 90% diagnosis accuracy. Prematurely terminating test-data collection at fixed levels (e.g., 100 failing bits) is also shown to negatively impact diagnosis accuracy.				49th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)	JUN 03-07, 2012	IEEE; ACM; EDAC	San Francisco, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0738-100X	978-1-4503-1199-1	WOS:000309256800082

In addition, we investigate possible combinations of different sensor placements, and identify an optimal combination to achieve the best classification performance. The sensor system consists of several sensor modules that can be synchronized to record the accelerations of diverse motions/activities. In our experiment, three sensor modules are mounted on participants' hand wrists, waists, and ankles, respectively., to collect seven categories of activity accelerations. The proposed classification algorithm consisting of acceleration acquisition, signal preprocessing, feature generation, and feature reduction, is capable of translating time-series acceleration signals into important time- and frequency-domain feature vectors. The dimension of features is reduced by linear discriminate analysis (LDA), and then the reduced features are sent to a k-nearest neighbor neighbor (k-NN) classifier for classification. Our experimental results have successfully validated the effectiveness of the proposed classification algorithm. The best classification accuracy is 96.98% when the sensor modules are placed on hand and ankle simultaneously.				7th International Conference on Intelligent Computing (ICIC)	AUG 11-14, 2011	IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc; Int Neural Network Soc; Natl Sci Fdn China	Zhengzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-642-25943-2	WOS:000306498200058

Band selection is often used to reduce the computational complexity for hyperspectral images. We proposed a new method for unsupervised band selection by using complex network to represent the spectral bands. The method completes the task with the objective of preserving the maximal information from original data in the selected bands. Both the divergences and connections between each hyperspectral band can be revealed from the topological characteristics of the generated network. We use the network topology as the criterion to identify the bands, and select the bands that can form the most approximate network comparing to the network of the original data. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with traditional methods, the proposed algorithm can obtain accurate results with clear physical meaning and simple process.

Aiming at the special character of the definition for outliers in soft-sensor modeling process, an outlier detection method based on k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) is proposed in this paper. The proposed method can be realized conveniently from data without priori knowledge and assumption of the process.

To achieve intelligent mobility for a smart wheelchair, we proposed to construct a user-environment interface that users can interact with the living environment like a normal healthy person. An integrated interactive platform, including touch control panel, together with several cameras, and wireless sensors, is embedded on a wheelchair to achieve friendly interaction. Interaction functions, such as appliance control, semi-automatic vision assistant function, and physiological information monitoring function etc. have been developed. The target of light mobility is achieved and the overall smart wheelchair system comprise: a mobile vehicle, information sensor modules, analysis control modules and an image capture unit which is set towards the headrest direction of the mobile vehicle to capture a user's facial image data. The physiological information sensor module is used for sensing at least one physiological data of the user. The analysis control module outputs a seamless monitoring signal to a caregiver side in response to the image data or the at least one physiological data. These user-environment interaction functions are developed under the design target of human technology that the wheelchair user can interact with the environment like a normal person.

Neuroimaging data are highly dimensional and are thus cumbersome to analyze. Manifold learning techniques, which find a low-dimensional representation for high-dimensional data, have been applied to brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A shape quantification method based on multidimensional scaling (MDS), a well-known manifold learning technique, was proposed. The method successfully distinguished between AD and normal patients. We extended the MDS-based quantification method by 1) applying it to distinguish patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from normal patients, and 2) showing the effectiveness of the induced low-dimensional embedding space in predicting key clinical variables such as mini-mental-state exam scores and clinical diagnosis by using a standard multiple linear regression. Distinguishing patients with MCI from normal patients is also important as it is related to early detection of AD. We were able to 1) classify not only AD/normal patients but also MCI/normal patients better than we could with the traditional classification based on the hippocampus volume, and to 2) show good statistical power for predicting key clinical variables. Our test group consisted of 25 normal, 25 AD, and 25 MCI patients.								0	0	0	0	0	0374-4884		WOS:000298198300019

The first proposed methodology is based on the selection of those voxels which present a greater difference between Controls and Alzheimer type dementia patients. The mean value of the intensities of the selected voxels is used as features for different classifiers. The proposed methodology reaches an accuracy of 89% in the classification task. A second criterion is chosen to select voxels based on considering those which present not only greater overall difference between both modalities (Controls and Alzheimer) but also present lower dispersion. The classification accuracy using this second condition increases to 94%. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.								0	0	0	0	0	1051-2004		WOS:000295815600010

In this paper we consider the convergence rate of the error for the k nearest neighbor estimators in case that m is (p, C)-smooth. It is known that the minimax rate is unachievable by any k nearest neighbor estimator for p > 1.5 and d = 1. We generalize this result to any d >= 1. Throughout this paper, we assume that the data is independent and identically distributed and as an error criterion we use the expected L-2 error.								0	0	0	0	0	0916-8532		WOS:000296673400022	
J	Khorshidpour, Zeinab; Hashemi, Sattar; Hamzeh, Ali								CBDL: Context-Based Distance Learning for Categorical Attributes								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			26	11			1076	1100		10.1002/int.20499			NOV 2011	2011	Distance learning is an important notion and has played a critical role in success of various machine learning algorithms. Any learning algorithm that requires dissimilarity/similarity measures has to assume some forms of distance functions, either explicitly or implicitly. Hence, in recent years a considerable amount of research has been devoted to distance learning. Despite great achievements in this field, a number of important issues need to be further explored for real world datasets mainly containing categorical attributes. Based on these considerations, the current research presents a Context-Based Distance Learning approach (CBDL) to advance the state of the art existing researches on distance metric learning for categorical datasets. CBDL is designed and developed based on the idea that distance between two values of a given categorical attribute can be estimated by using information inherently exists within subset of attributes called context. CBDL composes of two main components: context extraction component and distance learning component. Context extraction component is responsible for extracting the relevant subset of feature set for a given attribute, while distance learning component tries to learn distance between each pair of values based on the extracted context. To have a comprehensive analysis, we conduct wide range of experiments in both supervised and unsupervised environments in the presence of noise. Our experimental results reveal that CBDL is the method of choice distance learning approach by offering a comparable or better performance compared to the state of the art existing distance learning schemes according to studied evaluation measures.

J	Reed, Jeremy; Lee, Chin-Hui								Preference Music Ratings Prediction Using Tokenization and Minimum Classification Error Training								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING			19	8			2294	2303		10.1109/TASL.2011.2129509			NOV 2011	2011	In order to address two main limitations of current content-based music recommendation approaches, an ordinal regression algorithm for music recommendation that incorporates dynamic information is presented. Instead of assuming that local spectral features within a song are identically and independently distributed examples of an underlying probability density, music is characterized by a vocabulary of acoustic segment models (ASMs), which are found with an unsupervised process. Further, instead of classifying music based on subjective classes, such as genre, or trying to find a universal notion of similarity, songs are classified based on personal preference ratings. The ordinal regression approach to perform the ratings prediction is based on the discriminative-training algorithm known as minimum classification error (MCE) training. Experimental results indicate that improved temporal modeling leads to superior performance over standard spectral-based music representations. Further, the MCE-based preference ratings algorithm is shown to be superior over two other systems. Analysis demonstrates that the superior performance is due to MCE being a non-conservative algorithm that demonstrates immunity to outliers.								0	0	0	0	0	1558-7916		WOS:000296889900005

The LAD is based on the concepts of combinatorics, optimization, and Boolean functions. The key feature of the LAD is the capability of detecting hidden patterns in the data. Since patterns are basically combinations of certain attributes, they can be used to build a decision boundary for classification in the LAD by providing important information to distinguish observations in one class from those in the other class. The use of patterns may result in a more stable performance in terms of being able to classify both positive and negative classes due to their robustness to measurement errors. The patterns are also interpretable and can serve as an essential tool for understanding the problem. These desirable properties of the patterns generated from the LAD motivate the use of the LAD patterns as input variables to other classification techniques to achieve a more stable and accurate performance. In this paper, the patterns generated from the LAD are used as the input variables to the decision tree and k-nearest neighbor classification methods. The applicability and usefulness of the LAD patterns for classification are investigated experimentally. The classification accuracy and sensitivity of the classification results for different classifiers in the original and pattern spaces are compared using several public data. The experimental results show that classifications in the pattern space can yield better and stable performance than those in the original space in terms of accuracy when the classification accuracy of the LAD is relatively good (i.e., the LAD patterns are of good quality), the ratio of the number of patterns to the total number of attributes is small, or the data set for classification is balanced between two classes.

J	Oentaryo, Richard J.; Pasquier, Michel; Quek, Chai								RFCMAC: A novel reduced localized neuro-fuzzy system approach to knowledge extraction								EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			38	10			12066	12084		10.1016/j.eswa.2011.02.058			SEP 15 2011	2011	Neuro-fuzzy system (NFS) and especially localized NFS are powerful rule-based methods for knowledge extraction, capable of inducing salient knowledge structures from data automatically. Contemporary localized NFSs, however, often demand large features and rules to accurately describe the overall domain data, thus degrading their interpretability and generalization traits. In light of these issues, a new localized NFS termed the Reduced Fuzzy Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (RFCMAC) is proposed that models the two-stage neural development of cortical memories in the brain to construct and reduce the human's memory structure. This idea is realized in both label generation and rule generation phases of the RFCMAC learning process to derive a compact and representative rule base structure, prior to an iterative parameter tuning phase. The incorporation of reduction mechanisms provides RFCMAC with several benefits over classical localized NFSs, including discovery of highly concise and intuitive rules, satisfactory generalization performances, and enhanced system scalability. A series of experiments on nonlinear regression, water plant monitoring, and leukemia diagnosis tasks have demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed system as a novel knowledge extraction tool.

The vigilance states are usually categorized in at least three states, including slow wave sleep (SWS), rapid eye movement sleep (REM), and awakening. To identify different vigilance states, even a well-trained expert must spend a lot of time analyzing a mass of physiological recording data. This study proposes an automatic vigilance stages classification method for analyzing EEG signals in rats. The EEG signals were transferred by fast Fourier transform before extracting features. These extracted features were then used as training patterns to construct the proposed classification system. The proposed classification system contains two functional units. The first unit is principle component analysis (PCA) method, which is used to project the high dimensional features into the lower dimensional subspace. The second unit is the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) method, which identifies the physiological state in each EEG signal epoch. Based on the results of analyzing 810 epochs of EEG signal, the proposed classification method achieves satisfactory classification accuracy for vigilance states. Based on machine-learning algorithms, the classifier learns to approach the configuration that best fits the categorization task. Therefore, additional training in searching best parameters and thresholds can be avoided. Moreover, the PCA algorithm projects data instances into a 3-D space, making it possible to visualize state-changing dynamics. Experimental results show that the proposed machine-learning based classifier performs better than conventional vigilance state classification algorithms. The results also suggest that it is possible to identify the vigilance states with only EEG signals using the proposed pattern recognition technique.

This problem is solved with a simple, yet powerful, modification of the so called ALVOT family of supervised classification algorithms with a novel differentiated-weighting scheme. Compared to other previously published approaches, the proposed method significantly reduces the number and complexity of the text-features to be extracted from the text. Also, the specific combination of line-level and word-level features used introduces an eclectic paradigm between texture-related and structure-related approaches. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

All the input patterns that belong to that cluster will have the same label as the prototype. It should be noted that a prototype does not have to be only one data. A cluster could be represented by more than one data. In this paper, the M-dimensional rectangle of the Fuzzy ART is used as a prototype. A new tree clustering structure replaces the training phase of Fuzzy ARTMAP. The obtained clusters are used to form the prototype rectangles. These rectangles will be used in the test phase of the Fuzzy ARTMAP. This algorithm is compared to the Nearest Neighbor classifier, the Fuzzy ARTMAP, C4.5, and the fuzzy ART-Var algorithms for different values of the vigilance parameter. Databases from the UCI repository will be used for comparison. Experimental results show the good generalization capability of this new algorithm.								0	0	0	0	0	0010-485X		WOS:000290167700003

Gabor filters were utilized to extract the textural features of bitumen images. The features were used in three different query tests to quantify their representation capacity. The K nearest neighbor classifier was tested using leave-one-out cross validation.

J	Wu, Wei; Xu, Jun; Li, Hang; Oyama, Satoshi								Learning a Robust Relevance Model for Search Using Kernel Methods								JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			12				1429	1458					MAY 2011	2011	This paper points out that many search relevance models in information retrieval, such as the Vector Space Model, BM25 and Language Models for Information Retrieval, can be viewed as a similarity function between pairs of objects of different types, referred to as an S-function. An S-function is specifically defined as the dot product between the images of two objects in a Hilbert space mapped from two different input spaces. One advantage of taking this view is that one can take a unified and principled approach to address the issues with regard to search relevance. The paper then proposes employing a kernel method to learn a robust relevance model as an S-function, which can effectively deal with the term mismatch problem, one of the biggest challenges in search. The kernel method exploits a positive semi-definite kernel referred to as an S-kernel. The paper shows that when using an S-kernel the model learned by the kernel method is guaranteed to be an S-function. The paper then gives more general principles for constructing S-kernels. A specific implementation of the kernel method is proposed using the Ranking SVM techniques and click-through data. The proposed approach is employed to learn a relevance model as an extension of BM25, referred to as Robust BM25. Experimental results on web search and enterprise search data show that Robust BM25 significantly outperforms baseline methods and can successfully tackle the term mismatch problem.								0	0	0	0	0	1532-4435		WOS:000292304000001

However, Wrappers suffer from the fact that they only use a single classifier. The downside to this is that each classifier will have its own biases and will therefore select very different features. To overcome the biases of individual classifiers, we propose a new data mining method called Wrapper-based Decision Trees (WDT). The WDT method uses multiple classifiers for selecting relevant features and decision trees to visualize relationships among the selected features. We use the WDT to investigate the influences of the levels of computer experience on users' preferences for the design of search engines. The benefit of using WDT lies within the fact that it can uncover the most accurate set of relevant features to help differentiate the preferences of users with diverse levels of computer experience. The results indicate that the users with varied levels of computer experiences have different preferences regarding the following features: the number of icons, the arrangement of search results, and the presentation of error messages. Such findings can be used to develop personalized search engines to accommodate users' different levels of computer experience. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	He, Ping; Xu, Xiaohua; Chen, Ling								Manifold Mapping Machine								NEUROCOMPUTING			74	9	SI		1450	1466		10.1016/j.neucom.2010.11.023			APR 2011	2011	Nonlinear classification has been a non-trivial task in machine learning for the past decades. In recent years, kernel machines have successfully generalized the inner-product based linear classifiers to nonlinear ones by transforming data into some high or infinite dimensional feature space. However, due to their implicit space transformation and unobservable latent feature space, it is hard to have an intuitive understanding of their working mechanism. In this paper, we propose a comprehensible framework for nonlinear classifier design, called Manifold Mapping Machine (M(3)). M(3) can generalize any linear classifier to nonlinear by transforming data into some low-dimensional feature space explicitly. To demonstrate the effectiveness of M(3) framework, we further present an algorithmic implementation of M(3) named Supervised Spectral Space Classifier (S(3)C). Compared with the kernel classifiers, S(3)C can achieve similar or even better data separation by mapping data into the low-dimensional spectral space, allowing both of its mapped data and new feature space to be examined directly. Moreover, with the discriminative information integrated into the spectral space transformation, the classification performance of S(3)C is more robust than that of the kernel classifiers. Experimental results show that S(3)C is superior to other state-of-the-art nonlinear classifiers on both synthetic and real-world data sets. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Conventional ABC analysis classifies inventory items three categories: A, B, or C based on annual dollar usage of an inventory item. Multi-criteria inventory classification has been proposed by a number of researchers in order to take other important criteria into consideration. These researchers have compared artificial-intelligence (AI)-based classification techniques with traditional multiple discriminant analysis (MDA). Examples of these AI-based techniques include support vector machines (SVMs), backpropagation networks (BPNs), and the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm. To test the effectiveness of these techniques, classification results based on four benchmark techniques are compared. The results show that AI-based techniques demonstrate superior accuracy to MDA. Statistical analysis reveals that SVM enables more accurate classification than other AI-based techniques. This finding suggests the possibility of implementing AI-based techniques for multi-criteria ABC analysis in enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Two parallel dielectric layers are penetrated by a perpendicular electromagnetic wave. A standing wave is formed between layers. Radial basis function networks are employed to estimate the electric field intensity between the layers for both the harmonic wave and the pulse wave illumination. The electrical parameters of dielectric layers can influence the field distribution inside the investigated structure. Probabilistic neural networks are used to classify parameters of layers related to critical intensities of internal fields. Classification abilities of probabilistic networks are compared with a conventional k-NN method both for a dense training set and a sparse one.								0	0	0	0	0	1751-8725		WOS:000288785200014

The algorithm uses the hypothesis in line with the Gestalt laws of proximity for human vision that, in an image, basic semantic structures are formed by line segments (arcs also approximated and broken into smaller line segments based on pixel deviation threshold in the proposed approach) which are in close proximity with each other. Further, these basic semantic structures are hierarchically combined (by brain) until such a point where a semantic meaning of the structure can be extracted. Following the same argument, the algorithm in a bottom up approach extracts line segments in an image and then forms semantic groups of these line segments based on a minimum distance threshold from each other. The line segment groups so formed can be differentiated from each other by the number of group members and their geometrical properties. The geometrical properties of these semantic groups are used to generate rotation, translation, and scale-invariant histograms used as feature vector for object class recognition tasks in a k-nearest-neighbor framework. The algorithm has been tested on standard benchmark database and results are compared with existing approaches to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the grouping approach vis-a-vis other approaches.

Tensor-based locally maximum margin classifier for image and video classification								COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING			115	3	SI		300	309		10.1016/j.cviu.2010.10.007			MAR 2011	2011	In the past decades, maximum margin classifiers have been recognized as a powerful tool for pattern classification problem. However, for image and video data, it is still hard to map the visual features to the semantic labels, although many maximum margin techniques have announced impressive classification results in their own datasets. The performance uncertainty of maximum margin classifiers in real world applications is mainly caused by the lack of theoretical ground for kernel projection, which unfortunately, is just the key of the performance improvement. Either the kernel space distorts the semantics of the visual space or the dataset is not linear separable in the kernel space, the classification performance cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Tensor-based Locally Maximum Margin Classifier (TLMMC), which avoids the kernel projection with unclear physical meaning. TLMMC employs the tensor techniques to represent the image and video data in high-order space directly, so the intrinsic structure of the data point is well preserved. To address the difficulty of seeking a linear discriminant hyperplane in the tensor space. TLMMC utilizes a set of local multilinear hyperplanes to construct a global nonlinear one. To find the optimal solution for each local hyperplane, maximum margin technique is used to minimize the generalization error in the smaller but more relevant subset of the training data. Integrating the attractive characters of tensor representation, local-based method, and maximum margin classifier, TLMMC shows impressive results in both theoretical analysis and empirical validation. Besides an effective image and video classifier, this paper also illustrates a new thought of semantics oriented classifier design, which emphasizes the model with clear physical explanation and solid theoretical support instead of performance improvement on individual learning tasks.

One example where quality control becomes critical is the percussion cap mass production, an element assembled in firearm ammunition. These elements must achieve a minimum tolerance deviation in their fabrication. This study outlines a machine vision system development using a three-dimensional camera for the inspection of the whole production of percussion caps. This system presents multiple problems, such as metallic reflections in the percussion caps, high-speed movement for scanning the pieces, and mechanical errors and irregularities in percussion cap placement. Owing to these problems, it is impossible to solve the problem using traditional image processing methods, and hence, machine-learning algorithms have been tested to provide a feasible classification of the possible errors present in the percussion caps.								0	0	0	0	0	1751-9632		WOS:000288243000004

Unlike the k-nearest neighbor, an instance-similarity based method; WOC-NN computes similarities between a test instance and a class pattern of each emotion class. An emotion class pattern is a representation of its ranked neighboring classes. A Hamming distance is used as distance metric, enhanced with two improvements: i) weighting the importance of each class rank of each neighborhood pattern and ii) discarding irrelevant class ranks from the patterns. Thus, the decision process in WOC-NN exploits more information than Bayes rule which makes use only of the information about the model class that minimizes Bayes risk. This extra information allows WOC-NN to get more accurate prediction. Also, the results show that the proposed system outperforms the result of state-of-the art systems when applied to the FAU AIBO corpus.				12th Annual Conference of the International-Speech-Communication-Association 2011 (INTERSPEECH 2011)	AUG 27-31, 2011	Int Speech Commun Assoc	Florence, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0		978-1-61839-270-1	WOS:000316502201272

A solution for the electrical consumption management problem is the use of a nonintrusive appliance load monitoring system. This system captures the signals from the aggregate consumption, extracts the features from these signals and classifies the extracted features in order to identify the switched on appliances. This paper complements a novel feature extraction scheme presented in a previous work for load disaggregation with a comparative study of supervised classification methods. The objective of the current work is hence to make use of the feature extraction scheme to construct a database of signatures and then to compare different supervised learning methods for load classification. Preliminary results indicate high classification accuracy of all tested methods.

Robotic measures of postural control, reaction time, movement smoothness, and movement error associated with robotic assessment of the upper-limb fail to recognize the inherent spatial and geometric differences between stroke and control hand path trajectories. In this study we propose the application of a class of algorithms, Dynamic Time Warping, designed to quantify the spatial difference and skew between hand written characters and vocal waveforms as a means for identifying individuals exhibiting sensorimotor impairment. In order to achieve this 85 stroke subjects, and 54 age, gender, and handedness matched control subjects, underwent robotic assessment of the upper-limb.

We present an efficient approach for identifying, learning and modeling the policies of others during collaborative problem solving activities. The mechanisms presented in this paper will enable agents to build more effective argumentation strategies by keeping track of who might have, and be willing to provide the resources required for the enactment of a plan. We argue that agents can improve their argumentation strategies by building accurate models of others' policies regarding resource use, information provision, etc. In a set of experiments, we demonstrate the utility of this novel combination of techniques through empirical evaluation, in which we demonstrate that more accurate models of others' policies (or norms) can be developed more rapidly using various forms of evidence from argumentation-based dialogue.				7th International Workshop on Argumentation in Multi-Agent Systems (ArgMAS) in Association with the 9th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS)	MAY 10, 2010		Toronto, CANADA	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-642-21939-9	WOS:000312791800006

We present a classification-guided (wrapper) method for time-domain NIRS feature extraction to classify left and right hand movements. Four different wrapper methods, based on univariate and multivariate ranking and sequential forward and backward selection, along with three different classifiers (k-Nearest neighbor, Bayes, and Support Vector Machines) were studied. Using NIRS data from two subjects we show that a rank-based wrapper in conjunction with polynomial SVMs can achieve 100% sensitivity and specificity separating left and right hand movements (5-fold cross validation). Results show the promise of wrapper methods in classifying NIRS signals for BCI applications.				5th International IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS) Conference on Neural Engineering (NER)	APR 27-MAY 01, 2011	Natl Sci Fdn (NSF); Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS); IEEE	Cancun, MEXICO	0	0	0	0	0	1948-3546	978-1-4244-4141-9	WOS:000298735800017

However, a limitation of many of them lies in the use of only one measure to select the best attribute-value pair. In this way, many attribute-value pairs have the same best values. Consecptently, it is difficulty to distinguish which attribute-value pair is the best. On the other hand, these classifiers usually combine two best attribute-value pairs to generate rules, whether they bias toward the same class label or not. In this paper, we propose a new classification approach named CAIG (Classification based on Attribute-value pair Integrate Gain) which has a number of new features. First, it uses multi measures to select the best attribute-value pairs. Second, it divides attribute-value pairs into different groups according to the class label. Third, it arranges attribute-value pairs to the same groups if they bias to same class label. Fourth, it adopts a greedy algorithm to generate rules from the theses groups. Experimental results show that the method of multi measures is highly accuracy in comparison with the one measure.

In this paper, an algorithm developed for the accurate detection of heartbeats from a ballistocardiography signal is presented. The signal is obtained using a regular chair adapted with Electro-Mechanical Film (EMFi) sensors and an acquisition system, so a ballistocardiogram is generated. The presence of important disturbances in this type of signal is unavoidable due to several natural causes; therefore, its processing involves significant difficulties to be tackled in order to obtain reliable lectures of the heartbeat. The algorithm presented here performs consistently well, showing a very low error rate, even if the signal contains significant noise.

J	Huy Nguyen Anh Pham; Triantaphyllou, Evangelos								A meta-heuristic approach for improving the accuracy in some classification algorithms								COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH			38	1	SI		174	189		10.1016/j.cor.2010.04.011			JAN 2011	2011	Current classification algorithms usually do not try to achieve a balance between fitting and generalization when they infer models from training data. Furthermore, current algorithms ignore the fact that there may be different penalty costs for the false-positive, false-negative, and unclassifiable types. Thus, their performance may not be optimal or may even be coincidental. This paper proposes a meta-heuristic approach, called the Convexity Based Algorithm (CBA), to address these issues. The new approach aims at optimally balancing the data fitting and generalization behaviors of models when some traditional classification approaches are used. The CBA first defines the total misclassification cost (TC) as a weighted function of the three penalty costs and the corresponding error rates as mentioned above. Next it partitions the training data into regions. This is done according to some convexity properties derivable from the training data and the traditional classification method to be used in conjunction with the CBA. Next the CBA uses a genetic approach to determine the optimal levels of fitting and generalization. The TC is used as the fitness function in this genetic approach. Twelve real-life datasets from a wide spectrum of domains were used to better understand the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The computational results indicate that the CBA may potentially fill in a critical gap in the use of current or future classification algorithms. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

[16,17] proposed a transformation distance called "tangent distance" (TD) which can make pattern recognition be efficient. The key idea is to construct a distance measure which is invariant with respect to some chosen transformations. In this research, we provide a method using adaptive TD based on an idea inspired by "discriminant adaptive nearest neighbor" [7]. This method is relatively easy compared with many other complicated ones. A real handwritten recognition data set is used to illustrate our new method. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method gives lower classification error rates than those by standard implementation of neural networks and support vector machines and is as good as several other complicated approaches.								0	0	0	0	0	0266-4763		WOS:000298923300018

We do so by combining reinforcement learning mechanisms with techniques belonging to the field of multivariate statistics on three different levels of abstraction: the motivation layer and the two simultaneously learning strategy and skill layers. The motivation layer allows for modelling occasionally contradicting goals in terms of drives in a very intuitive fashion. A drive represents one single goal, that a robot wants to be satisfied, like charging its battery, when it is nearly exhausted, or transporting an object to a target position. The strategy layer encapsulates the main reinforcement learning algorithm based on an abstracted and dynamically adjusted Markovian state space. By means of state abstraction, we minimise the overall state space size in order to ensure feasibility of the learning process in a dynamically changing environment. The skill layer finally realises a generalised learning method for learning reactive low-level behaviours, that enable a robot to interact with the environment.								0	0	0	0	0		978-3-0348-0129-4	WOS:000291621900036

It departs from the use of integral transforms to model hyperspectral images in terms of probability distributions. This provides a link between harmonic analysis and affine geometric transformations between object surface planes in the scene. Moreover, the use of harmonic analysis permits the study of these descriptors in the context of Hilbert spaces. This, in turn, provides a connection to functional analysis to capture the spectral cross-correlation between bands in the image for the generation of a descriptor with a high energy compaction ratio. Thus, descriptors can be computed based upon orthogonal bases capable of capturing the space and wavelength correlation for the spectra in the hyperspectral imagery under study. We illustrate the utility of our descriptor for purpose of object recognition on a hyperspectral image dataset of real-world objects and compare our results to those yielded using an alternative.								0	0	0	0	0	2190-5916	978-3-642-11567-7	WOS:000292280700008

Here we study the problem of choosing the distance metric for a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) phonetic frame classifier. We compare the standard Euclidean distance to two learned Mahalanobis distances, based on large-margin nearest neighbors (LMNN) and locality preserving projections (LPP). We use locality sensitive hashing for approximate nearest neighbor search to reduce the test time of k-NN classification. We compare the error rates of these approaches, as well as of baseline Gaussian mixture-based and multilayer perceptron classifiers, on the task of phonetic frame classification of speech from the TIMIT database. The k-NN classifiers outperform Gaussian mixture models, but not multilayer perceptrons. We find that the best k-NN classification performance is obtained using LPP, while LMNN is close behind.				12th Annual Conference of the International-Speech-Communication-Association 2011 (INTERSPEECH 2011)	AUG 27-31, 2011	Int Speech Commun Assoc	Florence, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0		978-1-61839-270-1	WOS:000316502201076

IEEE					Economic Load Dispatch using Intelligent Optimization with Fuzzy Control								IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUZZY SYSTEMS (FUZZ 2011)	IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems						2219	2224					2011	2011	In this paper, Differential Evolution (DE) that incorporates fuzzy control and k-nearest neighbors algorithm is proposed to tackle the economic load dispatch problem. To provide the self-terminating ability, a technique called Iteration Windows (IW) is introduced to govern the number of iteration in each searching stage during the optimization. The size of IW is controlled by a fuzzy controller, which uses the information provided by the k-nearest neighbors system to analyze the population during the searching process. The controller keeps controlling the IW till the end of the searching process. A wavelet based mutation process is embedded in the DE searching process to enhance the searching performance. The weight F of DE is also controlled by the fuzzy controller to further speed up the searching process. The proposed method is employed to solve the Economic Load Dispatch with Valve-Point Loading (ELD-VPL) Problem. It is shown empirically that the proposed method can terminate the searching process with a reasonable number of iteration and performs significantly better than the conventional methods in terms of convergence speed and solution quality.

Such necessity arises frequently in real situations: e.g., classification of video clips or object classification using acoustic scattering experiments to name a few. In particular, we propose an algorithm for classifying signal ensembles by bringing together well-known techniques from various disciplines in a novel way. Our algorithm first performs the dimensionality reduction on training ensembles using either the linear embeddings (e.g., Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)) or the nonlinear embeddings (e.g., the Laplacian eigenmap (LE), the diffusion map (DM)). After embedding training ensembles into a lower-dimensional space, our algorithm extends a given test ensemble into the trained embedding space, and then measures the "distance" between the test ensemble and each training ensemble in that space, and classify it using the nearest neighbor method. It turns out that the choice of this ensemble distance measure is critical, and our algorithm adopts the so-called Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), a robust distance measure successfully used in image retrieval and image registration. We will demonstrate the performance of our algorithm using two real examples: classification of underwater objects using multiple sonar waveforms; and classification of video clips of digit-speaking lips. This article also provides a concise review on the several key concepts in statistical learning such as PCA, MDS, LE, DM, and EMD as well as the practical issues including how to tune parameters, which will be useful for the readers interested in numerical experiments.								0	0	0	0	0		978-0-8176-8094-7	WOS:000289749400011

This representative string can be used as a cryptographic key in many security applications upon error correction. Discretization performance should not degrade from the actual continuous features-based classification performance significantly. However, numerous discretization approaches based on ineffective encoding schemes have been put forward. Therefore, the correlation between such discretization and classification has never been made clear. In this article, we aim to bridge the gap between continuous and Hamming domains, and provide a revelation upon how discretization based on equal-width quantization and linearly separable subcode encoding could affect the classification performance in the Hamming domain. We further illustrate how such discretization can be applied in order to obtain a highly resembled classification performance under the general Lp distance and the inner product metrics. Finally, empirical studies conducted on two benchmark face datasets vindicate our analysis results.								0	0	0	0	0	1687-6180		WOS:000300977900001

IEEE					Feasibility of Safety Applications based on Intra-Car Wireless Sensor Networks: A Case Study								2011 IEEE VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE (VTC FALL)	IEEE VTS Vehicular Technology Conference Proceedings												2011	2011	Nowadays, there are more than 150 sensors inside a car which are connected via wires to the Electronic Control Units (ECUs). The increase in the number of sensors put into a car adds significant weight to the car and makes the wiring system more complex. Intra-car Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is therefore a promising solution for automobile industry in the near future as it eliminates the amount of wiring harness and simplifies the wiring structure. The reduction in the weight of a car leads in a more efficient engine performance, better fuel economy, and reliability. In addition to the direct benefits, the Intra-car WSNs can be used for other applications. An example shown in this paper is a BLind spot Information System (BLIS). The Intra-car WSN-based BLIS is evaluated via real experiments on vehicles. The results show a comparable or even higher detection rate with other BLISs (i.e., based on cameras and radars). The main benefit of Intra-car WSNs-based BLIS is cost; the proposed system does not require additional hardware components (e.g., cameras or radars).

In this paper we propose an adaptive vision based algorithm for road detection in diverse outdoor conditions. Our novel approach employs feature based classification and uses the Kohonen Self-Organizing Map (SOM) for the purpose of road detection. The robustness of the algorithm lies in the unique ability of SOM to organize information while learning diverse inputs. Features used for the training and testing of SOM are identified. The proposed method is capable of working with structured as well as unstructured roads and noisy environments that may be encountered by an intelligent vehicle. The proposed technique is extensively compared with the k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm. Results show that SOM outperforms KNN in classification consistency and is independent to the lighting conditions while taking comparable classification time which shows that the network can also be used as an online learning architecture.

S	Mikawa, Kenta; Ishida, Takashi; Goto, Masayuki			IEEE					A Proposal of Extended Cosine Measure for Distance Metric Learning in Text Classification								2011 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS (SMC)	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings						1741	1746					2011	2011	This paper discusses a new similarity measure between documents on a vector space model from the view point of distance metric learning. The documents are represented by points in the vector space by using the information of frequencies of words appearing in each document. The similarity measure between two different documents is useful to recognize the relationship and can be applied to classification or clustering of the data. Usually, the cosine similarity and the Euclid distance have been used in order to measure the similarity between points in the Euclidean space. However, these measures do not take the correlation among words which appear in documents into consideration on an application of the vector space model to document analysis. Generally speaking, many words which appear in documents have correlation to one another depending on the sentence structures, topics and subjects. Therefore, it is effective to build a suitable metric measure taking the correlation of words into consideration on the vector space in order to improve the performance of document classification and clustering. This paper presents a new effective method to acquire a distance measure on the document vector space based on an extended cosine measure. In addition, the way of distance metric learning is proposed to acquire the proper metric from the view point of supervised learning. The effectiveness of our proposal is clarified by simulation experiments for the text classification problems of the customer review which is posted on the web site and the newspaper article.

This leads to deteriorate dramatically the performance of incremental learning algorithms over time. This is because of the use of data which is no more consistent with the characteristics of new incoming one. In this paper, an approach for learning in dynamic environments is proposed. This approach integrates a mechanism to use only the recent and useful patterns to update the classifier without a "catastrophic forgetting". This approach is used for the acoustic leak detection in the steam generator unit of the nuclear power generator "Prototype Fast React".				7th Biannual Conference of the European-Society-for-Fuzzy-Logic-and-Technology (EUSFLAT)/17th Annual LFA Meeting	JUL 18-22, 2011	European Soc Fuzzy Log & Technol (EUSFLAT)	Aix-les-Bains, FRANCE	0	0	0	0	0	1951-6851	978-90-78677-00-0	WOS:000301519600058

Different from existing researches, which are mainly concentrated on differences in reflex thresholds, a new approach was proposed. The approach uses original reflex electromyography (EMC) signals as "features" of patients. Data mining techniques, including statistical measurement and pattern recognition, were applied to these "features" to evaluate relations among different groups of patients with respect to gender and age. Experiments revealed that these "features" allowed to separate those groups of patients. Results proved the strong influence of those demographic factors on NWR of chronic pain patients.				15th Nordic-Baltic Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Medical Physics (NBC 2011)	JUN 14-17, 2011	NMS; Det Obelske Familiefond; Maquet; Trumpf	Aalborg, DENMARK	0	0	0	0	0	1680-0737	978-3-642-21682-4	WOS:000308452500056

This study examined the application of supervised learning algorithms for famine prediction. Data were collected between 2004 and 2005 from households in northern, central, eastern, and southern parts of Uganda. Data sets from the northern region were the most suitable as a learning sample for other regions. Classification performance of Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes and Decision tree in prediction of famine were evaluated. Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbors performed better than the other methods, and Support Vector Machine produced the best Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC), which can be used by policy makers to identify famine-prone households. It is recommended that satellite and household data should be used in combination to predict food security because this increases the specificity of households at risk.								0	0	0	0	0	0883-9514		WOS:000296541800004

In this paper, we propose a new attribute selection strategy - based on a lazy learning approach - which postpones the identification of relevant attributes until an instance is submitted for classification. Our strategy relies on the hypothesis that taking into account the attribute values of an instance to be classified may contribute to identifying the best attributes for the correct classification of that particular instance. Experimental results using the k-NN and Naive Bayes classifiers, over 40 different data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and five large data sets from the NIPS 2003 feature selection challenge, show the effectiveness of delaying attribute selection to classification time. The proposed lazy technique in most cases improves the accuracy of classification, when compared with the analogous attribute selection approach performed as a data preprocessing step. We also propose a metric to estimate when a specific data set can benefit from the lazy attribute selection approach.								0	0	0	0	0	1088-467X		WOS:000294432100005

In recent years we have suggested their application to classification problems, and investigated their relationship to other types of discrete classifiers such as Decision Trees. In this paper we focus on a continuous domain version of Stack Filter Classifiers which we call Ordered Hypothesis Machines (OHM), and investigate their relationship to Nearest Neighbor classifiers. We show that OHM classifiers provide a novel framework in which to train Nearest Neighbor type classifiers by minimizing empirical error based loss functions. We use the framework to investigate a new cost sensitive loss function that allows us to train a Nearest Neighbor type classifier for low false alarm rate applications. We report results on both synthetic data and real-world image data.

Nonetheless, the Internet is an outstanding and challenging case because of its incredibly fast development, unparalleled heterogeneity and the inherent lack of measurement and monitoring mechanisms in its core conception. In short, packet switched networks defy analytical modeling. This chapter is intended to introduce and provide concise descriptions of some of the building blocks of what some authors call Internet Science [21, 104], i.e., the study of laws and patterns in Internet structure. Additional related aspects that will be used throughout the next chapters are discussed as well. We will briefly define and describe the most relevant concepts about Internet performance and measurement that will be used throughout the next chapters. However, we will not get into details about all the networking concepts this monograph deals with. We refer to [37] for a good overall and in-depth analysis of traffic measurement and performance analysis. There are also a number of research papers that provide good insight into more specific topics. Among these, we highlight [21], where some key mathematical concepts in Internet traffic analysis are discussed. It is also out of the scope of this monograph to analyze in detail the mathematical aspects of most of the concepts this monograph deals with, and in particular those related to traffic control. For this, we refer the interested reader to [153] and [15].

The quality of a review can be determined by identifying how relevant it is to the work that the review was written for as well as its similarity to existing well-written and coherent reviews. Relevance between two pieces of text can be determined by identifying semantic and syntactic similarities between them. In this paper, we make use of string-based metrics that incorporate concepts of paraphrasing and plagiarism to determine matching between texts. We use a graph-based text representation technique. We use the k-nearest neighbor classification algorithm to build a supervised model and classify text as LOW, MEDIUM or HIGH based on values of the metrics. We evaluate our approach on three data sets from student assignments and show that our model achieves an average accuracy of 63%.				23rd IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI)	NOV 07-09, 2011	IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Multimedia Comp (TCMC); Bio & Artificial Intelligence Soc (BAIS); Florida Atlant Univ (FAU); Univ Technol, Ctr Quantum Comp & Intelligent Syst (UTS-QCIS); Tsinghua Univ, Arnetminer	Boca Raton, FL	0	0	0	0	0	1082-3409	978-0-7695-4596-7	WOS:000299009900064

Each base classifier, called K-TIPCAC, is mainly based on the projection of the given points on the Fisher subspace, estimated on the training data, by means of a novel technique. The proposed multiclass classifier is applied to the task of protein subcellular location prediction, which is one of the most difficult inulticlass prediction problems in modern computational biology. Although many methods have been proposed in the literature to solve this problem all the existing approaches are affected by some limitations, so that the problem is still open. Experimental results clearly indicate that the proposed technique, called DDAG K-TIPCAC, performs equally, if not better, than state of the art ensemble methods aimed at multi-class classification of highly unbalanced data.				3rd Workshop on Supervised and Unsupervised Ensemble Methods and Their Applications	SEP, 2010		Barcelona, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	1860-949X	978-3-642-22909-1	WOS:000309505800009

These design principles are extracted from experiences, discussed in this paper, which guided the creation of the parameter-less multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, named MO-EPNN (multi-objective evolutionary probabilistic neural network). Furthermore, these design principles are also corroborated by similar principles used for an earlier design of a parameter-less, multi-objective genetic algorithm used to optimize a population of ART (adaptive resonance theory) models, named MO-GART (multi-objective genetically optimized ART); the ART classifier model is another example of an exemplar-based classifier model. MO-EPNN's performance is compared to other popular classifier models, such as SVM (Support Vector Machines) and CART (Classification and Regression Trees), as well as to an alternate competitive method to genetically optimize the PNN. These comparisons indicate that MO-EPNN's performance (generalization on unseen data and size) compares favorably to the aforementioned classifier models and to the alternate genetically optimized PNN approach. MO-EPPN's good performance, and MO-GART's earlier reported good performance, both of whose design relies on the same principles, gives credence to these design principles, delineated in this paper.

Due to computation cost of ensemble approaches there is a need for pruning ensembles. In this work we study ensemble pruning based on data partitioning. We use a ranked-based pruning approach. For this purpose base classifiers are ranked and pruned according to their accuracies in a separate validation set. We employ four data partitioning methods with four machine learning categorization algorithms. We mainly aim to examine ensemble pruning in text categorization. We conduct experiments on two text collections: Reuters-21578 and BilCat-TRT. We show that we can prune 90% of ensemble members with almost no decrease in accuracy. We demonstrate that it is possible to increase accuracy of traditional ensembling with ensemble pruning.				7th Asia Information Retrieval Societies Conference (AIRS 2011)	DEC 18-20, 2011	Dubai Knowledge Village; Microsoft Middle E	Dubai, U ARAB EMIRATES	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-642-25630-1	WOS:000303361100032	
J	Turhal, Umit Cigdem; Duysak, Alpaslan								An algorithm to minimize within-class scatter and to reduce common matrix dimension for image recognition								TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			19	6			929	939		10.3906/elk-1003-403			2011	2011	In this paper, a new algorithm using 2DPCA and Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization Procedure for recognition of face images is proposed. The algorithm consists of two parts. In the first part, a common feature matrix is obtained; and in the second part, the dimension of the common feature matrix is reduced. Resulting common feature matrix with reduced dimension is used for face recognition. Column and row covariance matrices are obtained by applying 2DPCA on the column and row vectors of images, respectively. The algorithm then applies eigenvalue-eigenvector decomposition to each of these two covariance matrices. Total scatter maximization is achieved taking the projection of images onto d eigenvectors corresponding to the largest d eigenvalues of column covariance matrix, yielding the feature matrix. The each column of the feature matrix represents a feature vector. Minimization of within class scatter is achieved by reducing the redundancy of the corresponding feature vectors of the different images in the same class. A common feature vector for each d(th) eigenvector direction is obtained by applying Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization Procedure. A common feature matrix is established by gathering d common feature vectors in a matrix form. Then, the dimension of common feature matrix is reduced to d x d taking the projection of common feature matrix onto d eigenvectors which corresponds to the largest d eigenvalues of row covariance matrix. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated experimentally by measuring the recognition rates. The developed algorithm produced better recognition rates compared to Eigenface, Fisherface and 2DPCA methods. Ar-Face and ORL face databases are used in the experimental evaluations.								0	0	0	0	0	1300-0632		WOS:000295497900009

Optimal surgical resection requires accurate discrimination between normal and abnormal, cancerous tissue. We present our recent experience using quantitative optical spectroscopy in 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence-guided resection. Exogenous administration of ALA leads to preferential accumulation in tumor tissue of the fluorescent compound, PpIX, which can be used for in vivo surgical guidance. Using the state of the art approach with a fluorescence surgical microscope, we have been able to visualize a subset of brain tumors, but the sensitivity and accuracy of fluorescence detection for tumor tissue with this system are low. To take full advantage of the biological selectivity of PpIX accumulation in brain tumors, we used a quantitative optical spectroscopy system for in vivo measurements of PpIX tissue concentrations. We have shown that, using our quantitative approach for determination of biomarker concentrations, ALA-induced PpIX fluorescence-guidance can achieve accuracies of greater than 90% for most tumor histologies. Here we show multivariate analysis of fluorescence and diffuse reflectance signals in brain tumors with comparable diagnostic performance to our previously reported quantitative approach. These results are promising, since they show that technological improvements in current fluorescence-guided surgical technologies and more biologically relevant approaches are required to take full advantage of fluorescent biomarkers, achieve better tumor identification, increase extent of resection, and subsequently, lead to improve survival and quality of life in patients.

Programmed image filters generally result in low to medium performing solutions. Data-derived filters perform better in that they tap on selected image features, but require a per-sensor effort by an analyst or a machine learning expert. This contribution addresses filter shaping as a data-driven process that is 'placed in the hands of many end-users' with extensive domain knowledge but no expertise in machine learning. The focus is on interactive machine learning technologies as a means to achieve self-programming and specialization of image filters that learn to search images by their content, sequential order, and temporal attributes. We describe and assess the performance of two interactive algorithms designed and implemented for a real case study in process monitoring for nuclear safeguards. Experiments show that interactive machine learning helps detect safeguards relevant event while significantly reducing the number of false positives.								0	0	0	0	0	1860-949X	978-3-642-19550-1	WOS:000290879300010

For a higher dimensional data, if the training set size is small, it suffers from the curse of dimensionality effect and performance gets degraded. Partition based pattern synthesis is an existing technique of generating a larger set of artificial training patterns based on a chosen partition of the feature set. If the blocks of the partition are statistically independent then the quality of synthetic patterns generated is high. But, such a partition, often does not exist for real world problems. So, approximate ways of generating a partition based on correlation coefficient values between pairs of features were used earlier in some studies. That is, an approximate hard partition, where each feature belongs to exactly one cluster (block) of the partition was used for doing the synthesis. The current paper proposes an improvement over this. Instead of having a hard approximate partition, a soft approximate partition based on fuzzy set theory could be beneficial. The present paper proposes such a fuzzy partitioning method of the feature set called fuzzy partition around medoids (fuzzy-PAM). Experimentally, using some standard data-sets, it is demonstrated that the fuzzy partition based synthetic patters are better as for as the classification accuracy is concerned.				5th Multi-Disciplinary International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence, MIWAI-2011	DEC 07-09, 2011	IBM India; Locuz Enterprise Solut Ltd; IDRBT; Winzest	Univ Hyderabad, Hyderabad, INDIA	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-642-25724-7	WOS:000308110800011

How to design and implement efficient and effective multi-label algorithms is a challenging issue. The k-nearest neighbor (kNN) method and its weighted form (WkNN) are simple but effective for binary and multi-class classification. In this paper, we construct a weighted kNN version for multi-label classification (MLC-WkNN) according to Bayesian theorem. Through approximating a query instance by the linear weighted sum of k-nearest neighbors in terms of least squared error, the weights are determined adaptively by solving a quadratic programming with a unit simplex constraint. Specially, our MLC-WkNN is still a model-free and instance-based learning technique and only involves a tunable parameter k. Experimental study on two benchmark data sets (Image and Yeast) illustrates that our MLC-WkNN outperforms seven existing high-performed multi-label algorithms.				18th International Conference on Neural Information Processing (ICONIP 2011)	NOV 13-17, 2011	Asia Pacific Neural Network Assembly; Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ; Natl Nat Sci Fdn China; Shanghai Hyron Software Co Ltd; Microsoft Res Asia; Hitachi Res & Dev Corp; Fujitsu Res & Dev Ctr Co Ltd	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-642-24957-0	WOS:000306990600010

Leveraging prosodic cues as an alternative or augmentative communication (AAC) signal may allow some individuals with dysarthria to use their vocalizations to engage in richer and more efficient interactions. As an initial step towards building voice-driven communication aids, the performance of three machine classification algorithms was compared to determine which algorithm(s) was most accurate and efficient for classifying a dataset of prosodic manipulations. Our findings suggest that machine classification of dysarthric productions is feasible using preexisting machine learners and rather minimal training data. Highly accurate classification of categorical duration control was achieved for all speakers with dysarthria; however, classification of pitch categories and simultaneous duration-pitch control varied widely across speakers. These findings have implications for harnessing the residual vocal abilities of individuals with dysarthria for machine-mediated AAC interactions.								0	0	0	0	0	1065-1438		WOS:000284866700005

J	Visweswaran, Shyam; Cooper, Gregory F.								Learning Instance-Specific Predictive Models								JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			11				3333	3369					DEC 2010	2010	This paper introduces a Bayesian algorithm for constructing predictive models from data that are optimized to predict a target variable well for a particular instance. This algorithm learns Markov blanket models, carries out Bayesian model averaging over a set of models to predict a target variable of the instance at hand, and employs an instance-specific heuristic to locate a set of suitable models to average over. We call this method the instance-specific Markov blanket (ISMB) algorithm. The ISMB algorithm was evaluated on 21 UCI data sets using five different performance measures and its performance was compared to that of several commonly used predictive algorithms, including nave Bayes, C4.5 decision tree, logistic regression, neural networks, k-Nearest Neighbor, Lazy Bayesian Rules, and AdaBoost. Over all the data sets, the ISMB algorithm performed better on average on all performance measures against all the comparison algorithms.								0	0	0	0	0	1532-4435		WOS:000286637200003

Still, many practitioners have reservations about sharing or outsourcing datasets, primarily because of fear of losing the principal rights over the dataset. This work presents a way of convincingly claiming ownership rights over a trajectory dataset, without, at the same time, destroying the salient dataset characteristics, which are important for accurate search operations and data-mining tasks. The digital watermarking methodology that we present distorts imperceptibly a collection of sequences, effectively embedding a secret key, while retaining as well as possible the neighborhood of each object, which is vital for operations such as similarity search, classification, or clustering. A key contribution in this methodology is a technique for discovering the maximum distortion that still maintains such desirable properties. We demonstrate both analytically and empirically that the proposed dataset marking techniques can withstand a number of attacks (such a translation, rotation, noise addition, etc) and therefore can provide a robust framework for facilitating the secure dissemination of trajectory datasets.								0	0	0	0	0	1066-8888		WOS:000280599600004	
J	Shibata, Tomoyuki; Wada, Toshikazu								K-D Decision Tree: An Accelerated and Memory Efficient Nearest Neighbor Classifier								IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			E93D	7			1670	1681		10.1587/transinf.E93.D.1670			JUL 2010	2010	This paper presents a novel algorithm for Nearest Neighbor (NN) classifier. NN classification is a well-known method of pattern classification having the following properties: * it performs maximum-margin classification and achieves less than twice the ideal Bayesian error, * it does not require knowledge of pattern distributions, kernel functions or base classifiers, and * it can naturally be applied to multiclass classification problems. Among the drawbacks are A) inefficient memory use and B) ineffective pattern classification speed. This paper deals with the problems A and B. In most cases. NN search algorithms, such as k-d tree, are employed as a pattern search engine of the NN classifier. However, NN classification does not always require the NN search. Based on this idea, we propose a novel algorithm named k-d decision tree (KDDT). Since KDDT uses Voronoi-condensed prototypes, it consumes less memory than naive NN classifiers. We have confirmed that KDDT is much faster than NN search-based classifier through a comparative experiment (from 9 to 369 times faster than NN search based classifier). Furthermore, in order to extend applicability of the KDDT algorithm to high-dimensional NN classification, we modified it by incorporating Gabriel editing or RNG editing instead of Voronoi condensing. Through experiments using simulated and real data, we have confirmed the modified KDDT algorithms are superior to the original one.								0	0	0	0	0	0916-8532		WOS:000281342100002

Recommender Systems (RS) play an important role in this area. Here, we aim to establish a genre-based collaborative RS to automatically suggest and rank a list of appropriate items (movies) to a user based on the user profile and the past voting patterns of other users with similar tastes. The contribution of this paper is using genre based information in a hybrid fuzzy-Bayesian network collaborative RS. The interest to the different genres is computed based on a hybrid user model. The similarity of like-minded users according to the fuzzy distance and also Pearson correlation coefficient is involved in a Bayesian network.				2010 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence	JUL 18-23, 2010	IEEE; IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc; Int Neural Network Soc; Evolut Program Soc; IET	Barcelona, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	1098-7584	978-1-4244-6920-8	WOS:000287453601108

This is still an open difficult research problem due to a variety of challenges, such as non-i.i.d. data distribution, skewed or disjoint class distribution, satiability; peer dynamism and a synchronism. In this paper, we present a novel P2P Adaptive Classification Ensemble (PACE.) framework to perform classification in P2P networks. Unlike regular ensemble classification approaches, our new framework adapts to the test data. distribution and dynamically adjusts the voting scheme by combining a subset of classifiers/peers according to the test data example. In our approach, we implement the proposed PACE solution together with the state-of-the-art linear SVM as the base classifier for scalable P2P classification. Extensive empirical studies show that the proposed PACE method is both efficient and effective in improving classification performance over regular methods under various adverse conditions.				15th International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications	APR 01-04, 2010		Tsukuba, JAPAN	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-642-12025-1	WOS:000279562400003

They rely on independence hypotheses, together with a normality assumption, which may be too demanding, when dealing with numerical data. Possibility distributions are more compatible with the representation of poor data. This paper investigates two kinds of possibilistic elicitation methods that will be embedded into possibilistic naive classifiers. The first one is derived from a probability-possibility transformation of Gaussian distributions (or mixtures of them), which introduces some further tolerance. The second kind is based on a direct interpretation of data in fuzzy histogram or possibilistic formats that exploit an idea of proximity between attribute values in different ways. Besides, possibilistic classifiers may be allowed to leave the classification open between several classes in case of insufficient information for choosing one (which may be of interest when the number of classes is large). The experiments reported show the interest of possibilistic classifiers.				4th Annual International Conference on Scalable Uncertainty Management (SUM)	SEP 27-29, 2010		Toulouse, FRANCE	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-642-15950-3	WOS:000312447800015	
J	Chakrabarti, Amit; Regev, Oded								AN OPTIMAL RANDOMIZED CELL PROBE LOWER BOUND FOR APPROXIMATE NEAREST NEIGHBOR SEARCHING								SIAM JOURNAL ON COMPUTING			39	5			1919	1940		10.1137/080729955			2010	2010	We consider the approximate nearest neighbor search problem on the Hamming cube {0, 1}(d). We show that a randomized cell probe algorithm that uses polynomial storage and word size d(O(1)) requires a worst case query time of O(log log d/log log log d). The approximation factor may be as loose as 2log(1-eta d) for any fixed eta > 0. Our result fills a major gap in the study of this problem since all earlier lower bounds either did not allow randomization [A. Chakrabarti et al., A lower bound on the complexity of approximate nearest-neighbor searching on the Hamming cube, in Discrete and Computational Geometry, Springer, Berlin, 2003, pp. 313-328; D. Liu, Inform. Process. Lett., 92 (2004), pp. 23-29] or did not allow approximation [A. Borodin, R. Ostrovsky, and Y. Rabani, Proceedings of the 31st Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 1999, pp. 312-321; O. Barkol and Y. Rabani, Proceedings of the 32nd Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2000, pp. 388-396; T. S. Jayram et al., J. Comput. System Sci., 69 (2004), pp. 435-447]. We also give a cell probe algorithm that proves that our lower bound is optimal. Our proof uses a lower bound on the round complexity of the related communication problem. We show, additionally, that considerations of bit complexity alone cannot prove any nontrivial cell probe lower bound for the problem. This shows that the "richness technique" [P. B. Miltersen et al., J. Comput. System Sci., 57 (1998), pp. 37-49] used in a lot of recent research around this problem would not have helped here.

The standard Euclidean distance is commonly used in practice. This paper investigates the performance of k-NN classifier with respect to different adaptive metrics in the context of medical imaging. We propose using adaptive metrics such that the structure of the data is better described, introducing some unsupervised learning knowledge in k-NN.We investigated four different metrics are estimated: a theoretical metric based on the assumption that images are drawn from Brownian Image Model (BIM), the normalized metric based on variance of the data, the empirical metric is based on the empirical covariance matrix of the unlabeled data, and an optimized metric obtained by minimizing the classification error. The spectral structure of the empirical covariance also leads to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) performed on it which results the subspace metrics.The metrics are evaluated on two data sets: lateral X-rays of the lumbar aortic/spine region, where we use k-NN for performing abdominal aorta calcification detection; and mammograms, where we use k-NN for breast cancer risk assessment. The results show that appropriate choice of metric can improve classification.

Consequently, unsolicited or spam e-mails have dramatically become a major threat that can negatively impact the usability of the electronic mail as a reliable communication means. Besides wasting considerable time and money for business users and network administrators, spam consumes network bandwidth and server storage space, slows down e-mail servers, and provides a medium to distribute harmful and/or offensive content. Hence, it has become an important and indispensable aspect of any recent e-mail system to incorporate a spam filtering subsystem. In this chapter, we present an overview of the spam filtering problem and survey the state-of-the-art of the proposed and deployed machine learning based methods. We begin with a brief review of potential spam threats for network users and resources, and some market analysis indicators of the spam growth rate. After that, we formally describe the machine learning spam filtering problem and discuss various approaches for representing e-mail messages and selecting relevant features. Then, we describe some common metrics and benchmark corpora for evaluating and comparing the performance of different learning methods for spam filtering. Next, we discuss various learning algorithms that have been applied to this problem and survey the related work. Finally, we present a case study to compare the performance of a number of these learning methods on one of the publicly available datasets.								0	0	0	0	0		978-1-60456-646-8	WOS:000278665800015

This method automatically creates a model for liver fibrosis grading based on training datasets. Our supervised learning method evaluates hepatic hemodynamics from an anatomical MRI image and three T2*-W fMRI signal intensity time-course scans acquired during the breathing of air, air-carbon dioxide, and carbogen. It constructs a statistical model of liver fibrosis from these fMRI scans using a binary-based one-against-all multi class Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. We evaluated the resulting classification model with the leave-one out technique and compared it to both full multi-class SVM and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifications. Our experimental study analyzed 57 slice sets from 13 mice, and yielded a 98.2% separation accuracy between healthy and low grade fibrotic subjects, and an overall accuracy of 84.2% for fibrosis grading. These results are better than the existing image-based methods which can only discriminate between healthy and high grade fibrosis subjects. With appropriate extensions, our method may be used for non-invasive classification and progression monitoring of liver fibrosis in human patients instead of more invasive approaches, such as biopsy or contrast-enhanced imaging.

IEEE					Dynamic K-Nearest Neighbors For The Monitoring Of Evolving Systems								2010 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUZZY SYSTEMS (FUZZ-IEEE 2010)	IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems												2010	2010	In this article, a new Pattern Recognition (PR) approach is proposed to monitor the functioning modes evolutions in dynamic systems. When a functioning mode evolves, the system characteristics change and the observations, i.e. the patterns, obtained on the system change too. In this case, classes representing the system functioning modes have to be updated by keeping representative patterns only. The developed PR approach is based on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) method. It is named Dynamic KNN (DKNN) and comprises two phases: a detection phase to detect and confirm classes evolutions and an adaptation phase realized incrementally to update the evolved classes parameters and reduce the dataset. To illustrate this approach, the monitoring of weldings quality (good or bad) is realized on an industrial system, based on acoustic noises issued of weldings operations.				2010 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence	JUL 18-23, 2010	IEEE; IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc; Int Neural Network Soc; Evolut Program Soc; IET	Barcelona, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	1098-7584	978-1-4244-6920-8	WOS:000287453602047

As an important task of data mining, classification plays an important role in information retrieval, web searching, CRM, etc. Most of the present classification techniques are serial, which become impractical for large dataset. The computing resource is under-utilized and the executing time is not waitable. Provided the program mode of MapReduce, we propose the parallel implementation methods of several classification algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors, naive bayesian model and decision tree, etc. Preparatory experiments show that the proposed parallel methods can not only process large dataset, but also can be extended to execute on a cluster, which can significantly improve the efficiency.				5th International Conference on Rough Set and Knowledge Technology (RSKT)	OCT 15-17, 2010	Beijing Jiaotong Univ; Natl Nat Sci Fdn China (NSFC); Int Rough Set Soc (IRSS); Chinese Assoc Artificial Intelligence, Rough Sets & Soft Computat Soc (CRSSC)	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-642-16247-3	WOS:000314802800089

To relax this problem, the SVM was extended into a fuzzy SVM (FSVM) by the introduction of fuzzy memberships. The FSVM also has been further extended in two ways, by adopting a different objective function with the help of domain-specific knowledge, or by employing a different membership calculation method. In this paper we follow the second approach by proposing a new membership calculation method using a fuzzy k nearest neighbor classifier (F-KNN). Although there are already several membership calculation methods to enhance the performance of the FSVM, one problem in those methods is that they assume a specific data distribution. The F-KNN does not assume any data distribution, which helps the proposed method to accommodate various data distributions in real world problems. The proposed algorithm was applied to an insect footprint classification problem, and results verify the effectiveness of the method.				2010 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence	JUL 18-23, 2010	IEEE; IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc; Int Neural Network Soc; Evolut Program Soc; IET	Barcelona, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	1098-7584	978-1-4244-6920-8	WOS:000287453600058

The feature information of the training data is extracted firstly. In the classification phase, the feature information of the training data and the testing data are compared to make the initial prediction. If the predicting result is {C} which has only one element, testing data will be labeled class C. If the predicting result is {C(1), C(2), ... C(i)}, the corresponding subset of the training data set will be used in the k-NN algorithm to attain the predicted result. It is shown that this algorithm combined k-NN rule reduces computing time. If the feature information set could well generalize the training data, the error rate of the algorithm is decreased. The effectiveness of this proposed approach is verified on a public remote sensing data set.				5th International Symposium on Intelligence Computation and Applications	OCT 22-24, 2010	China Univ Geosciences; China Univ Geosciences, Sch Comp Sci	Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	1865-0929	978-3-642-16387-6	WOS:000288485100028	
S	Hua, Qiang; Ji, Aibing; He, Qiang			IEEE					Multiple Real-valued K Nearest Neighbor Classifiers System by Feature Grouping								IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN AND CYBERNETICS (SMC 2010)	IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics Conference Proceedings												2010	2010	This paper proposes a method to fuse Real-valued K nearest neighbor classifier by feature grouping. Real-valued K nearest neighbor classifier can approximate continuous-valued target functious, which can provide more information than crisp K nearest neighbor classifier in fusion. In addition real-valued K nearest neighbor classifier is sensitive to feature perturbation. Therefore, when multiple real-valued K nearest neighbor classifiers are fused by feature grouping, the performance of the fusion is better than single classifier. In order to validate the performance of fusion, four datasets are selected from vel Repository. Experimental results show that the performance of fusion is better than single classifier and multiple classifier system by other perturbations.

In this paper, an approach for creating and recognizing automatically the behavior profile of a computer user is combined with an evolving method to keep up to date the created profiles. The behavior of a computer is represented in this research as the sequence of commands s/he types during a period of time. This sequence is treated using statistical methods in order to create the corresponding user profile. However, as a user profile is usually not fixed but rather it changes and evolves, we propose a user profile classifier based on Evolving Systems. This paper describes briefly the model creation method and the evolving classifier, which are compared with well established off-line and on-line classifiers.				2010 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence	JUL 18-23, 2010	IEEE; IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc; Int Neural Network Soc; Evolut Program Soc; IET	Barcelona, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	1098-7584	978-1-4244-6920-8	WOS:000287453602125

The core concept of the paper is built upon the principle of symbolic dynamic filtering (SDF) that is used to extract relevant information in complex dynamical systems. The objective here is to identify the robot behavior from time-series data of piezoelectric sensor signals from the pressure sensitive floor in a laboratory environment. A symbolic feature extraction method is presented by partitioning of two-dimensional wavelet images of sensor time-series data. The K-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm is used to identify the patterns extracted by SDF. The proposed method is validated by experimentation, on a networked robotics test bed to detect and identify the type and motion profile of mobile robots.

An effective solution to defining such a metric is to learn it from a set of training samples. In this work, we propose a fast and scalable algorithm to learn a Mahalanobis distance. By employing the principle of margin maximization to secure better generalization performances, this algorithm formulates the metric learning as a convex optimization problem with a positive semidefinite (psd) matrix variable. Based on an important theorem that a psd matrix with trace of one can always be represented as a convex combination of multiple rank-one matrices, our algorithm employs a differentiable loss function and solves the above convex optimization with gradient descent methods. This algorithm not only naturally maintains the psd requirement; of the matrix variable that is essential for metric learning; but also significantly cuts down computational overhead, making it much more efficient with the increasing dimensions of feature vectors. Experimental study on benchmark data sets indicates that, compared with the existing metric learning algorithms, our algorithm can achieve higher classification accuracy with much less computational load.				9th Asian Conference on Computer Vision	SEP 23-27, 2009	Peking Univ, Key Lab Machine Percept; Chinese Acad Sci, Natl lab Pattern Recognit, Inst Automat; Natl Nat Sci Fdn China; Microsoft Res; Fujitsu; Microview; Luster	Xian, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-642-12296-5	WOS:000279642800029

Dialogue acts are sentence-level units that represent states of a dialogue, such as questions, statements, hesitations, etc. The knowledge of dialogue act realizations in a discourse or dialogue is part of the speech understanding and dialogue analysis process. It is of great importance for many applications: dialogue systems, speech recognition, automatic machine translation, etc. The main goal of this paper is to study the existing works about DA recognition and to discuss their respective advantages and drawbacks. A major concern in the DA recognition domain is that, although a few DA annotation schemes seem now to emerge as standards, most of the time, these DA tag-sets have to be adapted to the specificities of a given application, which prevents the deployment of standardized DA databases and evaluation procedures. The focus of this review is put on the various kinds of information that can be used to recognize DAs, such as prosody, lexical, etc., and on the types of models proposed so far to capture this information. Combining these information sources tends to appear nowadays as a prerequisite to recognize DAs.								0	0	0	0	0	1335-9150		WOS:000279752200004

This usually is a difficult task since RL has less chance to visit all state or has enough number of visit to learn average reward accurately. Moreover, RL may not be able to learn or obtain any optimal solution as RL learn by averaging rewards from each action performing in each state. In order to alleviate this RL learning problem, any solution to a task such as, non-optimal algorithm or heuristics can collaborate with RL by using their knowledge to prune the non-optimal action in each state. This reduces search space of RL and helps it learn faster. A Minimal consistent subset problem is used as an example to demonstrate how RL can learn faster with the help of other heuristics.

A technique called Iteration Windows is introduced to govern the number of iteration in each searching stage. The size of the iteration windows is controlled by a fuzzy controller, which uses the information provided by the k-nearest neighbors system to analyze the population during the searching process. The controller keeps controlling the iteration windows until the end of the searching process. The wavelet based mutation process is embedded in the DE searching process to enhance the searching performance of DE. The F weight of DE is also controlled by the fuzzy controller to further speed up the searching process. A suite of benchmark test functions is employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. It is shown empirically that the proposed method can terminate the searching process with a reasonable number of iteration.				2010 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence	JUL 18-23, 2010	IEEE; IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc; Int Neural Network Soc; Evolut Program Soc; IET	Barcelona, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0		978-1-4244-8126-2	WOS:000287375801030

This paper proposes a Multiclass Common Spatial Pattern (MCSP) based on Joint Approximate Diagonalization (JAD) for multiclass BCIs. The proposed method based on fast Frobenius diagonalization (FFDIAG) is compared with another method based on Jacobi angles on the BCI competition IV dataset 2a. The classification accuracies obtained from 10x10-fold cross-validations on the training dataset are compared using K-Nearest Neighbor, Classification Trees and Support Vector Machine classifiers. The proposed MCSP based on FFDIAG yields an averaged accuracy of 53.6% compared to 32.8% given by the method based on Jacobi angles and 27.8% of the one versus rest CSP methods.

However, different versions of k-NN may use different strategies to select the cases on which the solution is based when there are ties for the kth most similar case. One strategy is to break ties for the kth most similar case based on the ordering of cases in the dataset. We present an analysis of the order dependence introduced by this strategy and its effects on the algorithm's performance.				20th Irish Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science	AUG 19-21, 2009	Sch Comp Sci & Informat; CLARITY; Sci Fdn Ireland Ctr Sci, Engn & Technol; Tyndall Natl Inst; CLIQUE; Strateg Res Cluster; Sci Fdn Ireland (SFI); IBM; Idiro Technol; Norkom Technol	Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, IRELAND	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-642-17079-9	WOS:000286799900023

As in MOUT scenarios threats usually arise from humans one important task is the robust detection of humans.Detection of humans in MOUT by image processing systems can be very challenging, e.g., due to complex outdoor scenes where humans have a weak contrast against the background or are partially occluded. Porikli et al. introduced covariance descriptors and showed their usefulness for human detection in complex scenes. However, these descriptors do not lie on a vector space and so well-known machine learning techniques need to be adapted to train covariance descriptor classifiers. We present a novel approach based on manifold learning that simplifies the classification of covariance descriptors.In this paper, we apply this approach for detecting humans. We describe our human detection method and evaluate the detector on benchmark data sets generated from real-world image sequences captured during MOUT exercises.

Today, massively parallel DNA sequencing and hybridization approaches allow the identification of not only the gene repertoire but also the gene regulatory networks that function within an organism. The huge amounts of data acquired from such experiments can only be handled with intensive bioinformatics support that has to provide an adequate infrastructure for storing and analysing these data. Bioinformatics has to deliver efficient data analysis algorithms, user-friendly tools and software applications, as well as extensive hardware infrastructure to deal with these genome-scale analyses.The following chapter briefly introduces not only the most relevant topics of bioinformatics for functional and structural genomics but also addresses the practical aspects of other steps of a genome project such as sequencing or data management issues. The chapter will take the reader through the different technical approaches that can be applied in marine genomics projects.In the first part, we will mainly focus on data generation, introducing classical genome sequencing approaches such as the Sanger method and the shotgun technique. Moreover, a short overview of the current status of the next generation of sequencing techniques will be given. In the second part, we briefly introduce the concept of data management for bioinformatics applications. In the third part, we describe the basic principles of genome sequence analysis and address topics like EST clustering and genome assembly, gene prediction, gene function assignment and classification as well as whole genome annotation. In the fourth part of this chapter, we present an overview of transcriptome data analysis using microarray hybridization technology. After a brief introduction to microarray technology we describe state-of-the-art methods for image processing, data normalization, significance testing and cluster analysis.								0	0	0	0	0		978-90-481-8616-7	WOS:000278068900009

Frequently, excessive workload results in poor performance or in failing to finish the studies. The problem is more severe in lifelong learning, where students are professionals with family duties. So, the need of making informative decisions as of whether taking a specific course fits into a student's schedule is of great importance. This paper illustrates a system, called EDUPLAN and being currently under development, which aims at helping the student to make intelligent management of her time. EDUPLAN aims at informing the student as for which learning objects can fit her schedule or not, as well as at organizing her time. This can be achieved using scheduling algorithms and a description of the user's tasks and events. In the paper we also extend the LOM 1484.12.3 (TM)-2005 ontology with classes that can be used to describe the temporal distribution of the workload of any learning object. Finally, we provide EDUPLAN'S architecture, being built around the existing SELFPLANNER intelligent calendar application.				6th Hellenic Conference on Artificial Intelligence	MAY 04-07, 2010	Hellen Soc Artificial Intelligence; Inst Informat & Telecommun; NCSR	Athens, GREECE	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-642-12841-7	WOS:000281445400047

Some methods cannot even achieve as high a classification accuracy as the most accurate individual classifying component. To address this issue, we present the strategy of Aggregate Confidence Ensembles, which uses multiple measures to estimate a classifier's confidence in its predictions on an instance-by-instance basis. Using these confidence estimators to weight the votes in an ensemble results in an overall average increase in classification accuracy compared to the most accurate classifier in the ensemble. These aggregate measures result in higher classification accuracy than using a collection of single confidence estimates. Aggregate Confidence Ensembles outperform three baseline ensemble creation strategies, as well as the methods of Modified Stacking and Arbitration, both in terms of average classification accuracy and algorithm-by-algorithm comparisons in accuracy over 36 data sets.

However, because of the overfitting problem, the accuracy decreases if the SVM is modeled improperly or if the data is excessively noisy or nonlinear. For SVM, most of the misclassification occurs when the test data lies closer to the decision boundary. Therefore in this paper, we investigate the effect of Support Vectors found by SVM, and their effect on the decision when used with the Gaussian kernel. Based on the discussion results we also propose a new technique to improve the performance of SVM by creating smaller clusters along the decision boundary in the higher dimensional space. In this way we reduce the overfitting problem that occurs because of the model selection or the noise effect. As an alternative SVM tuning method, we also propose using only K highest Lagrange multipliers to summarize the decision boundary instead of the whole support vectors and compare the performances. Thus with test results, we show that the number of Support Vectors can be decreased further by using only a fraction of the support vectors found at the training step as a post-processing method.

Pughineanu. Evaluation of the Performances of a Parallel Algorithm to Recognize the Patterns in Relation with the Sequential Variant // Electronics and Electrical Engineering. - Kaunas: Technologija, 2010. - No. 9(105). - P. 65-68. To achieve an algorithm to efficiently recognize the patterns to return the best solution, we need an intensive processing of the entrance set data. In most cases there is a compromise between the taking over of the entrance set data and the algorithm execution time. The intensive processing of the entrance set data needs rather high calculation resources which cannot always be obtained from the ordinary calculation systems. In this paper we suggest the parallelization of an algorithm to recognize the patterns in scientific literature, its parallelization and the evaluation of this variant in relation to the sequential algorithm. This algorithm will be tested using a cluster formed of 28 nods, each nod having 2 quad core 2.33GHz processors.

We refer to all these preferred states as "preferences". The preferences an agent has selected to bring about at a given time are called "goals". This selection of preferences as goals is generally referred to as "goal generation". Basic aim behind goal generation is to provide the agent with a way of getting new goals. Although goal generation results in an increase in the agent's knowledge about its goals, the overall autonomy of the agent does not increase as its goals are derived from its preferences (which are programmed). We argue that to achieve greater autonomy, an agent must be able to generate new preferences. In this paper we discuss how an agent can generate new preferences based on analogy between new objects and the objects it has known preferences for.				8th International Workshop on Multi-Agent Systems Technologies	SEP 27-29, 2010		Leipzig, GERMANY	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-642-16177-3	WOS:000289106100017

We propose to rank features with the Laplacian Score to reduce the search space, and then we use this order to find the best feature subset. We compare our method against other based on ranking feature selection methods, namely, Information Gain Attribute Ranking, Relief, Correlation-based Feature Selection, and additionally we include in our comparison a Wrapper Subset Evaluation method.

MICHALSKI	Studies in Computational Intelligence		263				515	529			10.1007/978-3-642-05179-1		2010	2010	Based on mathematical models of immunocomputing, this chapter proposes an approach to speaker recognition by intelligent signal processing. The approach includes both low-level feature extraction and high-level ("intelligent") pattern recognition. The key model is the formal immune network (FIN) including apoptosis (programmed cell death) and immunization both controlled by cytokines (messenger proteins). Such FIN can be formed from audio signals using discrete tree transform (DTT), singular value decomposition (SVD), and the proposed index of inseparability in comparison with the Renyi entropy. Application is demonstrated on the task of recognizing nine male speakers by their utterances of two Japanese vowels. The obtained results suggest that the proposed approach outperforms state of the art approaches of computational intelligence.								0	0	0	0	0	1860-949X	978-3-642-05178-4	WOS:000274201700024

One of these examples where quality control becomes critical is the percussion cap mass production. These elements must achieve a minimum tolerance deviation in their fabrication. This paper outlines a machine vision development using a 3D camera for the inspection of the whole production of percussion caps. This system presents multiple problems, such as metallic reflections in the percussion caps, high speed movement of the system and mechanical errors and irregularities in percussion cap placement. Due to these problems, it is impossible to solve the problem by traditional image processing methods, and hence, machine learning algorithms have been tested to provide a feasible classification of the possible errors present in the percussion caps.				5th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems	JUN 23-25, 2010		Univ Pais Vasco, San Sebastian, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-642-13768-6	WOS:000286842000033

It is compared to more conventional AR-type counterpart on a classification of biosonar echoes, in which echoes from various tree species insonified with a bat-like chirp call are converted to biologically plausible feature vectors. Next, parametric and non-parametric models of the class-conditional densities are built from the echo feature vectors. The models are deployed in single-shot and sequential-decision classification algorithms. The results indicate that the proposed ARMA filter structure offers an improved single-echo classification performance, which leads to faster sequential-decision making than its AR-type counterpart.								0	0	0	0	0	1210-0552		WOS:000277434000004

Among many propositions, jumping emerging patterns (JEPs) have gained significant recognition due to their simplicity and strong discrimination capabilities. This thesis considers JEPs in terms of discovery and classification. The focus is put on their correspondence to the rough set theory. Transformations between transactional data and decision tables allow us to demonstrate relations of JEPs and global/local reducts. As a part of this discussion, we introduce the concept of a jumping emerging pattern with negation (JEPN). Our observations lead to two novel JEP mining methods based on local reducts: global condensation and local projection. Both attempt to decrease dimensionality of subproblems prior to reduct computation. We show that JEP mining can be reduced to the reduct set problem. The latter is addressed with a new approach, called RedApriori, that follows an Apriori candidate generation scheme and employs pruning based on the notion of attribute set dependence. In addition, we discuss different ways of storing pattern collections and propose a CC-Trie, a tree structure that ensures compactness of information and fast pattern lookups.								0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-642-14466-0	WOS:000285116400013

Its simplicity and effectiveness justify the use of this technique in certain domains but it however presents several drawbacks referring to time response, noise sensitivity and storage requirements. Several solutions have been proposed in order to alleviate these problems, such as improving the technique for speeding up or carrying out a data reduction process. Prototype generation is a suitable process for data reduction that allows to fit a data set for nearest neighbor classification. Position adjustment of prototypes is a successful technique within the prototype generation methodology.Evolutionary algorithms are adaptive methods based on natural evolution that may be used for search and optimization. Position adjustment of prototypes can be viewed as a search problem, thus it could be solved using evolutionary algorithms. In this paper, we perform a preliminary study on the use of differential evolution algorithms to the prototype generation problem. Differential evolution models are compared with other algorithms for adjusting the position of prototypes and the results are contrasted through non-parametrical statistical tests. The results show that some differential evolution models consistently outperform previously proposed methods.				2010 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence	JUL 18-23, 2010	IEEE; IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc; Int Neural Network Soc; Evolut Program Soc; IET	Barcelona, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0		978-1-4244-8126-2	WOS:000287375804024

IEEE					An Improved Nearest Neighbor Method for the Estimation of the Gamma Photon Entry Point in Monolithic Scintillator Detectors for PET								2010 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD (NSS/MIC)	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record						3088	3092					2010	2010	Several improvements of the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) method for the determination of the entry point (x,y) of a gamma photon in a monolithic scintillator PET detector have been investigated with the aim to obtain better spatial resolution and/or to enable faster detector calibration by reducing the amount of required reference data and by allowing for calibrating with a line source. These methods were tested on a dataset measured with a SiPM-array-based monolithic LYSO detector. It appears that similar to 10% to similar to 25% better spatial resolution can be obtained compared to the standard approach. Moreover, some of the improved methods using two orders of magnitude less reference data, yield essentially the same spatial resolution as the standard method, which reduces the time needed for calibration as well as entry point computation. Finally, line source calibration is shown to be possible with some of the methods, yielding better results than the standard method and allowing much faster and easier collection of the reference data.

It is the first step toward video content analysis and content-based video retrieval. We develop a novel approach for video shot boundary detection based on supervised learning.

The method works at the level of image patches. In the first stage, codebook-based local appearance features are regularized and reduced in dimension using latent topic models, combined with spatial pyramid matching based spatial layout features, and fed into logistic regression classifiers to produce an initial patch level labeling. In the second stage, these labels are combined with patch-neighborhood and global aggregate features using either a second layer of Logistic Regression or a Conditional Random Field. Finally, the patch-level results are refined to pixel level using MRF or over-segmentation based methods. The CRF is trained using a fast Maximum Margin approach. Comparative experiments on four multi-class segmentation datasets show that each of the above elements improves the results, leading to a scalable algorithm that is both faster and more accurate than existing patch-level approaches.								0	0	0	0	0	1687-6180		WOS:000290327700001

ION					Towards Arbitrary Placement of Multi-sensors Assisted Mobile Navigation System								PROCEEDINGS OF THE 23RD INTERNATIONAL TECHNICAL MEETING OF THE SATELLITE DIVISION OF THE INSTITUTE OF NAVIGATION (ION GNSS 2010)							556	564					2010	2010	Multi-sensors assisted navigation system is one of the most promising solutions for GPS-denied areas. However, as the portable positioning device can be arbitrarily placed on the user's body, it violates the assumed condition of sensor enabled positioning: the alignment. This poses great challenge since sensors 'placement greatly impacts on the positioning solution. The paper attempts to solve this problem by classifying the placement mode from the accelerometer and gyro signals. Then the system adapts proper pedestrian dead reckoning algorithms according to the identified device placement.Six commonly used placement modes including belt, pocket, backpack, in-hand dangling, messaging and near the ear talking are considered as the study cases in this paper. Simple time and frequency domain features are extracted from the inertial sensors then some machine learning algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbour, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines are applied for classification. Subsequently, step detections can be conducted by selecting the most appropriate sensor. Stride length and heading can be further estimated. From some preliminary field test results, the placement-aware solution shows significant improvement over conventional pedestrian solutions. The system fits for a variety of applications in the mass market, such as E-911, personnel/patient monitoring, indoor positioning, and many other location-based services.				23rd International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute-of-Navigation (ION GNSS-2010)	SEP 21-24, 2010		Portland, OR	0	0	0	0	0		*****************	WOS:000290734900046

Application of the Artificial Intelligence to the Prediction of the Ultimate Resistant Capacity of Connections in Steel-Concrete Composite Structures								REVISTA DE LA CONSTRUCCION			8	2			109	119					DEC 2009	2009	In the work the connections in steel-concrete composite structures are treated and different variants of the 'push out" test are described when stud connectors are used in composite beams made up with steel deck oriented perpendicularly to the axis of the steel beams. A database is presented with experimental results that serve as base for the realization of the predictions using artificial intelligence. The algorithm k-NN is described and the technique of optimization Particle Swan Optimization (PSO) is introduced in the assignment of weight to the attributes.It is developed an experiment with the objective of determining the precision of the algorism k-NN, considering two variables: k (near neighbours' number) and "variants of weight", being 20 study combinations. The automated system PROCON was developed that speeded up the obtaining of results. The results reached with the variant of more effectiveness are compared with those that are obtained when evaluating the entrance data using the formulations of the current codes: AISC and Eurocode-4.Promissory results are obtained, being demonstrated that the algorism k - NN is an effective technique that favours the creation of new data for the generation of a representative group of the possible design situations, from face to the improvement of the calculation methods, in a quick and simple way, supplementing, to those ends, to classic experimentation and the numeric simulation.								0	0	0	0	0	0718-915X		WOS:000273227800010

J	Wechsler, Harry								Linguistics and face recognition								JOURNAL OF VISUAL LANGUAGES AND COMPUTING			20	3			145	155		10.1016/j.jvlc.2009.01.001			JUN 2009	2009	We describe in this paper a novel biometric methodology for face recognition suitable to address pose, illumination, and expression (PIE) image variability, temporal change, flexible matching, and last but not least occlusion and disguise that are usually referred to as denial and deception. The adverse conditions listed above affect the scope and performance of biometric analysis vis-A-vis both training and testing. The conceptual framework proposed here draws support from discriminative methods using likelihood ratios. At the conceptual level it links forensics and biometrics, while at the implementation level it links the Bayesian framework and statistical learning theory. As many of the concerns listed usually affect only parts of the face, a non-parametric recognition-by-part approach is advanced here for the purpose of reliable face recognition. Recognition-by-parts facilitates authentication because it does not seek for explicit invariance. Instead, it handles variability using component-based configurations that are flexible enough to compensate among others for limited pose changes, if any, and limited occlusion and disguise. The recognition-by-parts approach proposed here supports incremental and progressive processing. It is similar in nature to modern linguistics and practical intelligence with the emphasis on semantics and pragmatics. Layered categorization starts with face detection using implicit rather than explicit segmentation. It proceeds with face authentication that involves feature selection of local patch instances including dimensionality reduction, exemplar-based clustering of patches into parts, and data fusion for matching using boosting driven by parts that play the role of weak learners. The implementation. driven by transcluction, employs proximity and typicality (ranking) realized using strangeness and random deficiency p-values, respectively. The feasibility and reliability of the proposed architecture has been validated using FERET and FRGC data. The paper concludes with suggestions for augmenting and enhancing the scope and utility of the recognition-by-parts architecture. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed classifier is based on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the instantaneous electrical power signal. With this in mind, it will be shown that the electrical power signal supports all necessary information to characterize both the working condition of the system and the nozzle type. Furthermore, the same signal can be analyzed with the aim of predicting the presence of an incoming faulty behavior. The presented technique is also used to build a second type of classifier. While the first one is of general application, the second one can be used when the properties of the orifice are known, and only the working conditions have to be classified. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which, due to its simplicity, can be embedded in a low-cost real-time diagnostic system. For the sake of clarity, a brief description of a water jet system is also presented.								0	0	0	0	0	0018-9456		WOS:000265373500033

MCSI is widely used in pattern recognition to select prototypes from a training set to be used in nearest neighbor classification. The RL agent solves the MCSI problem by deselecting a prototype one by one from the original data set to search for the best subset. Because the algorithm rarely descends to the smaller solution via its exploration strategy, a simple modification to the algorithm is proposed. The modification encourages the agent to try as many actions as possible at the current best solution to improve the results obtained. The paper concludes by comparing the performance of the proposed algorithm in handling the MCSI problem with the RL algorithm and the standard MCSI method.

This algorithm is designed to deal with problems where the use of continuous actions have clear advantages over the use of fine grained discrete actions. This new algorithm is derived from a baseline discrete actions algorithm implemented within a kind of k-nearest neighbors approach in order to produce a probabilistic representation of the input signal to construct robust state descriptions based on a collection (knn) of receptive field units and a probability distribution vector p(knn) over the knit collection. The baseline continuous-space-discreteactions kNN-TD(lambda) algorithm introduces probability traces as the natural adaptation of eligibility traces in the probabilistic context. Later the Ex < a >(lambda) algorithm is described as an extension of the baseline algorithms.

Allied Publishers PVT LTD					Signature Recognition using Fuzzy Min-Max Neural Network								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL, AUTOMATION, COMMUNICATION AND ENERGY CONSERVATION INCACEC 2009 VOL 1							242	248					2009	2009	The signature recognition system has been inspired from the human capability to recognize any pattern, which is a very difficult task for normal computer system having computing power of more then billions instructions per second. In this system the input is given in the form of a digital image by using writing pad, optical scanner, or Digital camera. This input image is processed to extract the information by using data acquisition and HU's seven moment invariant [21] to the order of three. Then the fuzzy min-max algorithm can applied to classify the signature pattern and this fuzzy min-max algorithm [1] is totally fit to the neural network framework. The neural network middle layer is work as fuzzified neuron and because of this the output can be correctly classified Use of fuzzy membership function is increase the accuracy of the classification of signature pattern because the decision boundaries are not crisp rather it is fuzzy. The neural network is designed for this work is for the category learning which can increase the speed of recognition because in this fuzzy min-max neural network [1] the supervised learning algorithm is used also it can learn nonlinear class boundaries in a single pass through the data and provides the ability to incorporate new and refute existing classes without retraining. The advantage of our system is its accuracy in recognizing signature is nearly 53% for single signature pattern per class and if the signature pattern per class are increased then the accuracy is increased up to 92% because patterns per class with slighter changes in it can increase the recognition efficiency naturally and there is no increase in training time because the neural network used is for category learning in which the dataset & index of the class is used for training.

B	Chua, TeckWee; Tan, WoeiWan			IEEE					A New Fuzzy Rule-Based Initialization Method for K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier								2009 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUZZY SYSTEMS, VOLS 1-3							415	420		10.1109/FUZZY.2009.5277215			2009	2009	The performances of conventional crisp and fuzzy K-Nearest neighbor (K-NN) algorithms trained using finite samples tends to be poor [1], [2]. With "holes" in the training data, it is unlikely that the decision area formed can actually represent the underlying data distribution. There is a need to capture more useful information from the limited training samples, therefore we propose a new fuzzy rule-based K-NN algorithm. A fuzzy rule-based initialization procedure differentiates our proposed algorithm from the conventional fuzzy K-NN algorithm. The new initialization procedure allows us to handle the imprecise inputs (neighborhood density and distance) through the natural framework of fuzzy logic system. Unlike conventional K-NN algorithms, the ability to fine tune the membership functions can lead to a highly versatile decision boundary. Thus, the new algorithm can be specifically tuned for different problems to achieve better results. The advantage is demonstrated on a synthetic data set in two-dimensional space. In addition, we also adopt weighted Euclidean distance measurement to overcome the curse of dimensionality [3]. The Euclidean distance weights and the parameters of the fuzzy rule-based system are then optimized with Genetic Algorithm (GA) simultaneously. The practical applicability of the proposed algorithm is verified on four UCI data sets (Bupa liver disorders, Glass, Pima Indians diabetes and Wisconsin breast cancer) and Ford automotive data set with an improvement of 3.42% in classification rate on average.				18th IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems	AUG 20-24, 2009	IEEE	Jeju Isl, SOUTH KOREA	0	0	0	0	0		978-1-4244-3596-8	WOS:000274242600072

Compared to the number of genes involved available training data sets generally have a fairly small sample size in cancer type classification. These training data limitations constitute a challenge to certain classification methodologies. The gene (feature) selection can extract genes which influence classification accuracy effectively, to eliminate the useless genes, and to improve the calculate performance and the classification accuracy. This paper presents hybrid feature selection method Taguchi-Genetic algorithm to rind optimal feature subset, to appraise feature set using K-nearest neighbor with leave-one-out cross-validation based on Euclidean distance calculation. Experimental results show that our method simplifies features effectively and obtains a higher classification accuracy compared to other classification methods from the literature.

A novel NN rule with an adaptive distance measure is proposed to classify input patterns. An iterative learning algorithm is employed to incorporate a local weight to the Euclidean distance measure that attempts to minimize the number of misclassified patterns in the training set. In case of data sets with highly overlapped classes, this may cause the classifier to increase its complexity and overfit. As a solution, LDA is considered as a popular feature extraction technique that aims at creating a feature space that best discriminates the data distributions and reduces overlaps between different classes of data. In this paper, an improved variation of LDA (im-LDA) is investigated which aims to moderate the effect of outlier classes. The proposed classifier design is evaluated by 6 standard data sets from UCI ML repository and eventually by TIMIT data set for framewise classification of speech data. The results show the effectiveness of the designed classifier using im-LDA with the proposed ad-NN method.				6th International Conference on Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotics	JUL 02-05, 2009	Inst Syst & Technologies Informat, Control & Commun; IFAC; Assoc Advancement Artificial Intelligence	Milan, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0		978-989-674-000-9	WOS:000282034200014

We have tried many ways to invent and improve algorithms to get better results from given data. However, few have been done on how to revise data to adapt machine learning. In this paper, the same classifiers are implemented on same object sets which are different in the granularity of classification to show different classification can make great difference in the quality of classification first. Then the development of knowledge-base is studied.

HDCC is a general approach to conceptual clustering that extends the traditional algorithm for hierarchical clustering by producing conceptual generalisations of the discovered clusters. This snakes it possible to combine the flexibility of changing distances for several clustering problems and the advantage of having concepts which are crucial l or tasks as summarisation and descriptive data mining in general. In this work we propose it set of generalisation operators and distances for the data types mentioned before and we analyse the properties by them satisfied on the basis of three different levels of agreement between the clustering hierarchy obtained from the linkage distance and the hierarchy obtained by using generalisation operators.				13th Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	APR 27-30, 2009	Sirindhorn Int Inst Technol; Thammasat Univ; Chulalongkorn Univ; Asian Inst Technol; Natl Elect & Comp Technol Ctr; Thailand Convent & Exhibit Bureau; AF Off Sci Res, Asian Off Aerosp Res & Dev	Bangkok, THAILAND	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-642-01306-5	WOS:000268632000060

Our objective is to allow a robot to remain continuously, moving above a terrain of interest using visual feedback to avoid leaving this region. As a particular application domain, we are interested in doing this in open water, but the approach makes few domain-specific assumptions. Specifically, our system employed an unsupervised learning technique to train a k-Nearest Neighbor classifier to distinguish between images of different terrain types through image segmentation. A simple random exploration strategy was used with this classifier to allow the robot to collect data while remaining confined above a coral reef without the need to maintain pose estimates. We tested the technique in simulation, and a live deployment was conducted in open water During the latter, the robot successfully navigated autonomously, above a coral reef during a 20 minutes period.				6th Canadian Conference on Computer and Robot Vision	MAY 25-27, 2009	Canadian Image Proc & Pattern Recognit Soc; Int Assoc Pattern Recognit	Kelowna, CANADA	0	0	0	0	0		978-1-4244-4211-9	WOS:000279806900037

The main slip sensor components consist of a silicone rubber surface which covers a PVDF sensor. After the amplification of the signal it is processed by a discrete short-time Fourier transform. The resulting spectrogram is processed by a principal component analysis to determine the main signal components. For a classification of three states ('slip', 'signal but no slip' and 'noise') a k-nearest neighbour classifier has been trained with the main signal components and serves for discrimination of slip states on the sensor's surface. The build-up of the sensor and the experimental setup will be briefly explained, the signal processing and the results will be discussed in detail.

In this paper, a text mining problem, i.e. text representation, is investigated from a multi-instance view. In detail, each text is regarded as a bag while each of its sentences is regarded as an instance. Bag can be labeled by its class label and its similarity is defined by sentence similarity The text classification problem is translated into multi-instance learning problem. In order to solve this problem, a Chinese text classifier focusing on bag has been built by KNN algorithm and good average precision 92.12% and recall 92.01% have been achieved in the experiments.				16th International Conference on Management Science and Engineering	SEP 14-16, 2009	Natl Nat Sci Fdn China; Harbin Inst Technol; State Univ Management; IEEE Technol Management Council	Moscow, RUSSIA	0	0	0	0	0	2155-1847	978-1-4244-3970-6	WOS:000273956800005

However, improving performance of the classifier is still attractive to cope with the high accuracy processing. A tolerant rough set is considered as a basis of the classification of data. The data classification is realized by applying the kNN with distance function. To improve the classification accuracy, a distance function with weights is considered. Then, weights of the function are optimized by the genetic algorithm. After the learning of training data, an unknown data is classified by the kNN with distance function. To improve further the performance of the kNN classifier, a relearning method is proposed. The proposed relearning method shows a higher generalization accuracy when compared to the basic kNN with distance function and other conventional learning algorithms. Experiments have been conducted on some benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.				10th International Conference on Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning (IDEAL 2009)	SEP 23-26, 2009	Junta Castilla Leon; Univ Burgos; Diputac Burgos; Ayuntamiento Burgos; GCI; CSA; FAE; FEC	Burgos, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-642-04393-2	WOS:000274188700006

For estimating the value of the correlation dimension in a particular case, a polynomial approximation of correlation integral is often used and then linear regression for logarithms of variables is applied. In this Chapter, we show that the correlation integral can be decomposed into functions each related to a particular point of data space. For these functions, one can use similar polynomial approximations such as the correlation integral. The essential difference is that the value of the exponent, which Would correspond to the correlation dimension, differs in accordance to the position of the point in question. Moreover, we show that the multiplicative constant represents the probability density estimation at that point. This finding is used to construct a classifier. Tests with some data sets from the Machine Learning Repository show that this classifier can be very effective.								0	0	0	0	0	1860-949X	978-3-642-01535-9	WOS:000268010900002

Because a single classifier has its very weak robustness to the entire text categorization, it is usually decomposed into binary classifications as many as categories. However, it requires to rearrange and relabel the given training examples with positive or negative labels for decomposing the text categorization. The task of this research is to apply the NTC to the text categorization without the decomposition and validate its feasibility. Therefore, we will compare the NTC with other approaches in the text categorization in the environment where the text categorization is not decomposed and validate that the NTC is practical tool for implement a light version of text categorization system.

Traditional approaches to text categorization require encoding documents into numerical vectors which leads to the two main problems: huge dimensionality and sparse distribution in each numerical vector. In this research, documents are encoded into string vectors instead of numerical vectors, and a new neural network called NTC which receive a string vector as its input vector is used for text categorization. The goal of this research is to avoid the two main problems by encoding documents into alternative structured data to numerical vectors. We will validate the performance of NTC by comparing it with other machine learning algorithms on the standard test bed, Reuter 21578.				1st International Conference on Networked Digital Technologies (NDT 2009)	JUL 28-31, 2009	IEEE Commun Soc	VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Ostrava, CZECH REPUBLIC	0	0	0	0	0		978-1-4244-4614-8	WOS:000279656200006

Even if the research on text categorization has been progressed very much, documents should be still encoded into numerical vectors.

Our approach is based on the idea that there are communities of users that find the same characteristics important to like or dislike a product.This model is an extension of the probabilistic latent semantic model for collaborative filtering with ideas based on clusterwise linear regression. On a movie data set, we show that the model, at the cost of a very small loss in overall performance, is able to recommend new items and give an explanation of its recommendations to its users.								0	0	0	0	0	0921-7126		WOS:000272958500004

Our method works by first converting the face image with all the corresponding face components such as eyes, now, and mouth to a grayscale images. The features are then extracted from the grayscale image, based on a descriptive statistics of the image and its corresponding face components. The edges of a face image and its corresponding face components are detected by using the canny algorithm. In the recognition step, different classifiers such as Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Pairwise Opposite Class-Nearest Neighbor (POC-NN) can be used for face recognition. We evaluated our method with more conventional Eigenface method bawd upon the AT&T and Yale face databases. The evaluation clearly confirm that for both databases our proposed method yields a higher recognition rate and requires less computational time than the Eigenface method.

Our aim is to achieve the classification performance of the nonlinear support vector machines (SVM) by using only the support vectors of the linear SVM. The proposed method does not require any type of kernels, and requires less computation time compared to the nonlinear SVM The SVSA algorithm has two steps. selection and adaptation. In the first step, some of the support vectors obtained from linear SVM are selected. Then the selected support vectors are adapted iteratively in the traning algorithm. The proposed method are compared against the linear and nonlinear SVM on sythetic and real remote sensing data. The results show that the proposed SVSA algorithm achieves very close performance to nonlinear SVM without any kernels in less computation time.

To address this issue, a hyperparameter evolutionary optimization (HPEO) framework was previously devised, initially using a genetic algorithm to tune external PRS parameters in a modular fashion, decoupled from its internal components. To further improve the effectiveness of HPEO and improve the diversity of the hyperparameter solutions found, this paper presents an extension that realizes cross-generation learning with an adaptive history network (AHN), which promotes exploring new regions in the search space while avoiding regions that have been searched extensively. The proposed approach, termed HPEO-AHN, is particularly suitable for tuning powerful but complex PRSs such as neuro-fuzzy systems (NFS). Preliminary experiments with two state-of-the-art NFSs optimized using the new approach have shown encouraging results.				18th IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems	AUG 20-24, 2009	IEEE	Jeju Isl, SOUTH KOREA	0	0	0	0	0		978-1-4244-3596-8	WOS:000274242600005

The users normally tend to express their preferences through comparisons. For example, Bob prefers Cornell to USC. Because the users only compare a small proportion of the products under difference contexts, "incomplete" preferences are a common occurrence. We propose a ranking approach which can contextually rank the query results when the users preferences are incomplete. We empirically evaluate the practical effectiveness of our method.

It has been widely used in many fields because of the implementation simplicity, the clarity of theory and the excellent classification performance. But KNN will increase classification error rate when training samples distribute unevenly or sample number of each class is very different. So, learning from the idea of clipping-KNN, this paper adopts an improved KNN classification algorithm and applies it to object-oriented classification of high resolution remote sensing image.Firstly, as sample points, image objects are obtained through image segmentation.

Also, a good distance measure among the data points is where the shoe pinches. In this paper, we use the cam weighted distance to find a more flexible neighborhood of a data point in a newly-created space of r-isomap algorithm. It is a major advantage of r-isomap to optimize the process of intrinsic structure of the local information in a data set. Short-circuit edges are reduced in a certain extent because of the relative transformation space which is constructed in r-isomap. Furthermore, we can get a well performance on both orientation and scale adaptive side, because we utilize the cam weighted distance to search the neighborhood of a data point. It has been proved that this distance measure is more efficient than the Euclidean distance. Experiments demonstrated that the proposed method can give better results on dimension reduction than r-isomap, Weighted Locally Linear Embedding (WLLE) and some other approaches on the data sets which have obvious classifications. Especially robust to data sets with noise.				2nd International Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Design	DEC 12-14, 2009	IEEE, Hong Kong Computat Intelligence Chapter; Bristol Univ; Zhejiang Univ; Tsinghua Univ	Changsha, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0		978-0-7695-3865-5	WOS:000276212800002

A k-nearest neighbor algorithm is used as a classifier and the Random Mutation Hill Climbing (RMHC) algorithm is used for case base reduction. The effects at various levels of positive class prevalence are tested in a binary classification problem. The results indicate that class imbalance is detrimental to both case base reduction and classifier performance. Selection with RMHC generally improves the classification performance regardless of the case base prevalence.

The architecture is composed of two steps: in the first one, a separating borderline between the two classes is piecewise constructed by a set of centroids calculated by a modified clustering algorithm, based on information theory; each of these centroids define a region where, in the second step of the proposed architecture, a hyperplane is constructed and adjusted by means of one-layer neural networks. This new method allows for binary classification while maintaining adequate use of computational resources, a common problem for machine learning methods. The proposed architecture is applied over classical benchmark classification problems and data sets, and its results are compared with those obtained by other well-known statistical and machine learning classifiers.

VanderSloten, J; Verdonck, P; Nyssen, M; Haueisen, J		An optimization framework for classifier learning from image data for computer-assisted diagnosis								4TH EUROPEAN CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING	IFMBE Proceedings		22	1-3			629	632					2009	2009	In computer-assisted medical diagnosis it is often hard or even impossible to obtain a valid set of rules for disease classification by classical knowledge engineering methods. Alternatively, machine learning methods are applied to obtain classifiers from sets of data pre-classified by medical experts. Typically in a medical context, available data sets are imbalanced with respect to the possible classifications. E.g., in dermatology, there are only few data representing cases of malign melanoma vs. many cases representing benign nevi. Furthermore, there are different missclassification costs assigned to different classes. E.g., it is much more critical (i.e. costly) to erroneously classify a malign melanoma as benign than the other way around. We propose a universally applicable optimization framework that successfully corrects the error-based inductive bias of classifier learning methods on image data. The framework integrates several techniques of common optimization techniques, such as modifying the optimization procedure for inducer-specific parameters, modifying input data by an arcing algorithm, combining classifiers of several classifier learning methods (kNN, SVM and C4.5) with different settings according to locally-adaptive, cost-sensitive voting schemes. The framework is designed to make the learning process cost-sensitive and enforcing more balanced missclassification costs between classes. The framework was evaluated on image data for Barrett's esophagus with promising results compared to the base learners.				4th European Conference of the International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering (ECIFMBE)	NOV 23-27, 2008		Antwerp, BELGIUM	0	0	0	0	0	1680-0737	978-3-540-89207-6	WOS:000299998500150

The representation extracted are often beneficial to mitigate the computational complexity and improve the accuracy of a particular classifier. In this paper we introduce a novel feature extraction algorithm called K nearest neighbor local margin maximization and apply it to measure the quality of the reduced features in the context of supervised classification problems. Using the concept of the hypothesis margin, we aim to find a discriminant subspace in which each projected point is well separated from the affine hull of its K local nearest neighbors. The experimental results on three high dimensional data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.

The robust neighbors are detected using a validation process. This method is more robust than traditional equivalent methods. This new classification method is called Modified K-Nearest Neighbor. Inspired the traditional KNN algorithm, the main idea is classifying the test samples according to their neighbor tags. This method is a kind of weighted KNN so that these weights are determined using a different procedure. The procedure computes the fraction of the same labeled neighbors to the total number of neighbors. The proposed method is evaluated on a variety of several standard UCI data sets. Experiments show the excellent improvement in accuracy in comparison with KNN method.

In this paper, we combine the effects of the radar's signal processing and tracking algorithms to assess the combined effect on covariance consistency of various algorithms. To do this, we first define the terms detection, detection primitive, and measurement. Next, we provide a detailed dataflow diagram for the processing chain of an electronically-scanned radar so that we can examine the propagation of truth data through various coordinate frames relative to radar signal processing. We examine issues related to expressing truth data in different frames and different relationships among targets. We describe in detail many of the algorithms in the signal-processing chain of typical monopulse radar and finally analyze and demonstrate the covariance consistency of various algorithms in the radar processing chain. When properly applied, covariance consistency analysis can be used to detect and correct inconsistent algorithms, invalid assumptions, and coding errors. The techniques described in this paper provide insight in determining system covariance requirements and may be used to ensure that both the design and implementation of radar processing algorithms provide good covariance consistency. The example simulations provide a baseline for algorithm covariance consistency, examine some common approximations used to simplify radar simulations, and demonstrate the effect of implementation errors that actually occurred during model development.(12)				2009 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 07-14, 2009		Big Sky, MT	0	0	0	0	0	1095-323X	978-1-4244-2621-8	WOS:000271964000169

A recently developed point symmetry based distance is utilized to determine the amount of point symmetry of a particular test pattern with respect to a class prototype. Kd-tree based nearest neighbor search is used for reducing the complexity of point symmetry distance computation. The proposed point symmetry based classifier is well-suited for classifying data sets having point symmetric classes, irrespective of any convexity, overlap or size. In order to classify data sets having line symmetry property, a line symmetry based classifier (LSC) along the lines of PSC is thereafter proposed in this paper. To measure the total amount of line symmetry of a particular point in a class, a new definition of line symmetry based distance is also provided. Proposed LSC preserves the advantages of PSC. The performance of PSC and LSC are demonstrated in classifying fourteen artificial and real-life data sets of varying complexities. For the purpose of comparison, k-NN classifier and the well-known support vector machine (SVM) based classifiers are executed on the data sets used here for the experiments. Statistical analysis, ANOVA, is also performed to compare the performance of these classification techniques.								0	0	0	0	0	0169-2968		WOS:000264096600009

For assessing the potential use of the proposed method in practice we compared the results obtained to the results that would be obtained by adopting a buy-and-hold strategy. The key performance measure in this comparison was profitability. The proposed method was shown to generate considerable higher profits than buy-and-hold for most of the companies, with few buy operations generated and, consequently, minimizing the risk of market exposure.

The authors had previously identified that the active site of this protein is in residues 1411-1429 (amino-acid sequence = KNSFMALYLSKGRLVFALG called A3G756) and that a three-amino-acid sequence KGR in A3G756 is crucial for exerting the activities. An experiment has shown that a cyclo-hEF3A peptide (a cyclic analog of A3G756) exhibits stronger activities than a linear-hEF3A peptide (a linearized peptide of the cyclo-hEF3A peptide). This experiment implies that adopting a loop conformation may be important for exerting the activities. In this study, the authors first computed the solution structures of the cyclo-hEF3A and linear-hEF3A peptides by molecular dynamics simulations. The obtained conformational ensembles consisted of a variety of conformations, which is a usual property of short peptides in solution. The ensembles involved a fraction where the peptide adopted beta-hairpins and KGR was located at the hairpin head. If there are protein segments that adopt beta-hairpins similar to those sampled from the simulation and have the KGR sequence at the hairpin head, these segments may have some activities. Then, the authors searched a database for segments satisfying these requirements and detected six functional segments. Three of them had laminin's activity, and the remaining three had activities similar to laminin's activities. Analyses on the conformational ensembles of cyclo- and linear-hEF3A peptides suggest that not only the KGR position in the hairpin but also the inter-strand packing is important for exerting laminin's activities.

Previous work has shown that it is advantageous to optimize general Euclidean distances (GED). In this paper, data transformations are optimized instead. This is equivalent to searching for GEDs, but can be applied to any learning algorithm, even if it does not use distances explicitly. Two optimization techniques have been used: a simple Local Search (LS) and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). CMA-ES is an advanced evolutionary method for optimization in difficult continuous domains. Both diagonal and complete matrices have been considered. Results show that in general, complete matrices found by CMA-ES either outperform or match both Local Search, and the classifier working on the original untransformed data.				10th International Conference on Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning (IDEAL 2009)	SEP 23-26, 2009	Junta Castilla Leon; Univ Burgos; Diputac Burgos; Ayuntamiento Burgos; GCI; CSA; FAE; FEC	Burgos, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-642-04393-2	WOS:000274188700022

In this paper, we optimize data transformations, which is equivalent to searching for GEDs, but can be applied to any learning algorithm, even if it does not use distances explicitly. Two optimization techniques have been used: a simple Local Search (LS) and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). CMA-ES is an advanced evolutionary method for optimization in difficult continuous domains. Both diagonal and complete matrices have been considered. The method has also been extended to a quadratic non-linear transformation. Results show that in general, the transformation methods described here either outperform or match the classifier working on the original data.				9th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications	NOV 30-DEC 02, 2009	Machine Intelligence Res Lab; IEEE Syst Man & Cybernetics Soc; Int Fuzzy Syst Assoc; European Neural Network Soc; European Soc Fuzzy Log & Technol; World Fed Soft Comp	Univ Pisa, Pisa, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0		978-1-4244-4735-0	WOS:000288405800175

IEEE					Case Based Reasoning Approach for Transaction Outcomes Prediction on Currency Markets								SOFA 2009: 3RD INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON SOFT COMPUTING APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS							91	96					2009	2009	This paper presents a case based reasoning approach for making profit in the foreign exchange (forex) market with controlled risk using k nearest neighbour (kNN) and improving on the results with neural networks (NNs) and a combination of both. Although many professionals have proven that exchange rates can be forecast using neural networks for example, poor trading strategies and unpredictable market fluctuation can inevitably still result in substantial loss. As a result, the method proposed in this paper will focus on predicting the outcome of potential trades with fixed stop loss (ST) and take profit (TP) positions, in terms of a win or loss. With the help of the Monte Carlo method, randomly generated trades together with different traditional technical indicators are fed into the models, resulting in a win or lose output. This is clearly a case based reasoning approach, in terms of searching similar past trade setups for selecting successful trades. There are several advantages over classical forecasting associated with such an approach, and the technique presented in this paper brings a novel perspective to problem of exchange trades predictability. The strategies implemented have not been empirically investigated with such wide a range of time granularities as is done in this paper, in any to the authors known academic literature. The profitability of this approach is back-tested at the end of this paper and highly encouraging results are reported.				3rd International Workshop on Soft Computing Applications	JUL 29-AUG 01, 2009	IEEE Computat Intelligence soc; IEEE Hungary Sect; EUROFUSE; Hungarian Fuzzy Assoc; BMT Resources; Grupul Scolar Transporturi Auto, Henri Coanda Arad	Szeged, HUNGARY	0	0	0	0	0		978-1-4244-5054-1	WOS:000275159600017

The inconvenience in determining the kernel and the parameters has motivated the use of local nearest neighbor (NN) classifiers in lieu of global classifiers. This substitution ignores the advantage of SV-M in global error minimization. On the other hand, the NN rule assumes that class conditional probabilities are locally constant. Such an assumption does not hold near class boundaries and in any high dimensional space due to the curse of dimensionality. We propose a hybrid classification method combining the global SVM and local NN classifiers. Local classifiers occur only when the global SVM is likely to fail. Furthermore, local NN classifiers adopt an adaptive metric driven by local SVM discriminative boundaries. Improved performance has been demonstrated compared to partially similar.				4th IEEE Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications	MAY 25-27, 2009	IEEE, Ind Elect Chapter Singapore; NW Polytechn Univ; IEEE Xian Sect; IEEE Control Syst Soc; IEEE Ind Elect Soc; Natl Nat Sci Fdn China; Inst Engn & Technol; Shaanxi Key Lab Informat Acquist & Proc	Xian, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0		978-1-4244-2799-4	WOS:000273183201320

The challenge of using evolutionary algorithms lies in solving the feature selection problem caused by the number of features. Classification data may contain useless, redundant or misleading features. To increase the classification accuracy, the primary objective is to remove irrelevant features in the feature space and identify the relevant features. Binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) has been applied successfully in solving feature selection problem. In this paper, two kinds of chaotic maps are embedded in binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO), a logistic map and a tent map, respectively. The purpose of the chaotic maps is to determine the inertia weight of the BPSO. In this study, we propose the chaotic binary particle swarm optimization (CBPSO) method to implement feature selection, and the K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) method with leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) serves as a classifier to evaluate the classification accuracies. The proposed method showed promising results for feature selection with respect to the number of feature subsets. The classification accuracy obtained by the proposed method is superior to ones obtained by the other methods from the literature.

IEEE					A MACHINE VISION BASED METHOD FOR ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION CLASSIFICATION								2009 16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOLS 1 AND 2							496	500					2009	2009	Weather maps refer to meteorological data that characterize the atmospheric circulation in a region. The classification of weather maps into categories becomes an important task for understanding regional climate. Towards this goal, manual and semiautomatic techniques have been used, requiring manpower and supervision. In this paper, we propose a machine vision based method for the classification of weather maps into distinct classes. The chain code descriptor is applied to extract the feature of isobaric lines and we introduce the Double-Side Chain Code (DSCC) histogram for feature representation. Handling DSCC histograms as multidimensional vectors, the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm classifies the objects to an appropriate number of classes, based on closest training set in the feature space. This method provides an automated and more 'objective' classification scheme, applying straightforward to the input weather map's image.				16th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing	JUL 05-07, 2009		Santorini, GREECE	0	0	0	0	0		978-1-4244-3297-4	WOS:000276494500084

It is a difficult work to extract implicit keywords in an article in the task of automatic keywords extraction. This work can also be called automatic keyword assignment. In this paper, an automatic keyword assignment method based on Citation-KNN (Citation-K Nearest Neighborhood) is proposed. Experimental results show that the proposed method can not only improve the precision and recall of keyword extraction, but also extract implicit keyword which does not appear in the articles efficiently.

First, an imbalanced factor is introduced and computed by Parzen-window estimation. The middle point of Tomek links is chosen as the initial point. Accordingly, this algorithm is iterated to find out the boundary points which have the equality of posterior probability. Through the project computation on the normal vectors of these points, the weight of each feature can be obtained, which actually indicates the importance degree of each feature. The experimental results on 3 real-word datasets demonstrate that this proposed algorithm can not only reduce the computational cost but also overcome the shortcoming that lite majority class may be defected well but the minority class may be ignored in the conventional feature selection algorithm.				3rd International Workshop on e-Activity (IWEA2009)/10th ACIS International Conference on Software Engineering Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing	MAY 27-29, 2009	IEEE Comp Soc; ACIS	Catholic Univ, Daegu, SOUTH KOREA	0	0	0	0	0		978-0-7695-3642-2	WOS:000275031800014

This fault location approach uses measurements of the fundamental components of voltage and current measured at the power substation. In addition, the approach is not constrained by the power system modeling and it is easily adaptable to the special characteristics of radial systems. The proposed fault locator is tested in a power distribution system and the obtained mean error is lower than 3%, by considering all fault types, several faulted nodes and fault resistances.								0	0	0	0	0	0120-6230		WOS:000257914500010

J	Chen Yunfang; Wang Ruchuan								A classification algorithm based on artificial immune								CHINESE JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS			17	3			432	436					JUL 2008	2008	Based on the natural characteristic of artificial immune system in the field of pattern recognition, the paper proposes a novel Classification algorithm (CAAI). According to the principle of gene revolution, negative selection and clonal selection, a classification algorithm which is based on AIS is designed and implemented. The algorithm consists of two phases. For each word, in the antibody libraries initialization phase, characteristic vectors of the training datasets are extracted and antibody libraries continually evolve using the negative selection. In the classification phase, a clonal selection is introduced to classify the test sample into different categories. Then, the proposed algorithm is validated using classical handwritten digit recognition problem, and the experimental results indicate the robustness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm. Additionally, the comparison with other classification algorithm showed the proposed algorithm has a great competitiveness on recognition rate and recognition performance.								0	1	0	0	1	1022-4653		WOS:000258684000008

However, a simple microarray experiment often leads to very high-dimensional data and a huge amount of information, the vast amount of data challenges researchers into extracting the important features and reducing the high dimensionality. In this paper, a nonlinear dimensionality reduction kernel method based locally linear embedding(LLE) is proposed, and fuzzy K-nearest neighbors algorithm which denoises datasets will be introduced as a replacement to the classical LLE's KNN algorithm. In addition, kernel method based support vector machine (SVM) will be used to classify genomic microarray data sets in this paper. We demonstrate the application of the techniques to two published DNA microarray data sets. The experimental results confirm the superiority and high success rates of the presented method.								0	0	0	0	0	1424-8220		WOS:000258180500010

These images can be acquired using different optical methods, such as structured lighting or interferometry. We propose a set of eight special features adapted to the problem of surface inspection using structured illumination. These characteristics are combined with six further features specially developed for the classification of faults using interferometric images. We apply two kinds of decision rules: the Bayesian and the nearest neighbor classifiers. The proposed features are evaluated using a noisy and a noise-free image data set. All patterns were obtained by means of structured lighting. Concerning the noisy data set, we obtain better classification rates when all the 14 features are used in combination with a one-nearest-neighbor classifier. In case of a noise-free data set, we show that similar classification rates are obtained when the 14 features or only the 8 specific features are involved. The methods described are designed to address a broad range of optical nondestructive applications involving the interpretation and classification of fringe patterns.

However, grades obtained in this methodology are hard to quantify objectively. Therefore, we carried out an empirical study to analyze the decisions underlying human summary-grading behavior. The task consisted of expert evaluation of summaries produced in critically relevant contexts of summarization development, and the resulting data were modeled by means of Bayesian networks using an application called Elvira, which allows for graphically observing the predictive power (if any) of the resultant variables. Thus, in this article, we analyzed summary-evaluation decision making in a computational framework.								0	0	0	0	0	1554-351X		WOS:000257227000028

As expected, experiments show that the suggested k is such that k/n -> 0 when both k and n tend to infinity, as required by the asymptotical consistency condition. Interestingly, it appears that the generalization error is robust w.r.t. to k when n becomes large (probably as a consequence of the k/n -> 0 relationship); the immediate consequence is that there is no need to provide an accurate estimate for the optimal k and an approximated coarser value, eg., provided with cross validation, 1-fold cross validation or leave one out is more than adequate.

In fact, the search for this best function is a hard nonlinear optimization problem.

This is an interesting problem because knowledge of protein-protein interactions may be applied to protein subunit aggregation, to computer-aided drug design, and to fundamental problems of cellular signalling and expression. With the explosion of newly-found protein sequences in the post-genomic era, its importance has become self-evident, and the challenge to address it even more urgent. Based on the pseudo amino acid composition (Chou, K.C.: PROTEINS: Structure, Function, and Genetics, 43: 246255, 2001) approach and nearest neighbor rule, a predictor called "NN-PseAA" classifier was developed to deal with this problem. As a showcase, prediction was performed on 8,797 fruitfly protein pairs. To avoid redundancy and homology bias, none of the protein pairs investigated has >= 25% sequence identity with any other. The overall success rate obtained by jackknife cross-validation for such a stringent dataset was 73.74%, indicating a quite promising sign of the new approach in stimulating the development of this important area and other related areas.				1st International Conference on Biomedical Engineering and Informatics	MAY 27-30, 2008	Tianjin Univ Technol; IEEE Comp Soc	Sanya, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0		978-0-7695-3118-2	WOS:000257096000031

Detection of hydrogeochemical seismic precursors by a statistical learning model								NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			8	6			1207	1216					2008	2008	The problem of detecting the occurrence of an earthquake precursor is faced in the general framework of the statistical learning theory. The aim of this work is both to build models able to detect seismic precursors from time series of different geochemical signals and to provide an estimate of number of false positives. The model we used is k-Nearest-Neighbor classifier for discriminating "no-disturbed signal", "seismic precursor" and "co-post seismic precursor" in time series relative to thirteen different hydrogeochemical parameters collected in water samples from a natural spring in Kamchachta (Russia) peninsula. The measurements collected are ion content (Na, Cl, Ca, HCO(3), H(3)BO(3)), parameters (pH, Q, T) and gases (N(2), CO(2), CH(4), O(2), Ag). The classification error is measured by Leave-K-Out-Cross-Validation procedure. Our study shows that the most discriminative ions for detecting seismic precursors are Cl and Na having an error rates of 15%. Moreover, the most discriminative parameters and gases are Q and CH(4) respectively, with error rate of 21%. The ions result the most informative hydrogeochemicals for detecting seismic precursors due to the peculiarities of the mechanisms involved in earthquake preparation. Finally we show that the information collected some month before the event under analysis are necessary to improve the classification accuracy.								0	0	0	0	0	1561-8633		WOS:000263381300001

In the basic variant of the k-NN algorithm the predicted class of q is estimated by taking the majority class of the q's k-nearest neighbors. Various similarity functions may be applied leading to different classification results. In this paper a heterogeneous similarity function is constructed out of different 1-component metrics by minimization of the number of classification errors the system makes on a training set. The HSFL-NN system, which has been introduced in this paper, on five tested datasets has given better results on unseen samples than the plain k-NN method with the optimally selected k parameter and the optimal homogeneous similarity function.				9th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing (ICAISC 2008)	JUN 22-26, 2008	Polish Neural Network Soc; Acad Humanities & Econ; Czestochowa Univ Technol, Dept Comp Engn; IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Polish Chapter	Zakopane, POLAND	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-540-69572-1	WOS:000257188100056

This includes issues like, e.g., the dimension and staffing of regional subdivisions, qualification balance of the workforce, and resource allocation strategies. While this multitude of possible adjustment parameters for optimization prevents from the analytical prediction. of organizational change efforts, simulation is a promising approach to analyze mobile environments and their change.In this work we present a formal model representing a generalization of mobile environments. This model can be utilized to examine the cost situation and performance of both real mobile enterprises and projected future development scenarios of such enterprises. The model is developed using colored petri nets (CPN) and the software suite CPN Tools. We show that our model is capable of predicting the outcomes of organizational change projects by the utilization of simulation and present a validation of our model based on real-world data of a German gas and power supply.				7th International Conference on Grid and Cooperative Computing	OCT 24-26, 2008	Chinese Acad Sci, Shenzhen Inst Adv Technol; Dawning Informat Ind Co Ltd; Chinese Natl Grid; European & Chinese Cooperat Grid; Chinese Acad Sci; Chinese Acad Engn	Shenzhen, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0		978-0-7695-3449-7	WOS:000262480400112

A conventional SOM is known to map original high dimensional data with similar features into points located close to each other in the low dimensional map in a so called competitive layer. In addition to this feature, the proposed SOM is also able to map high dimensional data belonging to a same class in each other's proximities. These characteristics retains the ability of. the map to be used as a visualization tool of high dimensional data while also support the execution of high quality pattern classifications in the low dimensional map. In the experiments the classification performance of the proposed SOM is compared to that of MLP with regards to wide varieties of problems.

The extended operation condition (EOC) and system cost are two key aspects in ATR performance evaluation. For the situation of air-to-ground (A-G) ATR using high range resolution (HRR) data, this paper analyzes the influence of target type number on ATR system performance. The system cost is also considered in evaluation process. An experiential performance model of typical ATR systems is given. The performance model and the corresponding conclusions have useful reference to ATR system performance prediction and assessment in the similar A-G applications.				2008 IEEE Radar Conference	MAY 26-30, 2008	IEEE; FINMECCANICA; SELEX; Agilent Technol; Dappolonia; Gedae; IDS; IET; MBDA; McGraw Hill; Natl Instruments; Off Naval Res, Sci & Technol; ROHDE & SCHWARZ; Tektronix; Thales Alenia; altran; ACCSCO; Raytheon	Rome, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	1097-5764	978-1-4244-1538-0	WOS:000264663001051

We experiment both with a memory-based learning approach and a maximum entropy modeling method.As an alternative to using external lexical resources, such as the low-coverage Dutch EuroWordNet, we evaluate the effect of automatically generated semantic clusters as information source. We compare these clusters, which group together semantically similar nouns, to two semantic features based on EuroWordNet encoding synonym and hypernym relations between nouns.The syntactic function of the anaphor and antecedent in the sentence can be an important clue for resolving coreferential relations. As baseline approach, we encode syntactic information as predicted by a memory-based shallow parser in a set of features. We contrast these shallow parse based features with features encoding richer syntactic information from a dependency parser. We show that using both the additional semantic information and syntactic information lead to small but significant performance improvement of our coreference resolution approach.				9th International Conference on Intelligent Text Processing and Computational Linguistics	FEB 17-23, 2008	Computat Linguist Grp; Univ Haifa, Caesarea Edmond Benjamin de Rothschild Fdn Inst Interdisciplinary Applicat Comp Sci	Univ Haifa, Haifa, ISRAEL	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-540-78134-9	WOS:000253658200030

Our main idea is to adjust confidence values so that their nominal values equal the information actually conveyed. In order to do so, we assume that information depends on the actual performance of each confidence value on an evaluation set. As information measure, we use Shannon's well-known logarithmic notion of information. With the confidence values matching their informational content, the classifier combination scheme reduces to the simple sum-rule, theoretically justifying this elementary combination scheme. In experimental evaluations for script identification, and both handwritten and printed character recognition, we achieve a consistent improvement on the best single recognition rate. We cherish the hope that our information-theoretical framework helps fill the theoretical gap we still experience in classifier combination, putting the excellent practical performance of multiple classifier systems on a more solid basis.								0	0	0	0	0	1860-949X	978-3-540-76279-9	WOS:000271816500007

The essential difference is that the value of the exponent, which would Correspond to the correlation dimension, differs in accordance to the position of the point in question. Moreover, we show that the multiplicative constant represents the probability density estimation at that point. This finding is used for the construction of a classifier.

Unfortunately, the best-known feature weighting algorithm, ReliefF, is biased. It decreases the relevance of some features and increases the relevance of others when irrelevant attributes are added to the data set. This paper presents an improved version of the algorithm, Stable Relief, for classification tasks by extracting relevant information. This method, using Stable Relief, is applied to feature weighting for the nearest neighbor classifier and is tested on real-world classification tasks. The results show that it can improve the nearest neighbor classifier on the tested tasks, and also outperforms the Relief. This paper shows that Stable Relief outperforms ReliefF on the task of cat and dog discrimination, using real images.				7th WSEAS International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Engineering and Data Bases	FEB 20-22, 2008	WSEAS	Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, ENGLAND	0	0	0	0	0		978-960-6766-41-1	WOS:000257462700027

Once we have a subadditive distance measure for time series, the measure will have at least one significant advantage over DTW; one can directly plug such distance measure into systems which exploit the subadditivity to perform faster similarity search techniques. We propose two frameworks for designing subadditive distance measures and a few examples of distance measures resulting from the frameworks. One framework is more general than the other and can be used to tailor distances from the other framework to gain better classification performance. Experimental results of nearest neighbor classification showed that the designed distance measures am practical for time series classification.

This subset can be used as a prototype which correctly recognizes the entire original prototype set. This proposed genetic algorithm tries to find the minimal consistent subset to reduce recognition time in nearest neighbor [2] classification. The main difference from other genetic algorithm (GA) approaches is the hybrid of minimal consistent set identification (MCSI) method [3] and genetic algorithm. The MCSI method provides the local optimal number of prototype while the Genetic performs the global search. The proposed hybrid algorithm has been tested on several problems and compared with the results of MCSI and other GA approach [4].

IEEE					ANODR Based Anomaly Detection for Black Hole and Route Disrupt Attacks								ICCN: 2008 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING, COMMUNICATION AND NETWORKING							199	203					2008	2008	An Anonymous on Demand Routing Protocol (ANODR) was designed based on the previous studies as the countermeasure for preventing passive attacks. ANODR is a purely on demand routing and identity free routing scheme that sets up an anonymous route as needed in real time. The proposed protocol ensures node privacy, route anonymity and location privacy and is robust against several known attacks. This limits the chances of eavesdropping and traffic analyzing to a time-critical on-demand window.Anonymity is one of the important characteristics in securing a wireless adhoc network routing. In this paper we study the unique anonymity threats in wireless adhoc environments. Two design principles of anonymous routing - Anonymous route discovery and Anonymous data forwarding are presented here. In the Anonymous route discovery design, a random route pseudonym for an on demand route is established. In the Anonymous data forwarding design, the source wraps its data packets for each end to end connection. This was implemented and tested using NS-2.0 simulator. The behavior of the proposed system has been studied for analysis like Packet delivery ratio, Packet delay and Overhead along with the existing system.

The challenge met in this paper is to expand the scope and utility of biometrics by discarding unwarranted assumptions regarding the completeness and quality of the data captured. Towards that end we propose a model-free and non-parametric component-based face recognition strategy with robust decisions for data fusion that are driven by transduction and boosting. The conceptual framework draws support throughout from discriminative methods using likelihood ratios. It links at the conceptual level forensics and biometrics, while at the implementation level it links the Bayesian framework and statistical learning theory (SLT). Feature selection of local patch instances and their corresponding high-order combinations, exemplar-based clustering (of patches) as components including the sharing (of exemplars) among components, and finally decision-making regarding authentication using boosting driven by components that play the role of weak-learners, are implemented in a similar fashion using transduction driven by a strangeness measure akin to typicality. The feasibility, reliability, and utility of the proposed open set face recognition architecture vis-a-vis adverse image capture conditions are illustrated using FRGC data. The potential for future developments concludes the paper.				10th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision	DEC 17-20, 2008	IEEE	Hanoi, VIETNAM	0	0	0	0	0		978-1-4244-2286-9	WOS:000266716600077

Such systems, referred to as multi-criteria recommenders, early demonstrated the potential of applying Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods to facilitate recommendation in numerous application domains. On the other hand, systematic implementation and testing of multi-criteria recommender systems in the context of real-life applications still remains rather limited. Previous studies dealing with the evaluation of recommender systems have outlined the importance of carrying out careful testing and parameterization of a recommender system, before it is actually deployed in a real setting. In this paper, the experimental analysis of several design options for three proposed multi-attribute utility collaborative filtering algorithms is presented. The data set used is synthetic, with multi-criteria evaluations that have been created using an appropriate simulation environment. This synthetic data set tries to mimic the evaluations that are expected to be collected from users in a particular application setting. The aim of the experiment is to demonstrate how a synthetic data set may be created and used to facilitate the study and selection of an appropriate recommendation algorithm, in the case that multi-criteria evaluations from real users are not available.

In addition, if some physical and signal criteria of this selection are taken into account, the obtained results grouping consecutive bands would be useful to design new filters for hyperspectral cameras in order to improve the efficiency of these devices. Starting from certain number of pre-selected bands, intervals of spectrally adjacent instances to these initial bands are considered for calculating new broader bands. Results will show how a weighted average on these intervals can keep, or even improve, the performance respecting to a narrower selection, avoiding, at the same time, common drawbacks from the narrow-band acquisition devices.				5th International Conference on Image Analysis and Recognition	JUN 25-27, 2008		Povoa de Varzim, PORTUGAL	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-540-69811-1	WOS:000257302500109

Workload characteristics can be different depending on database application. In particular, identifying workloads in mixed database applications might be quite difficult. Therefore, a method is necessary for identifying workloads in the mixed database application. This paper aims to identify workloads in the mixed database application using data mining technologies. To construct the mixed database application, we use the TPC-C and TPC-W benchmark. We discriminate between train workloads (workloads using the TPC-C or TPC-W benchmarks) and test workloads (mixed workloads of both benchmarks), and modify the algorithm of k-NN (Nearest Neighbor) classifier in order to satisfy our objectives. The modified k-NN algorithm measures how close the test workloads are to the train workloads. The modified k-NN algorithm is better than others for identifying workloads because its results are lower than others in the oscillation depending on the k parameter and the error rate. This research contributes towards considering flexible tuning methods using workload identification information.				12th World Multi-Conference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics/14th International Conference on Information Systems Analysis and Synthesis	JUN 29-JUL 02, 2008	Int Inst Informat & System; Int Federat Syst Res	Orlando, FL	0	0	0	0	0		978-1-934272-36-7	WOS:000263875200038

However, as a database system can be performed a lot of database applications, detecting workload characteristics might be more difficult. This paper proposes the method of finding near workload characteristics by mixed workloads. The workload find method is evaluated by the modified k-NN algorithm that is an extension of the existing the fuzzy k-NN algorithm. The modified k-NN algorithm measures how close workloads in TPC-C or TPC-W are to the mixed workloads between TPC-C and TPC-W. Furthermore, the result of our method is better than others for finding near workloads because its results are lower than others in the oscillation depending on the k parameter and the error rate. This study is able to contribute to finding similar information for providing autonomic database analysis and intelligent service in ubiquitous environments.

However, as existing imitation approaches usually require repetitive demonstrations of the skill to learn in order to be useful, those are typically not applicable in groups of robots. In these settings usually each robot has its own task to accomplish and should not be disturbed by teaching others. As a result an imitating robot most of the time has only one observation of a specific skill from which it can learn.We present an approach that allows an individually learning robot to make use of such cases of sporadic imitation which is the normal case in groups of robots. Thereby, a robot can use imitation in order to guide its exploration efforts towards more rewarding areas in the exploration space. This is inspired by imitation often found in nature where animals or humans try to map observations into their own capability space.

However, as existing imitation approaches usually require repetitive demonstrations of the skill to learn in order to be useful, those are typically not applicable in groups of robots. In these scenarios usually each robot has its own task to accomplish and should not he disturbed by teaching others.

We present an approach that allows an individually learning robot to make use of such cases of sporadic imitation which is often the only possibility to learn from other robots in a group. The power of the algorithm comes from the fact that it uses the robots already known skills and strategies to understand the observed behavior.

However, text preprocessing is still the bottleneck of text categorization based on Vector Space Model (VSM). The result of text preprocessing directly affects the performance and precision of categorization. Moreover, feature selection and feature weight become the major obstacles of text preprocessing. In this paper, we mainly focus on feature weight. We present a novel feature weight algorithm-TF-Gini that can improve the categorization peformance significantly.

Traditional methods either rely on linear searching or depend on a tree structure. These methods search information in the entire database and compare a query with the records in the database during the searching process, which lead to inefficiency. This paper presents a locality sensitive hashing based searching scheme (LSS) to achieve highly efficient information searching in a massive database. LSS classifies information based on their similarities to facilitate fast information location. Based on the study and analysis of LSS, an improved scheme is further proposed to enhance the searching efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the LSS schemes in searching information. They yield significant improvements over the efficiency of traditional methods. In addition, they guarantee successful location of the queried records.				IEEE SoutheastCon 2008	APR 03-06, 2008	IEEE	Huntsville, AL	0	0	0	0	0		978-1-4244-1883-1	WOS:000257094700028

A vital consideration in obtaining good results with this technique is the choice of distance function, and correspondingly which features to consider when computing distances between samples. In this chapter, a new ensemble technique is proposed to improve the performance of NN classifiers. The proposed approach combines multiple NN classifiers, where each classifier uses a different distance function and potentially a different set of features (feature vector). These feature vectors are determined for each distance metric using a Simple Voting Scheme incorporated in Tabu Search (TS). The proposed ensemble classifier with different distance metrics and different feature vectors (TS-DF/NN) is evaluated using various benchmark data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Results have indicated a significant increase in the performance when compared with various well-known classifiers. The proposed ensemble method is also compared with an ensemble classifier using different distance metrics but with the same feature vector (with or without Feature Selection (FS)).								0	0	0	0	0	1619-7127	978-3-540-72959-4	WOS:000267892800004

IEEE					Feature Selection Focused within Error Clusters								19TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION, VOLS 1-6	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION						2585	2588					2008	2008	We propose a feature selection method that constructs each new feature by analysis of tight error clusters. This is a greedy, time efficient forward selection algorithm that iteratively constructs one feature at a time, until a desired error rate is reached. The algorithm finds error clusters in the current feature space, then projects one tight cluster into the null space of the feature mapping, where a new feature that helps to classify these errors can be discovered. Tight error clusters indicate that the current features are unable to discriminate these samples. The approach is strongly data driven and restricted to linear features, but other wise general. Large scale experiments show that it can achieve a monotonically decreasing error rate within the feature discovery set, and a generally decreasing error rate on a distinct test set.				19th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2008)	DEC 08-11, 2008	IEEE	Tampa, FL	0	0	0	0	0	1051-4651	978-1-4244-2174-9	WOS:000264729001151

A crucial step is to identify transcription factor binding sites(TFBSs). However, the number of the known TFBSs is limited, and the accuracy of the state-of-the-art identification methods is still far from satisfactory. In this paper a novel integrated method for mining transcription factor binding sites is presented, which combines the sequence data mining method with the text mining method. Therefore, the method can not only obtain the putative TFBSs from the sequence data sets, but also acquire the experimentally verified TFBSs from the literatures. To evaluate the performance of our method, several experiments have been tested on real data sets. The results show that our integrated method outperforms each of the algorithms alone, furthermore, exhibits superior accuracy than existing algorithms.

In order to correctly analyze microarray data, the goal of feature (gene) selection is to select those subsets of differentially expressed genes that are potentially relevant for distinguishing the sample classes. In this paper, information gain and chaotic genetic algorithm are proposed to select the relevant genes, and a K-nearest neighbor with the leave-one-out cross-validation method serves as a classifier. Chaotic genetic algorithm is modified by using the chaotic mutation operator to increase the population diversity. The experimental results show that the proposed method not only effectively reduced the number of gene expression levels, but also achieved lower classification error rates.

Not only the information of the local mean of the k nearest neighbors of the unlabeled pattern in each individual class but also the knowledge of the ensemble mean of each individual class are taken into account in this new classification method.

It shows many advantages in solving nonlinearly small sample and high dimensional problems of pattern recognition. Only a part of samples or support vectors (SVs) plays an important role in the final decision function. But SVs could not be obtained in advance until a quadratic programming is performed. In this paper, we use K-nearest neighbour method to extract a boundary vector set which may contain SVs. The number of the boundary set is smaller than the whole training set. Consequently it reduces the training samples, speeds up the training of support vector machine.

We Propose a new methodology for addressing the classification task that relies on the main idea of the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, which is the most important representative of this field. In the proposed approach, given an unclassified pattern, a set of neighboring patterns is found, not necessarily using all input feature dimensions. Also, following the concept of the naive Bayesian classifier, we adopt the assumption of independence of input features in the outcome of the classification task. The two concepts are merged in an attempt to take advantage of their good performance features. In order to further improve the performance of our approach, we propose a novel weighting scheme of the memory-base. Using the self-organizing maps model during the execution of the algorithm, dynamic weights of the memory-base patterns are produced.

Experimental evidence suggests that the algorithm has a timing of O(n) for most practical values of k under the condition: k < 0.05n, where n is the number of three-dimensional points in the cloud. Case studies are presented to illustrate the robustness and efficiency of the method and a comparison is made to an existing exact method.								0	0	0	0	0	0954-4054		WOS:000249877300009	
J	Abbas, Syed Rahat; Arif, Muhammad								Modified nearest neighbor method for multistep ahead time series forecasting								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			21	3			463	481		10.1142/S0218001407005545			MAY 2007	2007	Multistep ahead time series forecasting has become an important activity in various fields of science and technology due to its usefulness in future events management. Nearest neighbor search is a pattern matching algorithm for forecasting, and the accuracy of the method considerably depends on the similarity of the pattern found in the database with the reference pattern. Original time series is embedded into optimal dimension. The optimal dimension is determined by using autocorrelation function plot. The last vector in the embedded matrix is taken as the reference vector and all the previous vectors as candidate vectors. In nearest neighbor algorithm, the reference vector is matched with all the candidate vectors in terms of Euclidean distance and the best matched pattern is used for forecasting. In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid distance measure to improve the search of the nearest neighbor. The proposed method is based on cross-correlation and Euclidean distance. The candidate patterns are shortlisted by using cross-correlation and then Euclidean distance is used to select the best matched pattern. Moreover, in multistep ahead forecasting, standard nearest neighbor method introduces a bias in the search which results in higher forecasting errors. We have modified the search methodology to remove the bias by ignoring the latest forecasted value during the search of the nearest neighbor in the subsequent iteration. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on two benchmark time series as well as two real life time series.								0	0	0	0	0	0218-0014		WOS:000251175500002	
J	Bai, Mingsain R.; Chen, Meng-Chun								Intelligent preprocessing and classification of audio signals								JOURNAL OF THE AUDIO ENGINEERING SOCIETY			55	5			372	384					MAY 2007	2007	An audio processor that integrates intelligent classification and preprocessing algorithms is presented. Audio features in the time and frequency domains are extracted and processed prior to classification. Classification algorithms, including the nearest neighbor rule (NNR), artificial neural networks (ANN), fuzzy neural networks (FNN), and hidden Markov models (HMM), are used to classify and identify singers and musical instruments. A training phase is required to establish a feature space template, followed by a test phase in which the audio features of the test data are calculated and matched to the feature space template. In addition to audio classification, the proposed system provides several independent component analysis (ICA)-based preprocessing functions for blind source separation, voice removal, and noise reduction. The proposed techniques were applied to process various kinds of audio program materials. The test results reveal that the performance of the methods is satisfactory, but varies slightly with the algorithm and program materials used in the tests.								0	0	0	0	0	1549-4950		WOS:000246989800003

In this paper we provide a design solution for adaptive classifiers operating in stationary environments; information provided (whenever available by a supervisor over time) is used to improve the performance of the classification system hence mimicking the asymptotical behavior suggested by the theory. The adaptive classifier relies on k -NNs, here chosen for their learning-free modality (hence easily supporting a real time adaptation mechanism); a novel method is proposed for matching the optimal k (measuring the complexity of the classifier) with the incremental knowledge acquired over time. A large experimental campaign shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Adaptive classifiers, which provide adaptive mechanisms to update their knowledge base over time, are able to exploit fresh information to improve accuracy but, traditionally, do not consider complexity issues. In this paper we propose a design solution for adaptive classifiers able to reduce the computational complexity and the memory requirements of k-NN classifiers by including condensing editing techniques. Moreover, we propose a novel approach for estimating the incoming innovation content which allows us for not including redundant or superfluous information (thus minimizing the knowledge base size).

Each rep-ion formed by the pairwise decision boundaries is assigned to the class with the highest frequency of training samples in that region. With more samples and classifiers, the frequencies converge to increasingly accurate non-parametric estimates of the posterior class probabilities in the vicinity of the decision boundaries. The method is applicable to non-parametric discrete or continuous class distributions dichotomized by either linear or non-linear classifiers (like support vector machines). We present a formal description of the method and place it in context with related methods. We present experimental results on machine-printed and handwritten digits that demonstrate the viability of frequency coding in a classification task.

The number and the arrangement of subunits forming a protein are referred to as quaternary structure. The quaternary structure of a protein is important, since it characterizes the biological function of the protein when it is involved in specific biological processes. Unfortunately, quaternary structures are not trivially deducible from protein amino acid sequences. In this work, we propose a protein quaternary structure classification method exploiting the functional domain composition of proteins. It is based on a nearest neighbor condensation technique in order to reduce both the portion of dataset to be stored and the number of comparisons to carry out. Our approach seems to be promising, in that it guarantees an high classification accuracy, even though it does not require the entire dataset to be analyzed. Indeed, experimental evaluations show that the method here proposed selects a small dataset portion for the classification (of the order of the 6.43%) and that it is very accurate (97.74%).				8th International Conference on Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning	DEC 16-19, 2007		Birmingham, ENGLAND	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-540-77225-5	WOS:000252394900081

The two-level orthogonal array is employed in the proposed method to provide a well-organized and balanced comparison of two levels of each feature (i.e., the feature is selected for pattern classification or not) and interactions among all features in a specific classification problem. That is, this two-dimensional matrix is mainly used to reduce the feature subset evaluation efforts prior to the classification procedure. Accordingly, the grey-based nearest neighbor rule and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are used to evaluate and optimize the features of the specific classification problem. In this manner, important and relevant features can be identified for pattern classification. Experiments performed on different application domains are reported to demonstrate the performance of the proposed hybrid Taguchi-Grey-based method. It can be easily seen that the proposed method yields superior performance and is helpful for improving the classification accuracy in pattern classification.				12th Iberoamerican Congress on Pattern Recognition	NOV 13-16, 2007	Univ Santiago Chile, Dept Indormat Ingn; Tech Univ Feder Santa Maria, Dept Informat Tech	Valparaiso, CHILE	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-540-76724-4	WOS:000252725900048	
B	Chen, Tung-Shou; Chiu, Yung-Hsing; Lin, Chih-Chiang								Fast Nearest Neighbor classification using class-based clustering								PROCEEDINGS OF 2007 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS, VOLS 1-7							1894	1898					2007	2007	Nearest Neighbor Rule (NNR) is a parameter-free classifier which is easy to implement, simple to operate and with high accuracy. However, it is time and memory consuming for large datasets. This study proposed a parameter-free method to accelerate NNR. This method employs a class-based clustering algorithm to divide the training data to several clusters with respective members belonging to the same class. Cluster representations are extracted clustering border data based on the nearest neighbors between the different class clusters. Since the cluster representations are the clustering border data rather than the clustering centers, the predicting accuracy will not be affected by removing a cluster's internal data. In the predicting phase, the nearest neighbor search area is narrowed down by referring to a distance between a testing data and its nearest cluster. Thus the predicting process Is speeded up. In this paper, the performance of the proposed method was evaluated and compared with NNR, K-NNR, and LIBSVM by using 5 benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed parameter-free classification algorithm is very easy to operate and gives consideration to speed and accuracy.				6th International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics	AUG 19-22, 2007	Machine Learning & Cybernet Res Inst; Hebei Univ; IEEE Syst Man & Cybernet Soc; Harbin Inst Technol Shenzhen Grad Sch; Chinese Univ Hong Kong; City Univ Hong Kong; Hong Kong Baptist Univ; Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol; Int Fuzzy Syst Assoc; Hebei Univ Sci & Technol	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0		978-1-4244-0972-3	WOS:000251433403014

Several studies have shown that irrelevant, interacting, or noisy features have as much effect on distance computation as other features. Various global and local feature-weighting algorithms have been proposed to deal with this problem. In this paper, we use a local weighting scheme that allows feature weights to vary for each training instance. We propose a novel learning algorithm to learn the weight of each feature for every training instance. By associating a cost to each training instance, the proposed learning algorithm attempts to minimize the sum of costs for misclassified training instances. Using a number of data sets from the UCI-ML repository, we show that the proposed feature-weighting scheme is quite effective in improving the generalization ability of the NN classifier.				11th IASTED International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing	AUG 29-31, 2007	Int Assoc Sci & Technol Dev; IASTED, TC Artificial Intelligence & Expert Syst; IASTED, TC Comm Soft Comp; Catalan Assoc Artificial Intelligence; Spanish Assoc Artificial Intelligence	Palma de Mallorca, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0		978-0-88986-693-5	WOS:000250957100029

In this way, classification of mental tasks is under investigation in the BCI society as a basic research. In this paper, a Weighted Distance Nearest Neighbor (WDNN) classifier is presented to improve the classification rate between the left and right imagery tasks in which a weight is assigned to each stored instance. The specified weight of each instance is then used for calculating the distance of a test pattern to that instance. We propose an iterative learning algorithm to specify the weights of training instances such that the error rate of the classifier on training data is minimized. ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG) signals are caught from four familiar subjects with the cue-based BCI. The proposed WDNN classifier is applied to the band power and fractal dimension features, which are extracted from EEG signals to classify mental tasks. Results show that our proposed method performs better in some subjects in comparison with the LDA and SVM, as well-known classifiers in the BCI field.				2nd International Workshop on Pattern Recognition in Bioinformatics	OCT 01-02, 2007	IAPR	Singapore, SINGAPORE	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-540-75285-1	WOS:000251314800036

Our approach has three main steps. First, a relational matrix that represents the pair-wise dissimilarities between all objects is constructed. Second, a fuzzy relational clustering algorithm is used to partition the data into groups of similar objects. Third, the relational data features are mapped to a unit hyper-cube space where each object is represented by its membership vectors in all clusters. The proposed method is validated by comparing the performance of several classifiers with different feature sets on the original and the transformed spaces. We show that the transformed space conserves the discriminative information of the original features. We also show that, using the transformed space, a richer set of standard classifiers could be used.

In the present work, using Hydrophobicity measure, we make use of Fast Fourier Transform to better analyze the sequence information. In our experiments, we have observed that sequence pattern based information could easily be exploited in the frequency domain using proximity rather than increasing margin of separation between the classes. Based on this information, a simple Nearest Neighbor (NN) method is then used to classify the 17 subfamilies. The proposed proximity based approach has outperformed the one against all implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) [Y. Z. Guo, et al, Acta Biochimica et Biophysica Sinica, 37(2005) 759]. Our simple proximity based approach has superior performance in terms of all three measures on both Jackknife and independent data set. For B, C, D and F subfamilies, the Mathew's correlation coefficient and overall accuracy using jackknife test are 0.96 and 96.03 %, while, using independent data set are 0.91 and 91.6 % respectively. The results validate the idea of exploiting sequence pattern based information in the frequency domain using proximity in terms of Euclidian distance. Another side advantage is that instead of training and saving 17 SVM models, we need a single NN classifier.				7th IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering	OCT 14-17, 2007	IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; IEEE Engn Med Biol; NSF; Int Soc Intelligent Biol Med; Syst, Man, Cybermet Soc	Boston, MA	0	0	0	0	0		978-1-4244-1509-0	WOS:000252958200217

However, in classification problems, in addition to depending on the training sample, a good choice of k depends on the specific observation to be classified. In this article we propose an adaptive nearest neighbor classification technique, where the value of k is selected depending on the distribution of competing classes in the vicinity of the observation to be classified.

Condition number of a matrix is an important measure in numerical analysis and linear algebra. However the direct computation of the condition number of a matrix is very expensive in terms of CPU and memory cost, and becomes prohibitive for large size matrices. We use data mining techniques to estimate the condition number of a given sparse matrix. In our previous work, we used Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict the condition numbers. While SVM is considered a state-of-the-art classification/regression algorithm, kNN is usually used for collaborative filtering tasks. Since prediction can also be interpreted as a classsfication/regression task, virtually any supervised learning algorithm (such as kNN) can also be applied. Experiments are performed on a publicly available dataset. We conclude that Modified kNN (MkNN) performs much better than SVM on this particular dataset.				6th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications	DEC 13-15, 2007	Assoc Machine Learning & Applicat; IEEE	Cincinnati, OH	0	0	0	0	0		978-0-7695-3069-7	WOS:000252793400037

Estimation of Distribution Algorithms(EDAs) focus on where the promising region is, however have less consideration about behavior of each individual in solution search algorithms. Since the basic ideas of EP and EDAs are quite different, it is possible to make them reinforce each other. In this paper, we present a hybrid evolutionary framework to make use of both the ideas of EP and EDAs through introducing a mini estimation operator into EP's search cycle. Unlike previous EDAs that use probability density function(PDF), the estimation mechanism used in the proposed framework is the k-nearest neighbor estimation which can perform better with relative small amount of training samples. Our experimental results have shown that the incorporation of machine learning techniques, such as k-nearest neighbor estimation, can improve the performance of evolutionary optimisation algorithms for a large number of benchmark functions.

The LDI algorithm offers a manifold way of discriminant analysis. Based on the hypothesis that samples from different classes reside in class-specific manifold structures, the algorithm depicts the manifold structures by a nearest-native graph and a invader graphs. And a new locality discriminant criterion is proposed, which best preserves the within-class local structures while suppresses the between-class overlap. Using the notion of the Laplacian of the graphs, the LDI algorithm finds the optimal linear transformation by solving the generalized eigenvalue problem. The feasibility of the LDI algorithm has been successfully tested in text categorization using 20NG and Reuters-21578 databases. Experiment results show LDI is an effective technique for document modeling and representations for classification.				4th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery	AUG 24-27, 2007	Hainan Univ; IEEE Reliabil Soc; Asia Pacific Neural Network Assembly	Haikou, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0		*****************	WOS:000252460600047

This procedure can be implemented in a SGNT with specific architecture consisting of one root and the initial class number of reference patterns. The leaf in SGNT is defined with prototype vector, learning vector, center property vector and distant property vector. After training, prototype set are outputted. The main advantage of this method is that both the number of prototypes and their locations are learned from the training set without much human intervention. Experiments with synthesis and real color image the excellent performance of this classification scheme as compared to existing K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) and Learning vector quantization (LVQ) algorithm.				5th International Symposium on Multispectral Image Processing and Pattern Recognition	NOV 15-17, 2007	SPIE; State Key Lab Multi Spectral Informat Proc Technol; Chinese Educ Minist Key Lab Image Proc & Intelligence Control; Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol	Wuhan Univ, Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0277-786X	978-0-8194-6950-2	WOS:000253700100153

The proposed framework is currently implemented to control the parameters of neuro-fuzzy system, a subclass of pattern recognition system, by employing a genetic algorithm (GA) as the core optimization technique. Two neuro-fuzzy systems i.e., Generic Self-Organizing Fuzzy Neural Network realizing Yager inference (GenSoFNN-Yager) and Reduced Fuzzy Cerebellar Model Articulation Computer realizing the Yager inference (RFCMAC-Yager), are employed as the test prototypes to evaluate the proposed framework. Experimental results on several classification and regression problems have shown the efficacy and robustness of the proposed approach.

When transmitted to an RF device, the two-tone signal is affected by nonlinear circuit components such as amplifiers or diodes. The nonlinear components cause intermodulation distortion to the input signal, which is reradiated by the device. Features of the intermodulation distortion products are used to construct a device fingerprint. The fingerprint is then used to characterize the device so that it can be identified from other RF devices.				14th IEEE/SP Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing	AUG 26-29, 2007	IEEE; SP	Madison, WI	0	0	0	0	0		978-1-4244-1197-9	WOS:000253416000034

Knowledge discovery offers the capacity to automate complex search and data analysis tasks.Data mining is the main phase in the knowledge discovery process. It consists in extracting nuggets of knowledge, i.e., pertinent patterns, pattern correlations, estimation or rules, hidden in bodies of data. The extracted nuggets of knowledge will be used in the verification of hypothesis or the prediction and explanation of knowledge.In this paper, we present a new survey on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD).				2nd International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science	JUN 03-06, 2008		Marrakech, MOROCCO	0	0	0	0	0		978-1-4244-1677-6	WOS:000264665900048

The proposed approach is based on the hybrid multi-intelligence technology, where the RBF neural networks, CBR and fuzzy logic reasoning have been used to obtain the parameter estimates, with which a desired prediction on the coiling temperatures has been obtained together with the cooling temperature curve in the cooling process. A number of tests using industrial data have been conducted where desired numerical results have been obtained. It has been shown that the proposed algorithm has a high potential of being used to realize an effective control of the whole process.

The predominant method for obtaining such individual prognoses is to analyze historical data using Cox regression, and apply the resulting model to data from new patients. However, the black-box nature of the Cox regression model makes it unattractive for clinical practice. Instead most physicians prefer to relate a new patient to the histories of similar, individual patients that were treated before. This paper presents a prognostic inference method that combines the k-nearest neighbor paradigm with Cox regression. It yields survival predictions for individual patients, based on small sets of similar patients from the past, and can be used to implement a prognostic case-retrieval system. To evaluate the method, it was applied to data from patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, a progressive and lethal lung disease. Experiments pointed out that the method competes well with Cox regression. The best predictive performance was obtained with a neighborhood size of 20.				11th Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIME 2007)	JUL 07-11, 2007		Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-540-73598-4	WOS:000248222900009

This application requires two searches: search for object appearance stored in the database and that for pose parameters (position, scale, orientation, and so on) of the tracking object in each image frame. For simplifying this problem, we propose a new method, pose parameter embedding (PPE) that transforms the original problem to an appearance search problem. The nearest neighbor (NN) appearance search in this problem has a special property that gradually changing queries are given. For this problem, graph based NN search is suitable, because the preceding search result can be used as the starting point of the next search. Delaunay graph can be used for this search, however, both the graph construction cost and the degree (number of mean edges connected to a vertex) drastically increase in high-dimensional space. Instead, we propose nearest first traversing graph (NFTG) for avoiding these problems. Based on these two techniques, we successfully realized video-rate tracking and recognition.

How to predict rockburst effectively for safety during mining has become an unresolved key problem. Because of poor understanding of the mechanism and influence factors of rockbust, it is very difficult to give accurate prediction using conventional methods. A new method based on k-Nearest Neighbor pattern recognition tech, which is one of the simplest and most effective tools in the field of pattern recognition, is proposed. First, the historical instances with influence factors induced rockbust are collected into database. Then, k historical instances whose influence factors similar to that of new instance are selected through scanning the database based on the neighbor similarity function. Finally, roburst risk of the new instance can be recognized by majority vote among the k nearest historical instances. The method gives accurate rockburst predictions under novel conditions when mining at great depth. The results of case studies at deep gold mines in South African show that this method is scientific, feasible, and promising.

It recently draws attention upon Internet users and information providers. Collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the widely used methods for recommendation. It recommends an item to a user based on the reference users' preferences for the target item or the target user's preferences for the reference items. In this paper, we propose an adaptive depth-first k-nearest neighbor search (DAKNNS) based collaborative filtering method. The algorithm can find k nearest neighbors of the object user in a small hypersphere in order to improve the efficiencies and forecast the rating. The hypersphere's. size can be automatically determined. It requires a quite moderate preprocessing effort, and the cost to classify an object user is O(alpha d)+O(k)(1<=alpha<<n). Our experiment shows the algorithm performance is superior to other known algorithms.				6th Wuhan International Conference on E-Business	MAY 26-27, 2007	China Univ Geosci; CICER; Journal Informat Technol; Int Journal Mobile Learning & Org; Int Journal Revenue Management; Int Journal Elect Markets; Int Journal Networking & Virtual Org; Int Journal Biomed Engn & Technol; Electr Govt, Int Journal	Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0		978-0-9604962-9-7	WOS:000249025701101

In addition to their simplicity, nearest neighbor rules have appealing theoretical properties, e.g. the asymptotic error probability of the plain 1-nearest-neighbor (NN) rule is at most twice the Bayes bound, which means zero asymptotic risk in the separable case. But given only a finite number of training examples, NN classifiers are often outperformed in practice. A possible modification of the NN rule to handle separable problems better is the nearest local hyperplane (NLH) approach. In this paper we introduce a new way of NLH classification that has two advantages over the original NLH algorithm. First, our method preserves the zero asymptotic risk property, of NN classifiers in the separable case. Second, it usually provides better finite sample performance.				10th Congress of the Italian-Association-for-Artificial-Intelligence	SEP 10-13, 2007	Italian Assoc Artificial Intelligence; CELI; ENEA; Exprivia; Fond IBM Italia; Google; Univ Rome, Tor Vergata	Rome, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-540-74781-9	WOS:000250857400025

This paper presents an application of the instance-based learning algorithm for predicting daily stock index price changes of the S&P 500 stock index between October 1995 and September 2000, given the daily changes in the exchange rate of the Canadian Dollar, the Pound Sterling, the French Franc, the Deutsche Mark and the Yen, the monthly changes in the consumer price index, GDP, and the changes in the monthly rates of certificates of deposit. The algorithm is used to predict an increase, decrease or no change in the S&P 500 stock index between a business day and the previous business day. The predictions are carried out using the IB3 variant of the IBL algorithms. The objective is to determine the feasibility of stock price prediction using the IB3 variant of the IBL algorithms. Various testing proportions and normalization methods are experimented with to obtain good predictions.				4th International Workshop on Computer Intelligence in Economics and Finance (CIEF 2005)	JUL 21-26, 2005		Salt Lake City, UT	0	0	0	0	0		978-3-540-72820-7	WOS:000249778600009

Morphological analysis is performed as a letter-by-letter classification task. Classification is performed by the k-nearest neighbor algorithm. Each classification produces a trigram of position-bound operations, each encoding segmentation, part-of-speech information, and letter transformations. The overlapping operation trigrams generated on the basis of an input word are converted into a lattice, from which all morphological analyses of the word are generated. Part-of-speech tagging is carried out separately from the morphological analyzer. A memory-based modular tagger is developed with a subtagger for known words and one for unknown words. On words not seen in training, the morphological analyzer attains a peak F-score of 0.47, while the tagger produces 66.4% correct tags. On all words, including words seen in training, the combination assigns a correct part-of-speech tag and generates all morphological analyses to about 91% of word tokens in running text								0	0	0	0	0	1386-291X	978-1-4020-6046-5	WOS:000269769700012

So, we give the structure of the bayesian network as well as the parameters of the network in order to detect faults in the multivariate space in the same manners as if we used multivariate control charts. The resulting bayesian network, with a computed threshold, is similar to the multivariate control charts.				4th International Conference on Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotics	MAY 09-12, 2007	Inst Syst & Technol Informat, Control & Commun; Univ Angers; Int Federat Automat Control; GDR MACS; CNRS; EEA; Assoc Advancement Artificial Intelligence	Angers, FRANCE	0	0	0	0	0		978-972-8865-82-5	WOS:000252639500032

However, Euclidean metric is not the best choice for LWNB. For nominal attributes, Euclidean metric has to order and number the values of attributes, or judge whether the attribute values are identical or not. For numeric attributes, Euclidean metric is not appropriate for different attribute scales and variability, and encounters the problem of attribute value outliers when normalizing values. In this paper, we systematically study probability based metrics, such as Interpolated Value Difference Metric (IVDM), Extended Short and Fukunaga Metric (SF2), SF2 calibrated by logarithm (SF2LOG) and Minimum Risk Metric (MRM), and apply them to LWNB. These probability based metrics can solve the above problems of Euclidean metric since they depend on the difference between the probabilities to evaluate the distances between the instances. We conduct the experiments to compare the performances of LWNB classifiers using Euclidean metric and probability based metrics on UCI datasets. The results show that LWNB classifiers using IVDM outperform the ones using Euclidean metric and other probability based metrics. We also observe that SF2, SF2LOG and MRM do not perform well due to their inaccurate probability estimates. An artificial dataset is built by logical sampling in a Bayesian network, where accurate probability estimates can be produced. We conduct the experiment on the artificial dataset. The results show that SF2, SF2LOG and MRM using accurate probability estimates perform better than Euclidean metric and IVDM in LWNB.				20th Conference of the Canadian-Society-for-Computational-Studies-of-Intelligence	MAY 28-30, 2007	Canadian Soc Computat Studies Intelligence	Montreal, CANADA	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-540-72664-7	WOS:000246691800016	
J	Wang, Chaoyong; Sun, Yanfeng; Liang, Yanchun								An improved SVM based on similarity metric								JOURNAL OF UNIVERSAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			13	10			1462	1470					2007	2007	A novel support vector machine method for classification is presented in this paper. A modified kernel function based on the similarity metric and Riemannian metric is applied to the support vector machine. In general, it is believed that the similarity of homogeneous samples is higher than that of inhomogeneous samples. Therefore, in Riemannian geometry, Riemannian metric can be used to reflect local property of a curve. In order to enlarge the similarity metric of the homogeneous samples or reduce that of the inhomogeneous samples in the feature space, Riemannian metric is used in the kernel function of the SVM. Simulated experiments are performed using the databases including an artificial and the UCI real data. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through the comparison with four typical kernel functions without similarity metric.								0	0	0	0	0	0948-695X		WOS:000253616300006

To capture relevant information from the EEG signal we use three types of features: power spectrum, conditional entropy, and conditional mutual information. In order to reduce irrelevant and misleading features we use a feature selection method that maximizes mutual information between features and classes and minimizes redundancy among features. Using a selected group of features we show that all classifiers can successfully generalize to the new subject for bands 1-40Hz and 1-60Hz. The classification rates are statistically. significant and the best classification rates, close to 90%, are obtained using conditional entropy features.				17th International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (ICANN 2007)	SEP 09-13, 2007	European Neural Networks Soc; Int Neural Networks Soc; Japanese Neural Network Soc; IEEE Comp Intelligence Soc; European Assoc Signal & Image Proc; Inst Engenhar Biomed; Univ Beira Interior; Inst Super Engenhar Porto; Reitor Univ Porto; UP, Dept Engenhar Elect Computadores; Inst Politecn Porto; Fund Cienc Tecnol; Fund Luso-Amer Desenvolvimento; Fund Calouste Gulbenkian; Microsoft Res Cambridge Lab; Portugal Telecom	Oporto, PORTUGAL	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	978-3-540-74693-5	WOS:000249783400016

While progress in this area is underway in sensor technology, mobile computing platforms, and data transport, barriers to large scale application remain ahead, particularly in the area of patient disease diagnosis, which generally requires a diverse set of sensors and instruments that are applied at proper times in response to patient state/behavior As these sensors may, be numerous, and may not be worn comfortably and practicably at all times, a solution is required for the systematic selection of sensors at the point of use. We describe the Incremental Diagnosis Method (IDM) system, an embedded decision support system based on Bayesian statistics and decision analysis theory developed to select or deselect available sensors so that the diagnostic certainly of patient condition best improved while the set of sensors used on the patient body is minimized. IDM has been evaluated in a testbed, the Medical Embedded Device for Individualized Care (MEDIC) system, based on standard, ubiquitous wireless platforms. MEDIC supports local sensing and signal processing, autonomous decision support, and remote reconfiguration and control of wearable components. A detailed evaluation of IDM operation and performance for patient gait analysis is also given in this paper Finally, we also discuss the many new opportunities provided by IDM and the related future research introduced by this capability.

In this model, a filtering stage of the kNN searching was employed to collect information from training examples and produced a set of emphasized weights which can be distributed to every example by a class of real-valued class labels. The emphasized weights changed the policy of the equal-valued impacts of the training examples and permitted a more efficient way to utilize the information behind the training examples with various sionificance levels. Due to the property of estimating density locally, the kNN method has the advantage to distinguish the heterogeneous examples from the regular examples by merely considering the situation of the examples themselves. The paper shows the model is promising with both the theoretical derivations and consequent experimental results.

Existing centralized KNNS does not scale up to large volume of data because the response time is linearly increasing with the size of the searched file. In this article, an adaptive distributed k-nearest neighbor search algorithm (P2PAKNNS) for high dimension data is proposed to further improve the scalability in P2P systems. The idea adopts the generalized hypersphere partitioning and the similarity measure function HDsim((x) over bar, (y) over bar), which can adaptively determines the size of the hypersphere and avoid the problems that L-k-norm leads to the non-contrasting behavior of distance in high dimensional space. By exploiting parallelism in a dynamic network of computers, the query execution scales up very well considering the number of distance computations. The experiments indicate the algorithm is effective.

J	Abbas, Syed Rahat; Arif, Muhammad								Long range time series forecasting by upsampling and using cross-correlation based selection of nearest neighbor								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			20	8			1261	1278		10.1142/S021800140600523X			DEC 2006	2006	Long range or multistep-ahead time series forecasting is an important issue in various fields of business, science and technology. In this paper, we have proposed a modified nearest neighbor based algorithm that can be used for long range time series forecasting. In the original time series, optimal selection of embedding dimension that can unfold the dynamics of the system is improved by using upsampling of the time series. Zeroth order cross-correlation and Euclidian distance criterion are used to select the nearest neighbor from up-sampled time series. Embedding dimension size and number of candidate vectors for nearest neighbor selection play an important role in forecasting. The size of embedding is optimized by using auto-correlation function (ACF) plot of the time series. It is observed that proposed algorithm outperforms the standard nearest neighbor algorithm. The cross-correlation based criteria shows better performance than Euclidean distance criteria.								0	0	0	0	0	0218-0014		WOS:000243988600008	
J	Kapil, Ankur; Gudi, Ravindra D.; Noronha, Santosh B.								Gene expression profile analysis using discrimination and fuzzy classification methods								ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			1	1-2			110	121		10.1002/apj.012			NOV-DEC 2006	2006	There is a huge incentive for gene expression analysis and identification of biologically meaningful clusters from microarray data. However, the high dimensionality of the data poses challenges for this task. Here, to reduce this problem of irrelevant dimensions, we consider three different projection methods, viz. principal components analysis (PCA), correspondence analysis (CA), and multiple discriminant analysis (DA). To account for the possibility of pleiotropy, where the expression of certain genes may be related to more than one phenotypical condition, we use fuzzy clustering on the lower dimensional space generated by PCA, CA, and DA. Fuzzy clustering permits partial belonging of an attribute, such as gene expression, to different functionalities and hence is eminently suited for this task. To determine the optimum number of clusters, we evaluate various cluster validity indices. In this paper, we compare these methodologies when applied to the data generated by a genetic network simulator (eXPatGen) and also to the experimental micro array data available for yeast S. cerevisiae.

J	Zhen Lou; Zhong Jin								A novel adaptive hit-distance for pattern recognition								CHINESE JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS			15	4A			793	796					OCT 2006	2006	The better the matter is understood, the better the distance between any given point and the matter subspace can be defined, and vice verse. In this paper, a novel idea of distance, Hit-Distance, was proposed to generalize the representational capacity of available prototypes. It is more reasonable to utilize the proposed hit-distance to describe the distance between any given point and any matter subspace. The effectiveness of the proposed distance was indirectly evaluated by some experiments of matter classifications. Experiments were performed on 8 benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It was shown that the hit-distance based classifiers performed much better than the classical nearest neighbor classifier (NN), the Nearest feature line method (NFL) and the Nearest feature plane method (NFP).								0	0	0	0	0	1022-4653		WOS:000241920200006

In design, knowledge is recognized as important to improve the decision-making process and the commensurability of the designers' interpretative framework, but how can relevant knowledge be identified among all the knowledge within a company? This study focuses on the early stage of project development when it is important to have a clear understanding of what is known and not known in the company to correctly specify projects (e.g., teams, costs, lead-time, etc.). A method is proposed in this paper to identify knowledge, where it is, and its level of reusability. This method filters a repository to identify and extract relevant knowledge and define its level of reusability. A case study based on a new single-use camera and a repository of 18 single-use cameras is performed to highlight and validate the proposed method.

The novelty lies in the estimation of the style-constrained posterior field class probabilities from the frequencies of the training patterns in the regions of the feature space engendered by the pairwise decision boundaries of the dichotomizers. We show that on simulated data, this non-parametric field classifier is nearly optimal. On scanned printed digits, its accuracy is comparable to that of state-of-the-art style classifiers.				18th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2006)	AUG 20-24, 2006	IAPR; CAA; Hong Kong Baptist Univ	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	1051-4651	0-7695-2521-0	WOS:000240707600051

Automatically trainable methods are highly desirable, as well as extremely high speed in order to process large collections. Significant obstacles include the expense of preparing correctly labeled ("ground-truthed") samples, unresolved methodological questions in specifying the domain (e.g. what is a representative collection of document images?), and a lack of consensus among researchers on how to evaluate content-extraction performance. Our research strategy emphasizes versatility first: that is, we concentrate at the outset on designing methods that promise to work across the broadest possible range of cases. This strategy, has several important implications: the classifiers must be trainable in reasonable time on vast data sets: and expensive ground-truthed data sets must be complemented by amplification using generative models. These and other design and architectural issues are discussed. We propose a trainable classification methodology that marries k-d trees and hash-driven table lookup and describe preliminary experiments.

We apply the Minimum Description Length principle to the training data for weighting each feature and then select an "Optimal" feature subset by a greedy approach tuned to a specific classifier.

We mainly introduce the KNN and SVM. Using them we can get ideal result in processing non-structural data. If the dimension of data is not high, KNN can get more ideal result; and SVM can be applicable to the data which dimension is very high. So we create a new model for intrusion detection system based KNN and SVM; and we set a threshold for dimension to decide whether using KNN or SVM. In the end, we make some experiments to compare our system with traditional intrusion detection system.				1st International Conference on Computer Science and Education (ICCSE 2006)	JUL 27-29, 2006	China Natl Res Council Comp Educ Coll & Univ; IEEE Control Syst Chapter, Singapore; Univ Virginia; Univ Melbourne	Xiamen Univ, Xiamen, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0		7-5615-2582-6	WOS:000241272800138

Due to the large number of genes and small number of samples, traditional statistical analysis methods alone are not typically sufficient to make appropriate conclusions. This chapter introduces the reader to the basic concepts in the analysis of microarray data and provides a summary of some of the most commonly used techniques. The overall structure of a microarray data analysis can be divided into four distinct components. The four components of a microarray data analysis consist of data preprocessing/quality control, identification of differentially expressed genes, unsupervised clustering/data visualization, and supervised classification/prediction. As the science of microarray analysis has advanced, a wide variety of methods have been developed to address each of these components. Guidance is provided as to the situations in which the various techniques can be applied most productively and cautions given about cases where these techniques will give inappropriate answers.								0	0	0	0	0		978-0-521-85396-5	WOS:000296572500005

An important problem in prototype selection consist in increasing the size of data sets. This problem can be harmful in evolutionary algorithms by deteriorating the convergence and increasing the time complexity. In this paper, we offer a preliminary proposal to solve these drawbacks. We propose an evolutionary algorithm that incorporates knowledge about the prototype selection problem. This study includes a comparison between our proposal and other evolutionary and non-evolutionary prototype selection algorithms. The results show that incorporating knowledge improves the performance of evolutionary algorithms and considerably reduces time execution.				7th International Conference on Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning (IDEAL 2006)	SEP 20-23, 2006		Univ Burgos, Burgos, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	3-540-45485-3	WOS:000241790900161

The motivation of the study is to develop two classifiers for quantitative attributes by the concepts of the association rule and the clustering. An illustration of using petroleum well logging data for oil/gas formation identification is presented in the paper. MPs and JMPs are ideally suitable to derive the implicit relationship between measured values (well logging data) and properties to be predicted (oil/gas formation or not). As a hybrid of classification and clustering and association rules mining, our approach have several advantages which are (1) it has a solid mathematical foundation and compact mathematical description of classifiers, (2) it does not require discretization, (3) it is robust when handling noisy or incomplete data in high dimensional data space.								0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743		WOS:000236545100010

Existing practices either look into first-hand gene expression data which could be costly for large scale analysis, or apply statistical or heuristic learning methods to discover potential binding sites which have limited accuracy due to the complexity of the data. Based on well-studied information retrieval theories, this paper proposes a novel systematic approach for transcription factor target gene prediction. The key of the approach is to model the prediction problem as a classification task by representing the features of the sequential data into vector data points in a higher-order domain. The proposed approach has produced satisfactory results in our controlled experiment on Auxin Response Factor (ARF) target gene prediction in Arabidopsis.

The attacker use abnormal activities to consume the system resource or to degrade the performance of network instead of intruding the system itself Currently, Detection mechanisms are researched that is able to detect the abnormal activities when the attackers use the large amount of packets to break the system down in the development of DDoS. However, the changeable frequency mode will be the tendency in the future.In this paper, we proposed the three-layer detection mechanism which can look for the sophisticated attack packets such as the changeable frequency attack mode. Firstly, we will analyze which fields in the packet may be our features. After analyzing, the features will be grouped into detection characteristics of each layer which quantifies the normal service behavior precisely according to their features. It is easy and immediate to detect the abnormal behavior when the attacks occur.We implement our proposed mechanism in the NTUST's Web Server. We will attack the Web server in practice to observe the difference for beginning to end. And our proposed mechanism can reach a higher performance.				10th World Multi-Conference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics/12th International Conference on Information Systems Analysis and Synthesis	JUL 16-19, 2006	Int Inst Informat & System	Orlando, FL	0	0	0	0	0		978-980-6560-67-3	WOS:000251936800053

This algorithm consists on the elimination of prototypes in the training set that are misclassified using the k-NN rule. From such editing scheme, a general editing procedure can be straightforward derived, where any classifier beyond k-NN can be used. In this paper, we analyze the behavior of this general editing procedure combined with 3 different neighborhood-based classification rules, including k-NN. The results reveal better performances of the 2 other techniques with respect to k-NN in most of cases.

These approaches fall under the integrated flood management (IFM) banner and focus not only on flood prevention, but on flood resilience. This paper introduces an application (FLORETO) for IFM that utilizes the data mining approach, in a web based three tier system, devoted to the capacity building of stakeholders as a micro-scale resilience strategy of IFM. The intelligent models, which constitute the business logic in FLORETO, are used to match the input parameters or design criteria, describing properties prone to flooding, to technically justifiable flood mitigation measures. Datasets from the German city of Kellinghusen were collected and intelligent models were built. Satisfactory results have been obtained, which shows the promise of this data mining approach and opens the door for its application for IFM in other regions.				6th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining	DEC 18-22, 2006	IEEE	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	1550-4786	978-0-7695-2701-7	WOS:000245601900045

In this paper we propose a new algorithm for addressing this problem. The main idea derives from the well-known algorithm of k-nearest-neighbors. In the proposed approach, given an unclassified pattern, a set of neighboring patterns is found, but not necessarily using all input feature dimensions. Also, following the concept of the naive Bayesian classifier, independence of input feature dimensions in the outcome of the classification task is assumed. The two concepts are merged in an attempt to take advantage of their good performance features. Experimental results have shown superior performance of the proposed method in comparison with the aforementioned algorithms and their variations.

IEEE					Gaussian mixture and Markov models for cell-phase classification in microscopic imaging								Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE/SMC International Conference on System of Systems Engineering							303	308					2006	2006	Studies of drug effects on cancer cells are performed through measuring cell cycle progression such as inter phase, prophase, metaphase and anaphase in individual cells. Such studies require the processing and analysis of huge amounts of image data. Manual image analysis is very time consuming thus costly, potentially inaccurate and poorly reproducible. Stages of an automated cellular imaging analysis consist of segmentation, feature extraction, classification, and tracking of individual cells in a dynamic cellular population. Image classfication of cell phases in a fully automatic manner presents the most difficult task of such analysis. We considered applying several versions of Gaussian mixture and Markov models for automating the classification of cell nuclei in different mitotic phases recorded over a period of twenty-four hours at every fifteen minutes with a time-lapse fluoresence microscopy.

This method aims at detecting and eliminating redundancies in a given data set while preserving the significant data. A reduced prototype set contains Pairwise Opposite Class-Nearest Neighbor (POC-NN) prototypes which are used instead of the whole given data. Before finding POC-NN prototypes, all sampling data have to be separated into two classes by using the criteria through odd and even sampling number of data, then POC-NN prototypes are obtained by iterative separation and analysis of the training data into two regions until each region is correctly grouped and classified. The separability is determined by the POC-NN prototypes essential to define the function approximator for local sampling data locating near these POC-NN prototypes. Experiments and results reported showed the effectiveness of this technique and its performance in both accuracy and prototype rate to those obtained by classical nearest neighbor techniques.				13th International Conference on Neural Informational Processing	OCT 03-06, 2006	Chinese Univ Hong Kong; Asia Pacific Neural Network Assembly; K C Wong Educ Fdn	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	3-540-46479-4	WOS:000241790100085

Various computer vision algorithms and methods for automatic visual inspection and automatic classification have been analyzed. Developed algorithm consists of three main stages: color analysis, texture analysis and defects detection. The color analysis is based on the percentile values obtained from the cumulative histogram of the image and texture analysis is based on the second order statistical features obtained from gray level co-occurrence matrix. Detection of defects is implemented as the segmentation method, based on the adaptive binary threshold algorithm, which is based on a local square regions and connected component analysis methods. This way we have achieved a very accurate classifying process with about 90 percent of accuracy, which greatly outstands results of human inspector, that are about 60-70 percent.

In many cases data is distributed, and bringing the data together in one place for analysis is not possible due to privacy laws (e.g. HIPAA) or policies. Privacy preserving data mining techniques have been developed to address this issue by providing mechanisms to mine the data while giving certain privacy guarantees. In this work we address the issue of privacy preserving nearest neighbor search, which forms the kernel of many data mining applications. To this end, we present a novel algorithm based on secure multiparty computation primitives to compute the nearest neighbors of records in horizontally distributed data. We show how this algorithm can be used in three important data mining algorithms, namely LOF outlier detection, SNN clustering, and kNN classification.				6th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining	DEC 18-22, 2006	IEEE	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0		978-0-7695-2702-4	WOS:000245603100099

Hence, how to deal with business emails is becoming more and more important for decision makers, because among these emails, there hides valuable information such as the customer's complaints about a product or the interests of customers to a product. These are important information for a manager to propose marketing policies. In this paper, we develop an improved kNN algorithm----fkNN (fuzz kNN) algorithm based on ontology ideology to classify the emails. After classifying the emails into different classes, we can mine knowledge more easily based on the classified emails. Therefore, the classification effect is very important for mining knowledge further. Fortunately, our improved algorithm behaves much better than other algorithms in classification performance for our email datasets and other datasets.

First, we propose a fuzzy information gain measure of a feature with respect to a set of training instances. Then, based on the proposed fuzzy information gain measure, we present an algorithm for constructing membership functions, calculating the class degree of each subset of training instances with respect to each class and calculating the fuzzy entropy of each subset of training instances, where each subset of training instances contains a part of the training instances whose values of a specific feature fall in the support of a specific fuzzy set of this feature. Finally, we propose an evaluating function for. classifying testing instances. The proposed method can deal with both numeric and nominal features. It gets higher average classification accuracy rates than the existing methods.

Their performance is compared with that of neural networks, M5 model trees, regression trees. A flow forecasting problem was solved along with the five benchmark problems.

A vital consideration in obtaining good results with this technique is the choice of distance function, and correspondingly which features to consider when computing distances between samples. In this paper a new ensemble technique is proposed to improve the performance of NN classifier The proposed approach combines multiple NN classifiers, where each classifier uses a different distance function and potentially a different set of features (feature vector). These feature vectors are determined for each distance metric using Simple Voting Scheme incorporated in Tabu Search (TS). The proposed ensemble classifier with different distance metrics and different feature vectors (TS-DF/NN) is evaluated using various benchmark data sets from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Results have indicated a significant increase in the performance when compared with various well-known classifiers. Furthermore, the proposed ensemble method is also compared with ensemble classifier using different distance metrics but with same feature vector (with or without Feature Selection (FS)).				6th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining	DEC 18-22, 2006	IEEE	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	1550-4786	978-0-7695-2701-7	WOS:000245601900132

IEEE					Efficient finger print image classification and recognition using neural network data mning								2007 International Conference of Signal Processing, Communications and Networking, Vols 1 and 2							426	432					2006	2006	This paper deals with the fingerprint classification and recognition system, which consists of extracting and matching of minutiae from the input image. The necessity for Security in fields such as improving airport security, strengthening the national borders, in travel documents, in preventing ID theft has brought the need to develop an able and efficient method for correct classification of personnel authentication. Fingerprints are the first biometric science used widely for the validation and verifications of entry into specific task, which is more reliable, efficient and accurate. Despite finger print recognition being reliable it has disadvantages such as very low recognition rate, low accuracy rate, total time of recovery and data insufficiency. To address above problem a novel Data Mining technique, Neuro Nearest Neighbour based fingerprint classification and recognition, is introduced which boosts the classification rate. The proposed method consists of different stages such as image enhancement, line detector based feature extraction, neural network classification using Learning vector quantization and Back propagation networks. The proposed system is trained and tested on Fingerprint Database obtained from the University of Bologna Italy, which consists of 900 samples. The exact image is recognized precisely from the classified database rather than the original set of database using Crisp K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm that increases recognition accuracy and reduction in time.

It can be interpreted as an empirical Bayes classifier based on the estimated a posteriori probabilities from the k nearest neighbors. The performance of the k-nearest neighbor rule relies on the locally constant a posteriori probability assumption. This assumption, however, becomes problematic in high dimensional spaces due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper we introduce a locally adaptive nearest neighbor rule. Instead of using the Euclidean distance to locate the nearest neighbors, the proposed method takes into account the effective influence size of each training example and the statistical confidence with which the label of each training example can be trusted. We test the new method on real-world benchmark datasets and compare it with the standard k-nearest neighbor rule and the support vector machines. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.				4th International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics	AUG 18-21, 2005	IEEE Systems, Man & Cybernet TCC; Hong Kong Polytechn Univ; Hebei Univ; S China Univ Technol; Chongqing Univ; Sun Yatsen Univ; Harbin Inst Technol; Int Univ Germany	Guangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	3-540-33584-6	WOS:000238282100057

In this model, a filtering stage of the kNN searching was employed to collect information from training examples and produced a set of emphasized weights which can be If distributed to every example by a class of real-valued class labels. The emphasized weights changed the policy of the equal-valued impacts of the training examples and permitted a more efficient way to utilize the information behind the training examples with various significance levels. Due to the property of estimating density locally, the kNN method has the advantage to distinguish the heterogeneous examples from the regular examples by merely considering the situation of the examples themselves. The paper shows the model is promising with both the theoretical derivations and consequent experimental results.

The problem of assigning functional classes to proteins is complicated by the fact that a single protein can participate in several different pathways and thus can have multiple functions. It follows that the instances in the resulting classification problem can carry multiple class labels.We have developed a tree-based classifier that capable of handling multiply-labeled data: we call the resulting tree a Recursive Maximum-Contrast Tree (RMCT). The name derives from the way in which nodes in the tree are split; this is done by selecting the two training instances with maximum contrast (that is, the two training instances with maximum separation according to some distance measure) and using them as seeds in a clustering algorithm to form a partition of the training instances and hence of the feature space. We test our algorithm on protein phylogenetic profiles generated from 60 completely sequenced genomes, and we compare our results to those achieved using existing algorithms such as support vector machines and decision trees.				6th IEEE Syposium on BioInformatics and BioEngineering (BIBE 2006)	OCT 16-18, 2006	IEEE Comp Soc; Biol & Artificial Intelligence Soc; ITRI	Arlington, VA	0	0	0	0	0		0-7695-2727-2	WOS:000242503800005

Compared with the axis-parallel decision trees (APDTs), NNC-Trees are more comprehensible for large problems, because the decision rules corresponding to the trees are simpler. Currently, the author has proposed an algorithm for inducing NNC-Trees based on the R(4)-rule. However, compared with C4.5, which is a popular program for inducing APDTs, the computation of our algorithm is relatively expensive. This paper proposes two methods for reducing the computational cost. The efficiency of the proposed methods is verified through experiments on three public databases.

J	Habrard, A; Bernard, M; Sebban, M								Detecting irrelevant subtrees to improve probabilistic learning from tree-structured data								FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE			66	1-2			103	130					JUN 2005	2005	In front of the large increase of the available amount of structured data (such as XML documents), many algorithms have emerged for dealing with tree-structured data. In this article, we present a probabilistic approach which aims at a priori pruning noisy or irrelevant subtrees in a set of trees. The originality of this approach, in comparison with classic data reduction techniques, comes from the fact that only a part of a tree (i.e. a subtree) can be deleted, rather than the whole tree itself. Our method is based on the use of confidence intervals, on a partition of subtrees, computed according to a given probability distribution. We propose an original approach to assess these intervals on tree-structured data and we experimentally show its interest in the presence of noise.				1st International Workshop on Mining Graphs, Trees and Sequences	SEP   10, 2003		Cavtat, CROATIA	0	0	0	0	0	0169-2968		WOS:000235948300006

In this context, the reuse of knowledge about the targeted product is critical for developing potential product platforms. One can facilitate the reuse of existing knowledge to achieve a desired design by establishing a method that considers the layout of modules (or components) with identified flow interfaces, volume and the fundamental functional description. The problem grows with the number of candidate modules and with information-rich descriptions. The proposed REUSE (Reuse Existing Unit for Shape and Efficiency) Method greatly facilitates this search by filtering candidates based on their similarity to desired characteristics and their performance efficiency. By reusing existing information from components and modules, this approach allows the detailed specification of cost (e.g., investment and production cost for a module) along with other desired characteristics. This method applies to the complete product realization enterprise from conception through product launch. It also enables traceability of design decisions to help capture rationale and justification. A case study involving a family of cameras illustrates the proposed method.

AdaBoost, short form for Adaptive Boosting method, consists of repeated use of a weak or a base learning algorithm to find corresponding weak hypothesis by adapting to the error rates of the individual weak hypotheses. A large, complex handwritten data is under study. A repeated use of weak learner on the huge data results in large. amount of processing time. In view of this, instead of using the entire training data for learning, we propose to use only prototypes. Further in the current work, the base learner consists of a nearest neighbour classifier that employs prototypes generated using "leader" clustering algorithm. The leader algorithm is a single pass algorithm and is linear in terms of time as well as computation complexity. The prototype set alone is used as training data. In the process of developing an algorithm, domain knowledge of the Handwritten data, which is under study, is made use of With the fusion of clustering, prototype selection, AdaBoost and Nearest Neighbour classifier a very high classification accuracy, which is better than reported earlier on the considered data, is obtained in less number of iterations. The procedure integrates clustering outcome in terms of prototypes with boosting.				4th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS 04)	DEC 05-08, 2004	IEEE Comp Soc; Computat Intelligence Soc; IEEE, Syst Man, & Cybernet Soc; BMFSA; SOFT; Int Fuzzy Syst Assoc; City Kitakyushu; World Federat Soft Comp	Kitakyushu, JAPAN	0	0	0	0	0		0-7695-2291-2	WOS:000228181100053

Parallel and distributed data mining provides an attractive solution to the large scale data mining process. Message passing based parallel computing has been widely used in diverse applications such as scientific computing, ray tracing, simulation, and recently data mining. In this paper, we will present an alternative approach based on distributed tuple space that we contend provides more convenient and efficient parallel data mining framework. Then, we describe the associated analytical performance models to investigate the scalability of the proposed architecture over the cluster computing environment. We also present the experimental results for an exemplary data mining algorithm, k nearest neighbor.

While improving the accuracy of those algorithms has been the main focus of past research, massive dataset size imposes another challenge. Parallel and distributed processing techniques have been applied to data mining algorithms to make them scalable. In this paper, we discuss a new emerging data mining algorithm, random forests, and its parallelization based on VCluster, a portable parallel runtime system we have developed for a cluster of multiprocessors. Random forests is an ensemble of many decision trees and the classification is performed by majority voting by those decision trees. We also present the experimental results on the performance of parallel random forests approach.

Four feature subset selection methods are investigated in the context of learning fuzzy rule bases. Two of them are filter methods namely, the Relief-E and the C-Focus. The other two are wrapper methods using GA as their search process; one implements the instance-based method 1-NN and the other, the constructive neural network algorithm DistAl. Results of the experiments conducted in three domains are presented and discussed; they show that methods which learn fuzzy rule bases can benefit from feature subset selection methods.				4th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS 04)	DEC 05-08, 2004	IEEE Comp Soc; Computat Intelligence Soc; IEEE, Syst Man, & Cybernet Soc; BMFSA; SOFT; Int Fuzzy Syst Assoc; City Kitakyushu; World Federat Soft Comp	Kitakyushu, JAPAN	0	0	0	0	0		0-7695-2291-2	WOS:000228181100029

In this paper we address these two assumptions, by introducing a new multi-agent model for the evolution of perceptually grounded lexicons, where agents do not perceive the same set of objects, and where agents receive a cue to focus their attention to objects, thus simulating a Theory of Mind. In addition, we vary the amount of corrective feedback provided to guide learning word-meanings. Results of simulations show that the proposed model is quite robust to the strength of these cues and the amount of feedback received.				8th European Conference on Artificial Life	SEP 05-09, 2005		Canterbury, ENGLAND	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	3-540-28848-1	WOS:000233583100065

It overcomes the drawbacks of the original Nearest Feature Line (NFL) classifier and possesses a novel property that centralizes the probability density of the initial sample distribution, which significantly enhances the classification ability. Another remarkable merit is that RNFLS is applicable to complex problems such as two-spirals, which the original NFL cannot deal with properly. Experimental comparisons with NFL, NN(Nearest Neighbor), k-NN and NNL (Nearest Neighbor Line) using artificial and real-world datasets demonstrate that RNFLS offers the best performance.				2nd International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery	AUG 27-29, 2005	Xiangtan Univ; IEEE Circuits & Syst Soc; IEEE Computat IntelligenceSoc; IEEE Control Syst Soc; Int Neural Network Soc; European Neural Network Soc; Chinese Assoc Artifiical Intelligence; Japanese Neural Network Soc; Int Fuzzy Syst Assoc; Asia-Pacific Neural Network Assembly; Fuzzy Math & Syst Assoc Chine; Hunan Comp Federat	Changsha, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	3-540-28331-5	WOS:000232218400011

However improving performance of the classifier is still attractive. Combining multiple classifiers is an effective technique for improving accuracy. There are many general combining algorithms, such as Bagging, Boosting, or Error Correcting Output Coding that significantly improve the classifier such as decision trees, rule learners, or neural networks. Unfortunately, these combining methods developed do not improve the nearest neighbor classifiers. In this paper first, we present a new approach to combine multiple KNN classifiers based on different distance functions, in which we apply multiple distance functions to improve the performance of the k-nearest neighbor classifier Second, we develop a combining method, in which the weights of the distance function, are learnt by genetic algorithm. Finally, combining classifiers in error correcting output coding, are discussed The proposed algorithms seek to increase generalization accuracy when compared to the basic k-nearest neighbor algorithm. Experiments have been conducted on some benchmark datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The results show that the proposed algorithms improve the performance of the k-nearest neighbor classification.				3rd International Conference on Software Engineering Research, Management and Applications	AUG 11-13, 2005		Cent Michigan Univ, Mt Pleasant, MI	0	0	0	0	0		0-7695-2297-1	WOS:000231789000031

To provide a reliable comparison of the ensembles we restrict the task to some constant configuration of committee members for each benchmark. We were looking for new types of committees which, in such configuration, would be as much accurate and stable as possible. The paper focuses on some ideas of heterogenous committees with different ways of their members competence estimation. Heterogenous committee members adapt in different ways and are able to solve different problems. Measuring the competence of committee members helps in making competent and accurate decisions.				5th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems	NOV 06-09, 2005	Operador Nacl Sistema Eletr; Coordenac Aperfeicoament Pessoal Nivel Super; Brazilian Comp Soc; Brazilian Soc Automat; IEEE Syst Man & Cygernet Soc; Int Fuzzy Syst Assoc; European Neural Network Soc; European Soc Fuzzy Log & Technol; World Federat Soft Comp; Pontific Univ Catol Rio deJaneiro	Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL	0	0	0	0	0		0-7695-2457-5	WOS:000234402500069

If the data set is large, however the induced DT may be too large to understand. Currently, we have proposed a non-genetic evolutionary algorithm called R(4)-rule for producing the smallest nearest neighbor classifiers (NNCs). In this paper we propose two new approaches for inducing DTs with the R(4)-rule. The DTs considered here are multivariate, and there is an NNC with two or more prototypes in each non-terminal node. In the first method, the prototypes are found directly from the training set. In the second method, the prototypes are found from the data assigned to each non-terminal node. Using these methods, we can induce more compact and more comprehensible DTs. The efficiency and efficacy of the methods are verified through experiments with several public databases.

The method has two advantages over traditional systems: the first is that it can predict "new" instances, not yet present in the case base; the second is that it can predict solutions not present in the retrieval set. The method is a generalisation of Shepard's Interpolation method, formulated as the minimisation of an error function defined in terms of distance metrics in the solution and problem spaces. We term the retrieval algorithm the Generalised Shepard Nearest Neighbour (GSNN) method. A novel aspect of GSNN is that it provides a general method for interpolation over nominal solution domains. The method is illustrated in the paper with reference to the Irises classification problem. It is evaluated with reference to a simulated nominal value test problem, and to a benchmark case base from the travel domain. The algorithm is shown to out-perform conventional nearest neighbour methods on these problems. Finally, GSNN is shown to improve in efficiency when used in conjunction with a diverse retrieval algorithm.				24th SGAI International Conference on Innovative Techniques and Applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI-2004)	DEC 12-15, 2004	British Comp Soc Specialist Grp Artificial Intelligence	Cambridge, ENGLAND	0	0	0	0	0		1-85233-907-1	WOS:000226889800006

This poses problems of radiometric-topographic normalization, which are addressed in this paper. The SCS (sun-canopy-sensor) method, extended for including diffuse sky radiation, is found to be particularly suited for this. Estimating parameters of radiometric-topographic correction algorithms (such as the ratio of direct sun radiation and diffuse sky radiation in case of the extended SCS method) from the image itself by regression of forest pixels arbitrarily selected at different topographic conditions relies on the assumption that the forest pixels selected at different irradiation conditions represent (in the statistical average) identical forest conditions. This assumption can hardly be proved to be valid. The estimation of this ratio by tuning within the kNN cross-validation procedure, on the other hand, represents a sound method, making use of the large amount of forest information available from terrestrial forest inventories. The practicability of this method depends on the number and thematic distribution of field plots on one single scene, for which homogenous atmospheric conditions can be assumed.				24th Symposium of the European-Association-of-Remote-Sensing-Laboratories (EARSeL)	MAY 25-27, 2004	European Assoc Remote Sensing Labs	Dubrovnik, CROATIA	0	0	0	0	0		90-5966-003-X	WOS:000228786900029

The method aimed to integrate the advantage of editing and condensing method, and it only selects the points in class boundary into prototype set. It used information contained in internal points to 'clean' or edit overlapping and noise of training set, then condensing process which only keeps border points was used to obtain prototype set. Computational results show that it can obtain satisfactory performance and higher condensing rate than popular instance reduction algorithm.

In this situation, the appearance may change significantly within the sequence, hampering efforts to track particular features. Active shape models [1] offer one approach to this problem, by "learning" the relationship between appearance and world-state from a small set of hand-labeled training examples. In this paper we propose a method for partitioning the input image set which addresses two problems: first, it provides an automatic method for selecting a set of training images for hand-labeling; second, it results in a partitioning of the image space into regions suitable for local model adaptation. Repeated application of the partitioning procedure results in a tree-structured representation of the image space. The resulting structure can be used to define corresponding neighborhoods in the shape model parameter space; a new image may be processed efficiently by first inserting it into the tree, and then solving for model parameters within the corresponding restricted domain. The ideas are illustrated with examples from an outdoor gaze-tracking application.				1st International Symposium on Visual Computing	DEC 05-07, 2005	UNR; DRI; LBNL; NASA Ames; intel; Digital Persona; Equinox	Lake Tahoe, NV	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	3-540-30750-8	WOS:000234830800037

The first method uses a feed-forward back-propagation Artificial Neural Network; the second method involves using Kohonen Self-Organising Maps while the third method is k-Nearest Neighbour analysis. The sensor monitors the food colour online as the food cooks by examining the reflected light from both the surface and the core of the product. The combination of using Principal Component Analysis and Backpropagation Neural Networks has been successfully investigated previously. In this paper, results obtained using all three classifiers are presented and compared. The Principal Components used to train each classifier are evaluated from data that generate a "colourscale" comprising six colour classifications. This scale has been developed to allow several products of similar colour to be tested using a single network that had been trained using the colourscale. The results presented show that both the neural network and the Self-Organising Map approach perform comparably, while the k-NN method tested under-performs the other two.

Indeed, approaches such as Principal Component Analysis and Independent Component Analysis attempt to extract a set of meaningful linear projections while minimizing interpoint distance distortions. The counterintuitive yet effective random projections approach of Johnson and Lindenstrauss defines a sample-based dimensionality reduction technique with probabilistically provable distortion bounds. We investigate and report on the relative efficacy of two random projection techniques for Synthetic Aperture Radar images in a classification setting.

S	Wang, JG; Neskovic, P; Cooper, LN						Wang, L; Chen, K; Ong, YS		Locally determining the number of neighbors in the k-nearest neighbor rule based on statistical confidence								ADVANCES IN NATURAL COMPUTATION, PT 1, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		3610				71	80					2005	2005	The k-nearest neighbor rule is one of the most attractive pattern classification algorithms. In practice, the value of k is usually determined by the cross-validation method. In this work, we propose a new method that locally determines the number of nearest neighbors based on the concept of statistical confidence. We define the confidence associated with decisions that are made by the majority rule from a finite number of observations and use it as a criterion to determine the number of nearest neighbors needed. The new algorithm is tested on several realworld datasets and yields results comparable to those obtained by the knearest neighbor rule. In contrast to the k-nearest neighbor rule that uses a fixed number of nearest neighbors throughout the feature space, our method locally adjusts the number of neighbors until a satisfactory level of confidence is reached. In addition, the statistical confidence provides a natural way to balance the trade-off between the reject rate and the error rate by excluding patterns that have low confidence levels.				1st International Conference on Natural Computation (ICNC 2005)	AUG 27-29, 2005	Xiangtang Univ; IEEE Circuits & Syst Soc; IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc; IEEE Control Syst Soc; Int Neural Network Soc; European Neural Network Soc; Chinese Assoc Artificial Intelligence; Japanese Neural Network Soc; Int Fuzzy Syst Assoc; Asia Pacific Neural Network Assembly; Fuzzy Math & Syst Assoc China; Hunan Comp Federat	Changsha, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	3-540-28323-4	WOS:000232222400009	
J	Yang, Y; Zheng, CX; Lin, P								Fuzzy clustering with spatial constraints for image thresholding								OPTICA APPLICATA			35	4			943	954					2005	2005	Image thresholding plays an important role in image segmentation. This paper presents a novel fuzzy clustering based image thresholding technique, which incorporates the spatial neighborhood information into the standard fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm. The prior spatial constraint, which is defined as weight in this paper, is inspired-by the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm and is modified from two aspects in order to improve the performance of image thresholding. The algorithm is. initialized by a fast FCM algorithm,. in which the iteration is carried out with the statistical gray level histogram of image instead of the conventional whole data of image; therefore its convergence is fast. Extensive experiment results and both qualitative and quantitative comparative studies with several existing methods on the thresholding of some synthetic and real images illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm.								0	0	0	0	0	0078-5466		WOS:000237771000034

Most common regional abnormalities for Alzheimer's disease are symmetric or asymmetric bilateral temporal or parietal hypoperfusion. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a useful tool in analyzing hypoperfusion in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this research is to provide a quantitatively automatic analysis of the SPECT scans for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. A characteristic-point-based fuzzy inference classifier (CPFIC) is proposed to perform two-class classification. The closeness matrix is defined to determine the closeness between training samples, and constrained minimizations are used to systematically train the CPFIC. For comparison, experiments on nearest neighbor method and support vector machine (SVM) were also performed. In error rates, the proposed CPFIC is better than nearest neighbor method, but worse than SVM method. Although the CPFIC did not perform better than SVM in error rates, the summarizing information embedded in the patterns on characteristic points can complement SVM to provide more information to radiologists.

The ongoing development of the prototype multisensor detection subsystem is presented, which integrates an advanced electromagnetic pulsed-induction array and ground penetrating synthetic aperture radar array on a single standoff platform. The FPDS detection subsystem is mounted on a robotic rubber-tracked vehicle and incorporates an accurate and precise navigation/positioning module making it well suited for operation in varied and irregular terrains. Detection sensors are optimally configured to minimize interference without loss in sensitivity or performance. Mine lane test data acquired from the prototype sensors are processed to extract signal- and image-based features for automatic target recognition. Preliminary results using optimal feature and classifier selection indicate the potential of the system to achieve high probabilities of detection while minimizing false alarms. The FPDS detection software system also exploits modern multi-sensor data fusion algorithms to provide real-time detection and discrimination information to the user.

On the basis of geometrical properties of data, the proposed algorithm first forms extended prototypes through computing means of any two prototypes in the same class. Then Gaussian kernel is employed for covering the geometrical structure of data and used as a local probability measurement. By computing the sum of the probabilities that a new sample to be classified to the set of prototypes and extended prototypes, the classified criterion based on the global probability measurement is achieved. The proposed GPC algorithm is simple but powerful, especially, when training samples are sparse and small size. Experiments on several databases show that the proposed algorithm is promising. Also, we explore other potential applications such as outlier removal with the proposed GPC algorithm.				2nd International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery	AUG 27-29, 2005	Xiangtan Univ; IEEE Circuits & Syst Soc; IEEE Computat IntelligenceSoc; IEEE Control Syst Soc; Int Neural Network Soc; European Neural Network Soc; Chinese Assoc Artifiical Intelligence; Japanese Neural Network Soc; Int Fuzzy Syst Assoc; Asia-Pacific Neural Network Assembly; Fuzzy Math & Syst Assoc Chine; Hunan Comp Federat	Changsha, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	3-540-28312-9	WOS:000232217900029

The assumption becomes invalid in high dimension due to the curse-of-dimensionality. Severe bias can be introduced under this condition when using nearest neighbor rule. We propose an adaptive nearest neighbor classification method "indecisive classifier" to minimize bias and variance by avoiding decision making in some hard-decision region. As a result, better classification performance can be expected in some scenario such as video based face recognition.

B	Zhao, QF						Shih, TK; Shibata, Y		Design smart NNTrees based on the R-4-rule								AINA 2005: 19th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications, Vol 2							547	551					2005	2005	Neural network tree (NNTree) is a hybrid learning model with the overall structure being a decision tree (DT), and each non-terminal node containing an expert neural network (ENN). Generally speaking, NNTrees outperform conventional DTs because more complex and possibly better features can be extracted by the ENNs. So far we have studied several genetic algorithms (GAs) for designing the NNTrees. These algorithms are computationally expensive, and the NNTrees obtained are often very large. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the R-4-rule, which is a non-genetic evolutionary algorithm proposed by the author several years ago. The key point is to propose a heuristic method for defining the teacher signals for the examples assigned to a non-terminal node. Once the teacher signals are defined, the ENNs can be trained quickly using the R-4-rule. Experiments with several public databases show that the new approach can produce smart NNTrees quickly and effectively.				19th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications	MAR 28-30, 2005	IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Distributed Proc; Tamkang Univ; Asian Off Aerosp Res & Dev; USA Asian Res Off	Taipei, TAIWAN	0	0	0	0	0		0-7695-2249-1	WOS:000229285400119

J	Li, JY; Ong, HL								Feature space transformation for better understanding biological and medical classifications								JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND PRACTICE IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			36	3			131	144					AUG 2004	2004	Recently published gene expression profiles and proteomic mass/charge ratios are extremely high-dimensional data. Though support vector machines can well learn the inner relationship of the data for classification, the non-linear kernel functions pose an obstacle to explain the prediction reasons to non-specialists. In this paper, we study the problem of feature space transformation for easy interpretability of classification results. Each new feature is a combination of multiple original features provided that the new feature captures a large percentage of one class of data, but sharply discriminates the data in the other class. Under the description of new features, training or test data are clearly class-separable. We also discuss a more sophisticated rule-based method, called PCL, for classification. PCL provides easily explainable classification scores for us to better understand the predictions and the test data themselves. Visualization is also used to enhance the understanding of the classifier output. We use rich examples to demonstrate our main points.								0	0	0	0	0	1443-458X		WOS:000223565300002

This is affecting the concept of content-based geospatial queries, as simple coverage-based query mechanisms (e.g., declaring a specific area of interest) as well as theme-based query mechanisms (e.g., requesting a black and white aerial photo or multispectral satellite imagery) are rendered inadequate to identify and access specific datasets in such collections. In this paper we introduce a novel approach to handle data quality attributes in geospatial queries. Our approach is characterized by the ability to model and learn user preferences, thus establishing user profiles that allow us to customize image queries for improving their functionality in a constantly diversifying geospatial user community.								0	0	0	0	0	0099-1112		WOS:000223074300011

The paper describes in detail how a simple neural network can be applied down to the level of an industrial realization to provide a reliable user-machine interface. The industrial application is that of character recognition where characters are drawn with the finger on a small touchpad. Compared with the nearest neighbour method, the neural network solution has slightly better recognition rate, is faster and requires less memory space. The design of the recognition system is given and results of an experiment made on a driving simulator are presented.								0	0	0	0	0	1370-4621		WOS:000220763000002

However multimedia systems are difficult to test. A major reason is that these systems generally exhibit fuzziness in their temporal behaviors. The fuzziness is caused by the existence of non-deterministic factors in their runtime environments, such as system load and network traffic. It complicates the analysis of test results. The problem is aggravated when a test involves the synchronization of different multimedia streams as well as variations in system loading.In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on the testing and fault-identification of multimedia systems by treating the issue as a classification problem. Typical classification techniques, including Bayesian networks, k-nearest neighbor and neural networks, are experimented with the use of X-Smiles, an open source multimedia authoring tool supporting the Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL). The encouraging result of our study, which is based only on five attributes, shows that our proposal can achieve an accuracy of 57.6 to 79.2% in identifying the types of fault in environments where common cause variations are present. A further improvement Of 7.6% is obtained via normalization.				4th International Conference on Quality Software	SEP 08-09, 2004	Tech Univ Braunschweig, Inst Informat Syst; Univ Hong Kong, Software Engn Grp; Swinburne Univ Technol, Ctr Software Engn	Braunschweig, GERMANY	0	0	0	0	0		0-7695-2207-6	WOS:000224457200005

Experimental results obtained so far show that the W-rule can produce the smallest or nearly smallest networks with high generalization ability by iteratively performing four basic operations: recognition, remembrance, (r) under bar eduction, and review. To use this algorithm, however, we must specify several parameters properly, and this is often not easy. In this paper, we try to improve the usability of the R-4-rule by reducing the number of parameters. The efficiency of the improved algorithm is verified through experiments with several public databases.				8th IASTED International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing	SEP 01-03, 2004	Int Assoc Sci & Technol Dev, TC Artificial Intelligence & Expert; IASTED, TC Soft Comp; World Modelling & Simulat Forum	Marbella, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0		0-88986-452-7	WOS:000228486200042

The number of examples in this set is arbitrary, generally determined by the user of the system. It can be seen empirically, that the final results are influenced by the initial choice of the seeds. The work described in this paper proposes and investigates other alternative methods for choosing seeds and empirically evaluates their impact on the learning results in seven knowledge domains, as far as accuracy and number of expressions describing the concepts are concerned. In spite of the additional time investment associated with using a clustering method and, assuming that accuracy of the induced concept is of major importance, experiments have shown that choosing the initial set of seeds as the center of clusters can be the best option.

In the manufacturing process, traceability is required to follow-up all the production cycle of the product. Consequently, product traceability can result in a great control of the production process, thus allows improving control of production tools and reacting to their deficiencies. For wood industries, implementation of current identification techniques is not easy, due to the extremely variable nature of the wood and the particular features of the manufacturing process. In this article, we implement a traceability tool within a manufacturing process using the intrinsic characteristics of the wood product. The goal is to achieve an individual identification of products. We use a microwave sensor to obtain a unique signature of the product and then we develop its identification. Thus, the identification process on the basis of a numerical product signature can be considered as a discrimination problem as for the nearest neighbor method. We evaluate the error rate of identification by a Monte Carlo simulation of the process. This work shows the high potential of developing an identification system based on the use of the intrinsic characteristics of product.

It is an interactive and iterative process that involves several steps with many decisions being made by users. A new and fertile research area, referenced in the present work as KDD Assistance, is concerned about the development of computational mechanisms that help men in making decisions in KDD processes. An important step in KDD process concerns the choice of which data mining algorithm(s) should be used in new databases. The present work aims at evaluating a ranking algorithm based approach. Given a new database, such approach takes algorithms' past performance in similar databases into consideration in order to indicate which algorithms should be tried on first. A computational tool to implement this approach was developed and is described in detail. Experiments with six classification algorithms and several databases are reported.

This paper proposes a novel data mining algorithm for the classification over quantitative data, based on a new pattern called MOUCLAS (MOUntain function based CLASsification) Patterns. The aim of the study is to apply MOUCLAS mining on the well logging data for purpose of oil/gas formation identification. From data mining point of view, the motivation of the study is to develop an association rule based classifier, which can has any number of predicates in the antecedent and overcome the limitation caused by the discretization method, for quantitative attributes by the concepts of clustering. An illustration of using well logging data for oil/gas formation identification is presented in the paper. MOUCLAS is ideally suitable to derive the implicit relationship between measured values (well logging data) and properties to be predicted (oil/gas formation or not). As a hybrid of classification and clustering and association rules mining, our approach have several advantages which are (1) it has a solid mathematical foundation and compact mathematical description of classifiers, (2) it does not require discretization, (3) it is robust when handling noisy or incomplete data in high dimensional data space, (4) it is not sensitive to the order of input items and it scales linearly with the size of input.

This method plays important roles not only in the nearest neighbor classifiers but also in the other classifiers such as the support vector machines, because the resulting prototype patterns involve support vectors in many cases. However, previous algorithms for Voronoi condensing were computationally inefficient in general Pattern Recognition tasks. This is because they use proximity graphs for entire training patters, which require computational time exponentially for the dimension of pattern space. For solving this problem, we proposed an efficient algorithm for Voronoi condensing named direct condensing that does not require the entire proximity graphs of training patterns. We confirmed that direct condensing efficiently calculates Voronoi condensed prototypes in high dimension (from 2 to 20 dimensions).				17th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)	AUG 23-26, 2004	Int Assoc Pattern Recognit; Univ Surrey; UniS; IEEE Comp Soc; HP Res Labs Bristol	British Machine Vis Assoc, Cambridge, ENGLAND	0	0	0	0	0	1051-4651	0-7695-2128-2	WOS:000223879500116

According to the development of modern technology, the demand is increasing in large-scale datasets with a large number of samples and a large number of features. However, almost all sophisticated algorithms proposed so far are effective only in a small number of features, say, up to 10. This is because in a high-dimensional space many pairs of samples share a same distance. Then the naive algorithm outperforms the others. In this study, we considered to utilize a sequential information of distances obtained by the examined training samples. Indeed, a combinatorial information of examined samples was used as bisectors between possible pairs of them. With this algorithm, a query is processed in O(alphabetand) for n samples in a d-dimensional space and for alpha,beta < 1, in expense of a preprocessing time and space in O(n(2)). We examined the performance of the algorithm.				10th International Workshop on Structural and Syntactic Pattern Recognition/5th International Conference on Statistical Techniques in Pattern Recognition	AUG 18-20, 2004	Inst Telecommun; Inst Super Tecn; Int Assoc Pattern Recognit; Fund Luso-Amer Desenvolvimento	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	3-540-22570-6	WOS:000223398900097	
B	Li, HF; Zhang, KS; Jiang, T			IEEE Comp Soc					Minimum entropy clustering and applications to gene expression analysis								2004 IEEE COMPUTATIONAL SYSTEMS BIOINFORMATICS CONFERENCE, PROCEEDINGS							142	151					2004	2004	Clustering is a common methodology for analyzing the gene expression data. In this paper, we present a new clustering algorithm from an information-theoretic point of view. First, we propose the minimum entropy (measured on a posteriori probabilities) criterion, which is the conditional entropy of clusters given the observations. Fano's inequality indicates that it could be a good criterion for clustering. We generalize the criterion by replacing Shannon's entropy with Havrda-Charvat's structural a-entropy. Interestingly, the minimum entropy criterion based on structural a-entropy is equal to the probability error of the nearest neighbor method when alpha = 2. This is another evidence that the proposed criterion is good for clustering. With a nonparametric approach for estimating a posteriori probabilities, an efficient iterative algorithm is then established to minimize the entropy. The experimental results show that the clustering algorithm performs significantly better than k-means/medians, hierarrhical clustering, SOM, and EM in terms of adjusted Rand index. Particularly, our algorithm performs very well even when the correct number of clusters is unknown. In addition, most clustering algorithms produce poor partitions in presence of outliers while our method can correctly reveal the structure of data and effectively identify outliers simultaneously.

We present a method using Learn Vector Quantization (LVQ) to cancel CCI for such systems. The model of the overall CCo is significantly simplified based on that of the individual CCI. The LVQ is realized as a classification equalizer with a decision feedback adaptive filter. An extremely small number of unique words (UWs) is utilized to initialize the LVQ equalizer. Simulation results show that the bit error rate (BER) of our proposed method is much better than that of the recently proposed nearest neighbor classification (NNC) equalizer.				15th IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor, Mobile, Radio Communications (PIMRC 2004)	SEP 05-08, 2004	IEEE	Barcelona, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0		0-7803-8523-3	WOS:000225483300253	
S	Li, JY; Ramamohanarao, K						Dai, H; Srikant, R; Zhang, C		A tree-based approach to the discovery of diagnostic biomarkers for ovarian cancer								ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE		3056				682	691					2004	2004	Computational diagnosis of cancer is a classification problem, and it has two special requirements on a learning algorithm: perfect accuracy and small number of features used in the classifier. This paper presents our results on an ovarian cancer data set. This data set is described by 15154 features, and consists of 253 samples. Each sample is referred to a woman who suffers from ovarian cancer or who does not have. In fact, the raw data is generated by the so-called mass spectrosmetry technology measuring the intensities of 15154 protein or peptide-features in a blood sample for every woman. The purpose is to identify a small subset of the features that can be used as biomarkers to separate the two classes of samples with high accuracy. Therefore, the identified features can be potentially used in routine clinical diagnosis for replacing labour-intensive and expensive conventional diagnosis methods. Our new tree-based method can achieve the perfect 100% accuracy in 10-fold cross validation on this data set. Meanwhile, this method also directly outputs a small set of biomarkers. Then we explain why support vector machines, naive bayes, and k-nearest neighbour cannot fulfill the purpose. This study is also aimed to elucidate the communication between contemporary cancer research and data mining techniques.				8th Pacific/Asia Conference on Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	MAY 26-28, 2004	NICIA; SAS; Univ Technol Sydney; Deakin Univ	Sydney, AUSTRALIA	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	3-540-22064-X	WOS:000221955100078

It compares two cases with respect to their "features," with each feature using a separate "comparator." The results of the comparators are combined according to some rule to give an overall measure of the similarity between the given cases. Previous works have described a CBR framework that can easily be instantiated to provide a case-based reasoner for virtually any problem domain. This uses an "adaptive," or "reflective'' software architecture wherein case features are associated with their comparators dynamically via run-time references to metadata. New instances of the framework are created simply by changing the metadata. No reprogramming is required. In this paper, we extend this concept to allow for dynamic selection also of feature-comparator combination rules. This makes the framework more adaptive by eliminating, the need to reprogram it for each such new rule. The overall effect is that the entire similarity measure is described by metata. The approach is illustrated via an example.				6th IASTED International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Control	AUG 23-25, 2004	Int Assoc Sci & Technol Dev; Tech Comm Control; Tech Comm Intelligent Syst & Control	Honolulu, HI	0	1	0	0	1		0-88986-436-5	WOS:000228556100046

In both training and testing, a Gabor filter is applied and 16 channels of features are extracted. Three classifiers (Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and k-Nearest-Neighbor (k-NN)) are used to identify different scripts at the word level (glyphs separated by white space). These three classifiers are applied to a variety of bilingual dictionaries and their performance is compared. Experimental results show the capability of Gabor filter to capture script features and the effectiveness of these three classifiers for script identification at the word level.

In this paper, we examine the classification performance of nonparametric classifiers for a CAD system of diffuse lung opacities in practical situations.				8th International Conference on Knowledge-Based Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems	SEP, 2004	Royal Soc New Zealand; IPENZ; New Zealand Trade & Enterprise; Telecom; Allied Telesyn; Positively Wellington Business	Wellington Inst Technol, Wellington, NEW ZEALAND	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	3-540-23318-0	WOS:000224585300084

In this paper a method for learning such a metric from training data is presented. This algorithm is a generalization of the so called Variable-Kernel Similarity Metric (VSM) Learning, originally proposed by Lowe and is therefore known as Generalized Variable-Kernel Similarity Metric (GVSM) learning. Experimental results show GVSM to be superior to VSM for extremely noisy or cross-correlated data.				10th International Workshop on Structural and Syntactic Pattern Recognition/5th International Conference on Statistical Techniques in Pattern Recognition	AUG 18-20, 2004	Inst Telecommun; Inst Super Tecn; Int Assoc Pattern Recognit; Fund Luso-Amer Desenvolvimento	Lisbon, PORTUGAL	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	3-540-22570-6	WOS:000223398900086

The resulting prototypes/metric combination minimizes a suitable estimation of the classification error probability. Good performance of this algorithm is assessed through experiments with a number of benchmark data sets and through a real two-class classification task which consists of detecting human faces in unrestricted-background pictures.				17th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)	AUG 23-26, 2004	Int Assoc Pattern Recognit; Univ Surrey; UniS; IEEE Comp Soc; HP Res Labs Bristol	British Machine Vis Assoc, Cambridge, ENGLAND	0	0	0	0	0	1051-4651	0-7695-2128-2	WOS:000223879500108

In this paper, PD signals are analyzed to localize defects in insulation systems. The task of automatic defect localization with respect to electrodes has a wide range of industrial applications. In fact, depending on the apparatus type., risk assessment is remarkably affected by defect location with respect to the electrodes. In this study.. various parameters are first extracted from PD distributions., and statistical analysis is performed to select the most significant parameters concerning localization. Then, the localization process is carried out through numerical classification. Three different classification methods are compared to find the best approach for this application. Comparing a k-nearest neighbor classifier, a probabilistic neural network and a support vector machine (SVM) based classifier, the best results are gained with SVM. although the former two are simpler to implement and easier to tune. SVM based classification has not been applied in PD analysis before this research.

In the literature, most similarity (dissimilarity) measures for categorical data consider the similarity of value pairs by considering whether or not these two values are identical. In these methods, the similarity (dissimilarity) of a non-identical value pair is simply considered 0 (1). In this paper, we introduce a dissimilarity measure for categorical data by imposing association relations between non-identical value pairs of an attribute based on their relations with other attributes. The key idea is to measure the similarity between two values of a categorical attribute by the similarities of the conditional probability distributions of other attributes conditioned on these two values. Experiments with a nearest neighbor algorithm demonstrate the merits of our proposal in real-life data sets.				8th Pacific/Asia Conference on Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining	MAY 26-28, 2004	NICIA; SAS; Univ Technol Sydney; Deakin Univ	Sydney, AUSTRALIA	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	3-540-22064-X	WOS:000221955100067

The essential gene selection process in microarray domains is performed by a sequential search engine and after used for the Bayesian Network model learning.

It is very simple, intuitive and accurate in a great variety of real-world applications. Despite its simplicity and effectiveness, practical use of this decision rule has been historically limited due to its high storage requirements and the computational costs involved. In order to overcome these drawbacks, it is possible either to employ fast search algorithms or to use a training set size reduction scheme.

It is like sele cting a subset of featur es for sequence data sets. The experimental results of the proposed method shows that the classification accuracy (CA) using the prototyp es generate d/used do not degrade much but the tr aining and testing time are reduc ed significantly. Thus the experimental results indicate that the similarity score need not b e calculated by considering the entire length of the sequence for achieving a good CA.

Some simple ensemble methods, such as Bagging, work well with unstable base algorithms, but fail with stable ones. The reason is that such methods achieve higher accuracy by reducing only the variance of the base algorithms. It does not touch the bias. Here, we propose a novel ensemble method, Mode Committee, intended to work for both stable and unstable base algorithms. It first derive a new algorithm, called mode competitor, from given base algorithm, with the help of k-modes clustering method and the local learning strategy. Randomness is injected into each mode competitor by the process of random seeding. The aim of deriving mode competitor is to reduce the bias with the possible increasing variance. Then, multiple mode competitors form a committee and vote on the decision of new example, with the aim to reduce the variance of mode competitors. Such an arithmetic framework has been materialized by two base algorithms, the unstable C4.5 and the stable naive Bayes. Extensive empirical results demonstrate this method's superiority, and further analysis by bias-variance decomposition reveals that it is due to the low-bias of mode competitors.				16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence	NOV 15-17, 2004	IEEE Comp Soc; Informat Technol Res Inst; Wright State Univ; Florida Atlantic Univ	Boca Raton, FL	0	0	0	0	0	1082-3409	0-7695-2236-X	WOS:000225597000082

Clinically early detection of Alzheimer's disease is helpful in taking care of the patients. The nuclear imaging method, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), is a useful tool in analyzing the cerebral blood flow. Most common regional abnormalities for Alzheimer's disease are symmetric or asymmetric bilateral temporal or parietal hypoperfusion, or frontal hypoperfusion. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) is employed to do pre-processing of SPECT volumes. Due to its effectiveness, easiness and fastness, SPM has been widely applied to the diagnosis and function research of brain diseases.The proposed system can provide a quantitatively automatic analysis of the SPECT volumes. The selection of three variables based on the statistical parametric t maps between Alzheimer's and normal volumes are proposed Then an optimal linear classifier is applied to discriminate between these two group of volumes. In statistical pattern recognition, the Bayes error the overlap among different class densities, is the smallest possible error in the current measurement space. Due to the effectiveness of the variable selection, the simple optimal linear classifier achieves a near-Bayes error ratio. The sensitivity and specificity of the proposed method are 88% and 90%, respectively. With the high sensitivity and specificity performance, the proposed automatic analysis of brain SPECT volumes can assist in the clinical practice of radiologists.				4TH IEEE Symposium on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BIBE 2004)	MAY 19-21, 2004	IEEE Comp Soc; IEEE Neural Networks Soc; Taichung Healthcare & Management Univ; Minist Educ; Natl Sci Council; Inst Informat Ind	Tai Chung, TAIWAN	0	0	0	0	0		0-7695-2173-8	WOS:000222238200025

Comparison to other linear combination based classifiers such as the nearest feature line (NFL) and the nearest feature plane (NFP), the proposed method takes much lower computation cost. Furthermore, the experimental results on the ORL face database have shown that the performance of both proposed methods are competitive to the NFL and NFP in face classification.

There are many methods' that deal with this type of problem. The data sets are sometimes in the binary form (real number) and represented by vectors of binary numbers (real numbers) although there are uncertainties in the data, e.g., data collected in management questionnaires. In this paper, we developed a linguistic K-nearest prototype algorithm with vectors of fuzzy numbers as inputs. This algorithm is based on the extension principle and the decomposition theorem. We apply this algorithm to linguistic vectors derived from a set of thirty-nine subjects answering questions about students' satisfaction with communication to their university.				12th IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems	MAY 25-28, 2003	IEEE; IEEE Neural Networks Soc	ST LOUIS, MO	0	0	0	0	0		0-7803-7810-5	WOS:000183448800136

In this paper, we analyze the theoretical properties of the Jensen-Renyi divergence which is defined between any arbitrary number of probability distributions. Using the theory of majorization, we derive its maximum value, and also some performance upper bounds in terms of the Bayes risk and the asymptotic error of the nearest neighbor classifier. To gain further insight into the robustness and the application of the Jensen-Renyi divergence measure in imaging, we provide substantial numerical experiments to show the power of this entopic measure in image registration and segmentation.				4th International Workshop on Energy Minimization Methods in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	JUL 07-09, 2003	Int Assoc Pattern Recognit; Inst Superior Tecn; Inst Telecommun	LISBON, PORTUGAL	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	3-540-40498-8	WOS:000185041700010

These diseases lead to important inflammatory symptoms resulting in an important functional impairment. In this paper we apply a topological mapping combined with a case based learning evaluation criterion to predict early arthritis. The first part presents a brief introduction to the problem and self-learning neural networks while the second part of this paper will apply this technique together with a case based learning evaluation criterion to diagnostic classification. Finally the paper shows that the Kohonen neural network achieves good performance that exceeds the results of other neural network approaches and decision trees. Copyright (C) 2003 IFAC.

B	Chang, F; Lin, CC; Lin, WH			IEEE					A two-stage classification method for vector pattern matching problems								2003 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS, VOLS 1-5, PROCEEDINGS							3022	3027					2003	2003	In this paper, we propose a new method to classify unknown objects into a large number of possible patterns (classes) and thereby solve vector-matching problems. The core of this method is a learning mechanism that reduces a huge amount of training samples into a highly condensed set of templates. When used in a testing process, these templates hold target patterns within the nearest K templates for almost all unknown objects, where K is a small number (2 or 3, for example). This learning mechanism also produces an extremely small set of confusing pairs, in opposition to all N(N-1)/2 possible pairs, where N is the total number of patterns. These pairs are further processed by a disambiguation procedure that improves the overall performance of the pattern classifier. This learning method thus suggests a two-stage online process for classifying unknown objects. The first stage reduces the number of possible candidates to a few candidates and the second stage identifies the target patterns out of these candidates.

We train the algorithms on both tasks individually and on the two tasks simultaneously. The parameters of both algorithms and the selection of features are optimized per task with iterative deepening, an efficient wrapper procedure that uses progressive sampling of training data. Results show a consistent significant advantage of MBL over CART, and also indicate that task combination can be done at the cost of little generalization score loss. Tests on cross-validated data and on held-out data yield F-scores of MBL on accent placement of 84 and 87, respectively, and on breaks of 88 and 91, respectively. Accent placement is shown to outperform an informed baseline rule; reliably predicting breaks other than those already indicated by intra-sentential punctuation, however, appears to be more challenging.				41st Annual Meeting of the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics	JUL 07-12, 2003	Assoc Computat Linguist; Microsoft; JUSTSYSTEM; NTT; OKI; Natl Inst Informat; Fuji Xerox; IBM Japan; CRL; Hokuto Syst; Fujitsu; Toshiba; NEC; Matsushita Elect; Hitachi; JAIST; Hiroshima City Univ; Kyoto Univ; Natl Inst Japanese Language; Tokushima Univ; Tottori Univ; NAIST; ATR	Sapporo, JAPAN	0	0	0	0	0		1-932432-09-4	WOS:000223097500062

This hyperplane is expressed as a function of a subset of the training vectors. These vectors are called support vectors. In this paper, we present a method of fuzzifying support vectors based off of the results of an SVM induction. We then propose a method of enhancing SVM induction using these fuzzy support vectors. We finish by presenting a computational example using the IRIS data set.				22nd International Conference of the North-American-Fuzzy-Information-Processing-Society (NAFIPS)	JUL 24-26, 2003	IEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc; IEEE; N Amer Fuzzy Informat Proc Soc	CHICAGO, IL	0	0	0	0	0		0-7803-7918-7	WOS:000185095000055

In the partially free word-order languages such as Korean and Japanese, a small number of rules dominate the performance due to their well-developed postpositions and endings. Thus, the proposed method is primarily based on the rules, and then the residual errors are corrected by adopting a memory-based machine learning method. Since the memory-based learning is an efficient method to handle exceptions in natural language processing, it is good at checking whether the estimates are exceptional cases of the rules and revising them. An evaluation of the method yields the improvement in F-score over the rules or various machine learning methods alone.				41st Annual Meeting of the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics	JUL 07-12, 2003	Assoc Computat Linguist; Microsoft; JUSTSYSTEM; NTT; OKI; Natl Inst Informat; Fuji Xerox; IBM Japan; CRL; Hokuto Syst; Fujitsu; Toshiba; NEC; Matsushita Elect; Hitachi; JAIST; Hiroshima City Univ; Kyoto Univ; Natl Inst Japanese Language; Tokushima Univ; Tottori Univ; NAIST; ATR	Sapporo, JAPAN	0	0	0	0	0		1-932432-09-4	WOS:000223097500063

Recent results in different robotics areas have demonstrated the potential of a number of techniques from the Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning domains, although very few work has been specifically addressed to online robots, where the object recognition is directly performed by the user. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using a neural network approach to object recognition in the context of online robots, and discuss the main advantages over the application of statistical learning methods. Some experiments with the UJI (Universitat Jaume I) online robot evaluate the performance of different neural network implementations, comparing it to that of some distance-based object recognition algorithms.

The adaptive update of the sample distribution, which tends to increase the weight of the misclassified examples, allows to improve the performance of any learning algorithm. However, its ability to avoid overfitting has been challenged when boosting is applied to noisy data. This situation is frequent with the modern databases, built thanks to new data acquisition technologies, such as the Web. The convergence speed of boosting is also penalized on such databases, where there is a large overlap of probability density functions of the classes to learn (large Bayesian error). In this article, we propose a slight modification of the weight update rule of the algorithm ADABOOST. We show that by exploiting an adaptive measure of a local entropy, computed from a neighborhood graph built on the examples, it is possible to identify not only the outliers but also the examples located in the Bayesian error region. Taking into account this information, we correct the weight of the examples to improve the boosting performances. A broad experimental study shows the interest of our new algorithm, called iADABOOST.				14th European Conference on Machine Learning	SEP 22-26, 2003	Croatian Minist Sci & Technol; Slovenian Minist Educ, Sci & Sports; Knowledge Discovery Network Excellence	CAVTAT, CROATIA	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	3-540-20121-1	WOS:000187061900032

In the conventional optimization method, several candidates are prepared, the error rate for them is found through experimentation, and the parameters which give the lowest recognition error rates are taken to be optimal values. However, in the conventional method, setting the candidate values so that they are certain to include optimal values is a common problem. In this paper, the authors evaluate from the standpoint of the optimalness of the solutions and computational burden the optimization methods (two-stage conventional method, response surface method, and energy function method) that address the problems of the conventional method.

From a syntactic treebank of spoken Dutch we extract instances of the attachment of prepositional phrases to either a governing verb or noun. Using cross-validated parameter and feature selection, we train two learning algorithms, IB1 and RIPPER, on making this distinction, based on unigram and bigram lexical features and a cooccurrence feature derived from WWW counts. We optimize the learning on noun attachment, since in a second stage we use the attachment decision. for blocking the incorrect placement of phrase boundaries before prepositional phrases attached to the preceding noun. On noun attachment, IB1 attains an F-score of 82; RIPPER an F-score of 78. When used as a filter for prosodic phrasing, using attachment decisions from IB1 yields the best improvement on precision (by six points to 71) on phrase boundary placement.				10th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (EACL 2003)	APR 12-17, 2003	Assoc Computat Linguist, European Chapter; Lingiist Syst BV; Xerox Res Ctr Europe; ATALA; European Language Resources Assoc	Budapest, HUNGARY	0	0	0	0	0		1-932432-00-0	WOS:000222995200019

In order to conquer these disadvantages of traditional quick k-nearest neighbor(k-NN) classification algorithm, this paper proposes a quick k-NN evidence classification algorithm-super-ball search evidence classification(ab.

The technique utilises the Generalised Shepard Nearest Neighbour (GSNN) algorithm to estimate nominal or real valued solutions in case bases with solution space metrics. An overview of GSNN and a generalised reduction technique, which subsumes some existing decremental methods, such as the Shrink algorithm, are presented. The reduction technique is given for case bases in terms of a measure of the importance of each case to the predictive power of the case base. A trial test is performed on two case bases of different kinds, with several metrics proposed in the solution space. The tests show that GSNN can out-perforin standard nearest neighbour methods on this set. Further test results show that a case-removal order proposed based on a GSNN error function can produce a sparse case base with good predictive power.				5th International Conference on Case-Bases Reasoning (ICCBR 2003)	JUN 23-26, 2003	Kaidara Software, Empolis & Norwegian; Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp & Informat Sci	TRONDHEIM, NORWAY	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	3-540-40433-3	WOS:000184854300049

As a result, the quality of the data set degrades and experiments and inferences derived from the data set become less reliable. In this paper we present an algorithm, called ANR (automatic noise reduction), as a filtering mechanism to identify and remove noisy data items whose classes have been mislabeled The underlying mechanism behind ANR is based on a framework of multi-layer artificial neural networks. ANR assigns each data item a soft class label in the form of a class probability vector, which is initialized to the original class label and can be modified during training. When the noise level is reasonably small (< 30%), the non-noisy data is dominant in determining the network architecture and its output, and thus a mechanism for correcting mislabeled data can be provided by aligning class probability vector with the network output. With a learning procedure for class probability vector based on its difference from the network output, the probability of a mislabeled class gradually becomes smaller while that of the correct class becomes larger, which eventually causes a correction of mislabeled data after sufficient training. After training, those data items whose classes have been relabeled are then treated as noisy data and removed from the data set. We evaluate the performance of the ANR based on 12 data sets drawn from the UCI data repository. The results show that ANR is capable of identifying a significant portion of noisy data. An average increase in accuracy of 24.5% can be achieved at a noise level of 25% by using ANR as a training data filter for a nearest neighbor classifier, as compared to the one without using ANR.

The distance between the input pattern and each of its K nearest neighbors is used for mass determination while the contextual information of the nearest neighbor in the training sample space is formulated by a fuzzy set in determining a fuzzy focal element. Therefore, pooling evidence provided by neighbors is realized by a fuzzy evidential reasoning, where feature selection is further considered through ranking and adaptive combination of neighbors. A fast implementation scheme of the fuzzy evidential reasoning is also developed. Experimental results of classifying multi-channel remote sensing images have shown that the proposed approach outperforms the K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) algorithm [1], the fuzzy K-nearest neighbor (F-KNN) algorithm [2], the evidence-theoretic Knearest neighbor (E-KNN) algorithm [3], and the fuzzy extended version of E-KNN (FE-KNN) [4], in terms of the classification accuracy and insensitivity to the number K of nearest neighbors.				3rd IEEE International Conference on Data Mining	NOV 19-22, 2003	IEEE Comp Soc TCCI; IEEE Comp Soc TCPAMI	MELBOURNE, FL	0	0	0	0	0		0-7695-1978-4	WOS:000188999400119

In previous research, we have presented a metric called relative feature importance (RFI) for measuring the non-parametric discriminatory power (NPDP) of features, RFI has been shown to correctly rank features for a variety of artificial data sets. In this work, we validate RFI on natural data, using several natural data sets. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.								0	0	0	0	0	0167-8655		WOS:000173992100004

A small scale experiment is conducted leading to the compilation of an evaluation corpus for the Greek language. Two models of sentence extraction are then described, along the lines of shallow linguistic analysis, feature combination and machine learning. Both models are based on term extraction and statistical filtering. After extracting the individual features of the text, we apply them to two neural networks that classify each sentence depending on its feature vector, the term weight being the feature with the best discriminant capacity. A three-layer feedforward network trained with the highly popular backpropagation algorithm and a competitive learning self-organizing reap characterized by the formation of a topographic map, both trained on a small manually annotated corpus of summaries, perform the sentence extraction task. Both methods could be used for rapid light information retrieval-oriented summarization.

B	Domeniconi, C; Gunopulos, D						Grossman, R; Han, J; Motwani, R; Kumar, V; Mannila, H		Efficient local flexible nearest neighbor classification								PROCEEDINGS OF THE SECOND SIAM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING	SIAM PROCEEDINGS SERIES						353	369					2002	2002	The nearest neighbor technique is a simple and appealing method to address classification problems. It relies on the assumption of locally constant class conditional probabilities. This assumption becomes invalid in high dimensions with a finite number of examples due to the curse of dimensionality. Severe bias can be introduced under these conditions when using the nearest neighbor rule. The employment of a local adaptive metric becomes crucial in order to keep class conditional probabilities close to uniform, and therefore to minimize the bias of estimates. We propose a technique that computes a locally flexible metric by means of Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The maximum margin boundary found by the SVM is used to determine the most discriminant direction over the query's neighborhood. Such direction provides a local weighting scheme for input features. We present experimental evidence, together with a formal justification, of classification performance improvement over the SVM algorithm alone and over a variety of adaptive learning schemes, by using both simulated and real data sets. Moreover, the proposed method has the important advantage of superior efficiency over the most competitive technique used in our experiments.				2nd SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM 02)	APR 11-13, 2002	SIAM	ARLINGTON, VA	0	0	0	0	0		0-89871-517-2	WOS:000177123500021	
B	Hullermeier, E			IEEE; IEEE					Exploiting similarity and experience in decision making								PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2002 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUZZY SYSTEMS, VOL 1 & 2							729	734					2002	2002	The idea of case-based decision making has recently been proposed as an alternative to expected utility theory. A case-based decision maker learns by storing already experienced decision problems, along with a rating of the results. Whenever a new problem needs to be solved, possible actions are assessed on the basis of experience from similar situations in which these actions have already been applied. In this paper, we consider case-based decision making within the context of instance-based learning, which is a special type of machine learning method. This consideration makes us suggest alternative case-based decision principles. These principles are motivated from a computational point of view and characterized axiomatically. Moreover, the possibility of applying case-based decision making in approximate reasoning is briefly touched on.

B	Inakoshi, H; Ando, T; Sato, A; Okamoto, S			IEEE					Discovery of emerging patterns from nearest neighbors								2002 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS, VOLS 1-4, PROCEEDINGS							1920	1925					2002	2002	In this paper, we propose a scalable classifier that uses jumping emerging patterns (JEPs), which are combinations of values that occur in one class. The original classifier, DeEPs, is an instance-based classifier that operates on all instances in real-time. It discovers maximal patterns that occur throughout the entire database and identifies JEPs by using these patterns. The necessary computational effort, though, is likely to increase when DeEPs is applied to a large database. Our proposed classifier operates on the nearest neighbors of a test instance. This reduction of instances improves scalability as the database volume increases. Moreover, our classifier imposes a restriction regarding JEPs discovery, so that it excludes patterns that cannot be identified as either correct JEPs or JEPs caused by the maximal patterns missing from nearest neighbors. These probably incorrect JEPs are specialized with additional items and participate in class determination. Our classifier performs significantly faster with these two enhancements, while it remains as accurate as the original classifier.

After a preliminary phase of supervised learning for similarity determination, we use the neural similarity measure to guide the k-NN rule. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that the similarity-based k-NN rule outperforms the Euclidean distance-based k-NN rule.

B	Oliveira, PM; Lobo, V; Barroso, V; Moura-Pires, F			IEEE; IEEE; IEEE					Detection and classification of underwater transients with data driven methods based on time-frequency distributions and non-parametric classifiers								OCEANS 2002 MTS/IEEE CONFERENCE & EXHIBITION, VOLS 1-4, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS							12	16					2002	2002	Due to the complexity of underwater transients and background interference, model based approaches to transient detection/classification are often not practical. This has motivated an interest for data-driven, model-free methods. One such method was presented in [2] and modified in [1], where it was applied to the detection of underwater transients. In this article, we will extend that approach, to allow its use in the more demanding environment of a brown water environment, where background noise is constituted by a multitude of different interferences, non-white, and highly non-stationary. Also, the assumption of linear separability amongst the transients and the background noise in the time-frequency or related domains will be discarded, leading to the use of an additional classifier stage. A technique to minimize the number of prototypes on this classifier will be presented. The developed methods are used to detect and classify real underwater transients, recorded off the Portuguese coast. Estimation of the overall error rate of the method is obtained using cross-validation with the available data set, showing that these methods can effectively be used in real environment situations.

We compare three different learning algorithms and select the best approach in terms of cost-performance ratio. The algorithms employ classic machine-learning techniques using a clustering approach. Experimental results show competing performance (95.1%) with the non-trainable recognizer (95.8%) previously developed, with obvious gains in flexibility and expandability. In addition, we study both their classification and learning performance with increasing number of examples per class.				4th International Workshop on Graphics Recognition	SEP 07-08, 2001	Int Assoc Pattern Recognit, TC 10; Queens Univ; Comp Sci & Engn Res Informat Ctr; Xero Fdn; Commun & Informat Technol Ontario	KINGSTON, CANADA	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	3-540-44066-6	WOS:000181394100007

One of the most well known such rules is the k-nearest-neighbor decision rule in which an unknown pattern is classified into the majority class among its k nearest neighbors in the training set. In the past fifty years many approaches have been proposed to improve the performance of this rule. More recently geometric methods have been found to be the best. Here we mention a variety of open problems of a computational geometric nature that arize in these methods. To provide some context and motivation for these open problems we briefly describe the methods and list some key references.				7th Japanese Conference on Discrete and Computational Geometry (JCDCG 2002)	DEC 06-09, 2002	Tokai Univ	TOKYO, JAPAN	0	0	0	0	0	0302-9743	3-540-20776-7	WOS:000188862800029

This tutor is an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) that operates on the WWW and aims at teaching non-native speakers the domain of the passive voice of the English language. It uses an innovative combination of stereotypes and the distance weighted k-nearest neighbor algorithm to initialize the model of a new student. In particular, the student is first assigned to a stereotype category concerning her/his knowledge level based on her/his performance on a preliminary test. The system then initializes all aspects of the student model using the distance weighted k-nearest neighbor algorithm among the students that belong to the same stereotype category with the new student. The basic idea of the algorithm is to weigh the contribution of each of the neighbor students according to their distance from the new student; the distance between students is calculated based on a similarity measure. In our case the similarity measure is estimated taking into account the students' mother tongue, how careful they are when solving exercises, as well as their knowledge of other languages. This information is acquired directly by the student at her/his first interaction with the system.				1st International IEEE Symposium on Intelligent Systems	SEP 10-12, 2002	IEEE Control Syst Soc; IEEE Instrumentat & Measurement Soc; IEEE Reg 8; Auckland Univ Technol, Knowledge Engn & Discovery Res Inst; IEE IM CS SMC Joint Chapter Bulgaria; IEEE Sect Bulgaria; ICT Dev Agcy; EUNITE	VARNA, BULGARIA	0	0	0	0	0		0-7803-7601-3	WOS:000180818600024

We compare the algorithm's performance on this parsing task with varying training set sizes (yielding learning curves) and different input representations. In particular we compare input consisting of words only, a variant that includes word form information for low-frequency words, gold-standard POS only, and combinations of these. The word-based shallow parser displays an apparently log-linear increase in performance, and surpasses the flatter POS-based curve at about 50,000 sentences of training data. The low-frequency variant performs even better, and the combinations is best. Comparative experiments with a real POS tagger produce lower results. We argue that we might not need an explicit intermediate POS-tagging step for parsing when a sufficient amount of training material is available and word form information is used for low-frequency words.				40th Annual Meeting of the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics	JUL 07-12, 2002	Assoc Computat Linguist; Assoc Computat Linguist, N Amer Chapter; Linguist Data Consortium; Microsoft Res; Sun; 240 Teragram; AT&T; BASIS Technol; BBN Technologies; LexisNexis; Cornell	Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA	0	0	0	0	0		1-55860-883-4	WOS:000223096700055

The algorithm is based on unique type of neural network specially developed to deal with large set of highly dimensional input data. An improvement of the algorithm is proposed by implementing various steps of input signal preprocessing, through the selection of parameters for analog filtering, and values for the data window and sampling frequency.

S	Wada, Y; Kasuga, H; Sumita, K						Kasturi, R; Laurendeau, D; Suen, C		An evolutionary approach for the generation of diversiform characters using a handwriting model								16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION, VOL III, PROCEEDINGS	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PATTERN RECOGNITION						131	134					2002	2002	In pattern recognition, a large number of diversiform characters is necessary to train / test a handwritten character recognition system. However it is not easy to collect a large number of natural samples. The artificial diversification of characters has been suggested as one means of collecting a variety of characters[1]. In this paper, we show that a handwriting model can be applied to the diversification of characters. The characters diversified by the model can be used as a database of character images for training / testing purposes. Wada & Kawato's handwriting model [2] is based on an optimal principle and the feature space of the characters includes sets of via-points extracted from actual handwritten characters. The handwriting model can be used to generate a variety of characters by changing via point information. In this paper we propose a method for generating a large variety of characters by changing via-point information based on a genetic algorithm and we show that the accuracy of a handwritten character recognition system that uses the characters generated by the proposed method as the training data, is equivalent to that of a system composed by using natural data.				16th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)	AUG 11-15, 2002	Int Assoc Pattern Recognit; Canadian Image Processing & Pattern Recognit Soc; Ctr Rech Informat Montreal; Matrox Imaging; Ind & Commerce Quebec; Rech, Sci & Technol Quebec; Microsoft Res; Bell; Lab Vis & Syst Numer; Comp Vis & Syst Lab; Ctr Pattern Recognit & Machine Intelligence; Ctr Etudes Reconnaissance Formes & Intelligence Artificielle; Scribers; Coreco Imaging; Precarn	QUEBEC CITY, CANADA	0	0	0	0	0	1051-4651	0-7695-1695-X	WOS:000177887100032	
B	Wang, PF; Mosley, C						Wang, L; Rajapakse, JC; Fukushima, K; Lee, SY; Yao, X		Associative memory neural networks for information retrieval of text word pairs								ICONIP'02: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING: COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE FOR THE E-AGE							2200	2203					2002	2002	Natural language information processing remains a challenge in Linguistics. Existing methods for retrieval of text often use stemming to retain common roots and base recall on these root words [1,4,5,9]. This requires the removal of stop words, e.g., numbers, symbols, high frequency bid low semantic weight words, thereby precluding phrases using these words [2]. In addition stemming is a morphologic approach that cannot readily process homonyms, synonyms and certain inflectional and derived forms [4.5]. Machine learning approaches assign words to categories [5,6,7,81, but application to a large corpus remains in debate [4]. For this study, we describe the application of the Cortronic theory and methods developed by Robert Hecht-Nielsen [2.3] to information retrieval of text word pairs. Hecht-Nielsen's theories build on associative memory artificial neural networks (AMNNs) introduced by Steinbuch [10] and extended by Willshaw et al. [ 11] especially in regards sparseness [2,3]. The AADNs are used to process a large corpus without excluding stop words, and retain the joint probability of mutual occurrences that allows rapid retrieval of word pairs. This AMNN approach includes three key components: representation of arbitrary objects (words), learning and knowledge accumulation based on measurement of co-occurrence and use of all the learned knowledge to produce (predict) the missing word in a phrase.				9th International Conference on Neural Information Processing	NOV 18-22, 2002	Asia Pacific Neural Network Assembly; Singapore Neurosci Assoc; SEAL & FSKD Conf Steering Comm; Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Elect & Electr Engn	SINGAPORE, SINGAPORE	0	0	0	0	0		981-04-7524-1	WOS:000182832400450
