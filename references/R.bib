Thus, bag-of-words representations of texts can be mapped into a modified vector space that is assumed to reflect semantic structure. In this contribution the authors describe thelsapackage for the statistical language and environment R and illustrate its proper use through examples from the areas of automated essay scoring and knowledge representation.},

	abstract = {Research programmes in the social sciences and elsewhere can be seen as 'set-ups' which combine inscription devices and thought styles. The history of inscription devices without consideration of changing and often discontinuous thought styles effectively takes the historical dimension out of the history of thought. Perhaps thought styles are actually more important than the techniques of inscription that arise from them. The social sciences have relied upon multiple modes of inscription, often using, adapting or extending those invented for other purposes, such as the census. But the strategic prioritisation and deployment of specific inscriptions in analysis and argument has inescapably been dependent on particular thought styles; of which by far the most significant over the course of the first half of the twentieth century was eugenics with its specific problem of 'population'. This paper describes the way that Alexander Carr-Saunders took up the problem of population within early attempts to develop sociology. We ask whether Carr-Saunders can be considered a 'precursor' of a sociologist. The history of British sociology takes different shapes 2013 as indeed does the very idea of a history of sociology 2013 depending on how one answers this question.},

It notes, in consistency with the Foucauldian approach, that material semiotics implies that knowledge traditions are performative, helping to create the realities that they describe.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:The} clustered heat map is the most popular means of visualizing genomic data. It compactly displays a large amount of data in an intuitive format that facilitates the detection of hidden structures and relations in the data. However, it is hampered by its use of cluster analysis which does not always respect the intrinsic relations in the data, often requiring non-standardized reordering of rows/columns to be performed post-clustering. This sometimes leads to uninformative and/or misleading conclusions. Often it is more informative to use dimension-reduction algorithms (such as Principal Component Analysis and Multi-Dimensional Scaling) which respect the topology inherent in the data. Yet, despite their proven utility in the analysis of biological data, they are not as widely used. This is at least partially due to the lack of user-friendly visualization methods with the visceral impact of the heat {map.RESULTS:NeatMap} is an R package designed to meet this need. {NeatMap} offers a variety of novel plots (in 2 and 3 dimensions) to be used in conjunction with these dimension-reduction techniques. Like the heat map, but unlike traditional displays of such results, it allows the entire dataset to be displayed while visualizing relations between elements. It also allows superimposition of cluster analysis results for mutual validation. {NeatMap} is shown to be more informative than the traditional heat map with the help of two well-known microarray {datasets.CONCLUSIONS:NeatMap} thus preserves many of the strengths of the clustered heat map while addressing some of its deficiencies. It is hoped that {NeatMap} will spur the adoption of non-clustering dimension-reduction algorithms.},

Typically we have available a large collection of possible covariates from which we hope to select a parsimonious set for the efficient prediction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression ({LARS)}, a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version of traditional forward selection methods. Three main properties are derived: (1) A simple modification of the {LARS} algorithm implements the Lasso, an attractive version of ordinary least squares that constrains the sum of the absolute regression coefficients; the {LARS} modification calculates all possible Lasso estimates for a given problem, using an order of magnitude less computer time than previous methods. (2) A different {LARS} modification efficiently implements Forward Stagewise linear regression, another promising new model selection method; this connection explains the similar numerical results previously observed for the Lasso and Stagewise, and helps us understand the properties of both methods, which are seen as constrained versions of the simpler {LARS} algorithm. (3) A simple approximation for the degrees of freedom of a {LARS} estimate is available, from which we derive a Cp estimate of prediction error; this allows a principled choice among the range of possible {LARS} estimates. {LARS} and its variants are computationally efficient: the paper describes a publicly available algorithm that requires only the same order of magnitude of computational effort as ordinary least squares applied to the full set of covariates.},

His attempt to use evolutionary principles of explanation to account for the development of literary forms is probed by considering its similarities to earlier evolutionary accounts of the development of design traits.

It is argued that their apparent differences need to be placed in a broader re-orientation of sociology away from its historical interface with the humanities and towards the natural sciences.

	abstract = {In his theory of social inequality and lifestyle groups, Bourdieu (1979) argued that lower classes exhibit a "taste of necessity". His main argument is that members of the lower classes are not able to sufficiently convert economic capital into cultural or social capital and vice versa, i.e. to successfully increase their capital volume. This hypothesis has neither been operationalized nor tested so far. We will give an explicit formulation of Bourdieu's theory and develop a test, using indicators derived from Bourdieu's work Distinction. We then apply our model to data from lower class members living in distressed neighborhoods in Cologne, Germany.
Groups belonging to the lower classes are located in a "social space", with dimensions to be interpreted as "capital volume" and "composition of cultural and economic capital". We show that members of the lower classes cannot sufficiently increase their capital volume since they cannot efficiently convert "cultural capital" into "economic capital" and vice versa, a fact that supports Bourdieu's assumption of a "taste of necessity".},

are the software packages Weka and R which have emerged from the machine learning and statistics communities, respectively. To make the different sets of tools
from both environments available in a single unified system, an R package {RWeka} is suggested which interfaces Weka’s functionality to R. With only a thin layer of (mostly R) code, a set of general interface generators is provided which can set up interface functions with the usual {“R} look and feel”, re-using Weka’s standardized interface of learner classes (including classifiers, clusterers, associators, filters, loaders, savers, and
stemmers) with associated methods.},

	abstract = {Topic models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation ({LDA)}, can be useful tools for the statistical analysis of document collections and other discrete data. The {LDA} model assumes that the words of each document arise from a mixture of topics, each of which is a distribution over the vocabulary. A limitation of {LDA} is the inability to model topic correlation even though, for example, a document about genetics is more likely to also be about disease than X-ray astronomy. This limitation stems from the use of the Dirichlet distribution to model the variability among the topic proportions. In this paper we develop the correlated topic model ({CTM)}, where the topic proportions exhibit correlation via the logistic normal distribution [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 44 (1982) 139–177]. We derive a fast variational inference algorithm for approximate posterior inference in this model, which is complicated by the fact that the logistic normal is not conjugate to the multinomial. We apply the {CTM} to the articles from Science published from 1990–1999, a data set that comprises {57M} words. The {CTM} gives a better fit of the data than {LDA}, and we demonstrate its use as an exploratory tool of large document collections.},

Examples of synthetic biology use by biotechnology companies illustrate the potential to substantially reduce research and development time and to increase speed to market. Improvements in the speed and cost of {DNA} synthesis are enabling scientists to design modified bacterial chromosomes that can be used in the production of renewable chemicals, biofuels, bioproducts, renewable specialty chemicals, pharmaceutical intermediates, fine chemicals, food ingredients, and health care products.

	abstract = {Engineered biological systems that integrate multi-input sensing, sophisticated information processing, and precisely regulated actuation in living cells could be useful in a variety of applications. For example, anticancer therapies could be engineered to detect and respond to complex cellular conditions in individual cells with high specificity. Here, we show a scalable transcriptional/posttranscriptional synthetic regulatory circuit—a cell-type “classifier”—that senses expression levels of a customizable set of endogenous {microRNAs} and triggers a cellular response only if the expression levels match a predetermined profile of interest. We demonstrate that a {HeLa} cancer cell classifier selectively identifies {HeLa} cells and triggers apoptosis without affecting non-{HeLa} cell types. This approach also provides a general platform for programmed responses to other complex cell states.},

Molecular dissection and mathematical modeling of biological oscillators have progressed quite far, but quantitative insights on the entrainment of clocks are relatively sparse. We simultaneously tracked the phases of hundreds of synthetic genetic oscillators relative to a common external stimulus to map the entrainment regions predicted by a detailed model of the clock. Synthetic oscillators were frequency-locked in wide intervals of the external period and showed higher-order resonance. Computational simulations indicated that natural oscillators may contain a positive-feedback loop to robustly adapt to environmental cycles.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the proximity of authors to those they cite using degrees of separation in a co-author network, essentially using collaboration networks to expand on the notion of self-citations. While the proportion of direct self-citations (including co-authors of both citing and cited papers) is relatively constant in time and across specialties in the natural sciences (10\% of citations) and the social sciences (20\%), the same cannot be said for citations to authors who are members of the co-author network. Differences between fields and trends over time lie not only in the degree of co-authorship which defines the large-scale topology of the collaboration network, but also in the referencing practices within a given discipline, computed by defining a propensity to cite at a given distance within the collaboration network. Overall, there is little tendency to cite those nearby in the collaboration network, excluding direct self-citations. By analyzing these social references, we characterize the social capital of local collaboration networks in terms of the knowledge production within scientific fields. These results have implications for the long-standing debate over biases common to most types of citation analysis, and for understanding citation practices across scientific disciplines over the past 50 years. In addition, our findings have important practical implications for the availability of 'arm's length' expert reviewers of grant applications and manuscripts.},

	abstract = {This magnificent book is the first comprehensive history of statistics from its beginnings around 1700 to its emergence as a distinct and mature discipline around {1900.Stephen} M. Stigler shows how statistics arose from the interplay of mathematical concepts and the needs of several applied sciences including astronomy, geodesy, experimental psychology, genetics, and sociology. He addresses many intriguing questions: How did scientists learn to combine measurements made under different conditions? And how were they led to use probability theory to measure the accuracy of the result? Why were statistical methods used successfully in astronomy long before they began to play a significant role in the social sciences? How could the introduction of least squares predate the discovery of regression by more than eighty years? On what grounds can the major works of men such as Bernoulli, De Moivre, Bayes, Quetelet, and Lexis be considered partial failures, while those of Laplace, Galton, Edgeworth, Pearson, and Yule are counted as successes? How did Galton's probability machine (the quincunx) provide him with the key to the major advance of the last half of the nineteenth {century?Stigler's} emphasis is upon how, when, and where the methods of probability theory were developed for measuring uncertainty in experimental and observational science, for reducing uncertainty, and as a conceptual framework for quantative studies in the social sciences. He describes with care the scientific context in which the different methods evolved and identifies the problems (conceptual or mathematical) that retarded the growth of mathematical statistics and the conceptual developments that permitted major {breakthroughs.Statisticians}, historians of science, and social and behavioral scientists will gain from this book a deeper understanding of the use of statistical methods and a better grasp of the promise and limitations of such techniques. The product of ten years of research, The History of Statistics will appeal to all who are interested in the humanistic study of science.},
