# Markets in algorithms

* methods of accompanying algorithms in obscure settings -- open data and closed models
* news analytics and sentiment analysis as key features of connection between media and markets
	* news analytics services -- RavenBank; RecordedFuture;
	* social media feeds/API - twitter, RSS, web-crawling, newswires, etc
* what difference do algorithms make? the case of machine learning
	* compare supervised & unsupervised
	* compare discriminative vs generative
	* compare parametric vs non-parametric
	* compare classification and regression
* what difference do graphics make?
	* shifting dimensionality
	* shifting practice of reading
	* association in data

- Perdido station:  the slake-moths,  the city in summer, the people and their dreams, dream shit, the weaver, the analytical engines
- the market or the public place, with its flow of people as a good model for the algorithms
