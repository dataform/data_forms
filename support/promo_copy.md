Machine Learners Archaeology of a Data Practice
Adrian Mackenzie

Machine learning---programming computers to learn from data---has spread across scientific disciplines, media, entertainment, and government. It is used in, among other areas, medical research, autonomous vehicles, credit transaction processing, computer gaming, recommendation systems, finance, surveillance, and robotics. Machine learning devices (sometimes understood as scientific models, sometimes as operational algorithms) anchor the field of data science. They have also become mundane mechanisms deeply embedded in a variety of systems and gadgets. In contexts from the everyday to the esoteric, machine learning is said to transform the nature of knowledge. In this book, Adrian Mackenzie investigates whether machine learning also transforms the practice of critical thinking.

Mackenzie focuses on machine learners---either humans and machines or human-machine relations---situated among settings, data, and devices. The settings range from fMRI to Facebook; the data anything from cat images to DNA sequences; the devices include neural networks, support vector machines, and decision trees. He examines specific learning algorithms---writing code and writing about code---and develops an archaeology of operations that, following Foucault, views machine learning as a form of knowledge production and a strategy of power.

Mackenzie counters the fears of some in the humanities by offering an account of machine learning in which a feeling of agency can take root. His archaeology of the operational formation of machine learning does not unearth the footprint of a strategic monolith but reveals the local relations of force that feed into the generalization and plurality of the field.

one-liner: If machine learning transforms the nature of knowledge, does it also transform the nature of critical thought?
