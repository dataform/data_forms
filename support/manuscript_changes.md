While it might not look it at first glance, I've done a lot of work on the manuscript in response to the readers reports. A couple of comments in the reports particularly motivated me: 
1. the suggestion that there was not much for the 'critical theory crowd' in the book
2. the judgement that the book would only have a readership amongst computers scientists

I guess they are flipsides of the same coin. Naturally, I wasn't happy with either. There were also comments about the lack of summaries, or overviews. 
The book deals with them by now developing a much more explicit and direct critical theoretical framework centred on the concept of the operation, and how machine learning, classification and prediction challenge prevailing conceptions of the operation as seen in critical theory of algorithms and data. A key emphasis in this revision rests on diagrams and diagrammatic processes. Hence the many figures, tables and equations in the text. 

Throughout the re-writing, I've strived to highlight how the book experiments with machine learning practice as part of transforming critical thought. I can seek that it was hard work for two of the readers of the first draft to get this, partly because I eschewed much auto-ethnographic description of it. They saw the book as a textbook, and not as an experiment in the transformation of critical thought amidst predictive practices. This is definitely the other hook of the book: in what ways could the intensified operational processes of machine learning become not just objects of critical research but also inform the practice of critical thinking?  

Some practical changes to help readers navigate -- some new diagrams graph elements of the archaeology; a glossary helps with terminology -- both technical and critical; summaries and overviews of chapters (see especially Conclusion).
