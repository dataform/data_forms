\newglossaryentry{archaeology}{name={archaeology}, description={Michel Foucault defines archaeology as a description that explores the production of statements at the level of knowledge practices (\textit{savoir}). It emphasizes the irregularities and discontinuities in knowledge practices as well as the derivations of operations and functions}}

\newglossaryentry{cross-validate}{name={cross-validate}, description={is an operation that validates a model against a part of the data in order to gauge how well predictions generalize to fresh or hitherto unseen data. Many rounds of cross-validation may be used in training models when data is limited.}}
\newglossaryentry{data strain}{name={data strain}, description={borrows from A.N. Whitehead's notion of strain, which refers to implicit forces or tensions in bodies of data that relate to the feeling of geometrically straight or flat loci}}
\newglossaryentry{decision boundary}{name={decision boundary}, description={is a  boundary or surface drawn in  vector space by a machine learning classifier to differentiate or separate and hence classify cases}}
\newglossaryentry{deep learning}{name={deep learning}, description={a neural network comprising many layers commonly used for image recognition}}
\newglossaryentry{diagram}{name={diagram}, description={is a form of abstraction concerned with functioning and operations.  In Gilles Deleuze's reading of Michel Foucault, diagrams display relations of force and also produce new kinds of reality and models of truth (Deleuze,1994)}}
\newglossaryentry{discourse}{name={discourse}, description={For Michel Foucault, a discourse holds together a group of statements generated by an enunciative function, which defines their conditions of existence}}
\newglossaryentry{enunciative function}{name={enunciative function}, description={For Michel Foucault, the specific relation of a statements to themselves, the relation to a subject, the correlate domain and their material existence in the form of reuses, replications and transcription together generate statements. In this book, the many predictions, inferences, plots, tabulations, numbers, scores, probabilities, classifications, software libraries and devices of machine learning comprise its enunciative function }}
\newglossaryentry{enunciative modality}{name={enunciative modality}, description={For Michel Foucault, the sites, subject positions, forms of observing, describing, teaching, perceiving associated with statements}}
\newglossaryentry{feature}{name={feature}, description={Also known in machine learning as variable, measurement, observation or attribute, a feature fills one dimension in the vector space inhabited by data }}
\newglossaryentry{function}{name={function}, description={map between two different sets of numbers. In machine learning, functions play very diverse roles, sometimes transforming data to generate feature or vector spaces, sometimes measuring cost or loss for particular models, and sometimes expressing forms such as curves and surfaces that transform data. Across these different usages and domains, the operation of mapping or relation between sets of values such as $X$ and $Y$ can be seen}}
\newglossaryentry{generative model}{name={generative model}, description={uses probability distributions to model the process that generated the data, thus allowing the model to generate or simulate samples from the data}}
\newglossaryentry{machine learner}{name={machine learner}, description={refers to both humans and machines involved in learning from data together}}
\newglossaryentry{Naive Bayes}{name={Na\"{\i}ve Bayes}, description={is a classifier that calculates the probability of an instance belonging to each class, and then assigns the instance to the most probable class}}
\newglossaryentry{operational formation}{name={operational formation}, description={is a variation on Michel Foucault's discursive formation that highlights the collective human-machine regularities of power-knowledge. While operation and operational fields are intrinsic to Foucault's account of discursive practice, they are somewhat overshadowed by the figures of the document, the utterance, and the proposition}}
\newglossaryentry{partial derivative}{name={partial derivative}, description={is an operator from differential calculus that expresses the rate of change of one variable with respect to another}}
\newglossaryentry{partial observer}{name={partial observer}, description={in Gilles Deleuze and FÃ©lix Guattari's concept of what a mathematical function does in science (Deleuze,1994)}}
\newglossaryentry{perceptron}{name={perceptron}, description={is a machine learner developed in the 1950s by Frank Rosenblatt. It is modelled on a neurone that learns to classify the input data or what it 'perceives' by varying parameters or weights on the  sum of its inputs to produce values of either `1` or 0'}}
\newglossaryentry{positivity}{name={positivity}, description={Michel Foucault's term in \textit{Archaeology of Knowledge} to describe the specific forms of accumulation of a group of statements in a discursive formation}}
\newglossaryentry{referential}{name={referential}, description={: for Michel Foucault, the referential of a statement is not the referent (the facts, things, realities or beings designated) but the place, condition, field of emergence or principle of differentiation for the entities named, described or designated in the statement. The referentials for machine learning include various hyperobjects such as genomes, social media, epidemics, markets and economies. Such referentials encompass many named entities. In this book, referential expands to include collective hyperobjects with their pre-individual reserves, and potentials for individuation}}
\newglossaryentry{regularization}{name={regularization}, description={ operates on the referentials of machine learning to target subtle, diffuse distributions of difference in order to classify or estimate their effects}}
\newglossaryentry{statement}{name={statement}, description={Michel Foucault's term for the product of an enunciative function that operationally relates a number of elements to a field of objects, establishing subject positions associated with them, and configuring a domain of coordination in which these elements can be invoked, used, and repeated. Statements take many forms including utterances, graphs, equations and numbers (Foucault,82)}}
\newglossaryentry{sum}{name={\ensuremath{\sum}}, description={is an operator that sums together all the terms to the right of the symbol}}
\newglossaryentry{variance}{name={variance}, description={of a model refers to its dependence on the particular data it is trained on}}

\newglossaryentry{vector}{name={vector}, description={ Three senses of the term are relevant: 1. A vector as an element of vector space; 2. A data structure in programming languages such as \texttt{R} -- a one dimensional array of elements; 3. A feeling in the sense used by A.N. Whitehead to describe the transfer from 'there' to 'here'}}
