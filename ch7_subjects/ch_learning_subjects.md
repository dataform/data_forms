\chapter{Propagating subject positions}
\label{ch:subjects}




> If a proposition, a sentence, a group of signs can be called 'statement,' it is not therefore because, one day, someone happened to speak them or put them into some concrete form of writing; it is because the position of the subject can be assigned [@Foucault_1972, 95] \index{statement!position of subject}

Who is the subject of machine learning? \index{machine learning!subject positions in}  In early 2002, while carrying out an ethnographic study of 'extreme programming,' a software development methodology popular at that time [@Mackenzie_2004], I spent several months visiting a company in Manchester developing software for call centres. The software was to manage 'knowledge' in call centres such that any query from a caller could be readily answered by staff who would query a knowledge management system to find answers to the query. \index{knowledge!management of}  This system was marketed on the promise of machine learning. It relied on an artificial neural network that learned to match queries and responses over time. \index{machine learner!neural net} A taciturn neural network expert, Vlad, sat in a different part of the room from the developers working on the databases and the web interfaces. Vlad's work on the neural network was at the core of the knowledge management system yet outside the orbit of the software development team and its agile software development processes. The rest of the team  generally regarded Vlad and the neural net as an esoteric,  temperamental yet powerful component, a hidden node we might say, of the knowledge management system.\index{machine learner!neural net} 

As we have seen with `kittydar` \index{machine learner!\texttt{kittydar}}, the position of machine learners is changing. They are no longer exotic or specialized, but banal or occasionally spectacular. Hilary Mason, who was Chief Scientist at bitly.com (an online service that shortens URLs), outlined an everyday  machine learning subject position at a London conference in 2012 called 'Bacon: Things Developers Love': \index{Mason, Hilary}

>You have all of these things that are different – engineering, infrastructure, mathematics and computer science, curiosity and an understanding of human behaviour – that is something that usually falls under the social sciences. At the intersection of all these things are wonderful people. But we're starting to develop something new, and that is - not that all of these things have not been done for a very long time - but we are only just now building systems where people, individual people, have all of these tools in one package, in one mind. (Hilary Mason, Chief Scientist, bitly.com) [@Bacon_2012] 

These 'things that are different,'  what I have been calling an operational formation,  assign subject positions.  In what ways does machine learning assign subject positions? In front of an audience of several hundred software developers, Mason describes shifts in the work of programming associated with the growth of large amounts of data associated with 'human behaviour.' At the centre of this shift stand 'wonderful people' who combine practices and knowledges of communication infrastructure, technology, statistics, and 'human behaviour' through curiosity and technical skills.  Mason was, in effect, telling her audience of software developers who they could  become in relation to expansive changes occurring around and in their work. \index{programming!work!transformation of}  The title of her talk was 'machine learning for hackers', and her audience were those hackers or programmers whose coding and programming attention may have been previously trained on web interfaces or database queries, but was now drawn towards machine learning. A change in programming practice and a shift towards machine learning was, she implied,  the key to programmers becoming the wonderful people, agents of their own time, capable of doing what is only now just possible because it is all together in 'one package, one mind.'

The  concatenation of 'one package, one mind' does not definitively allocate agency to people or things. (A 'package' after all is another name for a library of code.)  Mason adumbrates the outline of a subject position located  at the intersection of network infrastructure, mathematics and human behaviour.[^7.1] Mason, herself one of _Fortune_ magazines 'Top 40 under 40' business leaders to watch [@CNN_2011] and also featured in _Glamour_, a teenage fashion magazine [@Mason_2012], might personify such a 'wonderful person.' \index{Mason, Hilary} She is not a lone example. In mid-2016 Google announced a comprehensive program to re-train its software developers as machine learners [@Levy_2016].[^7.2] 

'It is the privileged machine in this context that creates its marginalized human others' writes Lucy Suchman in her account of  the encounters that 'effect "persons" and "machines" as distinct entities' [@Suchman_2006, 269] \index{Suchman, Lucy!human-machine difference}. \index{differences!human-machine}  While Mason and other relatively well-known human machine learners are not exactly marginalized (just the opposite, they achieve minor celebrity status in some cases), Suchman recommends 'recognition of the particularities of bodies and artifacts, of the cultural-historical practices through which human-machine differences are (re-)iteratively drawn, and of the possibilities for and politics of redistribution across the human machine boundary' (285). The intersections that machine learners currently occupy are heavily re-distributional. In almost every instance, machine learners claim to do something that humans alone, no matter how expert, could not. Does the re-distribution of engineering, mathematics, curiosity, infrastructure and 'something that usually falls under the social sciences' (but perhaps no longer does so?) both energise subjects ('its a pretty exciting time to be in any of these things') and assign them a marginal albeit still pivotal position in relation to privileged machines?

Machine learner subject positions are the topic of this chapter. I focus on artificial neural networks, or neural nets, in their various forms ranging from the multilayer perceptron (MLP) to the convolutional neural nets (CNN), recurrent neural nets (RNN) and deep belief networks of many recent deep learning projects (particularly in machine learning  competitions, as discussed below [@Dahl_2013]). \index{neural net|see{machine learner!neural net}} in exploring the re-drawing of subject-machine positions.  \index{diagram!machine learner as} Neural nets propagate between infrastructures, engineering and human behaviour (as Mason puts it), re-drawing human-machine differences, sometimes making it hard to seen what subject position they entail, where subjects are located or what they say, see and do. 

Like other machine learners, neural nets re-draw human-machine differences. Geoffrey Hinton, Simon Osindero and Yee-Why Teh \index{Hinton, Geoffrey} writing in _Neural Computation_ in 2006 described a 'fast learning algorithm for deep belief nets' [@Hinton_2006a]. Their description, whilst mostly couched in terms of conditional distributions, model parameters, and error rates,  also contains a section entitled 'Looking into the Mind of a Neural Network' (1545-1546). In that section, they describe how they used their deep belief network to _generate_ rather than classify images.[^7.01] In the process they were able to see what the 'associative memory has in mind' (1545). The term 'mind,' they comment, 'is not intended to be metaphorical' (1546) because the neural net in question has a distributed memory of the digits it has seen. Put slightly more formally, 'the network has a full generative model, so it is easy to look into its mind - we simply generate an image from its high-level representations' (1529).  \index{model!generative} 'Looking,' as often the case in machine learning, takes the form of diagramming a pattern, partition or strain in the data. 

The substitution of 'mind' and model reproduces many aspects of the figure  of artificial intelligence (which has typically relied on rule-based or symbolic reasoning), but the appearance of 'mind' in the form of a generative model (see chapter \ref{ch:probability}) suggests a rather different subject position. Archaeologically, the description of subject positions entails more than giving voice the existential threat of artificial intelligence.\index{archaeology!subject positions}. It first of all entails multiple positions linked to different groupings and statements in the operational formation.  As I will suggest, neural nets are particularly interesting because they re-draw human-machine boundaries through a combination of feeding-forward of potentials and propagating backwards of differences specifically concerned with images. Similarly, the practice of machine learning shifts  subject positions in a backward and forward movement. It  propagates potentialising optimism even as it undercuts the very differences that give rise to that optimism.

\end{table}

Almost every machine learning class, textbook, demonstration, and in recent years, machine learning competitions at some point turns to neural nets.\index{machine learner!neural net!popularity of}  Neural nets  display, however, some instability in the research literature. Table \ref{tab:disc_tech} shows the most frequent keywords for technical publications across the three main disciplinary domains inhabited by machine learners. While neural nets rank very high in computer science and engineering disciplines (appearing just after support vector machines), they do not appear in the statistics literature until 33 in the rankings. The prominence of neural nets on the engineering side of machine learning suggests a  specific enunciative mapping. \index{enunciative function!of neural net} 

Neural nets are often described from a deeply split perspective.  At some moments, the description  turns towards human subjects, or at least, the brains of human subjects. At other other moments, neural nets turn towards the vectorisation of data. \index{vectorisation} Neural nets constantly oscillate between brain and information infrastructure.  In some ways, they renew long-standing cybernetic hopes of bring brains and computation together in  models of computational intelligence and agency [@Hayles_1999]. \index{machine learner!neural net!cybernetics in}   Although they stem from a biological inspiration (dating at least back to the work by  McCulloch and Pitts in the 1940s [@Halpern_2015; @Wilson_2010]\index{Pitts, Walter}), they gain traction first in the 1980s and then again from mid-2000s onwards, as ways of dealing with changing computational infrastructures, and the difficulties of capitalising on infrastructure that is powerful but hard to control. In the course of fifty years, their serial re-invention -- from perceptron via neural net to deep belief net -- triply re-distributes subject positions amidst infrastructural re-configurations and vectorisation. \index{infrastructure!reconfiguration of} \index{vectorisation!of infrastructure}

For instance, writing in the 1980s,  David Ackley, Geoffrey Hinton (an important figure in the inception of neural nets over several decades), \index{Hinton, Geoffrey!on network infrastructure}  and Terrence Sejnowski link neuroscience and semiconductors: \index{Hinton, Geoffrey}

> Evidence about the architecture of the brain and the potential of the new VLSI technology have led to a resurgence of interest in “connectionist” systems ...  that store their long-term knowledge as the strengths of the connections between simple neuron-like processing elements. These networks are clearly suited to tasks like vision that can be performed efficiently in parallel networks which have physical connections in just the places where processes need to communicate. ... The more difficult problem is to discover parallel organizations that do not require so much problem-dependent information to be built into the architecture of the network [@Ackley_1985, 147-148].

Alignments and diagrammatic overlaps between brain and 'new VSLI [Very Large Scale Integrated] technology' -- semiconductor chips -- architectures sought to reproduce the plasticity of neuronal networks in the parallel distributed processing enabled by very densely packed semiconductor circuits. \index{diagram!overlay} The problem here was how to organize these connections without hardwiring domain specificity into 'the architecture of the network.' How could the architectures adapt to the problem in hand?

We saw in chapter \ref{ch:diagram} that the psychologist Frank Rosenblatt's perceptron [@Rosenblatt_1958] first implemented McCulloch and Pitts' cybernetic vision of neurones as models of computation [@Edwards_1996] \index{machine learner!perceptron}. \index{Rosenblatt, Frank}  While the computer science research on the perceptron wilted under  criticism from artificial intelligence experts such as Marvin Minsky (Minsky famously showed that a perceptron cannot learn the logical exclusive OR or `XOR` function; [@Minsky_1969]), \index{Minsky, Marvin!criticism of perceptron}  cognitive psychologists such as David Rumelhart, Geoffrey Hinton and Ronald Williams persisted with perceptrons, seeking to generalize their operations by connecting them together in networks (also known as multilayer perceptrons). In the mid-1980s, they developed the back-propagation algorithm \index{algorithm!back-propagation} [@Rumelhart_1985; @Hinton_1989], a way of adjusting the connections -- known as weights or parameters -- \index{parameters!weights!neural net }  between nodes (neurones) in the network in response to features in the data (see Figure \ref{fig:rumelhart1985}).

The back-propagation algorithm directly addressed the problem of learning to modify network organization without reliance on problem-dependent architectures, and in without having to program them in.   \index{programmability!problem of!neural net as solution to} Effectively, it constructs an  architecture of generalization. While cognition, and the idea that machines would be cognitive (rather than say, mechanical, calculative, or rule-based) mesmerised research work in artificial intelligence for several decades, the development of the back-propagation algorithm as a way for a set of connected computational nodes to learn came with explicit  infrastructural resonances. 

The resonances between computational architectures and human cognition (centred on vision)  became much more palpable from around 2006 when 'deep belief nets' appeared as a way of training many-layered neural nets implemented on much large computational platforms [@Hinton_2006a]. These resonances continue to echo today and indeed attract much attention.[^7.005] Like the advent of VSLI in the early 1980s, the vast concentrations of processing units in contemporary data centres (hundreds of thousands of cores as we saw in the case of Google Compute in the previous chapter \ref{ch:genome}) and  in the graphics cards \index{hardware!graphics cards} developed for high-end gaming  and video rendering (GPUs for PC gaming now typically have a thousand and sometimes several thousand cores) pose the problem of organizing infrastructure so that processes can communicate with each other. Machine learners have become just as important as loose or mutable infrastructural orders as epistemic instruments.

\end{figure}

Oscillating between cognition and infrastructures, between people and machines, neural nets suggest a way of thinking not only about how 'long-term knowledge' takes shape today, but about subject positions associated with machine learning. \index{subject position!knowledge in} \index{subject position!infrastructures of}  As infrastructural reorganization takes place around learning, and around the production of statements by machine learners, both human and non-human machine learners are assigned new positions. These positions are sometimes hierarchical and sometimes dispersed.  The machine learner subject position is a highly relational one rather than a single concentrated form of expertise (as we might find in a clinical oncologist, biostatistician or geologist). Because machine learners vectorize, optimize, probabilise, differentiate and refer, what counts as agency, skill, action, experience and learning shifts constantly. It is intimately bound and connected to transforms in infrastructure, variations in referentiality (such as we have seen in the construction of the vector space), and competing forms of accumulation or positivity. As Suchman suggests, examining privileged machines such as neural nets is a way to pay attention to the dispersed and somewhat disconnected sites from which subjects program, observe, design and respond to machine learners.

# Competitive positioning

How do neural nets come to oscillate between different subject positions?  The ranking of keywords in table \ref{tab:tech_disc} suggests that machine learning as an operational knowledge formation  attributes a privileged and constitutive function to neural nets. Neural nets concurrently spread into many difference disciplines: cognitive science, computer science, linguistics, adaptive control engineering, psychology, finance, operations research, etc., and particularly statistics and computer science during the 1980-1990s. This  dendritic growth did not just popularise machine learning. It brought engineering and statistics together more strongly. Ethem Alpaydin, a computer scientist, writes: \index{Alpaydin, Ethem!spread of neural nets}

>Perhaps the most important contribution of research on neural networks is this synergy that bridged various disciplines, especially statistics and engineering. It is thanks to this that the field of machine learning is now well established [@Alpaydin_2010, 274]. 

The forms of this field-making bridging are various.[^7.0010]   The primary meeting point of different disciplines has perhaps been the machine learning competitions of the 1990s that pitted neural nets against other machine learners such as support vector machine.   Many of these competitions focused on vision-related problems such as recognising   handwritten numerals. The handwritten digits used in these competitions, particularly the Neural Information Processing System workshops and KDD Cup (Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining) [@KDD_2013], all come from the `mnist` dataset  and during the 1990s, much effort focused on crafting neural nets to recognise these 60,000 or so handwritten digits.

_Elements of Statistical Learning_ devotes a lengthy section to the analysis of image recognition competitions that began in the early 1990s and continue today. Like Alpaydin, it affirms the coordinating effect of these competitions on the development of machine learning:

>This problem captured the attention of the machine learning and neural network community for many years, and has remained a benchmark problem in the field [@Hastie_2009, 404].

As Hastie and co-authors observe, 'at this point the digit recognition datasets became test beds for every new learning procedure, and researchers worked hard to drive down the error rates' [@Hastie_2009, 408-409]. such as zipcodes on envelopes (the set of handwritten digits we have already seen in chapter \ref{ch:pattern}, the `mnist` datasets [@LeCun_2012]). \index{dataset!\texttt{mnist}} \index{machine learning!competitions} The many competitions focused on the `mnist` dataset are, I suggest, a form of demonstration and testing of machines and people that propagate machine-human differences in machine learning. \index{data!images} 

Although they brought statistics and computer science closer, neural networks have had a somewhat problematic position in machine learning. Even in relation to the paradigmatic handwritten digit recognition problem, neural nets struggled to gain purchase precisely because a human subject position remained intimately interwoven into their operation.  On the one hand, their analogies and figurations as sophisticated neuronal-style models suggested cognitive capacities surpassing the more geometrical, algebraic and statistically grounded machine learners such as linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, or decision trees. On the other hand, the density and complexity of their architecture made them difficult to train. Neural nets could easily overfit \index{overfitting} the data. As _Elements of Statistical Learning_ puts it, it required 'pioneering efforts to handcraft the neural network to overcome some these deficiencies..., which ultimately led to the state of the art in neural network performance' [@Hastie_2009, 404].\index{machine learning!craft in}  It is rare to find the word 'handcraft' in machine learning literature. The operational premise of most machine learners is that machine learning works without handcrafting, or that it automates what had previously been programmed by hand. \index{programmining!automation of}  \index{programmability!problem of} Somewhat loopily, the competition to automate recognition of handwritten digits, the traces that epitomise movements of hands,  entailed much handcrafting and recognition of variations in performances of the machine.

The unstable position of subjects in relation to  neural nets are frequently discussed in contrasting terms by machine learners themselves.[^7.0011] They often  point to a transformation in the work of machine learning:

>Neural networks went out of fashion for a while in the 90s - 2005 because they are hard to train and other techniques like SVMs beat them on some problems. Now people have figured out better methods for training deep neural networks, requiring far fewer problem-specific tweaks. You can use the same pretraining whether you want a neural network to identify whose handwriting it is or if you want to decipher the handwriting, and the same pretraining methods work on very different problems. Neural networks are back in fashion and have been outperforming other methods, and not just in contests [@Zare_2012].

The somewhat vacillating presence of neural nets in the machine learning literature itself finds parallels in the movements of individual machine learners. Yann Le Cun's work on optical character recognition during 1980-1990s is said to have discovered the back-propagation algorithm at the same time as Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams [@Rumelhart_1986]. His implementations in `LeNet` won many research machine learning  competitions during the 1990s. In 2007, Andrew Ng could casually observe that neural nets _were_ the best, but in  2014, Le Cun find himself working on machine learning at Facebook [@Gomes_2014]. \index{Le Cun, Yann} Similarly, the cognitive psychologist Geoffrey Hinton's involvement in the early 1980s work on connectionist learning procedures in neural nets and subsequently on 'deep learning nets' [@Hinton_2006] delivers him to Google in 2013. \index{Hinton, Geoffrey}

Trajectories between academic research and industry are not unusual for machine learners.\index{subject position!sites}  Many of the techniques in machine learning have been incorporated into companies later acquired by other larger companies. Even if there is no spin-off company to be acquired, machine learners themselves have been assigned key positions in many industry settings. Corinna Cortes, co-inventor with Vladimir Vapnik of the  support vector machine, heads research at Google New York \index{Cortes, Corinna}. In 2011, Ng led a neural net-based project at Google that had, among other things, detected cats  in millions of hours of Youtube videos.[^7.3] Ng himself in 2014 began work as chief scientist for the Chinese search engine, Baidu leading a team of AI researchers specializing in 'deep learning,' the contemporary incarnation of neural nets [@Hof_2014] \index{deep learning|see{machine learner!deep learning}}. \index{Ng, Andrew} In recent years, (2012-2015), work on neural nets has again intensified, most prominently in association with social media platforms, but also in the increasingly common speech and face recognition systems found in everyday services and devices. Many of these neural nets are like `kittydar` \index{machine learner!i\texttt{kittydar}}, but implemented on a much larger and more distributed scale (for instance, in classifying videos on Youtube). In contemporary machine learning competitions, as we will see, neural nets again surface as intersectional machines, re-distributing differences between humans and machines. 

# A privileged machine and its diagrammatic forms

What accounts for the somewhat uneven fortunes of the neural net amongst machine learners? The unevenness of their performance, from limited curiosity in the late 1960s to handcrafted best-in-class  performer in the machine learning image classification competitions of the 1990s, from second best competitor in late 1990s to the spectacular promise of deep belief networks amidst the 'awesome materiality' of social media image streams in 2012, suggests that some powerful dynamics or becomings are in play around them. These dynamics are not easily understood in terms of celebrity machine learners (human and non-human) suddenly rising to prominent or privileged positions in the research departments of social media platforms.[^7.7]  Nor does it make sense to attribute the rising fortunes of the neural net to the algorithms themselves, as if some decisive advance occurred in algorithms.

The algorithms such as back-propagation  used in neural nets have not, as we will see, been radically transformed in their core operations since the 1980s, and even then, the algorithms themselves (principally gradient descent \index{gradient descent}) were not new. There have been important changes in scale (similar to those described in the previous chapter in the case of the `RF-ACE` algorithm and Google Compute), but as is often the case in machine learning, their proliferation occurs through  re-distributions of knowledge and infrastructure associated with altered subject positions. While machine learners in their machine form can be assigned a privileged position in the transformations of knowledge and action, human machine learners are not exactly marginalized, at least in celebrated  cases such as Ng, Le Cun, Hinton and others. Rather, we can see varying  subject positions emerging in relation to specific devices and data forms (images, sounds, documents) in specific sites (social media platforms and mobiles devices in particular).  

A varying subject position surfaces in the operational architecture of neural nets. Despite differences in diagrammatic form, neural net share much with other machine learners. The language of brain, neurones and cognition associated with neural net covers over their much more familiar vector space and function-finding optimisations they rely on. Diagrammatic groupings and lines of movement operate in neural nets to expand their architecture in alignment with a series of well-established transformations.   'The central idea,' write Hastie and co-authors, 'is to extract linear combinations of the inputs as derived features, and then model the target as a nonlinear function of these features. The result is a powerful learning method, with widespread applications in many fields' [@Hastie_2009, 389]. The 'central idea' can be seen in the algebraic expressions that Hastie and co-authors provide for the basic neural net model:

\begin {equation}
\label {eq:nn}
\begin {split}
Z_m = \sigma(\alpha_0m + \alpha_m^TX) m = 1, ...,M\\
T_k = \beta_0k + \beta_k^TZ, k = 1, ..., K,\\
f_k (X) = g_k (T), k = 1, ..., K,
\end {split}
\end {equation}

>where $Z = (Z_1 , Z_2, ..., Z_M )$, and $T = (T_1 , T_2 ,..., T_K )$. The activation function $\sigma(v)$ is usually chosen to be the sigmoid $\sigma(v) = 1/(1 + e - v )$

>[@Hastie_2009, 392]

Equation \ref{eq:nn} diagrams some familiar elements as well as some novelty. Some elements of the neural net are already familiar from linear models. The neural networks transform data in a vector space denoted by $X$. That is common to nearly all machine learners.  They make use of the non-linear sigmoid function \index{function!sigmoid} that lies at the heart of one of the main linear classifiers used in machine learning, logistic regression.\index{machine learner!logistic regression} Their training and learning processes have come to rely on the same kinds of cost, loss or error functions \index{cost function} we have seen in other  machine learners. \index{machine learner!neural net!central idea of}

The apparently increasing power of neural nets  to learn (to see, to find, to classify, to rank, to predict) owes much to diagrammatic substitutions that recombine operations of past machine learners in new intersections. These movements appear in the equations.\index{diagrammatic!substitution}   Equation \ref{eq:nn} has three lines rather than one, and this layering and its diagonal patterns of indexical referencing running between subscripts distinguishes neural nets from the linear  models it assembles. \index{diagram!equation as} 

\begin {equation}
\label {eq:linear_model_2}
\hat{Y} = \hat{\beta_0}  + \sum^p_{j=1} X_j \hat{\beta_j}
\end {equation}
 
Whereas the standard linear model \index{linear model} shown in Equation \ref{eq:linear_model_2} indexes a single vector space $X_j$ and approximates it using a single function $\hat{Y}$ by searching for the values of the parameters $\beta_j$ that best incline a flat  plane through the data, the three lines shown in equation \ref{eq:nn} are woven through each other much more consecutively. Each lines derives 'features' from the line above, adding layers to the network. So-called 'hidden layers,' such as line two of equation \ref{eq:nn} repeatedly transform the vector space inside the model itself.    Each node, $1..K$, adds a new dimension to this internal vector space. In many layered deep learning neural nets, the dimensionality of the vector space vastly expands. \index{vector space}   Much hinges on the unobstrusive sigmoid function operator written as $\sigma$: 'a neural network can be thought of as a nonlinear generalization of the linear model, both for regression and classification. By introducing the nonlinear transformation $\sigma$, it greatly enlarges the class of linear models' [@Hastie_2009, 394]. $\sigma$, it seems, allows neural nets to generalize beyond the linear model.[^7.32]

# Varying subject positions in code

The operational diagram of neural nets, I would suggest, ascribes subject positions associated with it. How does that happen?   Some familiar diagrammatic operations immediately appear in almost any actual example of a neural net. In the code vignette shown below, the dataset is a spreadsheet of information about passengers of the Titanic. The `titanic` dataset, like `iris` or `boston` is often used in contemporary machine learning pedagogy. \index{dataset!titanic}  It is for instance, the main training dataset used by (kaggle.com)[http://kaggle.com], an online machine learning competition site I will discuss below \index{Kaggle.com}. The first few lines of the `R` code load the dataset and transform it into vector space. For instance, variables such as `sex` that take values such as `male` and `female` become vectors of `1` and `0` in a new variable `sexmale`. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=R, label={lst:titanic_nn}]

```r
library(neuralnet)
titanic = read.csv("data/titanic3.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
titanic_transformed = as.data.frame(model.matrix(~survived + age + pclass +

The line of the code that constructs a neural net using the `neuralnet` library [@Fritsch_2012] closely resembles the lines of code used to construct linear models for the `prostate` data (see chapter \ref{ch:vector}).  The `R` formula for the neural net looks very similar to other machine learners such as logistic regression. It models whether someone `survived` the wreck of the Titanic in terms of their age, class of fare (`pclass`), sex, number of siblings/spouse (`sibsp`), number of parents/children (`parch`) and port of departure:

`survived ~ age +pclass + fare + sexmale + sibsp + parch + embarkedC + embarkedQ + embarkedS`

`R` model formula express the response or target variable `survived` as a combination of other variables. In this case, the plus sign `+` indicates that the combination is linear or additive. If this model formula looks so similar to other machine learning techniques we have been discussing, what do neural networks add? Why did and do so many machine learners turn to them?

Perhaps the only distinctive feature of the code listing \ref{lst:titanic_nn} appears in the expression `hidden = 3.` This architectural feature does not appear in the model formula in the `R` code but does, as we have already seen,  operate in the lines of equation \ref{eq:nn}. These 'hidden units' are key to neural net since they construct the 'derived features' that the model learns from the input data $X$.

How many nodes are hidden and in what topology matters less than the existence of operation that allows their topology to be configured in an encounter with data.   The novelty of this operation  was central to research into neural nets. As Rumelhart, Winton and Williams announce the algorithm in a letter to _Nature_ in 1986 entitled 'Learning representations by back-propagating errors' \index{algorithm!back-propagation}:

> We describe a new learning procedure, back-propagation, for networks of neurone-like units. The procedure repeatedly adjusts the weights of the connections in the network so as to minimize a measure of the difference between the actual output vector of the net and the desired output vector. As a result of the weight adjustments, internal ‘hidden’ units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units. The ability to create useful new features distinguishes back-propagation from earlier, simpler methods such as the perceptron-convergence procedure [@Rumelhart_1986, 533]. \index{error!back-propagation of}

Again, despite the persistent reference to biology, the description of the 'new learning procedure' sound more like machine learning. There is talk of minimizing a measure of difference between actual and desire output vectors (optimizing through a cost or loss function), as well as mention of 'features' and 'weights' (usually a synonym for model parameters: 'the neural network model has unknown parameters, often called weights, and we seek values for them that make the model fit the training data well' [@Hastie_2009, 395]). The novelty, however, consists in the 'hidden' units whose interactions 'represent important features.' In other words, the flat additive combination of features expressed in the `R` model formula above does not convey the interactions of these units. (As Hastie and co-authors put it, 'the units in the middle of the network, computing the derived features $Z_m$, are called hidden units because the values $Z_m$ are not directly observed' [@Hastie_2009, 393].)  These units can only viably interact in the neural nets because the back-propagation algorithm offers a way to create 'useful, new features' from the data. But because they interact through back-propagation, the hidden units 'capture' regularities in the 'task domain' and thereby do what counts as cognition in the connectionist philosophies associated with neural nets (see the PDP group's work [@McClelland_1986]).

The hidden layers lend a network form to machine learning. The final diagrammatic form in which neural nets appear is the network. Network graphs already appeared in Rosenblatt's perceptron work [@Rosenblatt_1958], but they ramify tremendously in the aftermath of back-propagation. Almost every book and article relating to  neural net presents some version of the diagram shown in Figure \ref{fig:titanic_net}.  



\begin{figure}
  \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figure/titanic_net.pdf}
        \caption{Neural network topology for 3-hidden unit `titanic` data}
  \label{fig:titanic_net}
\end{figure}

Although the network topology of the model appears in many more complicated forms, it diagrams several operations. First, it presents a surface -- the input layer -- that indexes something in the world. \index{diagram!network} \index{graphic!network} The input layer, shown as $X$ in the algebraic diagram of equation \ref{eq:nn}, suggests  receptive or recording surface (for instance, a camera). Early neural net papers on the handwritten digital recognition problem sometimes describe cameras mounted above tables focused on images [@LeCun_1989].  Second, it presents an output layer that can contain single or multiple nodes, the $k$ of equation \ref{eq:nn}. In the `titanic` examples, a single target node appears (survived or not). In the `MNIST` handwritten digit recognition models, there are usually ten output nodes, one for each of the digits 0 ... 9.  Third, the network diagram exhibits ordered  forms of movement. Data and calculation propagate from left to right or vice-versa. (Sometimes the networks are rotated, and the flow is vertical, but still bi-directional). Bi-directional hierarchical movement is key to the back-propagation algorithm in feed-forward and more complicated recurrent and convolutional neural nets. \index{algorithm!back-propagation} Fourth, it renders visible in principle the vital hidden nodes. Without the hidden nodes, neural nets collapse into linear models. With the hidden nodes, the $Z_m$ of the equations \ref{eq:nn},  neural nets, like some other machine learners we have discussed such as support vector machines, effectively expand the vector space by constructing new dimensions in it. The derived features or 'learned representations' (to use the language of [@Rumelhart_1986]) can expand indefinitely, according to different network topologies. \index{machine learner!neural net!hidden nodes}

# The subjects of a hidden operation

How do the diagrammatic forms of the basic model equations, the network diagram and the operational code comprising the privileged machine at work recognising handwritten digits or classifying the passengers on the Titanic, assign subject positions? How would we describe the figure of human machine learner in this setting? Is the human machine learner like Vlad, the former Eastern European mathematician tending the training of a neural net at the heart of the call centre knowledge management system, or more like Heather Arthur, the programmer who wrote `kittydar`? \index{machine learner!kittydar} 

When in _The Archaeology of Knowledge_, Foucault presents the 'position of the subject' \index{subject position} as an anchor point for the power-laden, knowledge forming  enunciative functions,\index{statements!enunciative function} he does not identify it as a unifying point grounded in interiority, in intentionality or even in  single speaking position or voice (that of *the*  machine learning expert, for instance). On the contrary, 'various enunciative modalities manifest his [sic] dispersion' [@Foucault_1972, 54].  Positions derive from operations that determine statements that become a kind of law for the subject.\index{subject position!operational assignment of}

As Foucault puts it, in a mathematical example and a conceptual formulation that broadly anticipates accounts of performativity, \index{performativity}  

>in each case the position of the subject is linked to the existence of an operation that is both determined and present; in each case, the subject of the statement is also the subject of the operation (he who establishes the definition of a straight line is also he who states it; he who posits the existence of a finite series is also, and at the same time, he who states it) ; and in each case, the subject links, by means of this operation and the statement in which it is embodied, his future statements and operations (as an enunciating subject, he accepts this statement as his own law) [@Foucault_1972, 94-95]. 

Foucault's examples here include subjects who say things like 'I call straight any series of points that ...': just such statements  operate in machine learning. The _operation_ is crucial, since it connects many different practices and techniques (function finding, optimisation, transformation of data into the vector space, mobilisation of probability distributions as a kind of rule of existence for learnable situations, etc.) that accompany, ornament, armour and diagram the statement.

Foucault posits, therefore,  a subject-positioning circularity between the operation and accompanying statement: the subject of the statement is also the subject of the operation. The provisional coincidence of operation and statement defines a subject position, with some agency and subjects machine learners to future operations.  The process might be formalised for any machine learner as follows: the diagrammatic operations of the machine learner support the production of statements; these operations become a way of producing future statements to the extent that the subject of the operation is _also_ the subject of the statement. The assignation of a subject position occurs in this forward and backward, feed-forwarding and back-propagating movement between operation and statement. \index{subject position!back-propagation} \index{machine learner!subject as|see{subject position}} 


# Algorithms that propagate errors

The distinctive feature of  neural nets, at least in their ordinary 'vanilla' forms, consists in their use of a series or chain of gradient descent operations  to minimise errors by adjusting the weights (or parameters) of all the nodes (or linear models) comprising the network. Adjusting the parameters of the nodes in the neural net hardly seems a striking achievement. If we, however, look more closely at the way in which the 'internal representations' [@Rumelhart_1986, 536] are iteratively constructed in neural nets, something more interesting begins to emerge from the forwards and backwards movement of this algorithm. \index{algorithm!back-propagation} Does an algorithm such as back-propagation diagram the slippery coincidence of subject of operation and subject of statement in machine learning?

The subject-positioning zone of slippage between statement and operation appears as error. \index{error} Although the gap between operation and statement might seem  small, there are many slippages and divergences in it. A minor statements such as 'we see that Net-5 does the best, having errors of only 1.6%, compared to 13% for the “vanilla” network Net-2' [@Hastie_2009, 407] bears within it, in its  coupling to all the operations comprising 'Net-5,' a set of determinations, sites and relations for variously positioned subjects. \index{machine learner!Net-5} (These might include machine learners, such as Hinton or Le Cun, but also U.S. Postal workers, whose work must have more ore less disappeared as automatic mail sorting improved).   In any concrete situation, in relation to any specific machine learner, the diagrammatic operations and statements will position subjects in specific ways. There is no simple referent here, no simple object gripped or seen by  a knowing or controlling subject, since on this account, the operations and statements in their dispersions, accumulations and distributions overflow any simple dyadic relation between a subject-object or human-machine/world. 

As we have seen in chapter \ref{ch:function}, error rates, training error, test error, generalization error, validation error are just some of the errors that criss-cross between human and machine learners. Errors render operations as statements. While not all of these errors figure directly in the algorithms, the learning procedure of most  machine learners derives from the way they update model parameters in the light of statements of  errors. Every   machine learner  makes different determinations in relation to model parameters and errors. We have already seen something of the forward movement that runs between the input layer and the output layer with its classificatory statements. Equations \ref{eq:nn} imply data  moving  a succession of layers and their nodes.  Conversely, the back-propagating phase of a neural net move from output towards input layer updating weights of various nodes in the light of differences between predicted and known outputs. \index{differences!between prediction and known values} \index{algorithm!back-propagation!equations of}

\begin {equation}
\label {eq:back_prop}
\begin {split}
\beta_{km}^{(r+1)} =  \beta^{(r)}_{km} - \gamma_r \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{\partial R_i}{\partial \beta_{km}^{(r)}}\\
\alpha_{ml}^{(r+1)} = \alpha^{(r)}_{km} - \gamma_r \sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{\partial R_i}{\partial \alpha_{km}^{(r)}}
\end {split}
\end {equation}

>[@Hastie_2009, 396]

Many different parameters figure in the back-propagation functions shown in equations \ref{eq:back_prop}. They include measures of error ($R$), values of the weights or parameters in various layers of the models ($\beta$, $\alpha$), variables that count the number of iterations the model has performed ($r$, $r+1$) and the functional operators such as summation ($\sum$) and partial differentiation ($\partial$). The usual indexical relations to vector space  appear in $N$, the number of rows or observations, as well as $K$, the number of outputs and $M$, the number of nodes in the hidden layer. Partial derivatives express the sensitivity of errors with respect to the weights or parameters of the nodes. \index{function!partial derivatives!in back-propagation}     In the densely iconic and indexical diagram of equation \ref{eq:back_prop}, the interweaving of the subscripts in the two lines show how values of the model parameters of the first two lines of equation \ref{eq:nn} update  as the model is trained on the input data. The two lines of equation \ref{eq:back_prop} specify how first the values of the parameters $\beta_{km}$ of the $K$ nodes of the output layer should be altered in the light of the difference between the actual and expected output values, and then how the weights $\alpha_{km}$  of the $M$ nodes of the hidden layers should be adjusted. Once these are adjusted, the forward movement defined by equations \ref{eq:nn} begins again. In adjusting weights in the layers, back-propagation always starts at the outputs, and travels back into the net towards the input layer at the bottom (or left hand side in diagram \ref{fig:titanic_net}.

'It is as if the error propagates from the output _y_ back to the inputs and hence the name _back-propagation_ was coined' writes Alpaydin [@Alpaydin_2010, 250]. As in any gradient descent operation (see chapter \ref{ch:function}), a rate parameter (here $\gamma$) regulates the speed of descent. If $\gamma$ is too large, the gradient descent might jump over a valley that contains the absolute minimum error; if $\gamma$ is  too small, then the descent is too slow for fast machine learning. In some versions of neural net, the value of $\gamma$ changes each at iteration $r$ of the model.[^7.201]  \index{gradient descent}

# Competitions as examination

More or less directly, the observation of error rates converging towards minimum values assigns a subject position the role of controlling hyper-parameters such as $\gamma$, the learning rate.  This seems a drastic curtailment of agency.  The related feed-forward and back-propagation of errors focuses the machine learner subject, the 'wonderful people' of Hilary Mason's exhortation to developers, on error.  At almost every step of its development as a field and in almost every aspect of its operation, competitions to observe and rank error rates bring human and machine learners together. In competitions, errors are not purely epistemic. \index{machine learning!competition!errors in} They circulate within a wider economy of competitive optimisation that connect them to power, value and agency dynamics.  The learning of machine learning takes place in examinations that rank both human and non-human machine learners according to error rates. \index{machine learning!competition!as examination} What can we learn from such competitions about subject positions in machine learning?

Backwards and forwards movement between human and machine machine learners characterises competitions run by [Kaggle](http://www.kaggle.com).\index{Kaggle|see{machine learning!competition!Kaggle}} Kaggle organizationally implements a parallel architecture machine learning process by back-propagating errors to hidden nodes embodied in individual competitors who, in principle at least, are not connected to each other, but only to the layers and nodes of Kaggle itself as a platform.  In comparison to the research-oriented machine learning competitions such as the annual  (KDD Cup)[http://www.sigkdd.org/kddcup/index.php][@KDD_2013]  run by the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Group on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, the NIPS (Neural Information Processing Systems) Challenges, the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge [@ILSVRC_2014]  or the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)[http://machinelearning.org/icml.html], the Kaggle competitions attract a wide range of academic, industry, commercial and individual entries. \index{machine learning!competitions}

Competitors no doubt enter these competitions for various reasons, not the least of which is their employment prospects or the promotion of their machine learning products (for instance, the winner of a major competition, the Heritage Health Fund Prize in 2012 uses that prize to promote the data mining software made by his company (Tiberius)[Tiberius.biz]; an entrant in the Hewlett 'Automated Essay Competition' again in 2012 included Pacific Metrics, a US company whose automated essay scoring products were already in use in U.S. schools; while Pacific Metrics did not win the competition, it acquired the winning machine learner and incorporated it into its products [@Kaggle_2012]). Kaggle.com is effectively a recruitment agency for machine learners [@Kaggle_2015d]. Some competitions have recruitment opportunities as the prize.  For instance, several competitions sponsored by Facebook have positions as data scientist at Facebook as the prize:

> Ever wonder what it's like to work at Facebook? Facebook and Kaggle are launching an Engineering competition for 2015. Trail blaze your way to the top of the leader board to earn an opportunity at interviewing for a role as a software engineer, working on world class Machine Learning problems [@Kaggle_2015] \index{Facebook!machine learning at}

While most employment agencies rely on CVs (curriculum vitae), Kaggle operates more like feed-forward and back-propagation between multiple competitions as a way of optimising its ranking of machine learners. \index{machine learning!competitions!Kaggle}

The competition organizers list three injunctions: download (the data), build (a model), and submit (an entry or many entries to the competition). Leader-boards and individual rankings within the Kaggle's "world's largest community of data scientists" [@Kaggle_2015b], [^7.20] allow clients --corporations mostly -- to 'harness the "cognitive surplus"' [@Kaggle_2015c].  The figure also shows some of the typical diversity of  the several hundred machine learning competitions that Kaggle has staged since 2011: diabetic retinopathy and west Nile virus prediction competition appear next to search results relevance or context ad clicks competitions.\index{data diversity} As we have seen frequently, accumulation,  aggregation and  proximity, whether accidental or constructed, between very disparate entities suggests that machine learners possess epistemic mobility not readily available to the domain experts (in diabetes, virology, information retrieval or search engine optimisation). 


\begin{figure}
  \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figure/kaggle.pdf}
        \caption{Kaggle data science competitions}
  \label{fig:kaggle}
\end{figure}

Like a neural network with many layers and nodes, competitions subject competitors (several hundred thousand in Kaggle) to ranking and indeed prediction based on the generalization error \index{error!generalization} of the models that they submit to the competition. The leader-board, which displays current rankings of competitors in a given competition, is the visual form of this error-based ranking: 

> The leaderboard is a central fixture of the Kaggle experience. It provides context to the incredible work accomplished by the Kaggle data science community. To a competitor, the leaderboard is a dynamic, living, action-filled battle. Tactics come to life. Individuals leapfrog over each other.  Teams merge and blend submissions.  Some submit early and often, attempting to build up insurmountable leads. Others bide time, waiting to pounce minutes before the buzzer with their finest of forests.  We see the joys of regularization and the agony of overfitting.   ... It's thousands of hours of collective human toil [@Kaggle_2015c]

The dynamics of ranking, and the experience of being ranked here arise from a fairly simple mechanism. Entrants in a given competition download two datasets, a training dataset that includes labels for all the response variables, and a test dataset that does not include the labels. In principle, competitors construct machine learners using the training dataset, use their machine learner  to predict labels for the test dataset, and then upload the predicted labels to Kaggle as a submission to the competition. The Kaggle platform then calculates a ranking based on the generalization error in the test labels.[^7.913]  Competitors optimise their entries against each other, but the competition overall functions as a kind of general optimization process in which many hidden nodes adjust their treatment to the training data as scores and rankings propagate through via the leaderboard system. The very stylised injunction to download-model-submit many times effectively creates an algorithmic process in which many hidden nodes operate in parallel to produce predictions. \index{Kaggle!competition!as optimisation process}

[^7.913]:  Kaggle itself has the actual labels for the test dataset. Entrants monitor the leaderboard and attempt to improve their rankings by making new submissions with improved or altered models. The many entries that participants sometimes submit to the competitions suggest that rankings, and their visibility operate like the loss functions that optimise the fit of a subject position to an operational formation. \index{optimisation!competition as process}

# Superimposing power and knowledge

It would be possible to explore in much greater ethnographic depth the practices of Kaggle competitors, the spectrum of participants (ranging from undergraduate student teams through to retired scientists, from hedge fund financial analysts to physicists), and the ways in which the topics of competitions relate to different scientific, governmental and commercial problems. Here I am interested mainly in the form of the competition as a test or examination centred on errors. The competitions take the form of examinations that set a problem, define some limits or constraints on its solution, and create a space that qualifies, ranks and displays the work of individuals or groups according to rates of generalization error (the error that arises when a machine learner encounters new data). \index{error!generalization}

Machine learning competitions  instance practices of examination that Foucault described in _Discipline and Punish_:

>The examination combines the techniques of an observing hierarchy and those of a normalizing judgement. ... It establishes over individuals a visibility through which one differentiates them and judges them. That is why, in all the mechanisms of discipline, the examination is highly ritualized. In it are combined the ceremony of power and the form of the experiment, the deployment of force and the establishment of truth. At the heart of the procedures of discipline, it manifests the subjection of those who are perceived as objects and the objectification of those who are subjected. The superimposition of the power relations and knowledge relations assumes in the examination all its visible brilliance [@Foucault_1977, 183-185]. \index{power!disciplinary!examinations in}

The disciplinary form of the examination of errors links statements and operations.  Examinations combine ceremony, ritual, experiment, force and truth in subject and object positioning operations.  \index{subject position!examination as normalizing} The consolidation of machine learning as a data practice today in competitions occurs via a much more pervasive practice of examining and testing. The forms of visibility created by competitions  individualize and normalize machine learners (often by proper names), and optimise  extractions of force, time, propensities and aptitudes.

In many Kaggle competitions (some titles are shown in table \ref{tab:kaggle_competitions}), winning entries come from machine learners working together. \index{Kaggle!competitions!variety of}  In the National Data Science Bowl competition of 2015,  competitors were asked to classify images of more  than 100 species of plankton.  The winning team comprised seven graduate and post-doctoral researchers from Ghent University, Belgium. In a jointly written blog account of their winning entry, team 'Deep Sea' describe something of the construction of the deep learning models they built. These were convolutional  neural nets, neural nets in which elements of the network only 'look' at overlapping tiles of the input images: \index{machine learning!neural net!convoulational}

>We started with a fairly shallow models by modern standards (~ 6 layers) and gradually added more layers when we noticed it improved performance (it usually did). Near the end of the competition, we were training models with up to 16 layers. The challenge, as always, was balancing improved performance with increased overfitting [@Dieleman_2015a].

Like many of the entrants in image-based classification competitions such as the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge [@ILSVRC_2014], 'Deep Sea' built their machine learner  in several stages, first deriving features \index{feature!selection} from the data by creating various layers that looked for common features across various scales, rotations and other transformations of the plankton images, and then adding neural net layers to classify those derived features using the labels supplied in the training set. In this respect, and in almost perfect synchrony with the deep learning teams at Google, Facebook and many other places, 'Deep Sea' combined supervised and unsupervised learning techniques \index{learning, supervised}. The lower convolutional layers that process the images are strictly speaker unsupervised because they make no use of the known labels or categories of the plankton; the upper layers are supervised because they make use of tthe labels in the normal back-propagation process of neural net training. 

In comparison to the plain or 'vanilla'  neural nets discussed above, deep belief networks involve many more parameters, stages of observation and modelling, configuration of hardware and infrastructural arrangements and comparison of results. 'Deep Sea' describe the architecture of one of their more successful models:

> It has 13 layers with parameters (10 convolutional, 3 fully connected) and 4 spatial pooling layers. The input shape is (32, 1, 95, 95), in bc01 order (batch size, number of channels, height, width). The output shape is (32, 121). For a given input, the network outputs 121 probabilities that sum to 1, one for each class.

They go on to describe the different layers -- cyclic slice, convolutional, spatial pooling -- that derive features from the data or augmenting it (by examining overlapping tiles, by rotating or scaling the images, so that any given image, is 'seen' in a number of different ways, and the model learns to detect these variations).   The combination of diverse layers in a stratified model introduces  a range of learners into the operation, just as Kaggle itself networks many machine learners through its competitions. 

A  massive parallel computation allows 'deep' learning. Infrastructure and cognition entwine heavily here, since the very possibility of training large many-layered neural nets depends heavily on vectorised transformations of image data.  Probably few other competitors in this competition would have had access to the Tesla K40 or 'NVIDIA GTX 980 Superclocked' GPU cards that 'Deep Sea' relied on.[^7.100] \index{GPU|see{vectorization!hardware!graphics processing unit}} Even with that intensive computational resource, their models required 'between 24 and 48 hours to reach convergence.' They constructed around 300 models. Because of the plethora of models with different architectures and parameters, 'we had to select how many and which models to use in the final blend' [@Dieleman_2015a]. As is often the case, competition engenders populations of machine learners whose aggregate tendencies model optimum performance.[^7.40] The 'DeepSea' team might epitomise machine learning subject positions. Like the 'wonderful people' described by Hilary Mason, they bring together infrastructure, engineering, mathematics/statistics and some knowledge of human behaviour (although the knowledge of human behaviour in this case might have more to do with what other Kaggle competitors might be doing, as well as an awareness of cutting edge research leaders in image recognition techniques). 

# Stacked subject positions

'DeepSea' built models that classify images of  more than a hundred kinds of plankton with few errors. In driving down error rates more than the hundreds of other competitors, they occupy a privileged subject position at the conjunction of operation and the statements in machine learning. Machine learners such as  deep belief nets adjust and align subject positions through their many convolutional layers.  They supplant, for instance, the skilled configuration of feature engineering \index{feature engineering} that characterised work on decision trees, linear regressions, support vector machines and predecessor neural nets. Similarly, they absorb the professional skills of Go players in training models that win against the best human players [@Silver_2016].   The subject position of a machine learner occupies a  zone of diagrammatic slippage between statements and operations. \index{statements!and operations!zone of slippage between}

The various positions subject might speak of, observe, question or decide about machine learning are neither unified or fixed. As the models grow, for instance, they test the capacity of human machine learners to understand how models relate to data. Perhaps more profoundly, the growth of neural nets exhibits the deeply competitive imperative that imbues much machine learning practice, and in many ways constrains thinking around machine learning. This competition is not always explicit or overt, but it almost transpires in the form of a test or examination. On behalf of machine learners, Andrew Ng declares that 'we care about generalization error,' \index{Ng, Andrew} \index{error!generalization} \index{examination}. Error is neither the responsibility simply of the machine or its human others. Rather, error moves forwards and backwards between human and non-human machine learners. 

Neural nets re-iteratively draw human-machine learning differences. Their own ups and downs, the merging and blending of statistics, computer science and cognitive science they afford, and their potential to drive down error or learn features \index{feature} from data given enough data  derives less from some exotic mathematical abstraction or encompassing algorithm, and more from  competitively accumulated layers and connections between units of modelling. The oscillating movement of the central algorithm -- feed-forward and back-propagation -- is instructive. Because it propagates errors to all elements of the network, and every element in the network adjusts its weights in trying to minimise error, the layers can grow, becoming convolutional and recurrent on many scales. \index{back-propagation!and growth of neural nets} The predictive power of the model derives from the networked collective of elementary machine learners driven to optimise their error rates. So too, the competitive examinations that today generalize machine learning as a data practice predicate the ongoing potential of hidden units -- machine learners  -- to learn from their rankings in tests of error. 

As it disperses  subject positions, the back-propagation of errors or optimisation also animates optimism about machine learning.[^7.343] \index{subject position!technical figure of} Machine learning hovers in potentialities because neural nets and their kin assimilate and adjust their weights in response to changes in infrastructures and in the generalization of operations to newly adjacent domains. Machine learners generate optimism through and about optimisation, an optimisation that is deeply predictive, prospective, anticipatory and abductive. But this adjusting of weights carried out through the propagation of errors is also inherently a ranking or examination. \index{machine learning!affect in!optimism} 

Human and machine learner differences can be re-drawn in two different directions. In one direction, machine learning operations assign a subject position focused on error rates. Vlad in his corner observing the neural nets occupied such a position. \index{differences!human-machine} In the other direction, the subjects who operate the neural net in order to fit a model find themselves  deeply caught up in a network of machine learners connected into parallel and layered architectures and operations. This feeding-forward, however, is regularized or narrowed down through examination and error, through back-propagation on various scales that ranks and filters machine learners according to their error rates. In this direction, the practice of training and testing generalization error that has long guided the supervision of machine learners becomes a mechanisms for adjusting subject  positions of human machine learners. Some will be wonderful people, some will remain remote like Vlad, and some will optimistically re-learn in order to change their ranking. \index{machine learning!ranking of}  

[^7.343]: The cultural theorist Lauren Berlant describes optimism as an operation:

        >The surrender to the return to the scene where the object hovers in its potentialities is the operation of optimism as an affective form [@Berlant_2007, 20]

    Berlant's complicated formulation brings together surrender, return, scene, object, potentialities and affective form. These movements, places and things might be understood as purely psychic or semiotic processes. But optimism as an asignifying diagrammatic operation also plays out across the manifold surfaces of algorithms, datasets, models, platforms and ranking systems associated with machine learning as a competitive examination. \index{Berlant, Lauren!optimism}

[^7.3]: Unlike the cats detected by `kittydar,` the software discussed in the introduction to this book, the Google experiment did not use supervised learning. The deep learning approach was unsupervised [@Markoff_2012]. That is, the neural nets were not trained using labelled images of cats.


[^7.01]: In the case of this paper, and many others related to neural nets, the images are of hand-written digits. These digits have an almost constitutive role, as I discuss in this chapter. 


[^7.1]: In earlier work on machine learning [@Mackenzie_2013], I presented programmers as agents of anticipation, suggesting that the turn to machine learning amongst programmers could be useful in understanding how predictivity was being done amidst broader shift to the regime of anticipation described by Vincenne Adams, Michelle Murphy and Adele Clarke [@Adams_2009]. Subsequently developments in machine learning, even just in the last three years, confirm that view, but in this chapter and in this book more generally, I focus less on transformations in programming practice and software development, and more on the asymmetries of different machine learner  subjects in relation to infrastructures and knowledge.

[^7.2]: Other figures we might follow include Claudia Perlich, Andrew Ng, Geoffrey Hinton, Corinna Cortez,  Daphne Koller, Christopher Bishop, Yann LeCun, or Jeff Hammerbacher.  Although some women's names appear here, in any such list, men's names are much more likely to appear. This is no accident.  \index{machine learner!gender of}


[^7.005]: Although mainstream media accounts of machine learning are not the focus of my interest here, it is hard to ignore the extraordinary level of interest that deep learning projects and techniques have attracted in the last few years. Articles have appeared in all the usual places -- _The New York Times_ [@Markoff_2012], _Wired_[@Garling_2015], or _The Guardian_ [@Arthur_2015]. In many of these accounts, machine learning and neural nets in particular appear both in the guise of the existential threat of artificial intelligence and as a mundane device (for instance, speech recognition on a mobile phone). The spectacular character of deep learning could be analysed in terms like that of the genomes discussed in chapter \ref{ch:genome}. In both cases, the advent and transformation of these machine learners is closely linked to networked platforms (such as Google, Facebook, Yahoo and Microsoft) and their efforts to encompass within their services as many elements of experience, exchange, communication and power as possible. Deep learning  machine learners currently focus mostly on images (photographs and video) and sounds (speech and music), and usually attempt to locate and label objects, words or genres.  \index{machine learner!deep learning!existential threat of}

[^7.0010]: We saw some use of neural nets in genomics in the previous chapter (\ref{ch:genome}). The initial publication of the `SRBCT` microarray dataset in [@Khan_2001] relied on neural nets.  \index{dataset!SRBCT}

[^7.0011]: Neural nets also receive uneven attention in the machine learning literature. In Andrew Ng's Stanford CS229 lectures from 2007, they receive somewhat short shrift: around 30 minutes of discussion in Lecture 6, in between Naive Bayes classifiers and several weeks of lectures on support vector machines [@Ng_2008b]. As he introduces a video of an autonomous vehicle steered by a neural net after a 20 minute training session with a human driver, Ng comments that 'neural nets were the best for many years.' \index{Ng, Andrew} The lectures quickly moves on to the successor, support vector machines.  In _Elements of Statistical Learning_, a whole chapter appears on the topic, but prefaced by a discussion of the antecedent statistical method of 'projection pursuit regression.' The inception of 'projection pursuit' is dated to 1974, and thus precedes the 1980s work on neural nets that was to receive so much attention. In _An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R_, a book whose authors include Hastie and Tibshirani, neural nets are not discussed and indeed not mentioned [@James_2013]. Textbooks written by computer scientists such as Ethem Alpaydin's _Introduction to Machine Learning_ do usually include at least a chapter on them, sometimes under different titles such as 'multi-layer perceptrons' [@Alpaydin_2010].  Willi Richert and Luis Pedro Coelho's _Building Machine Learning Systems with Python_ likewise does not mention them [@Richert_2013]. Cathy O'Neil and Rachel Schutt's _Doing Data Science_ mentions them but does not discuss them [@Schutt_2013], whereas both Brett Lantz's _Machine Learning with R_ [@Lantz_2013] and Matthew Kirk's _Thoughtful Machine Learning_ [@Kirk_2014] devote chapters to them. In the broader cannon of machine learning texts, the computer scientist Christopher Bishop's heavily cited books on pattern recognition dwell extensively on neural nets [@Bishop_1995; @Bishop_2006]. Amongst statisticians, Brian Ripley's _Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks_ [@Ripley_1996], also highly cited, placed a great deal of emphasis on them.\index{Ripley, Brian}  But these textbooks stand out against a pointillistic background of hundreds of thousands of scientific publications mentioning or making use of neural nets since the late 1980s in the usual litany of fields -- atmospheric sciences, biosensors, botany, power systems, water resource management, internal medicine, etc. This swollen publication tide attests to some kind of formation or configuration of knowledge invested in these particular techniques, perhaps more so than other I have discussed so far ( logistic regression, support vector machine, decision trees, random forests, linear discriminant analysis, etc.). 

[^7.7]: In any case, social media and search engines cannot be understood apart from the machine learning techniques that have been thoroughly woven through them since their inception.  Hence _Elements of Statistical Learning_ devotes several pages to Google's famous _PageRank_ algorithm, describing it as an unsupervised learner [@Hastie_2009, 576-578]. \index{social media platforms!machine learning as part of}

[^7.32]: Recent work on deep belief networks replaces the sigmoid function with other non-linear functions that subtly alter the way layers of neural nets relate to each other. See [@Glorot_2010] for an account of changing training practices in neural nets. 

[^7.201]: If back-propagation was formulated in the 1980s (and indeed, was already known in  1960), what do we learn from its current re-iterations? Given the effort that went into crafting neural nets to recognise handwritten digits during the 1980s and 1990s, what does the revival of neural nets suggest about machine learning as feed-forward/back-propagation operation? From the early publications such as [@Rumelhart_1985] on, the layered composition of the model has been linked to architectural considerations. As Hastie and co-authors write:

    >The advantages of back-propagation are its simple, local nature. In the back propagation algorithm, each hidden unit passes and receives information only to and from units that share a connection. Hence it can be implemented efficiently on a parallel architecture computer [@Hastie_2009, 397].

    These practical considerations have different significance in different settings. Some of the current iterations of neural nets in deep learning rely on massively parallel computing architectures (for instance, Andrew Ng's GoogleX Youtube video project). Yet the information sharing that happens during back-propagation might also encompass the human others of neural nets. The efficient parallel implementation in computing architecture affects, I would suggest, human and non-human machine learners in different ways. \index{machine learner!neural net!infrastructures of}


[^7.20]: At the time of writing, Kaggle claims around 320,000 competitors.

[^7.40]: On the command line, `git clone https://github.com/benanne/kaggle-ndsb` makes a copy of the model code. The code in that github repository gives some idea of the mosaic of techniques, configurations, variations and tests undertaken by 'DeepSea.'

[^7.100]: As another competitor in the National Data Science Bowl mentions:

    > One example is here the Kaggle plankton detection competition. At first I thought about entering the competition as I might have a huge advantage through my 4 GPU system. I reasoned I might be able to train a very large convolutional net in a very short time – one thing that others cannot do because they lack the hardware [@Dettmers_2015]

    Hardware parallelism and vectorization, at least in the area of deep learning, seems to matter more than the ability to test, examine, observe or invest new model configurations. \index{vectorization!hardware}
