# Conclusion: Out of the Data

## overview

 - how many things I couldn't include in the book
 - what it felt to write it -- working with all the code and various other problems
 - how it remained a kind of handicraft, not a social labour

## todo
- overview of the parts, and the chapters
- the media-science-government
- I use media as shorthand for media in general: they are things or infrastructures, which are also things, and things are media (Lash & Lury)


## text from proposal

The conclusion draws together the main threads running through the previous chapter, and sets out a series of questions and provocations for thinking with data. Crucially, the conclusion will stand back from the much more hands-on approach to data and data practice adopted in the preceding chapters in order to think more about we -- social scientists, humanities scholars -- might invent or create in the midst of data. While this book has a critical angle to it (so many claims about and beliefs in data plainly deserve critique for their conservative and naive approach to things), it is principally concerned with conceptual invention through doing things with data. The work of learning about machine learning, and learning about it in a way that is deeply embodied or practically embodied, brings with it altered ways of thinking about, questioning and integrating what is happening to data more generally. It highlights the key argument that has run through the book about the plural dimensionality of data as it is aggregated, tabulated, summarised and modelled in contemporary data and signal processes, and as well as the extraordinary mobility or kinetic energy of generic machine learning methods. In discussing the shifting dimensionality of data, and the kinetics of methods, the conclusion will attempt to sketch out how some promising ways of thinking with data might proceed. 

## What is 'into the data' about?

This book has sought to provide an account of several dozen techniques, algorithms and procedures that run deeply through contemporary sciences, government, media and business. Many tensions and forces run through these techniques since they are said to be crucial to knowledge, to value and to power. The account offered in the preceding pages has not sought to list or delineate the plurality of applications, setting, implementations and variations in machine learning operates. Typically, humanities and social science research does focus on specific cases, and sometimes a list of cases, and it usually offers these cases as examplars, as a kind of training set that can be used for the purpose of generalization. The neural networks, the support vector machines, the linear regressions, the random forests and Naive Bayes classifiers are multiplying and generalizing. The several hundred thousand scientific articles that run underneath my discussion embody the process of generalizing the techniques, and these articles are no doubt only a limited institutional sample of the effervescing foam that bears these techniques further into everyday infrastructures of media, energy, government, commerce and manufacture. (The great virtue of scientific publication, even in a time where science is so bound up with technoscientific  enterprises, remains in the visibility its publications afford.) The point here, however, is that such lists of applications and implementations would be both symptomatic and inadequate in accounting for the movement of these techniques, perhaps in the same way that a list of recommended products on Amazon.com's website both
