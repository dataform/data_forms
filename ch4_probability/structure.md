## structure

- hacking on how statistics became real -- tables of numbers; retrofitting of laws as regularities; the role of the social; constant crossover between medicine, state and science, 
- the fact that machine learning books are full of stats, but the traditional stats of hypothesis testing, tests of significance, measures of uncertainty or variation although some of this appears.
- statistical mechanisms in the service of something else -- follows on from argument about functions as partial observers and as things in the world (code) -- statistics becomes a device to order the progress of machines; and the laws that matter -- law of large of numbers; the normal distribution -- become techniques of controlling the proliferation of movements. 
- progression from 18th century joint probability through to 19th century distributions.
