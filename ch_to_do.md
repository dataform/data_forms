## preface

- vignettes from texas 97 calculator through manchester fieldwork, etc
- the sea and the escarpment; the trajectory - steel, coal, not the epicentre;
- there is a punishing level of technical specificity here. That will disinterest some people, and rightly so. Not everyone should have to do this. 
- highly literate machine learners will not find enough technical detail here - they should read for the outside; what about the others? focus on the diagrammatic ... 
- the choice of datasets -- deliberately limited; I've not gone searching for outside data, but stuck with the literature very closely in most cases; but the literature includes code;
- talk about the various meanings of 'into' : what is put in, a movement inwards, into as in like, a historical transition; link to James on conjunctions
- talking about unlearning  -- and what that might mean
- the look of this book -- it imitates its objects in certain ways -- typographically, diagrammatically, and infrastructurally ... 
- talk about the github site, and how to run the book
- the key datasets --- a set of 400k abstracts from all disciplines in the wos
- the typographic conventions used in this book -- follow Venables and Ripley


## ch_praxis


- the fact that spark has mlib and its examples as the standard ones
- the github argument -- how it is changing the way in which these systems are put together
- add in McCloskey 2014 paper on the diagrammatic (in doc archive -- data_intensve)
- add in notes from Exeter paper about diagonalization; and perhaps start with the diagonal diagram from hastie;
- scientific papers form a substrate here; but they are entangled with software, with databases, with institutions, and with a widening circle of actors
- learning about learning --
    - the Literature - landecker and kelty on treating literature as the informant; examples such as Cover-Hart, Breiman, etc
- Michie, Spiegelhalter 1994 book has report on the Statlog project -- it tried to bring all method together; good that it mixes stats and computer scientists; managed by Daimler-Benz; shows that the problem of diversity of techniques has been discussed before; look at how they tried to bring  the methods together;
- the habit of recursive application of code to itself, or to something close by, without ever going too far -- I'll do that too -- use the algorithms to investigate the literature, to classify the examples, to see how things move; but I don't want to place too much weight on this recursion, as it is something that needs to be analsyed. See the recent Totaro article -- not recursion as an intrinsic formal property, but as a practice in certain domains that allows a form of movement.
- Cathy O'Neill writing about why big data is over -- doing one course is not enough ... 
- done? On the aridness of the textbooks and literature and what to do about that. 
- add Parisi quote about software cultures: '
>The epochal challenge of programming cultures is to venture into the infinity of incomputable probabilities (infinite discrete unities that are bigger than the totality of the whole sequence of algorithmic instructions) that lies beyond both the digital ground and interactive empiricism. 77
- the entwining of the models and the data with this text -- it can't be shown in this text, in the same way that it can't be easily shown in the world.  
- complain about all the vignettes and case studies in this area - Mayer-Schonberger, the podcasts, etcs

## ch vector


- the tables are not meant to be looked at -- cf. a typical report table; the quote from MF d&P is really relevant here -- present the contrast?
- the rows are sometimes called 'the observations' -- connect to MF on observation
- the response column is what has to be constructed -- it is added on 
- the basic functions and their transformation of the linear model into a non-linear one
- go straight into the data -- talk about how hastie and others do this;
- the thing about looking at patterns -- someone elses turkish carpet
- Beniger article on history of stats graphics; Marchese on tables;
- bring in `iris` discussion
- do library dependencies with datasets added; create map of datasets; add datasets from other sources; 
- pull apart some diagrams using inkscape -- use this to show what happens to the abstract spaces
- mention how things that don't seem to be vector spaces are put into vector spaces (e.g. market basket analysis)
- use the metaphor of the house architecture and real estate as a figure to help explain the diagramming
- reference history of tables -- e.g. downloaded chapter -- need to get from samsung laptop
- discuss problem of tables -- how they diagrammaticaly generate high D spaces that we then wrestle with, mightly and again diagrammatically -- fallacy of misplaced concreteness?
- see history of statistics in terms of plurality of attempts to deal with the diagramming of the table
- add Foucault on the appearance of deep order in life/language/labour -- this is a really important thread to draw through - in this case through the reconstruction of the _table_. 
- add quotes from Foucault on the table of space of order, and ask how he thought about quantity, etc; and what is happening to tables today.
- quotes from Wark on the vector
- measure of distance -- and its use in knn
- fitting a line -- the cost of the mode
- creation of volumes by multiplication 
- the dot product or inner product - creates the vector space
-  Knowledge as a 'mechanism of statements and visibilities'
-  generalization as what cannot be seen

## ch function


- add secondary refs from zotero on steepest descent
- comment on other optimisation algorithms -- EM; non-gradient-based; Newton-Raphson; etc
- more on SAheart example
- diagrams of the problem of classification

## ch allness

## ch dimensional


- vapnik and russia vs decision tree/random forest (Breiman; St Ives)
- what happens in code here -- the inner product; the recursive, the backprop algorithm ... 
- what happens to knowledge -- knowledge understood in Foucaultean sense as savoir;  the discursive practices that criss words and things
- the dispersion of techniques in domains suggests something like an enunciative function; at the same time, the techniques themselves are statements addressing a common problem around separating that which overlaps or blurs; 
- another form of dispersion -- the same techniques found in different fields under different names -- e.g. reinforcement rule learning

## ch genome

- spectacular indexicality is a key theme here -- need to massively strengthen this
- conclusion is still not right -- shorten it
- knn discussion is not properly integrated -- how to do that? Does the technique itself suggest a manner of moving? also, it's not of khan, golub, etc -- redo with Khan; add hclust dendrogram
- clustering, etc. not represented, but important -- use images for this
- quotes from fix are not here properly -- integrate them -- especially the one about non-parametric, blah, blah
- circo diagram of the disciplines and techniques?

## ch subject


- the programming of ml as the backpropagation and feed forward of machine learning as function finding into finding a function for machine learning 
- hinton -- backpropagation of error -- the 1986 nature paper uses examples of people
- 'generalization error is what we care about' [@Ng_2008f]
- deep neural nets [@Hassabis_2013] should appear here
- the Higgs Boson challenge
- MF in d&p writes about how the individual internalises the disciplinary mechanism -- we are all machine learners now?
- the masculinity of machine learning -- how to deal with that? some prominent women, but massively masculinist -- takes me back to 1996 publication - also use SI of angelaki on geophilosophy of masculinity. See zotero masculinity folder
- the people change alongside the data; their sense of the power of data has a cost for them too
- put in Perlich stuff about data leakage -- really important to focus on competition as a way of showing how people do things
- we finally reach people -- why so late? And so what?
- use Lazzarato here -- semiotics, etc
- MF from archaeology of knowledge on the subject in the discursive formation

## conclusion

- present what I've been doing as an account of a transformation in human-machine relations; something that transforms scale, agency, dispersion, etc;
- return to 'into' and 'out' of the data: so many attempts to get things out of the data; little effort to puts things into the data;
- what if this book was a model -- what kind of model would it be
- overview of the parts, and the chapters
- the media-science-government
- I use media as shorthand for media in general: they are things or infrastructures, which are also things, and things are media (Lash & Lury)
- why I haven't done critique of surveillance, etc? Or of the hype?
- what does it add to have this concrete account of abstraction?
- what does it add to have followed some of the infrastructures, implementations, etc 
- what happened to the affective/psychoanalytic/movement in thought?
- the praxiography -- writing code as practice that allows something about movement to be contoured and perhaps countered.
