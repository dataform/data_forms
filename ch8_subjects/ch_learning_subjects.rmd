# 8. Optimising machine learners

## to do

- deep neural networks [@Hassabis_2013] should appear here
- the Higgs Boson challenge
- MF in d&p writes about how the individual internalises the disciplinary mechanism -- we are all machine learners now?
- the masculinity of machine learning -- how to deal with that? some prominent women, but massively masculinist -- takes me back to 1996 publication - also use SI of angelaki on geophilosophy of masculinity. See zotero masculinity folder
- my experience with vlad, sitting apart from everyone working on the neural networks -- such a shift
- the people change alongside the data; their sense of the power of data has a cost for them too
- put in Perlich stuff about data leakage -- really important to focus on competition as a way of showing how people do things
- we finally reach people -- why so late? And so what?
- use Lazzarato here -- semiotics, etc
- MF from archaeology of knowledge on the subject in the discursive formation

## Introduction

> It is the privileged machine in this context that creates its marginalized human others [@Suchman_2006, 269]

> If a proposition, a sentence, a group of signs can be called 'statement' , it is not therefore because, one day, someone happened to speak them or put them into some concrete form of writing; it is because the position of the subject can be assigned [@Foucault_1972,  95]

Throughout 

## People at the intersection or in a hierarchy

-- cf Ng, Hassabis, Hinton, Le Cun, etc. with others

## Competition and the work of optimisation

## Programming as intersectional practice

## The privilege of machine learning
