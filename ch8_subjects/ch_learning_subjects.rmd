# 8. Optimising machine learners to learn on their own

## to do

- 'neural nets were the best for many years' [@Ng_2008b]. 
- 'generalization error is what we care about' [@Ng_2008f]
- deep neural nets [@Hassabis_2013] should appear here
- the Higgs Boson challenge
- MF in d&p writes about how the individual internalises the disciplinary mechanism -- we are all machine learners now?
- the masculinity of machine learning -- how to deal with that? some prominent women, but massively masculinist -- takes me back to 1996 publication - also use SI of angelaki on geophilosophy of masculinity. See zotero masculinity folder
- my experience with vlad, sitting apart from everyone working on the neural nets -- such a shift
- the people change alongside the data; their sense of the power of data has a cost for them too
- put in Perlich stuff about data leakage -- really important to focus on competition as a way of showing how people do things
- we finally reach people -- why so late? And so what?
- use Lazzarato here -- semiotics, etc
- MF from archaeology of knowledge on the subject in the discursive formation

## Introduction

> It is the privileged machine in this context that creates its marginalized human others [@Suchman_2006, 269]

> If a proposition, a sentence, a group of signs can be called 'statement' , it is not therefore because, one day, someone happened to speak them or put them into some concrete form of writing; it is because the position of the subject can be assigned [@Foucault_1972,  95]

In almost every machine learning class, neural nets make some appearance. They have an ambivalent status. In Andrew Ng's Stanford CS229 lectures from 2007, neural nets receive somewhat short shrift: around 30 minutes of discussion in Lecture 6, in between Naive Bayes classifiers and several lectures on support vector machines [@Ng_2008b]. As he introduces a video of an autonomous vehicle steered by a neural net after a 20 minute training session with a human driver, Ng comments that 'neural nets were the best for many years.' The lectures quickly moves on to the successor, support vector machines.  In _Elements of Statistical Learning_, the whole of chapter 11 is on the topic, but prefaced by a discussion of the method of 'projection pursuit regression' in which the inception of 'projection pursuit' is dated to 1974. In _An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R_, a book whose authors include Hastie and Tibshirani, neural nets are not discussed and indeed not mentioned [@James_2013]. Willi Richert and Luis Pedro Coelho's _Building Machine Learning Systems with Python_ likewise does not mention them. Cathy O'Neil and Rachel Schutt's _Doing Data Science_ mention them but don't discuss them [@Schutt_2013], whereas both Brett Lantz's _Machine Learning with R_ [@Lantz_2013] and Matthew Kirk's _Thoughtful Machine Learning_ [@Kirk_2014] devote chapters to them. In the broader cannon of machine learning texts, the computer scientist Christopher Bishop's heavily cited books on pattern recognition dwell extensively on neural nets [@Bishop_1995; @Bishop_2006]. Amongst statisticians, Brian Ripley's _Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks_ [@Ripley_1996], also highly cited, placed a great deal of emphasis on them. 

The somewhat uneven presence of neural nets amongst machine learning literature finds parallels in the fortunes of machine learners. Yann LeCun's work on optical character recognition during 1980-1990s, and the implementations in `LeNet` led many machine learning  competitions. In 2007, Andrew Ng is casually observing that neural nets _were_ the best, but in  2014, LeCun find himself working on machine learning at Facebook. Similarly, the cognitive psychologist Geoffrey Hinton's involvement in the early 1980s work on connectionist learning procedures in neural nets and subsequently on 'deep learning nets' [@Hinton_2006] delivers him to Google in 2013. These trajectories between academic research and industry are not unusual. Many of the techniques in machine learning have been incorporated into companies later acquired by other larger companies. Even if there is no spin-off company to be acquired, machine learners themselves have been assigned key positions in many industry settings. Corinna Cortes, co-inventor with Vladimir Vapnik of the  support vector machine, heads research at Google New York. Ng himself in 2014 began work as chief scientist for the Chinese search engine, Baidu leading a team of AI researchers specializing in 'deep learning,' the contemporary incarnation of neural nets [@Hof_2014]. In 2011, Ng led a neural net-based project at Google that had, among other things, detected cats  in millions of hours of Youtube videos.[^8.1]

What accounts for the somewhat uneven fortunes of the neural net amongst machine learners? The unevenness of their performance, from curiosity to best, from second best to spectacular promise, suggests that some powerful dynamics or becomings are in play around them. These dynamics are not easily understood in terms of celebrity machine learners (human and non-human) suddenly rising to prominent or privileged positions in the research departments of social media platforms.[^8.2]  Nor does it make sense to attribute the rising fortunes of the neural net to the algorithms themselves. The algorithms used in neural net have not, as we will see, been radically transformed in their core operations. There have been important changes in scale (similar to those described in the previous chapter in the case of the `RF-ACE` algorithm and Google Compute). While machine learners in their machine form can be assigned a privileged position in the transformations of knowledge and action today, human machine learners are not exactly marginalized, at least in high profile cases such as Ng, LeCun, Hinton and others. Rather, the scale of machine learning seems to be changing both for the algorithms and for the human computer scientists, programmers and engineers. 

[^8.1]: Unlike the cats detected by `kittydar,` the software discussed in the introduction to this book, the Google experiment did not use supervised learning. The deep learning approach was unsupervised [@Markoff_2012]. That is, the neural nets were not given images in which cats were labelled to train on. 

[^8.2]: In any case, social media and search engines cannot be understood apart from the machine learning techniques that have been thoroughly woven through them since their inception.  Hence _Elements of Statistical Learning_ devotes several pages Google's famous _PageRank_ algorithm, describing it as an unsupervised learner [@Hastie_2009, 576-578].


## What do machine learners need to do?

[HERE]

>The big picture is that given data, a real-world classification problem, and constraints, you need to determine:
    1. Which classifier to use
    2. Which optimization method to employ
    3. Which loss function to minimize
    4. Which features to take from the data
    5. Which evaluation metric to use
    [@Schutt_2013, 116]
