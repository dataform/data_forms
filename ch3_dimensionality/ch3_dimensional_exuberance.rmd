# Dimensional exuberance and pattern recognition in movement

## overview

- recap of vector space, function and the sheer proliferation of algorithms: some basic intuitions - -cut a space; embed the space in a higher dimensional context; 
- return to vector space as the guiding model -- both critical of this -- it linearises but is tricked out in various ways
- pattern discovery -- pathetic or worthwhile?

## main arguments

- is there any possibility of an affirmative relationship to machine learning? Under what conditions? -- return to the ones I set out in ch1: Rabinow, Whitehead, Wilson, etc. Now want to ground those in some particular techniques that cut/include the world in different ways
- so many techniques to choose from: can only choose something whose specificity itself configures the literature, the field of practice, the knowledge economy in its own ways. 
    - choosing 3 techniques that include many other techniques in them somehow
        - random forests include many decision trees - 60-70s
        - neural networks include many logistic regressions and perceptrons - 50s
        - svms include many different dimensions -- basis functions + inner product (avoiding calculating too much); also Fisher's LDA - 30s
- see that including as countenancing alternatives -- and hence flashes of mentality into algorithms
- That is, to take the SVM  or NN or the Decision Tree seriously is already to understand the world in a particular way; each of them are monadologically potent; they express a world. 
- What we can do with this grip on the world? The idea of relaying it -- pursuing motion through experiments with forms of movement through scale and subjectivity
	- implementation as experiment in forms of movement -- the inner product, 
- How do they express/contain/grip the world?
	- critical argument: incredibly rigid approach in some ways to flux and change; what do we do with that rigidity?
	- extrinsic vs intrinsic structure: link to Whitehead can also use the shapeofdata stuff; -- key point -- how the vector space is reshaped; or not. Or the extraordinary efforts to get the vector space to accommodate differences
	- classification as the key problem: linear separability vs non-linear separability; strict splits vs shades of difference
	- making things linear in high dim: good or bad?  15 dim patterns

## Introduction

Under what conditions would it be possible to have an affirmative relationship to machine learning? The problem in answering this question is that there are so many techniques to choose from, and each of these techniques includes and  cuts the world in different ways. The list of techniques and the domain of their application is, as we have seen, huge.

The machine learning literature itself has a huge, fluxing dimensionality, not easily captured by search terms. The academic papers themselves are daunting in their bulk and variety, before we even try to move into the much more crowded and heavily trafficked domains where machine learning is practiced.  This literature itself, viewed in machine learning terms, comprises a high-dimensional vector space, whose features and attributes unstably move around as the techniques find new applications, as computer scientists, engineers, statisticians and others work on reshaping them.  Viewed as a bundle of divergent, tangled trajectories in a high-dimensional social-material space, machine learning (or data-mining) can be described, sorted, and classified  in different ways. The question is: what form of movement, from trajectories through the forest of practices associated with machine learning would allow us to inhabit the space of machine learning? What kinds of scales and subject positions would we need to move through in order to do that?

As I have emphasised previously, the form of movement through machine learning I'm experimenting with here is recursive or loopy. That is, rather than describing machine learning from the outside, or participating in it as an observer (participant observation, or even observant participation), I'm attempting to find ways of moving through machine learning by learning machine learning. And as the previous chapter discussed, here the term 'learning' is somewhat overloaded with multiple meanings. But the motivation is similar to what the anthropologist Paul Rabinow advocates: 'pursuing in our thought and writing something like motion, through different scales and different subject positions. ... Such movement is easy to initiate and hard to master. Yet I firmly believe that in the actual conjuncture of things, it is a paramount challenge for philosophy and the human sciences to experiment with forms that will be, if not fully adequate to, at least cognizant of, the need for such movement through scale and subjectivity' [@rabinow_anthropos_2003, 135-6]. This formulation resonates strongly for me. Learning machine learning is a form of movement through textbooks, scientific articles, online tutorials, Wikipedia pages, software documentation and many lines of `R` or `python` code. As Rabinow mentions, it is easy to start moving through machine learning, but hard to control that movement. I have found myself careening through websites, software manuals, YouTube lectures on machine learning, short intensive courses on data mining, news reports, APIs, code repositories and various code fragments.  Much of this movement has been saccadic (TBC) and aleatory rather than purposive or Dao-like, and only in writing now, in attempting to connect code, literature, people and events, might this movement take shape.

The descriptive challenge entailed in this movement was scenically figured more than a decade ago by Geoffrey Bowker and Susan Leigh Star in their work on classification systems. They wrote then:

> Imagine you are walking through a forest of interarticulated branches. Some are covered with ice or snow, and the suns melts their touching tips to reveal space between. Some are so thickly brambled they seem solid; others are oddly angular in nature, like esplanaded trees.  Some of the trees are wild, some have been cultivated ... Helicopters flying overhead can quickly tell your many types of each, even each leaf, there are in the world, but they cannot yet give you a guidebook for bird-watching or forestry conservation. There is a lot of underbrush and a complex ecology of soil bacteria, flora and fauna.  ... Now imagine that the forest is a huge information space and each of the trees and bushes are classification systems.  ... Your job is to describe this forest. [@bowker_sorting_1999,31-32]
 
Bowker and Star refer here to a variety of standardised classification systems running across sciences, institutions, industries and geographies. The classification systems exemplified in machine learning are in some ways much less diverse than Bowker and Star's examples in that they do not directly index a plurality of practices. Indeed, machine learning in many cases seek to reduce the plurality of practices to a set of algorithmic processes that can be monitored and controlled directly.  Nevertheless, a clear resonance between the Bowker and Star's challenge and the problems of machine learning comes through: much, perhaps most,  machine learning practice concerns classification. Many of the best-known and most widely used contemporary techniques -- logistic regression, neural networks, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines and a variety of clustering techniques --- largely focus on classification problems. As it turns out, at the very time Bowker and Star were writing about the interarticulated forest of classification systems, RandomForests (TM) were being developed as a way of navigating huge information spaces. Statisticians such as Leo Breiman at UCLA were assembling decision trees (a technique I discuss below) into forests that could classify [@breiman_random_2001].  In the machine learning literature,  the random forest paper is the most highly cited reference [@breiman_random_2001]. According to Thomson Scientific Web of Science/ISI, this paper has been cited  `r ml_df$TC[1]` times. Like two other key machine learning techniques of neural networks and support vector machines that were heavily developed in the late 1990s, random forests provided different ways of moving through the thicket of possible connections, associations, features and relations occasioned by digital data, especially as online data sets were becoming available.  Each of these techniques of random forests, neural networks and support vector machine, as I will discuss below, took an existing predictive or classificatory technique and internalised it in order to deal with the problems of a disorientating profusion of  possible classifications. With lesser and greater degrees of success, they brought together different scales of movement, and different ways of including the world. 

So in a way, machine learning has been taking on the job that Bowker and Star envisaged: 'imagine you are walking in a forest -- describe this forest.' But the forest we are moving in here is a forest of machine learning classifiers, mainly taking root in the  scientific-technical literature and associated software implementations.  The basic intuitions underlying  machine learning classification are not hard to grasp. We have already seen a few versions of it. Logistic regression, the technique discussed in the previous chapter and pervasively used in biomedical sciences, is a mainstay of classification techniques.  The techniques of decision trees, random forests, neural networks and support vector machines I will discuss here display many commonalities in their treatment of data.  They all  attempt to find ways of moving through data, and dealing with problems of deciding what groups, classes or sets things belong to, without having to know too much about  the world that data indexes. At the same time, or strictly speaking, slightly afterwards, these techniques themselves move through the world. Their movement is never purely abstract, as if they only inhabited a mathematical forest, although it possesses a certain texture or specificity. As with all functions, indelible residues of indexicality entangle machine learning technique with matters of fact. I like the way the biostatisticians  James Malley, Karen Malley and Sinisa Pajevic describe machine learning: 'if the data has any signal at all then most machines will detect it' but 'we freely admit that many machines tudies in this text are somewhat mysterious, though powerful engines' [@malley_statistical_2011, 257]. As we will see, the ways in which machine learning methods move through data detecting signals are intensively theorised yet at the same time not well understood.

    print(xtable(head(aid_df[,c('TI', 'PY' ,'TC')],10)))
```

Work on classification and regression techniques using decision tree algorithms goes back to the 1960s when statisticians were attempting to analyse increasingly large social survey datasets [@morgan_problems_1963].  As Dan Steinberg describes in his brief history of decision trees [@steinberg_cart_2009, 180], the decision tree or 'automatic interaction detector' (AID) as it was known sought to automate the practice of data analysts looking for interactions between different variables. The variety and sheer optimism of applications of these prototype decision tree techniques  is striking.  Papers that cite the AID paper or use AID techniques can be found, as the table shows, in education, politics, economics, population control, advertising, mass media and family planning. A decade after initial work, the AID was the object of trenchant criticism by statisticians and others. Statisticians such as Hillel Einhorn at the University of Chicago castigated the use of such techniques in the behavioural sciences partly out of a general distrust of 'purely empirical methods':

> The purely empirical approach is particularly dangerous in an age when computers and packaged programs are readily available, since there is temptation to substitute immediate empirical analysis for more analytic thought and theory building. It is also probably too much to hope that a majority of researchers will take the time to find out how and why a particular program works. The chief interest will continue to be in the output-the results-with as little delay as possible [@einhorn_alchemy_1972, 368]

Einhorn discusses AID alongside other still widely used techniques such as factor analysis and multi-dimensional scaling before concluding 'it should be clear that proceeding without a theory and with powerful data analytic techniques can lead to large numbers of Type I errors' [@einhorn_alchemy_1972, 378]. His specific objections to AID are  particularly focused on the problematic power of the technique: 'it may make sense out of "noise"' (369). Consequently, researchers easily misuse the technique: they 'overfit' the data, and do not pay enough attention to issues of validation (369-370). Similarly the British marketing researcher Peter Doyle, criticising the use of AID in assessing store performance and site selection by operation researchers, complained that searching for patterns in data using small data sets was bound to lead to spurious results and the decision trees, although intuitively appealing (that is, they could be easily interpreted), could easily change: 'a second variable may be almost as discriminating as the one chosen, but if the program is made to split on this, quite a different tree occurs' [@doyle_use_1973, 465-466].     It probably was too much to hope that a majority of researchers would take time to investigate how a particular program works.  The problem of what computers do to the analysis of empirical data is long-standing! 

Writing in 2008, however,  Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman recommend decision trees as the best off-the-shelf classifier:  'Of all the well-known learning methods, decision trees comes closest to meeting the requirements for serving as an off-the-shelf procedure for data-mining' [@hastie_elements_2009, 352]. Building decision trees is today a very common machine learning practice.  In 2013, Salford Systems, the purveyors of the leading contemporary commercial decision tree software, CART, claim:

 > CART is the ultimate classification tree that has revolutionized the entire field of advanced analytics and inaugurated the current era of data mining. CART, which is continually being improved, is one of the most important tools in modern data mining. Others have tried to copy CART but no one has succeeded as evidenced by unmatched accuracy, performance, feature set, built-in automation and ease of use. [Salford Systems](http://www.salford-systems.com/products/cart)

What happened in the intervening years?  Decision trees grew from statistical pariahs in the early 1970s to inaugurate the 'current era of datamining' (1990s-?). As the earlier citation from the biostatisticians Malley, Malley and Pajevic indicates, decision trees enjoy high regard even in biomedical research where statistical rigour is highly encouraged. As it turns out, working at the US Department of Energy's Stanford Linear Accelerator during the late 1970s, Jerome Friedman, the third author of Hastie, Tibshirani  and Friedman, was  instrumental in rescuing  decision trees from oblivion they had entered in the late 1960s ()see [@steinberg_cart_2009] for a brief history).

Today, the standard decision tree package for `R` is `rpart`. `rpart` is a contraction of 'recursive partitioning' and this term generally describes how the decision tree algorithm works.  R.A. Fisher's _iris_ dataset, which reports on the measurements of petal and sepal lengths of _iris virginica, iris setosa_ and _iris versicolor_,  is often used to present classification techniques. The usual framing of the classification problem is how to decide whether a given iris blossom is _virginica_, _setosa_ or _versicolor_.   While the _iris_ dataset is quite small, it supports a richly populated ecosystem of examples scattered across the machine learning literature. These irises don't grow in forests -- they are more often found in riverbanks and meadows --  but they do offer a variety of illustrations of how machine learning classifiers are brought to bear on classification problems. Here the classification is taxonomic - the  iris genus has various sub-genera, and sections within the sub-genera. _Setosa, _virginica_ and _versicolor_ all belong to the sub-genus _Limniris_. This botanical complication is  largely ignored in  most machine learning applications. In machine learning textbooks and tutorials, iris would be used to demonstrate how cleanly a classifier can separate the different kinds of irises. 


```{r iris_tree, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=NA, size='smallsize', results='asis' } 

    #load iris dataset
    data(iris)

    #load decision tree library
    library(rpart)

    #construct decision tree to classify iris by species
    ir.rp =rpart(Species ~ ., iris)
```

The code shown here loads the _iris_ data ( a dataset  is bundled with many data analysis tools), loads the `R` decision tree library, and builds a decision tree to classify the irises by species.  What has happened to the iris data in this decision tree? The `R` code that invokes the decision tree model is so brief `ir.rp =rpart(Species ~ ., iris)` that we can't tell much about how the data has been recursively partitioned. We know that the _iris_ has `r nrow(iris)` rows, and that there are equal numbers of the three iris varieties. The results of the partitioning can be seen below in two plots. 

```{r iris_tree_plot, echo=FALSE,  fig.cap ='Decision tree on _iris_ dataset', cache=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=NA, results='asis' } 

    #plot the tree
    par(mfrow = c(1,2), xpd=NA)
    plot(ir.rp, main = 'tree recursive partitioning of iris')
    text(ir.rp, cex=0.8, use.n=TRUE)
    table(iris$Species) # is data.frame with 'Species' factor
     iS <- iris$Species == "setosa"
     iV <- iris$Species == "versicolor"
     op <- par(bg = "bisque")
     matplot(c(1, 8), c(0, 4.5), type =  "n", xlab = "Length", ylab = "Width",
             main = "Petal and Sepal Dimensions in Iris Blossoms")
     matpoints(iris[iS,c(1,3)], iris[iS,c(2,4)], pch = "sS", col = c(2,4))
     matpoints(iris[iV,c(1,3)], iris[iV,c(2,4)], pch = "vV", col = c(2,4))
     legend(1, 4, c("    Setosa Petals", "    Setosa Sepals",
                    "Versicolor Petals", "Versicolor Sepals"),
            pch = "sSvV", col = rep(c(2,4), 2))
```

The plot on the left shows the decision tree and the plot on the right shows just _setosa_ and _versicolor_  plotted by petal and sepal widths and lengths.  As the plot on the right shows, most of the measurements are well clustered. Only the _setosa_ petal lengths and widths seem to vary widely. All the other measurements are tightly bunched. This means that the decision tree shown on the left has little trouble classifying the irises. Decision trees are read from the top down, left to right. The top level of this tree can be read, for instance, as saying, if the length of petal is less 2.45, then the iris is _setosa_. Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman  suggest that 'a key advantage of the recursive binary tree is its interpretability. The feature space partition is fully described a by single tree.  ... This representation is popular among medical scientists, perhaps because it mimics the way a doctor thinks.  The tree stratifies the population into strata of high and low outcome, on the basis of patient characteristics' [@hastie_elements_2009, 306-7]. I would differ from them on this point.  Decision trees do indeed have a rich  medical, as well  commercial and industrial history of use. And yes, decision trees and their later variations (such  as`C4.5`, the 'top' data-mining algorithm according to a survey of data miners in 2009 [@wu_top_2008] was developing during the 1980s in response to Friedman's work on decision trees) are often presented as easy to use because they are 'not unlike the serious of troubleshooting questions you might find in your car's manual to help determine what could be wrong with the vehicle' [@wu_top_2008,2]. (But who actually reads car manuals?) While that scenario is unlikely today, especially as Google sends autonomous-driving cars out onto the roads of California undoubtedly controlled by a variety of classifiers such as decision trees, neural networks and support vector machines, the recursive partitioning technique still has a great deal of traction in machine learning practice precisely because of its simplicity.

    ml_df = ml_df[order(ml_df$TC, decreasing=TRUE),]
    print(xtable(head(ml_df[,c('TI', 'TC')])))

```

The history of the decision trees  criss-crosses behavioural, biomedical and associated statistical sciences. This prolixity or associativity of decision trees can be seen in the scientific literature.  A Thomson Reuters 'Web of Science' query on 'decision tree' across all indexes returns roughly 10,000 results. Just looking at the most highly cited results in this set, we can see that 'decision tree' plays a role in a psychiatric diagnostic procedure in 1992, in clinical decision making in 1993,  in helping sort out astronomical observations in 2000, in a serum protein matching test for distinguishing benign and non-benign prostate cancer in 2002,  or in bringing biometric data together to uniquely identify individuals in 2003. (A similar but more restricted Web of Science query on the specific version of decision tree developed by Friedman for the 1984 book _Classification and Regression Trees_ yields 1600 results, and the fields of application are just as varied.) While the most cited paper (the psychiatric diagnostic test) does not actually use machine learning, all the others do, and in greatly varying ways. The question then is how such a huge lateral slippage  occurring? What is it about decision trees that allows them to move across different settings so readily?

It is worthwhile looking at what actually happens to the data as  a decision tree is constructed in standard decision tree software such as `rpart` or its Python equivalents. 'Tree-based methods partition the feature space into a set of rectangles and then fit a simple model (like a constant) in each one. They are conceptually simple yet powerful' [@hastie_elements_2009, 305].  This specification is quite precise. The tree method  partitions data into _rectangles_, but the rectangles cannot overlap or in any way deviate alignment with the horizontal or vertical axes. The binary partitions produced are like housing plots of various sizes lined up within a block. As usual in  descriptions of machine learning techniques, the metaphors and analogies are two or three dimensional, but the practical implementations work in much higher dimensions.

In the example shown above, the different shadings of the rectangles indicate areas that the decision tree has classified in different species. While these decision surfaces look somewhat irregularly , they are all   combinations of rectangles.  The plots above, again, show 'decision surfaces' in two dimensions, but the dataset has at least five dimensions (petal width, petal length, sepal width, sepal length, species). The splitting of variables into pairs and then plotting them against each other is a way to put this decision surface in some perspective. As often happens in machine learning, it is not possible to see data in all its dimensionality. Instead, machine learning techniques often construct some perspective that allows the reshaping of the data to become visible in some part. 

What happens in decision trees to differences and in particular those differences that we regard as important enough to develop classifications for? Whitehead suggests that 'sharp-cut scientific classifications are essential for scientific method. But they are dangerous for philosophy. Such classification hides the truth that the different modes of natural existence shade off into each other' [@whitehead_modes_1956, 215]. Decision trees actually take this truth to heart. In higher dimensional feature spaces, many different classifications are possible and a huge number of different trees could be constructed for any given dataset. Even for the _iris_ dataset,  different implementations of the algorithm generate different results because of the way they optimise the tree they select.  Given that the aim is to generate a rule that best separates categories or classes of subjects, events or things of interest, how can decision tree techniques deal with this potential proliferation of rules?  In some ways, it seems that the decision tree researchers were reading actor-network theory as they developed the recursive partitioning algorithms. On the one hand, they are almost agnostic about differences in the world. As the biostatisticians Malley, Malley and Pajevic write in their account, 'no distributional assumptions or other statistical premises are made in decision trees concerning the features or the subjects' [@malley_statistical_2011, 20]. 'Wait,' readers of actor network theory might say, 'that sounds like the ontological pluralism of actor network theory, or William James or A.N. Whitehead.' Indeed, decision trees (and as we'll see, random forests) are emphatically agnostic about what differences matter in principle.  But their almost inexhaustible capacity to accommodate differences can make them unstable. 

To see this instability, and how machine learning practice tries to regulate it, we need to delve a little further into the algorithm. The problem with _iris_ is that the species actually ontically separate. The pattern of separation that the decision tree algorithm finds exists in the world for us too, except when, as happens, species of iris hybridise with each other. In many cases, things as Whitehead suggests, are not cleanly separable. Often there is some pattern of separation, perhaps in the form of overlapping clusters or clouds of points, but not enough to define a simple set of decision rules.  (As we will see that support vector machines, with their 'maximum margin hyperplanes,' take these overlaps as given, and build models focused on the overlaps.) How then does a decision tree decide how to split things? What counts as a good split has been a long standing topic of debate in the decision tree literature. Choosing where to cut: this is a key problem for classification or decision trees. As Malley, Malley and Pajevic observe, 'the challenge is to define _good_ when its clear that no obviously excellent split is easily available' [@malley_statistical_2011, 121].  The definition of 'good' that has emerged in the decision tree literature is centred on 'node purity.'

TBC: the node purity discussion; tree pruning and its complications. Somehow jump to random forests ...

notion of pattern involves the concept of different modes of togetherness MoT, 195-6

Thus beyond all questions of quantity, there lie questions of pattern, which are essential for the understanding of nature. Apart from a presupposed pattern, quantity determines nothing. Indeed quantity itself is nothing other than analogy of functions within analogous patterns W, MoT, 195
