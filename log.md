- fixing up the bibliography; modified the zotero export to exclude large fields (like notes, abstract); modifying mybook package to suppress other fields
- struggling with 'last accessed' field -- that needs to be 'by type'. 
- sorted this out by adding stuff to 'mybook.sty' --\clearfield(urlyear},etc. A bit of pfaff and took me all morning, but references are now much cleaner. 
- will go through rest of reference list adding page numbers, etc.

- reading conclusion (crap!) + intro to see how they map onto each other. Not too much at th e moment
- adding new index entries into index on a couple of docs.

- finally managed to read intro and conclusion. Started work on glossary and fixed googletrends code.
- collated some Domingos quotes in a notes file

- read chapter 1 on diagramming -- quite a bit of reasonable stuff in there, but its too vague in its claims;
- did quite a bit of work getting some foucault quotes, and hyperobjects descriptions. 
- considering whether to reoroder the chapter to start with NAND function, program it and then learn it. We get from NAND to perceptron via rosenblatt, and then programs, and then their formalization as a machine learner; and this machine learner is just one of many that might be constructed. We get sense of their plenitude, their accumulation in learning machine learning, in seeing who is machine learning, in seeing the practice of machine learning in code, and in the archives of contemporary knowledge production.

- getting glossaries to work -- seems to be ok. 
- also played with separate bibliographies for primary and 2ndary sources -- sample code is in testbib in latex folder; instructions on how to do this are in glossaries how to pdf in latex folder

- read 1/3 ch2 on vector space -- doesn't seem too bad. Still need to spend quite a bit of work to get it clearer.
- sorting references into primary and 2ndary -- found Hansen on Faucault and media; worth reading perhaps -- in archive
- read rest of ch2 -- its ok -- needs quite a bit of tightening, and not sure hw well the code vectorisation stuff fits. Needs to be also be understood as a topos, or some other threshold thing.

- reading ch4 -- ok so far. Not sure of what the hook is: slippage between different senses of function (superimposed thresholds!) or something else
- need to resize tables, so did that by adding lines to mybook.sty; trying to rebuild with that. ; ok, worked by putting size in the xtable options at beginning of knitr code. Need to put this across all the chapters. 
- got 10 pages into chapter, but still no strong hook -- optimisation is what I want to get to -- to say that the threshold that has been crossed is one in which learning == optimisation, and optimisation is a kind of searching

## Thu May 19 16:24:19 BST 2016

- got a fair ways  through ch4 on curves -- learning is still struggling to get through -- so complicated to disentangle all the functions
- also played with building everything on hp machine -- didn#t go so well. Some missing dependencies?
- talked to press about deadline -- mid-July -- need to work back from that ...
