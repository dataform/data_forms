- fixing up the bibliography; modified the zotero export to exclude large fields (like notes, abstract); modifying mybook package to suppress other fields
- struggling with 'last accessed' field -- that needs to be 'by type'. 
- sorted this out by adding stuff to 'mybook.sty' --\clearfield(urlyear},etc. A bit of pfaff and took me all morning, but references are now much cleaner. 
- will go through rest of reference list adding page numbers, etc.

- read chapter 1 on diagramming -- quite a bit of reasonable stuff in there, but its too vague in its claims;
- did quite a bit of work getting some foucault quotes, and hyperobjects descriptions. 
- considering whether to reoroder the chapter to start with NAND function, program it and then learn it. We get from NAND to perceptron via rosenblatt, and then programs, and then their formalization as a machine learner; and this machine learner is just one of many that might be constructed. We get sense of their plenitude, their accumulation in learning machine learning, in seeing who is machine learning, in seeing the practice of machine learning in code, and in the archives of contemporary knowledge production.
