- ideas for the Governing Prediction event in Paris september:
     - I don't want to do a new paper, so the question is: what do I have in the book that I can use to talk about governance;
     - Could just go with a basic Foucaultean argument about the observer and its transformation in ml.  That might mean using a bit of the Crary stuff, or my own account of what governs the production of statements. 
    - possible topics include the fake news stuff? Would that be enough? Or something more focused on a particular domain? Is there some dataset that is particularly problematic around governance that I could focus on. 
        - maybe all datasets are problematic in that they are tables. A new mode of inhabiting the table. Isn't that my key argument? How would I exemplify that? By working through an example of what happens to an image in a CNN? What happens to faces, for instance, in the predictive classificatory orderings?  
     - what about GDELT as a system? How does that fit into governance?  
     - or what about the Google global fishing example? and how that compares with what the NSA does? Or the Facebook case? Or the role of Cambridge Analytics in elections? 
     - could make my life a bit easier by using the Planetary Settlement Project and the ways in which governance (biopolitical, economic, etc.) switches around to predictive operationality; maybe in all of these, the question is bringing governance to bear on that which previously had not been governed. The multiplicity. 
     - But I don't do governance. what is governance? How does it related to governmentality?  could follow Barry who sees tech as an orientation to the political present. That could be a useful tension: predictive operationality and the invention of political institutions  
     - possible titles: predictive operationality and the invention of political institutions
     - to contextualise: Jasanoff's work on policy/government/science? Is science a key figure for me?
     - a key question (following Lynch on epistoics) -- how does something get described as a prediction? And what about all the things that are predictive, but not named as such? This is hardly ever talked about ...

- I don't what governance is. What is it? Is it the same as governing? Also, where does governmentality fit? 
- downloaded 2500 records on governmentality and saved in support/gov.tsv 
- working on titles more

- need to send the title, but don't want to do the new work.
- listened to a podcast - twice -- interview with Andrew Hwang, global policy lead for AI at google. He doesn't seem to be able to talk about policy, but mentioned some useful examples and leads on it
    - UK and Obama US reports on AI
    - need to look at very localized, mundane transformations
    - understanding of policy as the link between tech and social change; 
    - has some stuff on fairness and why its not an interesting topic
    - also on explainability and its requirements; 
    - books to look at: Ian Goodfellow and the Cybersyn book 
- DONE: check library for these - DONE
- could just talk about the challenge of explainability based on 'vectorisation and its consequences' 
- there's quite a lot happening in terms of fairness(?). Maybe

- been thinking that for me the arguments about fairness, discrimination, explainability all come too late. If governance is always part of the situation, and governmentality involves forms of observation, what happens with the change in observer?  
- possible titles:
    - Techniques of the Predictor;
    - Vectorising things out: prediction and its consequences
- looking at literature -- key references cited around governmentality are Dean 1999, Foucault, 1991, Rose 1997, Foucault 2007, and Beck as well as Andrew Barry 1996 

## Fri 23 Jun 2017 14:08:42 BST
- still wrestling a bit with writing this abstract -- I don't want to commit myself to new work. But did look at references that are most cited: Foucault, 2007 can be found at http://lib.myilibrary.com.ezproxy.lancs.ac.uk/Open.aspx?id=317917
- put a quote from this at ~/notes/foucault_security_2007.md
- abstract for Paris:

> Techniques of the Predictor: generalizing complex populations

> A strikingly active policy-oriented apparatus has begun to emerge around certain forms of prediction associated with technology platforms. Unlike the predictive models that have long been part of the sciences, a set of institutions, procedures, calculations and operations have begin to take shape around problems of opacity, discrimination,  ownership and extension of predictive models in populations. In this paper, I will suggest that the governmentality of prediction currently taking shape can be understood from the perspective of what we might term 'techniques of the predictor' (after Crary's 'techniques of the observer').  Techniques of the predictor mobilise specific operational statements (classifications, identifications, rankings and recommendations), and generalize their production in new populations. The emerging governmentality of prediction might be see as part of the regularization of this mobilizing production.

- I listened twice to that podcast from the google policy person -- its on the phone. 
- Conference sent me this briefing:

Thanks again for taking part in the conference in September in Paris. This message is to give you some background on the conference and its objectives, and provide some indications that may be useful to keep in mind when developing your talk.

The conference concludes our three-year comparative project on computation, prediction and policy, in which we looked at the evolution of the dominant modes of computation used in the area of energy policy-making, chemicals regulation and crime control. The heterogeneity of the policies we looked at meant that we considered quite diverse forms of computation/modelling, which had in common to help institutions predict or anticipate future issues, making policy more future-oriented – at least rhetorically.

The conference will also be comparative, with papers on modelling and computation in the area of security, transport, environment, energy, food and health. There will also be diversity in the practices, tools and cultures of modelling and computation that will be talked about, obviously, with some sectors discussing more established forms of statistical modelling, and others being on the more recent developments in terms of predictive analytics.

This is an occasion to develop a more general analysis of how and why the practice of modelling and computation takes root in policy and governance. To be sure, predicting or anticipating futures, is a key reason. But looking across policy areas, one finds that prediction/anticipation means quite a diversity of things (time horizons differ, ambition to change futures also varies…), and one may also find that it is not always the main reason, in fact. Simulating the effects of a decision to avert some contestations seem an important reason, for instance in energy policy-making. In crime control, the adoption of predictive analytics seem to be less about actually knowing future crime with accuracy, than about short-term optimization of patrolling tactics and control over police officers in the field.

In this context, it would be ideal if you could describe with as much clarity as possible, including for people that have little or no knowledge of the area you are investigating, the particular modelling practice that you are considering, describing the data, tools, time-horizons, theories, etc., that characterizes it, putting them in the context of the history of the field, or positioning them vis-à-vis other ways of modelling and computing in the area. But given that you are proposing a full framework, I think your paper will be strong on that anyway, and is pretty promising for our purpose.    

Second, it would be very beneficial for the discussion and accumulation of findings across the conference to keep in mind and try answering the question of how and why has this or these particular way(s) of modelling/computing found its place in the policy area in question? How and why did it or they become a recognized expertise, and something that gets concretely used by the policy-making bodies and administrations involved? That is the question of our project and of the conference, the one that is posed by the rise of predictive analytics (supposedly against more “traditional” forms of modelling and simulation), and the one on which we would like the conference to provide answers. So it would be great to have your take on that question.

We are not requesting to provide a full paper ahead of the conference. However, our plan is to provide participants and the audience with a compendium of short papers of between 1500 and 2000 words, summarizing your talk. It would be ideal if you could send me this by September 1st, so that it can be disseminated a few days before the event.

On another note, there will be a dinner for all speakers on Tuesday 12th, please mark it down in your agenda.
Don’t hesitate to write back if you have any question. I look forward to meeting you at the conference, and thanks again for taking part in it.
