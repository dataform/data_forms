- fixing up the bibliography; modified the zotero export to exclude large fields (like notes, abstract); modifying mybook package to suppress other fields
- struggling with 'last accessed' field -- that needs to be 'by type'. 
- sorted this out by adding stuff to 'mybook.sty' --\clearfield(urlyear},etc. A bit of pfaff and too me all morning, but references are now much cleaner. 
- will go through rest of reference list adding page numbers, etc.
