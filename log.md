- ideas for the Governing Prediction event in Paris september:
     - I don't want to do a new paper, so the question is: what do I have in the book that I can use to talk about governance;
     - Could just go with a basic Foucaultean argument about the observer and its transformation in ml.  That might mean using a bit of the Crary stuff, or my own account of what governs the production of statements. 
    - possible topics include the fake news stuff? Would that be enough? Or something more focused on a particular domain? Is there some dataset that is particularly problematic around governance that I could focus on. 
        - maybe all datasets are problematic in that they are tables. A new mode of inhabiting the table. Isn't that my key argument? How would I exemplify that? By working through an example of what happens to an image in a CNN? What happens to faces, for instance, in the predictive classificatory orderings?  
     - what about GDELT as a system? How does that fit into governance?  
     - or what about the Google global fishing example? and how that compares with what the NSA does? Or the Facebook case? Or the role of Cambridge Analytics in elections? 
     - could make my life a bit easier by using the the Planetary Settlement Project and the ways in which governance (biopolitical, economic, etc.) switches around to predictive operationality; maybe in all of these, the question is bringing governance to bear on that which previously had not been governed. The multiplicity. 
     - But I don't do governance. what is governance? How does it related to governmentality?  could follow Barry who sees tech as an orientation to the political present. That could be a useful tension: predictive operationality and the invention of political institutions  
     - possible titles: predictive operationality and the invention of political institutions
     - to contextualise: Jasanoff's work on policy/government/science? Is science a key figure for me?
     - a key question (following Lynch on epistoics) -- how does something get described as a prediction? And what about all the things that are predictive, but not named as such? This is hardly ever talked about ...

- I don't what governance is. What is it? Is it the same as governing? Also, where does governmentality fit? 
- downloaded 2500 records on governmentality and saved in support/gov.tsv 
- working on titles more

- need to send the title, but don't want to do the new work.
- listened to a podcast - twice -- interview with Andrew Hwang, global policy lead for AI at google. He doesn't seem to be able to talk about policy, but mentioned some useful examples and leads on it
    - UK and Obama US reports on AI
    - need to look at very localized, mundane transformations
    - understanding of policy as the link between tech and social change;
