- ideas for the Governing Prediction event in Paris september:
     - I don't want to do a new paper, so the question is: what do I have in the book that I can use to talk about governance;
     - Could just go with a basic Foucaultean argument about the observer and its transformation in ml.  That might mean using a bit of the Crary stuff, or my own account of what governs the production of statements. 
    - possible topics include the fake news stuff? Would that be enough? Or something more focused on a particular domain? Is there some dataset that is particularly problematic around governance that I could focus on. 
        - maybe all datasets are problematic in that they are tables. A new mode of inhabiting the table. Isn't that my key argument? How would I exemplify that? By working through an example of what happens to an image in a CNN? What happens to faces, for instance, in the predictive classificatory orderings?  
     - what about GDELT as a system? How does that fit into governance?  
     - or what about the Google global fishing example? and how that compares with what the NSA does? Or the Facebook case? Or the role of Cambridge Analytics in elections? 
     - could make my life a bit easier by using the Planetary Settlement Project and the ways in which governance (biopolitical, economic, etc.) switches around to predictive operationality; maybe in all of these, the question is bringing governance to bear on that which previously had not been governed. The multiplicity. 
     - But I don't do governance. what is governance? How does it related to governmentality?  could follow Barry who sees tech as an orientation to the political present. That could be a useful tension: predictive operationality and the invention of political institutions  
     - possible titles: predictive operationality and the invention of political institutions
     - to contextualise: Jasanoff's work on policy/government/science? Is science a key figure for me?
     - a key question (following Lynch on epistoics) -- how does something get described as a prediction? And what about all the things that are predictive, but not named as such? This is hardly ever talked about ...

- I don't what governance is. What is it? Is it the same as governing? Also, where does governmentality fit? 
- downloaded 2500 records on governmentality and saved in support/gov.tsv 
- working on titles more

- need to send the title, but don't want to do the new work.
- listened to a podcast - twice -- interview with Andrew Hwang, global policy lead for AI at google. He doesn't seem to be able to talk about policy, but mentioned some useful examples and leads on it
    - UK and Obama US reports on AI
    - need to look at very localized, mundane transformations
    - understanding of policy as the link between tech and social change; 
    - has some stuff on fairness and why its not an interesting topic
    - also on explainability and its requirements; 
    - books to look at: Ian Goodfellow and the Cybersyn book 
- DONE: check library for these - DONE
- could just talk about the challenge of explainability based on 'vectorisation and its consequences' 
- there's quite a lot happening in terms of fairness(?). Maybe

- been thinking that for me the arguments about fairness, discrimination, explainability all come too late. If governance is always part of the situation, and governmentality involves forms of observation, what happens with the change in observer?  
- possible titles:
    - Techniques of the Predictor;
    - Vectorising things out: prediction and its consequences
- looking at literature -- key references cited around governmentality are Dean 1999, Foucault, 1991, Rose 1997, Foucault 2007, and Beck as well as Andrew Barry 1996

- still wrestling a bit with writing this abstract -- I don't want to commit myself to new work. But did look at references that are most cited: Foucault, 2007 can be found at http://lib.myilibrary.com.ezproxy.lancs.ac.uk/Open.aspx?id=317917
- put a quote from this at ~/notes/foucault_security_2007.md
- abstract for Paris:

> Techniques of the Predictor: generalizing complex populations

> A strikingly active policy-oriented apparatus has begun to emerge around certain forms of prediction associated with technology platforms. Unlike the predictive models that have long been part of the sciences, a set of institutions, procedures, calculations and operations have begin to take shape around problems of opacity, discrimination,  ownership and extension of predictive models in populations. In this paper, I will suggest that the governmentality of prediction currently taking shape can be understood from the perspective of what we might term 'techniques of the predictor' (after Crary's 'techniques of the observer').  Techniques of the predictor mobilise specific operational statements (classifications, identifications, rankings and recommendations), and generalize their production in new populations. The emerging governmentality of prediction might be see as part of the regularization of this mobilizing production.
