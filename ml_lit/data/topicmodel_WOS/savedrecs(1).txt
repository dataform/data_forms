Despite significant progress in this field, there still remain numerous avenues to explore. Indeed, this paper provides a study of exploiting online travel information for personalized travel package recommendation. A critical challenge along this line is to address the unique characteristics of travel data, which distinguish travel packages from traditional items for recommendation. To that end, in this paper, we first analyze the characteristics of the existing travel packages and develop a tourist-area-season topic (TAST) model. This TAST model can represent travel packages and tourists by different topic distributions, where the topic extraction is conditioned on both the tourists and the intrinsic features (i.e., locations, travel seasons) of the landscapes. Then, based on this topic model representation, we propose a cocktail approach to generate the lists for personalized travel package recommendation. Furthermore, we extend the TAST model to the tourist-relation-area-season topic (TRAST) model for capturing the latent relationships among the tourists in each travel group. Finally, we evaluate the TAST model, the TRAST model, and the cocktail recommendation approach on the real-world travel package data. Experimental results show that the TAST model can effectively capture the unique characteristics of the travel data and the cocktail approach is, thus, much more effective than traditional recommendation techniques for travel package recommendation. Also, by considering tourist relationships, the TRAST model can be used as an effective assessment for travel group formation.

Different from the existing author-topic model in which each author and topic are associated with the multinomial distributions over topics and words, in AGTM, each genre, author, and topic are associated with the multinomial distributions over authors, topics, and words, respectively. The bias of the distribution of the authors with respect to the topics can be rectified by incorporating the distribution of the genres with respect to the authors. Therefore, the classification accuracy of documents is improved when the information of genre is introduced. By representing the images with several visual words, the AGTM can be used for satellite image annotation. The labels of classes and scenes of the images correspond to the authors and the genres of the documents, respectively. The labels of classes and scenes of test images can be estimated, and the accuracy of satellite image annotation is improved when the information of scenes is introduced in the training images. Experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed method.

However, many traditional machine learning methods fail to simultaneously integrate textual data into the prediction process because of its high dimensionality. In this paper, we present a supervised method using Laplacian Eigenmaps to enable existing machine learning methods to estimate both low-dimensional representations of textual data and accurate predictors based on these low-dimensional representations at the same time. Materials and methods We present a supervised Laplacian Eigenmap method to enhance predictive models by embedding textual predictors into a low-dimensional latent space, which preserves the local similarities among textual data in high-dimensional space. The proposed implementation performs alternating optimization using gradient descent. For the evaluation, we applied our method to over 2000 patient records from a large single-center pediatric cardiology practice to predict if patients were diagnosed with cardiac disease. In our experiments, we consider relatively short textual descriptions because of data availability. We compared our method with latent semantic indexing, latent Dirichlet allocation, and local Fisher discriminant analysis. The results were assessed using four metrics: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), specificity, and sensitivity. Results and discussion The results indicate that supervised Laplacian Eigenmaps was the highest performing method in our study, achieving 0.782 and 0.374 for AUC and MCC, respectively. Supervised Laplacian Eigenmaps showed an increase of 8.16% in AUC and 20.6% in MCC over the baseline that excluded textual data and a 2.69% and 5.35% increase in AUC and MCC, respectively, over unsupervised Laplacian Eigenmaps. Conclusions As a solution, we present a supervised Laplacian Eigenmap method to embed textual predictors into a low-dimensional Euclidean space. This method allows many existing machine learning predictors to effectively and efficiently capture the potential of textual predictors, especially those based on short texts.

In many situations, the test suites are so large that executing every test for every source code change is infeasible, due to time and resource constraints. Development teams need to prioritize their test suite so that as many distinct faults as possible are detected early in the execution of the test suite. We consider the problem of static black-box test case prioritization (TCP), where test suites are prioritized without the availability of the source code of the system under test (SUT). We propose a new static black-box TCP technique that represents test cases using a previously unused data source in the test suite: the linguistic data of the test cases, i.e., their identifier names, comments, and string literals. Our technique applies a text analysis algorithm called topic modeling to the linguistic data to approximate the functionality of each test case, allowing our technique to give high priority to test cases that test different functionalities of the SUT. We compare our proposed technique with existing static black-box TCP techniques in a case study of multiple real-world open source systems: several versions of Apache Ant and Apache Derby. We find that our static black-box TCP technique outperforms existing static black-box TCP techniques, and has comparable or better performance than two existing execution-based TCP techniques. Static black-box TCP methods are widely applicable because the only input they require is the source code of the test cases themselves. This contrasts with other TCP techniques which require access to the SUT runtime behavior, to the SUT specification models, or to the SUT source code.

J	Yu, MM; Wang, JL; Zhao, XD				Yu, Miaomiao; Wang, Junli; Zhao, Xiaodong			A PAM-based ontology concept and hierarchy learning method	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						concept and hierarchy learning; ontology learning; Pachinko Allocation Model; probabilistic topic model		As a shared conceptual model that can express knowledge and a modelling tool that can describe conceptual model in the semantic and knowledge level, ontology plays an important role in the related fields of the Semantic Web, natural language processing and information retrieval. Ontology learning is a series of methods and technologies to construct ontology automatically or semi-automatically. Concept and hierarchy learning are the most important parts of the ontology construction. This paper proposes an ontology concept and hierarchy learning method based on the Pachinko Allocation Model. The above problem is transformed into a probability and statistical inference problem by building an ontology concept learning model. Gibbs sampling is used to estimate the parameters. Then, using the ontology concept generation algorithm based on WordNet, an abstract description of the ontology concept is obtained. Experimental results on the standard test dataset show that the proposed method can offer an effective solution to ontology concept and hierarchy learning.

J	Zhong, EH; Fan, W; Yang, Q				Zhong, Erheng; Fan, Wei; Yang, Qiang			User Behavior Learning and Transfer in Composite Social Networks	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA			English	Article						Composite social network; transfer learning; social network analysis	MODELS	Accurate prediction of user behaviors is important for many social media applications, including social marketing, personalization, and recommendation. A major challenge lies in that although many previous works model user behavior from only historical behavior logs, the available user behavior data or interactions between users and items in a given social network are usually very limited and sparse (e.g., >= 99.9% empty), which makes models overfit the rare observations and fail to provide accurate predictions. We observe that many people are members of several social networks in the same time, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Tencent's QQ. Importantly, users' behaviors and interests in different networks influence one another. This provides an opportunity to leverage the knowledge of user behaviors in different networks by considering the overlapping users in different networks as bridges, in order to alleviate the data sparsity problem, and enhance the predictive performance of user behavior modeling. Combining different networks "simply and naively" does not work well. In this article, we formulate the problem to model multiple networks as "adaptive composite transfer" and propose a framework called ComSoc. ComSoc first selects the most suitable networks inside a composite social network via a hierarchical Bayesian model, parameterized for individual users. It then builds topic models for user behavior prediction using both the relationships in the selected networks and related behavior data. With different relational regularization, we introduce different implementations, corresponding to different ways to transfer knowledge from composite social relations. To handle big data, we have implemented the algorithm using Map/Reduce. We demonstrate that the proposed composite network-based user behavior models significantly improve the predictive accuracy over a number of existing approaches on several real-world applications, including a very large social networking dataset from Tencent Inc.

J	Bekhuis, T; Tseytlin, E; Mitchell, KJ; Demner-Fushman, D				Bekhuis, Tanja; Tseytlin, Eugene; Mitchell, Kevin J.; Demner-Fushman, Dina			Feature Engineering and a Proposed Decision-Support System for Systematic Reviewers of Medical Evidence	PLOS ONE			English	Review							ALGORITHM; CLASSIFICATION; CLASSIFIERS; WORKLOAD; ROBUST	Objectives: Evidence-based medicine depends on the timely synthesis of research findings. An important source of synthesized evidence resides in systematic reviews. However, a bottleneck in review production involves dual screening of citations with titles and abstracts to find eligible studies. For this research, we tested the effect of various kinds of textual information (features) on performance of a machine learning classifier. Based on our findings, we propose an automated system to reduce screeing burden, as well as offer quality assurance. Methods: We built a database of citations from 5 systematic reviews that varied with respect to domain, topic, and sponsor. Consensus judgments regarding eligibility were inferred from published reports. We extracted 5 feature sets from citations: alphabetic, alphanumeric(+), indexing, features mapped to concepts in systematic reviews, and topic models. To simulate a two-person team, we divided the data into random halves. We optimized the parameters of a Bayesian classifier, then trained and tested models on alternate data halves. Overall, we conducted 50 independent tests. Results: All tests of summary performance (mean F3) surpassed the corresponding baseline, P<0.0001. The ranks for mean F3, precision, and classification error were statistically different across feature sets averaged over reviews; P-values for Friedman's test were.045,.002, and.002, respectively. Differences in ranks for mean recall were not statistically significant. Alphanumeric(+) features were associated with best performance; mean reduction in screening burden for this feature type ranged from 88% to 98% for the second pass through citations and from 38% to 48% overall. Conclusions: A computer-assisted, decision support system based on our methods could substantially reduce the burden of screening citations for systematic review teams and solo reviewers. Additionally, such a system could deliver quality assurance both by confirming concordant decisions and by naming studies associated with discordant decisions for further consideration.

A framework is developed using the following new aspects: Gaussian mixture clustering for the quantization process, the use of an integrated visual vocabulary (IVV), which is built as the union of all centroids obtained from the separate quantization process of each class, and the usage of some features, including edge orientation histogram, CIELab color moments, and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). The experiments are conducted on IKONOS images with six semantic classes (tree, grassland, residential, commercial/ industrial, road, and water). The results show that the use of an IVV increases the overall accuracy (OA) by 11 to 12% and 6% when it is implemented on the selected and all features, respectively. The selected features of CIELab color moments and GLCM provide a better OA than the implementation over CIELab color moment or GLCM as individuals. The latter increases the OA by only similar to 2 to 3%. Moreover, the results show that the OA of LDA outperforms the OA of C4.5 and naive Bayes tree by similar to 20%.

In our problem, an input is given by a long sequence of co-occurrence events among objects, namely a stream of co-occurrence events. Given a stream of co-occurrence events, we learn unknown latent vectors of objects such that their inner product adaptively approximates the target similarities resulting from accumulating co-occurrence events. Toward this end, we propose a new incremental algorithm for dimensionality reduction. The core of our algorithm is its partial updating style where only a small number of latent vectors are modified for each co-occurrence event, while most other latent vectors remain unchanged. Experiment results using both synthetic and real data sets demonstrate that in contrast to some existing methods, the proposed algorithm can stably and gradually learn target similarities among objects without being trapped by the collapsing problem.

J	Luo, L; Li, L				Luo, Le; Li, Li			Defining and Evaluating Classification Algorithm for High-Dimensional Data Based on Latent Topics	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TEXT CATEGORIZATION	Automatic text categorization is one of the key techniques in information retrieval and the data mining field. The classification is usually time-consuming when the training dataset is large and high-dimensional. Many methods have been proposed to solve this problem, but few can achieve satisfactory efficiency. In this paper, we present a method which combines the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm and the Support Vector Machine (SVM). LDA is first used to generate reduced dimensional representation of topics as feature in VSM. It is able to reduce features dramatically but keeps the necessary semantic information. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is then employed to classify the data based on the generated features. We evaluate the algorithm on 20 Newsgroups and Reuters-21578 datasets, respectively. The experimental results show that the classification based on our proposed LDA+SVM model achieves high performance in terms of precision, recall and F1 measure. Further, it can achieve this within a much shorter time-frame. Our process improves greatly upon the previous work in this field and displays strong potential to achieve a streamlined classification process for a wide range of applications.

Analyzing microblog content with topic models facilitates the search for users and microblogs of interest from a vast amount of information. However, traditional topic model doesn't work well on microblog because these blogs are short and have irregular writing patterns. Considering that microblog have obviously concentration on the field and time they were posted, we propose a microblog recommender approach called time-field latent Dirichlet allocation (TF-LDA), which effectively makes topics more discriminative and thus improves recommender performance. An experiment shows that user and microblog recommendations based on TF-LDA increases accuracy compared with those based on traditional topic models.

However, in a real context, sufficient labeled examples are not always available because human labeling is enormously time-consuming. For this reason, there has been recent interest in methods that are capable of obtaining a high accuracy when the size of the training set is small. In this paper we introduce a new single label text classification method that performs better than baseline methods when the number of labeled examples is small. Differently from most of the existing methods that usually make use of a vector of features composed of weighted words, the proposed approach uses a structured vector of features, composed of weighted pairs of words. The proposed vector of features is automatically learned, given a set of documents, using a global method for term extraction based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation implemented as the Probabilistic Topic Model. Experiments performed using a small percentage of the original training set (about 1%) confirmed our theories. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The model is designed to handle the difficult case of multivariate time series obtained from a mixture of activities, that is, our observations are caused by the superposition of multiple phenomena occurring concurrently and with no synchronization. The model uses nonparametric Bayesian methods to describe both the motifs and their occurrences in documents. We derive an inference scheme to automatically and simultaneously recover the recurrent motifs (both their characteristics and number) and their occurrence instants in each document. The model is widely applicable and is illustrated on datasets coming from multiple modalities, mainly videos from static cameras and audio localization data. The rich semantic interpretation that the model offers can be leveraged in tasks such as event counting or for scene analysis. The approach is also used as a mean of doing soft camera calibration in a camera network. A thorough study of the model parameters is provided and a cross-platform implementation of the inference algorithm will be made publicly available.

J	Farrahi, K; Gatica-Perez, D				Farrahi, Katayoun; Gatica-Perez, Daniel			A probabilistic approach to mining mobile phone data sequences	PERSONAL AND UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING			English	Article								We present a new approach to address the problem of large sequence mining from big data. The particular problem of interest is the effective mining of long sequences from large-scale location data to be practical for Reality Mining applications, which suffer from large amounts of noise and lack of ground truth. To address this complex data, we propose an unsupervised probabilistic topic model called the distant n-gram topic model (DNTM). The DNTM is based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which is extended to integrate sequential information. We define the generative process for the model, derive the inference procedure, and evaluate our model on both synthetic data and real mobile phone data. We consider two different mobile phone datasets containing natural human mobility patterns obtained by location sensing, the first considering GPS/wi-fi locations and the second considering cell tower connections. The DNTM discovers meaningful topics on the synthetic data as well as the two mobile phone datasets. Finally, the DNTM is compared to LDA by considering log-likelihood performance on unseen data, showing the predictive power of the model. The results show that the DNTM consistently outperforms LDA as the sequence length increases.

J	Gao, GY; Ma, HD				Gao, Guang-Yu; Ma, Hua-Dong			Movie Scene Recognition Using Panoramic Frame and Representative Feature Patches	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						movie scene recognition; key-frame extraction; representative feature; panoramic frame	SCALE	Recognizing scene information in images or videos, such as locating the objects and answering "Where am I?", has attracted much attention in computer vision research field. Many existing scene recognition methods focus on static images, and cannot achieve satisfactory results on videos which contain more complex scenes features than images. In this paper, we propose a robust movie scene recognition approach based on panoramic frame and representative feature patch. More specifically, the movie is first efficiently segmented into video shots and scenes. Secondly, we introduce a novel key-frame extraction method using panoramic frame and also a local feature extraction process is applied to get the representative feature patches (RFPs) in each video shot. Thirdly, a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based recognition model is trained to recognize the scene within each individual video scene clip. The correlations between video clips are considered to enhance the recognition performance. When our proposed approach is implemented to recognize the scene in realistic movies, the experimental results shows that it can achieve satisfactory performance.

Measuring similarities between patient traces can profitably be exploited further as a basis for providing insights into the pathways, and complementing existing techniques of clinical pathway analysis (CPA), which mainly focus on looking at aggregated data seen from an external perspective. Most existing methods measure similarities between patient traces via computing the relative distance between their event sequences. However, clinical pathways, as typical human-centered processes, always take place in an unstructured fashion, i.e., clinical events occur arbitrarily without a particular order. Bringing order in the chaos of clinical pathways may decline the accuracy of similarity measure between patient traces, and may distort the efficiency of further analysis tasks. In this paper, we present a behavioral topic analysis approach to measure similarities between patient traces. More specifically, a probabilistic graphical model, i.e., latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), is employed to discover latent treatment behaviors of patient traces for clinical pathways such that similarities of pairwise patient traces can be measured based on their underlying behavioral topical features. The presented method provides a basis for further applications in CPA. In particular, three possible applications are introduced in this paper, i.e., patient trace retrieval, clustering, and anomaly detection. The proposed approach and the presented applications are evaluated via a real-world dataset of several specific clinical pathways collected from a Chinese hospital.

The elucidation of the subcategorization of a pulmonary nodule type in CT images is an important preliminary step towards developing the nodule managements that are specific to each patient. We categorize lung cancers by analyzing volumetric distributions of CT values within lung cancers via a topic model such as latent Dirichlet allocation. Through applying our scheme to 3D CT images of non-small-cell lung cancer (maximum lesion size of 3 cm), we demonstrate the potential usefulness of the topic model-based categorization of lung cancers as quantitative CT biomarkers.

However, there exist two major limitations in the existing topic detection and tracking models, i.e. noise words and multiple sub-events. In this paper, a novel event detection and tracking algorithm, topic event detection and tracking (TEDT), was proposed to tackle these limitations by clustering the co-occurrent features of the underlying topics in the text stream data and then the evolution of events was analyzed for the event tracking purpose. The evaluation was performed on two real datasets with the promising results demonstrating that (1) the proposed TEDT algorithm is superior to the state-of-the-art topic model with respect to event detection; (2) the proposed TEDT algorithm can successfully track the event changes.

Although many text mining techniques and generative probabilistic models have been developed for static plain-text corpus, they are inclined to achieve unsatisfactory results in microblogs without considering that microblogs are temporally sequential and concerned with social network information. In this paper, we propose a novel topic model, MicroBlog-Topics over Time (MB-ToT), which aims for comprehensive topic analysis in microblogs. Firstly, we assume each topic is a mixture distribution influenced by both word co-occurrences and timestamps of microblogs. This allowsMB-ToT to capture the changes of each topic over time. Subsequently, we apply users' intrinsic interests, social contact relations and #hashtags to improve the topic mining result. Finally, we present a Gibbs sampling implementation for the inference of MB-ToT. We evaluate MB-ToT and compare it with the state-of-the-art methods on a real dataset. In our experiments, MB-ToT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in terms of both perplexity and KL-divergence. We also show that the quality of the generated latent topics of MB-ToT is promising.

To assess the image quality, firstly, we learn topic-specific word distribution by training a set of pristine and distorted images without human subjective scores. Secondly, LDA model is used to estimate probability distribution of topic for the regions in the test images. Finally, we calculate the perceptual quality score of the test image by comparing the estimated probabilities of topics of the test image with that for the pristine images. Note that the quality-aware visual words are used to represent the images, which generated with respect to the natural scene statistic features. Experimental evaluation on the publicly available subjective-rated database LIVE demonstrates that our proposed method correlates reasonably well with different mean opinion scores (DMOS).

However, current text knowledge representation models either lose much knowledge [e. g., vector space model (VSM)] or have a high complex computation [e. g., latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)]; even some of them cannot be constructed automatically [e. g., web ontology language, (OWL)]. In this paper, a novel text knowledge representation model, power series representation (PSR) model, which has a low complex computation in text knowledge constructing process, is proposed to leverage the contradiction between carrying rich knowledge and automatic construction. First, concept algebra of human concept learning is developed to represent text knowledge as the form of power series. Then, degree-2 power series hypothesis is introduced to simplify the proposed PSR model, which can be automatically constructed with a lower complex computation and has more knowledge than the VSM and LDA. After that, degree-2 power series hypothesis-based reasoning operations are developed, which provide a more flexible reasoning ability than OWL and LDA. Furthermore, experiments and comparisons with current knowledge representation models show that our model has better characteristics than others when representing text knowledge. Finally, a demo is given to indicate that PSR model has a good prospect over the area of web semantic search.

Categorized tip information of social media based on topic detection	IAENG TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Engineering (WCE)	JUL 03-05, 2013	London, UNITED KINGDOM	Int Assoc Engn				Social media such as Social network systems, blogs, and microblogs is the most popular services. Using social media, users who are members of a social media community post and exchange information that is related to personal behavior, experimentation, and their own sentiments. These information is not written in ordinary web pages, but it is sometimes important information for the users. However, it is difficult to extract such important information from social media, because so much information exists. We propose a method to extract such important information from social media. We call such information "tip information". Our proposed tip information is including a user's experiment and it has common important words. We call the common important words "tip keywords". We first classify social media based on topic by using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Next, we extract user's experiment sentences from social media based on experience mining method and we extract sentences which are include tip keyword from them. They become tip information. After extracting tip information, we classify it according to four categories which are "suggestion and recommendation", "restraint", "briefing", and "possible and impossible". Then we present tip information based on each category.	[Nadamoto, A.; Hattori, Y.] Konan Univ, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan	Nadamoto, A (reprint author), Konan Univ, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.

Most state-of-the-art algorithms only consider structural properties to detect disjoint subcommunities and do not include the fact that people can belong to more than one community and also ignore the information contained in posts that users have made. To tackle this problem, we developed a novel methodology to detect overlapping subcommunities in online social networks and a method to analyze the content patterns for each subcommunities using topic models. This paper presents our main contribution, a hybrid algorithm which combines two different overlapping sub-community detection approaches: the first one considers the graph structure of the network (topology-based subcommunities detection approach) and the second one takes the textual information of the network nodes into consideration (topic-based subcommunities detection approach). Additionally we provide a method to analyze and compare the content generated. Tests on real-world virtual communities show that our algorithm outperforms other methods.

Automatic routine discovery goes beyond low-level activity recognition such as sitting or standing and analyzes human behaviors at a higher level (e. g., commuting to work). With recent developments in ubiquitous sensor technologies, it becomes easier to acquire a massive amount of sensor data. One main line of research is to mine human routines from sensor data using parametric topic models such as latent Dirichlet allocation. The main shortcoming of parametric models is that it assumes a fixed, pre-specified parameter regardless of the data. Choosing an appropriate parameter usually requires an inefficient trial-and-error model selection process. Furthermore, it is even more difficult to find optimal parameter values in advance for personalized applications. In this paper, we present a novel nonparametric framework for human routine discovery that can infer high-level routines without knowing the number of latent topics beforehand. Our approach is evaluated on public datasets in two routine domains: a 34-daily-activity dataset and a transportation mode dataset. Experimental results show that our nonparametric framework can automatically learn the appropriate model parameters from sensor data without any form of model selection procedure and can outperform traditional parametric approaches for human routine discovery tasks.

Among various obstacles to human complex action recognition, one of the most challenging is to deal with self-occlusion, where one body part occludes another one. This paper presents a new method of human complex action recognition, which is based on optical flow and correlated topic model (CTM). Firstly, the Markov random field was used to represent the occlusion relationship between human body parts in terms of an occlusion state variable. Secondly, the structure from motion (SFM) is used for reconstructing the missing data of point trajectories. Then, we can extract the key frame based on motion feature from optical flow and the ratios of the width and height are extracted by the human silhouette. Finally, we use the topic model of correlated topic model (CTM) to classify action. Experiments were performed on the KTH, Weizmann, and UIUC action dataset to test and evaluate the proposed method. The compared experiment results showed that the proposed method was more effective than compared methods.

Using Bayesian belief network we give three topic tracking models: a static topic model BSTM and two dynamic topic models BDTM-I, BDTM-II. BDTM-II merges the advantages of BSTM and BDTM-I, has better tracking performance than the former two, and effectively alleviates topic drift phenomenon. Applying unrelated coming stories to update BDTM-I and BDTM-II can filter noises existed in topics. Experiments on TDT corpora show that BSTM decreases (C-det)(norm) by 5.5% comparing to VSM, BDTM-II decreases (C-det)(norm) by 6.3% and 6.0% comparing to BSTM and BDTM-I respectively, using unrelated stories can improve the tracking performance.

Most of the current methods are devoted either to discovering static latent topics and users' interests or to analyzing topic evolution only from intrafeatures of documents, namely, text content, without considering directly extrafeatures of documents such as authors. Moreover, they are applicable only to the case of single processor. To resolve these problems, we propose a dynamic users' interest discovery model with distributed inference algorithm, named as Distributed Author-Topic over Time (D-AToT) model. The collapsed Gibbs sampling method following the main idea of MapReduce is also utilized for inferring model parameters. The proposed model can discover latent topics and users' interests, and mine their changing patterns over time. Extensive experimental results on NIPS (Neural Information Processing Systems) dataset show that our D-AToT model is feasible and efficient.

To study this, this paper proposes two sets of topic attributes to examine topic dynamic characteristics: topic continuity and topic popularity. Topic continuity comprises six attributes: steady, concentrating, diluting, sporadic, transforming, and emerging topics; topic popularity comprises three attributes: rising, declining, and fluctuating topics. These attributes are applied to a data set on library and information science publications during the past 11 years (2001-2011). Results show that topics on "web information retrieval", "citation and bibliometrics", "system and technology", and "health science" have the highest average popularity; topics on "h-index", "online communities", "data preservation", "social media", and "web analysis" are increasingly becoming popular in library and information science.

As translation ambiguities are pervasive in statistical machine translation, we introduce two topic-based models for translation rule selection which incorporates global topic information into translation disambiguation. We associate each synchronous translation rule with source- and target-side topic distributions. With these topic distributions, we propose a topic dissimilarity model to select desirable (less dissimilar) rules by imposing penalties for rules with a large value of dissimilarity of their topic distributions to those of given documents. In order to encourage the use of non-topic specific translation rules, we also present a topic sensitivity model to balance translation rule selection between generic rules and topic-specific rules. Furthermore, we project target-side topic distributions onto the source- side topic model space so that we can benefit from topic information of both the source and target language. We integrate the proposed topic dissimilarity and sensitivity model into hierarchical phrase-based machine translation for synchronous translation rule selection. Experiments show that our topic-based translation rule selection model can substantially improve translation quality.

A topic model is such an unsupervised probabilistic method that captures latent aspects of data, where each latent aspect, or a topic, is associated with one homogeneous region. The results of topic models, however, usually have noises, which decreases the overall segmentation performance. In this paper, to improve the performance of image segmentation using topic models, we propose two topic masks applicable to topic assignments of homogeneous regions obtained from topic models. The topic masks capture the noises among the assigned topic assignments or topic labels, and remove the noises by replacements, just like image masks for pixels. However, as the nature of topic assignments is different from image pixels, the topic masks have properties that are different from the existing image masks for pixels. There are two contributions of this paper. First, the topic masks can be used to reduce the noises of topic assignments obtained from topic models for image segmentation tasks. Second, we test the effectiveness of the topic masks by applying them to segmented images obtained from the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model and the Spatial Latent Dirichlet Allocation model upon the MSRC image dataset. The empirical results show that one of the masks successfully reduces the topic noises.

Clustering flood events from water quality time series using Latent Dirichlet Allocation model	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						water quality; time series analysis; flood events; probabilistic model; temporal pattern extraction	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; AGRICULTURAL CATCHMENTS; HEADWATER CATCHMENT; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; CLASSIFICATION; NITRATE; SEDIMENT; IDENTIFICATION; GROUNDWATER; PREDICTION	To improve hydro-chemical modeling and forecasting, there is a need to better understand flood-induced variability in water chemistry and the processes controlling it in watersheds. In the literature, assumptions are often made, for instance, that stream chemistry reacts differently to rainfall events depending on the season; however, methods to verify such assumptions are not well developed. Often, few floods are studied at a time and chemicals are used as tracers. Grouping similar events from large multivariate data sets using principal component analysis and clustering methods helps to explain hydrological processes; however, these methods currently have some limits (definition of flood descriptors, linear assumption, for instance). Most clustering methods have been used in the context of regionalization, focusing more on mapping results than on understanding processes. In this study, we extracted flood patterns using the probabilistic Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, its first use in hydrology, to our knowledge. The LDA method allows multivariate temporal data sets to be considered without having to define explanatory factors beforehand or select representative floods. We analyzed a multivariate data set from a long-term observatory (Kervidy-Naizin, western France) containing data for four solutes monitored daily for 12 years: nitrate, chloride, dissolved organic carbon, and sulfate. The LDA method extracted three different patterns that were distributed by season. Each pattern can be explained by seasonal hydrological processes. Hydro-meteorological parameters help explain the processes leading to these patterns, which increases understanding of flood-induced variability in water quality. Thus, the LDA method appears useful for analyzing long-term data sets.	[Aubert, A.

Recently, there have been significant advancements in various topic modeling techniques, particularly in the form of probabilistic graphical modeling. State-of-the-art techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been successfully applied in visual text analytics. However, most of the widely-used methods based on probabilistic modeling have drawbacks in terms of consistency from multiple runs and empirical convergence. Furthermore, due to the complicatedness in the formulation and the algorithm, LDA cannot easily incorporate various types of user feedback. To tackle this problem, we propose a reliable and flexible visual analytics system for topic modeling called UTOPIAN (User-driven Topic modeling based on Inter active Nonnegative Matrix Factorization). Centered around its semi-supervised formulation, UTOPIAN enables users to interact with the topic modeling method and steer the result in a user-driven manner. We demonstrate the capability of UTOPIAN via several usage scenarios with real-world document corpuses such as InfoVis/VAST paper data set and product review data sets.

The dynamic nature of such data requires the sentiment and topic analysis model to be also dynamically updated, capturing the most recent language use of sentiments and topics in text. We propose a dynamic Joint Sentiment-Topic model (dJST) which allows the detection and tracking of views of current and recurrent interests and shifts in topic and sentiment. Both topic and sentiment dynamics are captured by assuming that the current sentiment-topic-specific word distributions are generated according to the word distributions at previous epochs. We study three different ways of accounting for such dependency information: (1) sliding window where the current sentiment-topic word distributions are dependent on the previous sentiment-topic-specific word distributions in the last S epochs; (2) skip model where history sentiment topic word distributions are considered by skipping some epochs in between; and (3) multiscale model where previous long- and short-timescale distributions are taken into consideration. We derive efficient online inference procedures to sequentially update the model with newly arrived data and show the effectiveness of our proposed model on the Mozilla add-on reviews crawled between 2007 and 2011.

Researchers have attempted to summarize, categorize, and relate these artifacts by using semi-unsupervised machine-learning algorithms, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). LDA is used for concept and topic analysis to suggest candidate word-lists or topics that describe and relate software artifacts. However, these word-lists and topics are difficult to interpret in the absence of meaningful summary labels. Current attempts to interpret topics assume manual labelling and do not use domain-specific knowledge to improve, contextualize, or describe results for the developers. We propose a solution: automated labelled topic extraction. Topics are extracted using LDA from commit-log comments recovered from source control systems. These topics are given labels from a generalizable cross-project taxonomy, consisting of non-functional requirements. Our approach was evaluated with experiments and case studies on three large-scale Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) projects: MySQL, PostgreSQL and MaxDB. The case studies show that labelled topic extraction can produce appropriate, context-sensitive labels that are relevant to these projects, and provide fresh insight into their evolving software development activities.

J	Marshall, EA				Marshall, Emily A.			Defining population problems: Using topic models for cross-national comparison of disciplinary development	POETICS			English	Article						Topic models; Academic disciplines; Demography; Fertility; France; Great Britain	DEMOGRAPHIC-TRANSITION; SOCIAL-SCIENCE; FERTILITY	The content of academic journals provides insight into disciplinary boundaries and priorities. This paper uses correlated topic modeling (CTM), an innovative approach to textual analysis, for a cross-national comparison of the development of research agendas in the discipline of demography. Using articles from leading demographic journals from 1946 to 2005, CTM shows how the set of concepts relevant to the study of fertility was defined differently in France and Great Britain. Results indicate that demographic research agendas reflected both cultural and institutional differences that shaped different understandings of fertility decline. While British demography focused on high-fertility contexts, French demography focused on lower-fertility contexts. This difference reflects national intellectual traditions shaped by larger cultural discourses: the dominance of demographic transition theory and fears of overpopulation in Britain versus the co-existence in France of a second salient model, a theory of demographic "revolution" with sustained low fertility leading to depopulation. Relationships between expert concerns and broader public concerns are then examined in the British case by comparing journal publications to mass-media coverage of fertility and population issues. This comparison shows that British academic demography passed over some policy-relevant population issues, such as discussions of immigrant fertility, that were featured in the popular press.

We present this overview by recounting a series of our prior collaborative projects that have employed and developed various forms of topic models to understand language differentiation in academe. With each project, we encountered a variety of model-specific issues concerning the validity of topics and their suitability to our data and research questions. We developed a variety of novel visualization techniques to make sense of topic-solutions and used a variety of techniques to validate our results. In addition, we created a variety of new topic modeling techniques and procedures suitable to different kinds of data and research questions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Miller, IM				Miller, Ian Matthew			Rebellion, crime and violence in Qing China, 1722-1911: A topic modeling approach	POETICS			English	Article						China; Qing Dynasty; Rebellion; Unrest; Distant reading; Topic model		Banditry and unrest in eighteenth and nineteenth century China have attracted substantial attention from several generations of researchers. Often, they apply particular ontologies a priori to the source base. Given their reliance on state documents, these studies are subject to the perspectives of record-keepers and their theories of violence. It is particularly difficult to apply fixed definitions to concepts like "banditry" and "unrest"-a problem that applies as much to modern researchers as to our historical informants. To better view the nature of violence in the Qing Dynasty-as routine crime, and as rebellion and unrest-it is important to develop a model of how administrators understood it. Therefore, rather than assuming a fixed set of categories, this study models Qing administrators' typologies of violence based on the frequencies of term co-occurrence. Based on the term groupings in the model, five topics relate to violent unrest. Each topic accounts for a particular statistical pattern of word use corresponding to patterns of occurrence, observation and recording of related phenomena. These groupings give some insight into the "crime rates" of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and more importantly, these groupings cast light on their understandings of crime, rebellion and unrest.

J	Paul, R; Newman, P				Paul, Rohan; Newman, Paul			Self-help: Seeking out perplexing images for ever improving topological mapping	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH			English	Article						Life-long learning; topological mapping; topic models; perplexity	PROBABILISTIC LOCALIZATION; SURPRISING EVENTS; LOOP-CLOSURE; FAB-MAP; APPEARANCE; SLAM; NAVIGATION; SCALE; VIDEO; MODEL	In this work, we present a novel approach that allows a robot to improve its own navigation performance through introspection and then targeted data retrieval. It is a step in the direction of life-long learning and adaptation and is motivated by the desire to build robots that have plastic competencies which are not baked in. They should react to and benefit from use. We consider a particular instantiation of this problem in the context of place recognition. Based on a topic-based probabilistic representation for images, we use a measure of perplexity to evaluate how well a working set of background images explain the robot's online view of the world. Offline, the robot then searches an external resource to seek out additional background images that bolster its ability to localize in its environment when used next. In this way the robot adapts and improves performance through use. We demonstrate this approach using data collected from a mobile robot operating in outdoor workspaces.

J	Zhao, B; Zhong, YF; Zhang, LP				Zhao, Bei; Zhong, Yanfei; Zhang, Liangpei			Scene classification via latent Dirichlet allocation using a hybrid generative/discriminative strategy for high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery	REMOTE SENSING LETTERS			English	Article							OBJECTS; MODEL	In order to capture the high-level concepts in high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing imagery, scene classification based on a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model, a generative topic model, is a practical method to bridge the semantic gaps between the low-level features and the high-level concepts of HSR imagery. In the previous work, LDA has been considered as a scene classifier, namely C-LDA, and multiple LDA models for each scene class are built separately, where the scene class is determined by a maximum likelihood rule. The C-LDA strategy disregards the correlations between the generative topic spaces of the different scene classes. In this letter, two novel strategies of scene classification based on LDA are proposed to consider the correlations between the generative topic spaces of the different scene classes by sharing the topic spaces for all the scene classes. One of the proposed strategies utilizes LDA as part of the classifier, namely P-LDA, which generates the topic space from all the training images. A discriminative classifier (e.g., support vector machine, SVM) is also employed as the other classification part of P-LDA. The other proposed strategy employs LDA as the topic feature extractor, namely F-LDA, which generates the topic space from all the training and test images, and utilizes a discriminative classifier to classify the topic features. The experimental results using aerial orthophotographs show that the performances of the two proposed strategies for scene classification based on LDA are better than the traditional C-LDA method.

J	Pan, J; Ma, Z; Pang, YW; Yuan, Y				Pan, Jing; Ma, Zhao; Pang, Yanwei; Yuan, Yuan			Robust probabilistic tensor analysis for time-variant collaborative filtering	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Tensor analysis; Collaborative filtering; Movie recommendation; Topic model	MODELS; VIDEO	The input data of collaborative filtering, also known as recommendation system, are usually sparse and noisy. In addition, in many cases the data are time-variant and have obvious periodic property. In this paper, we take the two characteristics into account. To utilize the time-variant and periodic properties, we describe the data as a three-order tensor and then formulate the collaborative filtering as a problem of probabilistic tensor decomposition with a time-periodical constraint. The robustness is achieved by employing Tsallis divergence to describe the objective function and q-EM algorithm to find the optimal solution. The proposed method is demonstrated on movie recommendation. Experimental results on two Netflix and Movielens databases show the superiority of the proposed method. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Most topic models are either unsupervised or fully supervised. In this paper, to take advantage of both limited labeled training images and rich unlabeled images, we propose a novel regularized Semi-Supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (r-SSLDA) for learning visual concept classifiers. Instead of introducing a new complex topic model, we attempt to find an efficient way to learn topic models in a semi-supervised way. Our r-SSLDA considers both semi-supervised properties and supervised topic model simultaneously in a regularization framework. Furthermore, to improve the performance of r-SSLDA, we introduce the low rank graph to the framework. Experiments on Caltech 101 and Caltech 256 have shown that r-SSLDA outperforms both unsupervised LDA and achieves competitive performance against fully supervised LDA with much fewer labeled images.

Social content annotation has naturally emerged as a method of categorization and filtering of online information. The unrestricted vocabulary users choose from to annotate content has often lead to an explosion of the size of space in which search is performed. In this article, we propose latent topic models as a principled way of reducing the dimensionality of such data and capturing the dynamics of collaborative annotation process. We propose three generative processes to model latent user tastes with respect to resources they annotate with metadata. We show that latent user interests combined with social clues from the immediate neighborhood of users can significantly improve social link prediction in the online music social media site Last.fm. Most link prediction methods suffer from the high class imbalance problem, resulting in low precision and/or recall. In contrast, our proposed classification schemes for social link recommendation achieve high precision and recall with respect to not only the dominant class (nonexistence of a link), but also with respect to sparse positive instances, which are the most vital in social tie prediction.

S. politicians. The study requires selection of a subsample of representative posts for sentiment scoring, a common and costly aspect of sentiment mining. As a general contribution, our application is preceded by a proposed algorithm for maximizing sampling efficiency. In particular, we outline and illustrate greedy selection of documents to build designs that are D-optimal in a topic-factor decomposition of the original text. The strategy is applied to our motivating dataset of political posts, and we outline a new technique for predicting both generic and subject-specific document sentiment through the use of variable interactions in multinomial inverse regression. Results are presented for analysis of 2.1 million Twitter posts collected around February 2012. Computer codes and data are provided as supplementary material online.

J	Yang, P; Gao, W; Tan, Q; Wong, KF				Yang, Pei; Gao, Wei; Tan, Qi; Wong, Kam-Fai			A link-bridged topic model for cross-domain document classification	INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Cross-domain; Document classification; Transfer learning; Auxiliary link network	TEXT CLASSIFICATION	Transfer learning utilizes labeled data available from some related domain (source domain) for achieving effective knowledge transformation to the target domain. However, most state-of-the-art cross-domain classification methods treat documents as plain text and ignore the hyperlink (or citation) relationship existing among the documents. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-domain document classification approach called Link-Bridged Topic model (LBT). LBT consists of two key steps. Firstly, LBT utilizes an auxiliary link network to discover the direct or indirect co-citation relationship among documents by embedding the background knowledge into a graph kernel. The mined co-citation relationship is leveraged to bridge the gap across different domains. Secondly, LBT simultaneously combines the content information and link structures into a unified latent topic model. The model is based on an assumption that the documents of source and target domains share some common topics from the point of view of both content information and link structure. By mapping both domains data into the latent topic spaces, LBT encodes the knowledge about domain commonality and difference as the shared topics with associated differential probabilities. The learned latent topics must be consistent with the source and target data, as well as content and link statistics. Then the shared topics act as the bridge to facilitate knowledge transfer from the source to the target domains. Experiments on different types of datasets show that our algorithm significantly improves the generalization performance of cross-domain document classification. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the main (and perhaps strong) assumption of these models is that generative process follows a bag-of-words assumption, i.e. each token is independent from the previous one. We extend the popular Latent Dirichlet Allocation model by exploiting three different conditional Markovian assumptions: (i) the token generation depends on the current topic and on the previous token; (ii) the topic associated with each observation depends on topic associated with the previous one; (iii) the token generation depends on the current and previous topic. For each of these modeling assumptions we present a Gibbs Sampling procedure for parameter estimation. Experimental evaluation over real-word data shows the performance advantages, in terms of recall and precision, of the sequence-modeling approaches.

TOPICVIEW: VISUAL ANALYSIS OF TOPIC MODELS AND THEIR IMPACT ON DOCUMENT CLUSTERING	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS			English	Article						Text analysis; visual model analysis; latent semantic analysis; latent dirichlet allocation; clustering		We present a new approach for analyzing topic models using visual analytics. We have developed Topic View, an application for visually comparing and exploring multiple models of text corpora, as a prototype for this type of analysis tool. Topic View uses multiple linked views to visually analyze conceptual and topical content, document relationships identified by models, and the impact of models on the results of document clustering. As case studies, we examine models created using two standard approaches: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Conceptual content is compared through the combination of (i) a bipartite graph matching LSA concepts with LDA topics based on the cosine similarities of model factors and (ii) a table containing the terms for each LSA concept and LDA topic listed in decreasing order of importance. Document relationships are examined through the combination of (i) side-by-side document similarity graphs, (ii) a table listing the weights for each document's contribution to each concept/topic, and (iii) a full text reader for documents selected in either of the graphs or the table. The impact of LSA and LDA models on document clustering applications is explored through similar means, using proximities between documents and cluster exemplars for graph layout edge weighting and table entries. We demonstrate the utility of Topic View's visual approach to model assessment by comparing LSA and LDA models of several example corpora.

Under our framework, a low-level codebook is generated by an adaptive quantization with respect to the activeness criterion. The Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (HDP) model is then applied to automatically cluster low-level features into atomic activities. Afterwards, the dynamic behaviors of the activities are represented as a multivariate point-process. The pair-wise relationships between activities are explicitly captured by the non-parametric Granger causality analysis, from which the activity interactions and temporal dependencies are discovered. Then, each video clip is labeled by one of the activity interactions. The results of the real-world traffic datasets show that the proposed method can achieve a high quality classification performance. Compared with traditional K-means clustering, a maximum improvement of 19.19% is achieved by using the proposed causal grouping method.

An Examination of Librarians' Contributions to Research	PORTAL-LIBRARIES AND THE ACADEMY			English	Article							LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION; INFORMATION-SCIENCE; ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS; PRACTITIONERS; SCHOLARSHIP; JOURNALS; AUTHORS	This article examines authorship of LIS literature in the context of practitioner and non-practitioner production of published research. For this study, 4,827 peer-reviewed articles from twenty LIS journals published between 1956 and 2011 were examined to determine the percentage of articles written by practitioners. The study identified a decrease in the proportion of articles authored by practitioners between 2006 and 2011. Topic analysis of articles revealed subtle yet distinct differences in research subject matter between practitioner-authored and non-practitioner-authored articles. If present trends continue, the character of LIS literature may shift away from many issues relating to practical librarianship.	[Finlay, S.

Assuming that the collection of each photographer's geotagged photos is a sequence of visited locations, photo-sharing sites are important sources for gathering the location histories of tourists. By following their location sequences, we can find representative and diverse travel routes that link key landmarks. Recommendations are performed by our photographer behavior model, which estimates the probability of a photographer visiting a landmark. We incorporate user preference and present location information into the probabilistic behavior model by combining topic models and Markov models. Based on the photographer behavior model, proposed route recommendation method outputs a set of personalized travel plans that match the user's preference, present location, spare time and transportation means. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using an actual large-scale geotag dataset held by Flickr in terms of the prediction accuracy of travel behavior.

J	Sang, JT; Xu, CS				Sang, Jitao; Xu, Changsheng			Social Influence Analysis and Application on Multimedia Sharing Websites	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA COMPUTING COMMUNICATIONS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Algorithms; Experimentation; Performance; Social relation analysis; influence analysis; social media; topic model		Social media is becoming popular these days, where users necessarily interact with each other to form social networks. Influence network, as one special case of social network, has been recognized as significantly impacting social activities and user decisions. We emphasize in this article that the inter-user influence is essentially topic-sensitive, as for different tasks users tend to trust different influencers and be influenced most by them. While existing research focuses on global influence modeling and applies to text-based networks, this work investigates the problem of topic-sensitive influence modeling in the multimedia domain. According to temporal data justification, we propose a multimodal probabilistic model, considering both users' textual annotation and uploaded visual images. This model is capable of simultaneously extracting user topic distributions and topic-sensitive influence strengths. By identifying the topic-sensitive influencer, we are able to conduct applications, like collective search and collaborative recommendation. A risk minimization-based general framework for personalized image search is further presented, where the image search task is transferred to measure the distance of image and personalized query language models. The framework considers the noisy tag issue and enables easy incorporation of social influence. We have conducted experiments on a large-scale Flickr dataset. Qualitative as well as quantitative evaluation results have validated the effectiveness of the topic-sensitive influencer mining model, and demonstrated the advantage of incorporating topic-sensitive influence in personalized image search and topic-based image recommendation.

J	Su, H; Yang, H; Zheng, SB; Fan, YW; Wei, S				Su, Hang; Yang, Hua; Zheng, Shibao; Fan, Yawen; Wei, Sha			The Large-Scale Crowd Behavior Perception Based on Spatio-Temporal Viscous Fluid Field	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY			English	Article						Crowd behavior analysis; spatio-temporal feature; crowd motion pattern	SOCIAL FORCE MODEL; SCENES; FLOW; MOTION	Over the past decades, a wide attention has been paid to crowd control and management in the intelligent video surveillance area. Among the tasks for automatic surveillance video analysis, crowd motion modeling lays a crucial foundation for numerous subsequent analysis but encounters many unsolved challenges due to occlusions among pedestrians, complicated motion patterns in crowded scenarios, etc. Addressing the unsolved challenges, the authors propose a novel spatio-temporal viscous fluid field to model crowd motion patterns by exploring both appearance of crowd behaviors and interaction among pedestrians. Large-scale crowd events are hereby recognized based on characteristics of the fluid field. First, a spatio-temporal variation matrix is proposed to measure the local fluctuation of video signals in both spatial and temporal domains. After that, eigenvalue analysis is applied on the matrix to extract the principal fluctuations resulting in an abstract fluid field. Interaction force is then explored based on shear force in viscous fluid, incorporating with the fluctuations to characterize motion properties of a crowd. The authors then construct a codebook by clustering neighboring pixels with similar spatio-temporal features, and consequently, crowd behaviors are recognized using the latent Dirichlet allocation model. The convincing results obtained from the experiments on published datasets demonstrate that the proposed method obtains high-quality results for large-scale crowd behavior perception in terms of both robustness and effectiveness.

The Impact of Classifier Configuration and Classifier Combination on Bug Localization	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Software maintenance; bug localization; information retrieval; VSM; LSI; LDA; classifier combination	LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION; FEATURE LOCATION; SYSTEMS; RETRIEVAL	Bug localization is the task of determining which source code entities are relevant to a bug report. Manual bug localization is labor intensive since developers must consider thousands of source code entities. Current research builds bug localization classifiers, based on information retrieval models, to locate entities that are textually similar to the bug report. Current research, however, does not consider the effect of classifier configuration, i.e., all the parameter values that specify the behavior of a classifier. As such, the effect of each parameter or which parameter values lead to the best performance is unknown. In this paper, we empirically investigate the effectiveness of a large space of classifier configurations, 3,172 in total. Further, we introduce a framework for combining the results of multiple classifier configurations since classifier combination has shown promise in other domains. Through a detailed case study on over 8,000 bug reports from three large-scale projects, we make two main contributions. First, we show that the parameters of a classifier have a significant impact on its performance. Second, we show that combining multiple classifiers-whether those classifiers are hand-picked or randomly chosen relative to intelligently defined subspaces of classifiers-improves the performance of even the best individual classifiers.

Therefore, this paper learns prior knowledge from the known human pose in the collected samples to infer characteristics of new human poses. This way realizing zero-shot and one-shot learning overcomes the above two difficulties. Finally, a novel human pose estimation based on knowledge transfer learning is proposed in this paper. In the process of our human pose estimation method, first, an attribute-based representation model of the human pose is built based on our proposed "body-pose-attribute" hierarchical framework. Under this model, an image would be divided into disjoint regions, and an attribute is extracted from each region. Thus, an attribute bags can be used to represent a specific human pose, then the attribute bag of a new human pose can be effectively transferred from the prior knowledge obtained from the known human poses. Second, an attribute parameter model called supervised LDA (SLDA) is built, and the Gibbs sampling algorithm is exploited to infer and to learn several parameters of the model for predicting the attributes of the test target samples. The experimental results from the subset of H3D dataset and VOC2011 dataset have shown that the proposed method is feasible and effective even if the training sample set is small.

This article proposes a novel method for image annotation based on combining feature-word distributions, which map from visual space to word space, and word-topic distributions, which form a structure to capture label relationships for annotation. We refer to this type of model as Feature-Word-Topic models. The introduction of topics allows us to efficiently take word associations, such as {ocean, fish, coral} or {desert, sand, cactus}, into account for image annotation. Unlike previous topic-based methods, we do not consider topics as joint distributions of words and visual features, but as distributions of words only. Feature-word distributions are utilized to define weights in computation of topic distributions for annotation. By doing so, topic models in text mining can be applied directly in our method. Our Feature-word-topic model, which exploits Gaussian Mixtures for feature-word distributions, and probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) for word-topic distributions, shows that our method is able to obtain promising results in image annotation and retrieval.

J	Gonzalez-Diaz, I; Diaz-de-Maria, F				Gonzalez-Diaz, Ivan; Diaz-de-Maria, Fernando			A region-centered topic model for object discovery and category-based image segmentation	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Latent topic models; Topic discovery; Category-based image segmentation; Kernel Logistic Regression; Context	RECOGNITION; CONTEXT; TEXTONBOOST	Latent topic models have become a popular paradigm in many computer vision applications due to their capability to unsupervisely discover semantics in visual content. Relying on the Bag-of-Words representation, they consider images as mixtures of latent topics that generate visual words according to some specific distributions. However, the performance of these methods is still limited by the way in which they take into account the spatial distribution of visual words and, what is even more important, the currently used appearance distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel region-centered latent topic model that introduces two main contributions: first, an improved spatial context model that allows for considering inter-topic inter-region influences; and second, an advanced region-based appearance distribution built on the Kernel Logistic Regressor. It is worth highlighting that the proposed contributions have been seamlessly integrated in the model, so that all the parameters are concurrently estimated using a unified inference process. Furthermore, the proposed model has been extended to work in both unsupervised and supervised modes. Our results for unsupervised mode improve 30% those of previous latent topic models. For supervised mode, where discriminative approaches are preponderant, our results are quite close to those of discriminative state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Grant, S; Cordy, JR; Skillicorn, DB				Grant, Scott; Cordy, James R.; Skillicorn, David B.			Using heuristics to estimate an appropriate number of latent topics in source code analysis	SCIENCE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING			English	Article						Source code analysis; Latent Dirichlet Allocation; Latent topic model; Code clusters	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; DIRICHLET ALLOCATION; TRACEABILITY LINKS; SOFTWARE; DOCUMENTATION; CLONES	Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a data clustering algorithm that performs especially well for text documents. In natural-language applications it automatically finds groups of related words (called "latent topics") and clusters the documents into sets that are about the same "topic". LDA has also been applied to source code, where the documents are natural source code units such as methods or classes, and the words are the keywords, operators, and programmer-defined names in the code. The problem of determining a topic count that most appropriately describes a set of source code documents is an open problem. We address this empirically by constructing clusterings with different numbers of topics for a large number of software systems, and then use a pair of measures based on source code locality and topic model similarity to assess how well the topic structure identifies related source code units. Results suggest that the topic count required can be closely approximated using the number of software code fragments in the system. We extend these results to recommend appropriate topic counts for arbitrary software systems based on an analysis of a set of open source systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Laudun, J; Goodwin, J				Laudun, John; Goodwin, Jonathan			Computing Folklore Studies: Mapping over a Century of Scholarly Production through Topics	JOURNAL OF AMERICAN FOLKLORE			English	Article						Intellectual history; computer analysis; folklore and folklife; journals (periodicals)		Folklorists, like most practitioners in afield, understand the history of their discipline through a combination of their own reading and the consensus inherited from their graduate training and professional interactions. Disciplinary history, an effectively oral form of communication, codifies quickly. Highly contingent and random processes become widely understood as historically inevitable. In this preliminary report on a larger project examining the application of computational methodologies in the service of intellectual history, we explore the use of topic modeling as a way to understand the ebb and flow of topics and paradigms within a domain. Using JSTOR's Data for Research application programming interface to access the contents of 6,778 articles from three folklore studies journals (Journal of American Folklore, Western Folklore, Journal of Folklore Research), we used one form of topic modeling, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, to delineate 50 distinct topics drawn from 125 years of research publication. Of particular interest here was the legendary "turn toward performance" in our field.

J	Momtazi, S; Naumann, F				Momtazi, Saeedeh; Naumann, Felix			Topic modeling for expert finding using latent Dirichlet allocation	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article								The task of expert finding is to rank the experts in the search space given a field of expertise as an input query. In this paper, we propose a topic modeling approach for this task. The proposed model uses latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to induce probabilistic topics. In the first step of our algorithm, the main topics of a document collection are extracted using LDA. The extracted topics present the connection between expert candidates and user queries. In the second step, the topics are used as a bridge to find the probability of selecting each candidate for a given query. The candidates are then ranked based on these probabilities. The experimental results on the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) Enterprise track for 2005 and 2006 show that the proposed topic-based approach outperforms the state-of-the-art profile- and document-based models, which use information retrieval methods to rank experts.

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a powerful mechanism to extract recurrent behaviors and high-level patterns (called topics) from mobility data in an unsupervised manner. One drawback of LDA is that it is difficult to give meaningful and usable labels to the extracted topics. We present a methodology to automatically classify the topic with meaningful labels so as to support their use in applications. We also present a topic prediction mechanism to infer user's future whereabouts on the basis of the extracted topics. Both these two mechanisms are tested and evaluated using the Reality Mining dataset consisting of a large set of continuous data on human behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

J	Guo, X; Xiang, Y; Chen, Q; Huang, ZH; Hao, YT				Guo, Xin; Xiang, Yang; Chen, Qian; Huang, Zhenhua; Hao, Yongtao			LDA-based online topic detection using tensor factorization	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						LDA; tensor factorization; topic detection; topic tensor		In the information retrieval field, effective and efficient extraction of topics from large-scale online text streams is challenging because it is a fully unsupervised learning task without prior knowledge. Most previous studies have focused on how to analyse text corpus to extract topics, rarely considering time dimensions. In the present study, we approached topic detection as a temporal optimization problem. Here, we propose a novel approach to incremental topic detection, called online topic detection using tensor factorization (OTD-TF), which is based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). First, topics are obtained from the corpus in current time slices using LDA. Second, a topic tensor with a time dimension is constructed to identify the correlations between pairs of topics. Then, approximate topics are merged using TF. Finally, documents are reallocated to corresponding topic bins. By executing these steps continuously and incrementally, temporal topic detection can be achieved. In theoretical analyses and simulation experiments, OTD-TF outperformed other systems in terms of space and time complexity and achieved a high precision ratio. Our experimental evaluations also revealed interesting temporal patterns in topic emergence, development, extinction, burst and transience.

For batch PLSA inference algorithms, the required memory size grows linearly with the data size, and handling massive data streams is very difficult. To process big data streams, we propose an online belief propagation (OBP) algorithm based on the improved factor graph representation for PLSA. The factor graph of PLSA facilitates the classic belief propagation (BP) algorithm. Furthermore, OBP splits the data stream into a set of small segments, and uses the estimated parameters of previous segments to calculate the gradient descent of the current segment. Because OBP removes each segment from memory after processing, it is memory-efficient for big data streams. We examine the performance of OBP on four document data sets, and demonstrate that OBP is competitive in both speed and accuracy for online expectation maximization (OEM) in PLSA, and can also give a more accurate topic evolution. Experiments on massive data streams from Baidu further confirm the effectiveness of the OBP algorithm.

However, often the amount of data available from an interesting data source is too small to model the data source well. When several data sets are available from related sources, exploiting their similarities by transfer learning can improve the resulting models compared to modeling sources independently. We introduce a Bayesian generative transfer learning model which represents similarity across document collections by sparse sharing of latent topics controlled by an Indian buffet process. Unlike a prominent previous model, hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) based multi-task learning, our model decouples topic sharing probability from topic strength, making sharing of low-strength topics easier. In experiments, our model outperforms the HDP approach both on synthetic data and in first of the two case studies on text collections, and achieves similar performance as the HDP approach in the second case study.

With these services, because users can attach annotations freely, some annotations do not describe the semantics of the content, thus they are noisy, i.e., not content related. The extraction of content-related annotations can be used as a prepossessing step in machine learning tasks such as text classification and image recognition, or can improve information retrieval performance. The proposed model is a generative model for content and annotations, in which the annotations are assumed to originate either from topics that generated the content or from a general distribution unrelated to the content.

In order to obtain statistical insight into the underlying patterns of motions in activities, we develop a dynamic, hierarchical Bayesian model which connects low-level visual features in videos with poses, motion patterns and classes of activities. This process is somewhat analogous to the method of detecting topics or categories from documents based on the word content of the documents, except that our documents are dynamic. The proposed generative model harnesses both the temporal ordering power of dynamic Bayesian networks such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and the automatic clustering power of hierarchical Bayesian models such as the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. We also introduce a probabilistic framework for detecting and localizing pre-specified activities (or gestures) in a video sequence, analogous to the use of filler models for keyword detection in speech processing. We demonstrate the robustness of our classification model and our spotting framework by recognizing activities in unconstrained real-life video sequences and by spotting gestures via a one-shot-learning approach.

The recent growth of data on complex social systems and the potential to derive stories from them has shifted the focus of journalistic and scientific attention increasingly toward data-driven journalism and computational social science. In this paper we advocate the usage of modern statistical methods for problems of data journalism and beyond, which may help journalistic and scientific work and lead to additional insight. Using the WikiLeaks Afghanistan war logs for illustration, we present an approach that builds intelligible statistical models for interpretable segments in the data, in this case to explore the fatality rates associated with different circumstances in the Afghanistan war. Our approach combines preprocessing by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with model trees. LDA is used to process the natural language information contained in each report summary by estimating latent topics and assigning each report to one of them. Together with other variables these topic assignments serve as splitting variables for finding segments in the data to which local statistical models for the reported number of fatalities are fitted. Segmentation and fitting is carried out with recursive partitioning of negative binomial distributions. We identify segments with different fatality rates that correspond to a small number of topics and other variables as well as their interactions. Furthermore, we carve out the similarities between segments and connect them to stories that have been covered in the media. This gives an unprecedented description of the war in Afghanistan and serves as an example of how data journalism, computational social science and other areas with interest in database data can benefit from modern statistical techniques.

On account of the deficiency of parameter estimation in LDA, this study integrated co-occurrence theory and clustering judgement indicators and constructed an ATNLDA (Auto Topic Number LDA) model for topic segmentation. Next, ATNLDA was used to determine the optimal topic number of stem cell research literatures from 2006 to 2011 in PubMed, which was then used for topic segmentation of research content in stem cell data set. After stem cell research topics were obtained, they were analysed in terms of topic label, topic research content and interrelation between topics. The results verified that application of ATNLDA in topic segmentation in stem cell literature research is effective and feasible. Current deficiencies of ATNLDA and future study plan were also discussed.

As underlying models we consider the vector space model (both in a term setting and in a latent semantic analysis setting) and probabilistic topic models based on latent Dirichlet allocation. Content terms can be classified as topical terms or named entities, yielding several models for content fusion and comparison. All used methods are completely unsupervised.

Price is an important factor in consumer purchase behavior. The proposed model assumes that a topic has its own price distributions for each item as well as an item distribution. The topic proportions, which represent a user's purchase tendency, are influenced by the user's purchased items and their prices. By estimating the mean and the variance of the price for each topic, the proposed model can cluster related items taking their price ranges into consideration. We present its efficient inference procedure based on collapsed Gibbs sampling. Experiments on real purchase data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

J	Ramanathan, V; Wechsler, H				Ramanathan, Venkatesh; Wechsler, Harry			Phishing detection and impersonated entity discovery using Conditional Random Field and Latent Dirichlet Allocation	COMPUTERS & SECURITY			English	Article						Boosting; Conditional Random Field; Identity theft; Impersonated entity discovery; Latent Dirichlet Allocation; Machine learning; Named entity; Natural language processing; Phishing		Phishing is an attempt to steal users' personal and financial information such as passwords, social security and credit card numbers, via electronic communication such as e-mail and other messaging services. Attackers pretend to be from a legitimate organization and direct users to a fake website that resembles a legitimate website, which is then used to collect users' personal information. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to detect phishing attacks and to discover the entity/organization that the attackers impersonate during phishing attacks. The proposed multi-stage methodology employs natural language processing and machine learning. The methodology first discovers (i) named entities, which includes names of people, organizations, and locations; and (ii) hidden topics, using (a) Conditional Random Field (CRF) and (b) Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) operating on both phishing and non-phishing data. Utilizing topics and named entities as features, the next stage classifies each message as phishing or non-phishing using AdaBoost. For messages classified as phishing, the final stage discovers the impersonated entity using CRF. Experimental results show that the phishing classifier detects phishing attacks with no misclassification when the proportion of phishing emails is less than 20%. The F-measure obtained was 100%. Our approach also discovers the impersonated entity from messages that are classified as phishing, with a discovery rate of 88.1%. The automatic discovery of impersonated entity from phishing helps the legitimate organization to take down the offending phishing site. This protects their users from falling for phishing attacks, which in turn leads to satisfied customers. Automatic discovery of an impersonated entity also helps email service providers to collaborate with each other to exchange attack information and protect their customers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a well known topic model. Variational Bayesian inference or collapsed Gibbs sampling is often used to estimate parameters in LDA; however, these inference methods incur high computational cost for large-scale data. Therefore, highly efficient technology is needed for this purpose. We use parallel computation technology for efficient collapsed Gibbs sampling inference for LDA. We assume a symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) cluster, which has been widely used in recent years. In prior work on parallel inference for LDA, either MPI or OpenMP has often been used alone. For an SMP cluster, however, it is more suitable to adopt hybrid parallelization that uses message passing for communication between SMP nodes and loop directives for parallelization within each SMP node. We developed an MPI/OpenMP hybrid parallel inference method for LDA, and evaluated the performance of the inference under various settings of an SMP cluster. We further investigated the approximation that controls the inter-node communications, and found out that it achieved noticeable increase in inference speed while maintaining inference accuracy.

J	Vaduva, C; Gavat, I; Datcu, M				Vaduva, Corina; Gavat, Inge; Datcu, Mihai			Latent Dirichlet Allocation for Spatial Analysis of Satellite Images	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						High-level image understanding; invariant signatures; latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA); spatial relationships	RELATIVE POSITION; INFORMATION; RETRIEVAL; MODELS; WORDS	This paper describes research that seeks to supersede human inductive learning and reasoning in high-level scene understanding and content extraction. Searching for relevant knowledge with a semantic meaning consists mostly in visual human inspection of the data, regardless of the application. The method presented in this paper is an innovation in the field of information retrieval. It aims to discover latent semantic classes containing pairs of objects characterized by a certain spatial positioning. A hierarchical structure is recommended for the image content. This approach is based on a method initially developed for topics discovery in text, applied this time to invariant descriptors of image region or objects configurations. First, invariant spatial signatures are computed for pairs of objects, based on a measure of their interaction, as attributes for describing spatial arrangements inside the scene. Spatial visual words are then defined through a simple classification, extracting new patterns of similar object configurations. Further, the scene is modeled according to these new patterns (spatial visual words) using the latent Dirichlet allocation model into a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics.

In this model, documents are represented as a mixture of sequential activity patterns (our motifs) where the mixing weights are defined by the motif starting time occurrences. The novelties are multi fold. First, unlike previous approaches where topics modeled only the co-occurrence of words at a given time instant, our motifs model the co-occurrence and temporal order in which the words occur within a temporal window. Second, unlike traditional Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN), our model accounts for the important case where activities occur concurrently in the video (but not necessarily in synchrony), i.e., the advent of activity motifs can overlap. The learning of the motifs in these difficult situations is made possible thanks to the introduction of latent variables representing the activity starting times, enabling us to implicitly align the occurrences of the same pattern during the joint inference of the motifs and their starting times. As a third novelty, we propose a general method that favors the recovery of sparse distributions, a highly desirable property in many topic model applications, by adding simple regularization constraints on the searched distributions to the data likelihood optimization criteria. We substantiate our claims with experiments on synthetic data to demonstrate the algorithm behavior, and on four video datasets with significant variations in their activity content obtained from static cameras. We observe that using low-level motion features from videos, our algorithm is able to capture sequential patterns that implicitly represent typical trajectories of scene objects.

Conventional topic-based visualization approaches are inefficient to capture this complicated thematic structure. This paper introduces a novel topic-based model, called the topic hypergraph, that characterizes the thematic structure of a long document with a hypergraph representation. Each hypergraph node represents a unique document piece, and encodes its theme as a composition of multiple topics. Two types of relationships among nodes are modeled: an edge that connects two consecutive themes to present their sequential transition, and a hyperedge that encodes a topic. The new representation is essentially a 2D reformulation of the linear streamgraph representation, and can be adaptive by constructing a multi-level hierarchy. We design a suite of visualization and interaction tools to allow users to interactively analyze the theme evolution, theme diversities, and topic interleaving. Our approach is also suitable for comparing multiple long documents.

Each document d in our collection D is a clinical trial protocol which itself contains a set of eligibility criteria. Given a small set of sample documents D', vertical bar D'vertical bar << vertical bar D vertical bar, a user has initially identified as relevant e.g., via a user query interface, our scoring method automatically suggests eligibility criteria from D, D superset of D', by ranking them according to how appropriate they are to the clinical trial protocol currently being designed. The appropriateness is measured by the degree to which they are consistent with the user-supplied sample documents D'. Method: We propose a novel three-step method called LDALR which views documents as a mixture of latent topics. First, we infer the latent topics in the sample documents using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Next, we use logistic regression models to compute the probability that a given candidate criterion belongs to a particular topic. Lastly, we score each criterion by computing its expected value, the probability-weighted sum of the topic proportions inferred from the set of sample documents. Intuitively, the greater the probability that a candidate criterion belongs to the topics that are dominant in the samples, the higher its expected value or score. Results: Our experiments have shown that LDALR is 8 and 9 times better (resp., for inclusion and exclusion criteria) than randomly choosing from a set of candidates obtained from relevant documents. In user simulation experiments using LDALR, we were able to automatically construct eligibility criteria that are on the average 75% and 70% (resp., for inclusion and exclusion criteria) similar to the correct eligibility criteria. Conclusions: We have proposed LDALR, a practical method for discovering and inferring appropriate eligibility criteria in clinical trial protocols without labeled data. Results from our experiments suggest that LDALR models can be used to effectively find appropriate eligibility criteria from a large repository of clinical trial protocols.

J	Feng, YS; Lapata, M				Feng, Yansong; Lapata, Mirella			Automatic Caption Generation for News Images	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Caption generation; image annotation; summarization; topic models	NATURAL-LANGUAGE; ANNOTATION; DATABASE; SYSTEM	This paper is concerned with the task of automatically generating captions for images, which is important for many image-related applications. Examples include video and image retrieval as well as the development of tools that aid visually impaired individuals to access pictorial information. Our approach leverages the vast resource of pictures available on the web and the fact that many of them are captioned and colocated with thematically related documents. Our model learns to create captions from a database of news articles, the pictures embedded in them, and their captions, and consists of two stages. Content selection identifies what the image and accompanying article are about, whereas surface realization determines how to verbalize the chosen content. We approximate content selection with a probabilistic image annotation model that suggests keywords for an image. The model postulates that images and their textual descriptions are generated by a shared set of latent variables (topics) and is trained on a weakly labeled dataset (which treats the captions and associated news articles as image labels). Inspired by recent work in summarization, we propose extractive and abstractive surface realization models. Experimental results show that it is viable to generate captions that are pertinent to the specific content of an image and its associated article, while permitting creativity in the description. Indeed, the output of our abstractive model compares favorably to handwritten captions and is often superior to extractive methods.

J	Huang, ZX; Lu, XD; Duan, HL				Huang, Zhengxing; Lu, Xudong; Duan, Huilong			Latent Treatment Pattern Discovery for Clinical Processes	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Clinical process analysis; Latent Dirichlet Allocation; Pattern discovery; Careflow log	PROCESS MODELS; EVENT LOGS; PATHWAYS; CARE; SUPPORT	A clinical process is typically a mixture of various latent treatment patterns, implicitly indicating the likelihood of what clinical activities are essential/critical to the process. Discovering these hidden patterns is one of the most important components of clinical process analysis. What makes the pattern discovery problem complex is that these patterns are hidden in clinical processes, are composed of variable clinical activities, and often vary significantly between patient individuals. This paper employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover treatment patterns as a probabilistic combination of clinical activities. The probability distribution derived from LDA surmises the essential features of treatment patterns, and clinical processes can be accurately described by combining different classes of distributions. The presented approach has been implemented and evaluated via real-world data sets.

J	Pirolli, P; Kairam, S				Pirolli, Peter; Kairam, Sanjay			A knowledge-tracing model of learning from a social tagging system	USER MODELING AND USER-ADAPTED INTERACTION			English	Article						Cognitive models; User models; Latent Dirichlet allocation; LDA; Topic models; SparTag.us; Social tagging; Social web	REPRESENTATION	We propose a user model to support personalized learning paths through online material. Our approach is a variant of student modeling using the computer tutoring concept of knowledge tracing. Knowledge tracing involves representing the knowledge required to master a domain, and, from traces of online user behavior, diagnosing user knowledge states as a profile over those elements. The user model is induced from documents tagged by an expert in a social tagging system. Tags identified with "expertise" in a domain can be used to identify a corpus of domain documents. That corpus can be fed to an automated process that distills a topic model representation characteristic of the domain. As a learner navigates and reads online material, inferences can be made about the degree to which topics in the target domain have been learned. We validate this knowledge tracing approach against data from a social tagging study. As part of this evaluation, we match the predictions of the knowledge-tracing model to individual participant responses made to individual question items used to test domain knowledge.

J	Brahmi, A; Ech-Cherif, A; Benyettou, A				Brahmi, Abderrezak; Ech-Cherif, Ahmed; Benyettou, Abdelkader			An Arabic Lemma-Based Stemmer for Latent Topic Modeling	INTERNATIONAL ARAB JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Arabic stemming; topic model; semantic analysis; classification; test collection		Developments in Arabic information retrieval did not follow the increasing use of the Arabic Web during the last decade. Semantic indexing in a language with high inflectional morphology, such as Arabic, is not a trivial task and requires a text analysis in the original language. Excepting cross-language retrieval methods or limited studies, the main efforts, for developing semantic analysis methods and topic modeling, did not include Arabic text. This paper describes our approach for analyzing semantics in Arabic texts. A new lemma-based stemmer is developed and compared to root-based one for characterizing Arabic text. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is adapted to extract Arabic latent topics from various real-world corpora. In addition to the interesting subjects discovered in the press articles during the 2007-2009 period, experiments show that the classification performances with lemma-based stemming in the topics space, are improved when comparing to classification with root-based stemming.

However, it is often the case that those search result documents consist of a mixture of documents that are closely related to various contents. In order to address the issue of quickly overviewing the distribution of contents, this paper proposes a framework of labeling blog posts with Wikipedia entries through LDA (latent Dirichlet allocation) based topic modeling of Wikipedia. One of the most important advantages of this LDA-based document model is that the collected Wikipedia entries and their LDA parameters heavily depend on the distribution of keywords across all the search result of blog posts. This tendency actually contributes to quickly overviewing the search result of blog posts through the LDA-based topic distribution. We show that the LDA-based document retrieval scheme outperforms our previous approach. Finally, we compare the proposed approach to the standard LDA-based topic modeling without Wikipedia knowledge source. Both LDA-based topic modeling results have quite different nature and contribute to quickly overviewing the search result of blog posts in a quite complementary fashion.

J	Tang, SL; Zhang, Y; Wang, HQ; Chen, M; Wu, F; Zhuang, YT				Tang Siliang; Zhang Yin; Wang Hanqi; Chen Ming; Wu Fei; Zhuang Yueting			The Discovery of Burst Topic and Its Intermittent Evolution in Our Real World	CHINA COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						LDA; time series; iterative clustering model		Nowadays, a considerably large number of documents are available over many online news sites (e.g., CNN and NYT). Therefore, the utilization of these online documents, for example, the discovery of a burst topic and its evolution, is a significant challenge. In this paper, a novel topic model, called intermittent Evolution LDA (iELDA) is proposed. In iELDA, the time-evolving documents are divided into many small epochs. iELDA utilizes the detected global topics as priors to guide the detection of an emerging topic and keep track of its evolution over different epochs. As a natural extension of the traditional Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Dynamic Topic Model (DTM), iELDA has an advantage: it can discover the intermittent recurring pattern of a burst topic. We apply iELDA to real-world data from NYT; the results demonstrate that the proposed iELDA can appropriately capture a burst topic and track its intermittent evolution as well as produce a better predictive ability than other related topic models.

J	Martin, GH; Schockaert, S; Cornelis, C; Naessens, H				Martin, German Hurtado; Schockaert, Steven; Cornelis, Chris; Naessens, Helga			Using semi-structured data for assessing research paper similarity	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Document similarity; Semi-structured document; Language modeling; Latent Dirichlet Allocation	RETRIEVAL	The task of assessing the similarity of research papers is of interest in a variety of application contexts. It is a challenging task, however, as the full text of the papers is often not available, and similarity needs to be determined based on the papers' abstract, and some additional features such as their authors, keywords, and the journals in which they were published. Our work explores several methods to exploit this information, first by using methods based on the vector space model and then by adapting language modeling techniques to this end. In the first case, in addition to a number of standard approaches we experiment with the use of a form of explicit semantic analysis. In the second case, the basic strategy we pursue is to augment the information contained in the abstract by interpolating the corresponding language model with language models for the authors, keywords and journal of the paper. This strategy is then extended by revealing the latent topic structure of the collection using an adaptation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation, in which the keywords that were provided by the authors are used to guide the process. Experimental analysis shows that a well-considered use of these techniques significantly improves the results of the standard vector space model approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Jeong, YS; Jin, SY; Choi, HJ				Jeong, Young-Seob; Jin, Sou-Young; Choi, Ho-Jin			Non-Simultaneous Sampling Deactivation during the Parameter Approximation of a Topic Model	KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Topic mining; unsupervised learning; efficient parameter approximation		Since Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) were introduced, many revised or extended topic models have appeared. Due to the intractable likelihood of these models, training any topic model requires to use some approximation algorithm such as variational approximation, Laplace approximation, or Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Although these approximation algorithms perform well, training a topic model is still computationally expensive given the large amount of data it requires. In this paper, we propose a new method, called non-simultaneous sampling deactivation, for efficient approximation of parameters in a topic model. While each random variable is normally sampled or obtained by a single predefined burn-in period in the traditional approximation algorithms, our new method is based on the observation that the random variable nodes in one topic model have all different periods of convergence. During the iterative approximation process, the proposed method allows each random variable node to be terminated or deactivated when it is converged. Therefore, compared to the traditional approximation ways in which usually every node is deactivated concurrently, the proposed method achieves the inference efficiency in terms of time and memory. We do not propose a new approximation algorithm, but a new process applicable to the existing approximation algorithms. Through experiments, we show the time and memory efficiency of the method, and discuss about the tradeoff between the efficiency of the approximation process and the parameter consistency.

The key idea underlying these studies is "multimodal categorization" of a robot's experience. However, previous studies considered only nonhierarchical categorization methods, which led to nonhierarchical concept structures. Our concepts have a hierarchical structure, thus ensuring that the resulting inferences are more efficient and accurate. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical categorization method. The method involves extending multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation (MLDA) to hierarchical MLDA using the nested Chinese restaurant process, which makes it possible for robots to acquire concepts in a hierarchical structure. We show that a robot can form a hierarchical concept structure based on self-obtained multimodal information. Moreover, by focusing on the common features of each category in the hierarchy, the robot is able to infer unobserved information including word meanings.

In regard to developing advanced driver-assistance systems (ADASs), various methods for recognizing driver behavior have been proposed. Most of these methods employ a supervised approach based on human tags. Unfortunately, preparing complete annotations is practically impossible with massive driving-behavioral data because of the great variety of driving scenes. To overcome that difficulty, in this study, a double articulation analyzer (DAA) is used to segment continuous driving-behavioral data into sequences of discrete driving scenes. Thereafter, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is used for clustering the driving scenes into a small number of so-called " drive topics" according to emergence frequency of physical features observed in the scenes. Because both DAA and LDA are unsupervised methods, they achieve data-driven scene segmentation and drive topic estimation without human tags. Labels of the extracted drive topics are also determined automatically by using distributions of the physical behavioral features included in each drive topic. The proposed framework therefore translates the output of sensors monitoring the driver and the driving environment into natural language. Efficiency of proposed method is evaluated by using a massive data set of driving behavior, including 90 drives for more than 78 hours over 3700km in total.

Various driving support systems nowadays have been developed for safe and comfortable driving. To develop more effective driving assist systems, abstractive recognition of driving situation performed just like a human driver is important in order to achieve fully cooperative driving between the driver and vehicle. To achieve human-like annotation of driving behavioral data and image sequences, we first divided continuous driving behavioral data into discrete symbols that represent driving situations. Then, using multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation, latent driving topics laid on each driving situation were estimated as a relation model among driving behavioral data, image sequences, and human-annotated tags. Finally, automatic annotation of the behavioral data and image sequences can be achieved by calculating the predictive distribution of the annotations via estimated latent-driving topics. The proposed method intuitively annotated more than 50,000 pieces of frame data, including urban road and expressway data. The effectiveness of the estimated drive topics was also evaluated by analyzing the performances of driving-situation classification. The topics represented the drive context efficiently, i.e., the drive topics lead to a 95% lower-dimensional feature space and 6% higher accuracy compared with a high-dimensional raw-feature space. Moreover, the drive topics achieved performance almost equivalent performance to human annotators, especially in classifying traffic jams and the number of lanes.

Term weighting is a standard preprocessing step in TR and is used to adjust the importance of a term within a document or corpus. Common term weighting schemes such as tf-idf may not be optimal for use with source code, because they originate from a natural language context and were designed for use with unstructured documents. In this paper we propose a new approach to term weighting in which term weights are assigned using the structural information from the source code. We then evaluate the proposed approach by conducting an empirical study of a TR-based FLT. In all, we study over 400 bugs and features from five open source Java systems and find that structural term weighting can cause a statistically significant improvement in the accuracy of the FLT.

For analyzing this type of data, existing topic modeling approaches, which are highly tailored toward document collections, require manually-defined regularization terms to exploit and to bias the topic learning towards structure information. We propose an approach, called Topical Relational Model, as a principled approach for automatically learning topics from both textual and structure information. Using a topic model, we can show that our approach is effective in exploiting heterogeneous structure information, outperforming a state-of-the-art approach that requires manually-tuned regularization.

Vehicles and pedestrians are tracked within the video imagery and their collective activity in each time frame is measured and categorized using a natural extension of the dynamic latent Dirichlet allocation model. Our extension involves use of multiple types of simultaneously observed features from multiple classes of objects within the video imagery. Within the prior for the model these features are treated as independent, and modeled as draws from a variety of appropriate distribution types. By including multiple features, the model generates a richer set of activities; we quantitatively show that this yields better predictions of physical attributes within the scene, relative to currently available models that use only the single best feature. We show this by comparing model prediction of traffic light states within a busy intersection, which we ground-truth manually within the video imagery.	[Brandes, T.

The focus of comparative summarization is the analysis of input documents and the creation of summaries which depict the most significant differences in them. We experiment with two well known methods - Latent Semantic Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation - to obtain the latent topics of documents. These topics can be compared and thus we can learn the main factual differences and select the most significant sentences into the output summaries. Our algorithms are briefly explained in section 2 and their evaluation on the TAC 2011 dataset with the ROUGE toolkit is then presented in section 3.

Topic models provide a low-dimensional representation of large document corpora, and drive many important applications such as summarization, document segmentation, word-sense disambiguation, etc. Evaluation of topic models is an important issue; since low-quality topics potentially degrade the performance of these applications. In this paper, we develop a graph mining and machine learning approach for the external evaluation of topic models. Based on the graph-centric features we extract from the projection of topic words on the Wikipedia page-links graph, we learn models that can predict the human-perceived quality of topics (based on human judgments), and classify them as high or low quality. Experiments on four real-world corpora show that our approach boosts the prediction performance up to 30% over three baselines of various complexities, and demonstrate the generality of our method to diverse domains. In addition, we provide an interpretation of our models and outline the discriminating characteristics of topic quality.

The discriminative log-linear component reduces the number of parameters to be learnt while outperforming baseline generative models. At the same time, the explanatory power of the generative component is not compromised. We establish its superiority over a purely generative model by applying it to two different ranking tasks: (a) In the first task, we look at the problem of proposing alternative citations given textual and bibliographic evidence. We solve it as a ranking problem in itself and as a platform for further qualitative analysis of convergence of scientific phenomenon. (b) In the second task we address the problem of ranking potential email recipients based on email content and sender information.

Recently, topic models have been successfully used in SDR as well as general information retrieval (lR). These models fall into two categories: probabilistic topic models (PTM) and non-probabilistic topic models (NPTM). One major difference between PTM and NPTM is that the former only takes the words occurring in a document into account, whereas the latter, such as latent semantic analysis (LSA), explicitly models all the words in the vocabulary (including both occurring and non-occurring words). We believe that the non-occurring words can provide additional information that is also useful for SDR. However, to our best knowledge, there is a dearth of work investigating the effectiveness of the non-occurring words for SDR and IR. In order to make effective use of those non-occurring words of documents for semantic analysis, we propose a weighted matrix factorization (WMF) framework, in which the impact of the non-occurring words on the semantic analysis can be modulated properly. The results of SDR experiments conducted on the TDT-2 (Topic Detection and Tracking) collection highlight the performance merits of our proposed framework when compared to several existing topic models.

An important limitation of existing Web service clustering approaches is that they solely focus on utilizing WSDL (Web Service Description Language) documents. There has been a recent trend of using user-contributed tagging data to improve the performance of service clustering. Nonetheless, these approaches fail to completely leverage the information carried by the tagging data and hence only trivially improve the clustering performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that seamlessly integrates tagging data and WSDL documents through augmented Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We also develop three strategies to preprocess tagging data before being integrated into the LDA framework for clustering. Comprehensive experiments based on real data and the implementation of a Web service search engine demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed LDA-based service clustering approach.

Now, we generate this amount of contents in about two days! The spread of generic (as Twitter, Facebook or Google+) or specialized (as LinkedIn or Viadeo) social networks allows sharing opinions on different aspects of life every day. Therefore this information is a rich source of data for opinion mining and sentiment analysis. This paper introduces a novel approach to the sentiment analysis based on the Weighted Word Pairs obtained by the use of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) approach. The proposed methodology aims at identifying a word-based graphical model for depicting and mining a positive or negative attitude towards a topic. For the evaluation of the proposed approach a challenging scenario has been set: the real-time analysis of tweets. The experimental evaluation shows how the proposed approach is effective and satisfactory.

We build a sequence of daily corporate news network for the period 2005-2011 using companies of the STOXX 50 index as nodes; the weights of the edges are the sum of the number of news items with the same topic by every pair of companies identified by the topic model methodology. The STOXX 50 includes the top 50 European companies by level of capitalization. We performed the Granger causality test and the Brownian distance covariance test of independence among several measures of centrality, return and volatility. We found that the average eigenvector centrality of the corporate news networks at different points of time has an impact on return and volatility of the STOXX 50 index. Likewise, return and volatility of the STOXX 50 index also has an effect on average eigenvector centrality. These results are more significant during the most important period of the recent financial crisis (January 2008-March 2009). So, we observe that there is a dynamic process that affects and is affected by return, volatility, and centrality. The causality tests suggest it is possible to improve the prediction of return and volatility by extracting and analyzing a network based on the common topics of news stories.

Most work assumes that a user is not constrained in their selection of items. This assumption does not take into account the availability constraint, whereby users could only access some items, but not others. For example, in subscription-based systems, we can observe only those historical preferences on subscribed (available) items. However, the objective is to predict preferences on unsubscribed (unavailable) items, which do not appear in the historical observations due to their (lack of) availability. To model preferences in a probabilistic manner and address the issue of availability constraint, we develop a graphical model, called Latent Transition Model (LTM) to discover users' latent interests. LTM is novel in incorporating transitions in interests when certain items are not available to the user. Experiments on a real-life implicit feedback dataset demonstrate that LTM is effective in discovering customers' latent interests, and it achieves significant improvements in prediction accuracy over baselines that do not model transitions.

A Thousand Frames in Just a Few Words: Lingual Description of Videos through Latent Topics and Sparse Object Stitching	2013 IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION (CVPR)	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition		English	Proceedings Paper	26th IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)	JUN 23-28, 2013	Portland, OR	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc				The problem of describing images through natural language has gained importance in the computer vision community. Solutions to image description have either focused on a top-down approach of generating language through combinations of object detections and language models or bottom-up propagation of keyword tags from training images to test images through probabilistic or nearest neighbor techniques. In contrast, describing videos with natural language is a less studied problem. In this paper, we combine ideas from the bottom-up and top-down approaches to image description and propose a method for video description that captures the most relevant contents of a video in a natural language description. We propose a hybrid system consisting of a low level multimodal latent topic model for initial keyword annotation, a middle level of concept detectors and a high level module to produce final lingual descriptions. We compare the results of our system to human descriptions in both short and long forms on two datasets, and demonstrate that final system output has greater agreement with the human descriptions than any single level.

This is typically accomplished by sending an email message to a user, with a link directing the user to a web site used to collect personal information. Phishing detection systems typically rely on content filtering techniques, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify phishing messages. In the case of spear phishing, however, this may be ineffective because messages from a trusted source may contain little content. In order to handle such emerging spear phishing behavior, we propose as a first step the use of Spectral Clustering to analyze messages based on traffic behavior. In particular, Spectral Clustering analyzes the links between URL substrings for web sites found in the message contents. Cluster membership is then used to construct a Random Forest classifier for phishing. Data from the Phishing Email Corpus and the Spam Assassin Email Corpus are used to evaluate this approach. Performance evaluation metrics include the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC), as well as accuracy, precision, recall, and the (harmonic mean) F measure. Performance of the integrated Spectral Clustering and Random Forest approach is found to provide significant improvements in all the metrics listed, compared to a content filtering technique such as LDA coupled with text message deletion done randomly or in an adaptive fashion using adversarial learning. The Spectral Clustering approach is robust against the absence of content. In particular, we show that Spectral Clustering yields (99.8%, 97.8%) for (AUC, F measure) compared to LDA that yields (94.6%, 89.4%) and (79.6%, 57.9%) when the content of the messages is reduced to 10% of their original size using random and adversarial deletion, respectively. The difference is most striking at low False Positive (FP) rates.

Cluster Based Human Action Recognition Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation	2013 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CIRCUITS, CONTROLS AND COMMUNICATIONS (CCUBE)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Circuits, Controls and Communications (CCUBE)	DEC 27-28, 2013	Bengaluru, INDIA			Clusters; Gait Sequence; Human Action Recognition; Latent Dirichlet Allocation		Recognizing human actions in video streams is a challenging task in the field of image processing and surveillance. This is due to variabilities in shapes, articulations of human body, cluttered background scene and occlusions. Conventional human action recognition algorithms generate coarse clusters of input videos, with lesser information regarding the cluster generation. In this paper, a mapping technique has been proposed which transforms the gait sequences into document-word template required for topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Algorithm (LDA). LDA is used to group the input videos into finer clusters. Experiments on KTH dataset [10] suggest that the proposed algorithm is effective method for recognizing human actions from the video streams.	[Deepak, N.

Recently, a lot of sentiment analysis models have been proposed, including supervised and unsupervised approaches. However, the role of supervised models has been undermined by the phenomenon of big data, and the unsupervised ones are drawing more and more attention. But, most current unsupervised methods are based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and they need to specify the number of aspects in advance, making them subjective. In addition, these methods treat factual words and opinioned words the same, and assume that one sentence contains only one aspect, all of which make the existing unsupervised methods unsatisfactory. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel hybrid Hierarchical Dirichlet Process-Latent Dirichlet Allocation (HDP-LDA) model. This model can automatically determine the number of aspects, distinguish factual words from opinioned words, and further effectively extracts the aspect specific sentiment words. Experiment result shows that our model can clearly capture the aspects people mentioned and the specific sentiment words they use in each aspect, improving the performance of sentiment analysis efficiently. At last, we compared our model with the influential topic models, namely, JST, AUSM and MaxEnt-LDA, on the online restaurant review, and found our model performs very well.

Although in theory these topic models can produce very good results if they are configured properly, in reality their potential may be undermined by improper calibration of their parameters (e. g., number of topics, hyper-parameters), which could potentially lead to sub-optimal results. In our previous work we addressed this issue and proposed LDA-GA, an approach that uses Genetic Algorithms (GA) to find a near-optimal configuration of parameters for LDA, which was shown to produce superior results for traceability link recovery and other tasks than reported ad-hoc configurations. LDA-GA works by optimizing the coherence of topics produced by LDA for a given dataset. In this paper, we instantiate LDA-GA as a TraceLab experiment, making publicly available all the implemented components, the datasets and the results from our previous work. In addition, we provide guidelines on how to extend our LDA-GA approach to other IR techniques and other software engineering tasks using existing TraceLab components.

To mimic this mechanism in robots, multimodal categorization, which enables the robot to form concepts, has been studied. On the other hand, segmentation and categorization of human motions have also been studied to recognize and predict future motions. This paper addresses the issue on how these different kinds of concepts are integrated to generate higher level concepts and, more importantly, on how the higher level concepts affect the formation of each lower level concept. To this end, we propose the multi-layered multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation (mMLDA), which is an expansion of the MLDA to learn and represent the hierarchical structure of concepts. We also examine a simple integration model and compare it with the mMLDA. The experimental results reveal that the mMLDA leads to a better inference performance and, indeed, forms higher level concepts which integrate motions and objects that are necessary for real-world understanding.

The aim of this paper is to narrow the focus of this broader problem of using social media to crowdsource information to assist in the fight against crime, to the specific problem of identifying the description of vehicles in microblog text. As this problem has many aspects, especially in terms of data gathering and identification, an initial search is performed on preset keywords and the resulting database is tagged. The tags are then analysed to determine which features are the most common. Topic models are then run on the data to determine if any useful keyword can be found for further searches and initial statistics are recorded as a baseline for further processing. Our primary concern is establishing the common content of the relevant Tweets. The result could be used both for help with data collection as well as with feature selection when learning classification algorithms for data mining.

LDA is a generative topic model that is capable of hierarchically organizing discrete data including texts and images. We propose a new texture model by connecting texture primitives to the topic of LDA. The model is able to extract the characteristic features of a texture primitive and group them into a topic based on their frequencies of co-occurrence. Here, the feature descriptor is the connection of Haar-like features of multiple sizes. The segments of an image are finally obtained by identifying the homogeneous regions in the corresponding topic assignment map. The evaluation results for synthetic texture mosaics, remote sensing images, and natural scene images are illustrated.

This characterization, important for customers and companies, goes beyond traditional sentiment analysis where the polarity of the sentiments expressed in opinions is usually identified as positive, negative or neutral. The authors investigate different tweet representation models, including bags of words and probabilistic topic models, to shed light on the semantics of the messages. Their experiments show that topic-based models generated with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) yield, most of the times, better categorizations when compared to TF-IDF based features, particularly when these models are enriched with natural language features and specific Twitter slang.

Extracting Turkish Tweet Topics Using LDA	2013 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERING (ELECO)			English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Electrical and Electronics Engineering (ELECO)	NOV 28-30, 2013	Bursa, TURKEY	Chamber Elect Engineers Bursa Branch, Istanbul Techn Univ, Fac Elect & Elect Engn, Uludag Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, IEEE, Reg 8, IEEE Turkey Sect, CAS Chapter, Sci & Technol Res Council Turkey				Social media is a very popular medium of communication for sharing people's activities, opinions and feelings with others. Twitter has become one of the most popular of these social media services. Finding relevant information in the large space of Twitter is a challenge. Various algorithms have been developed to find related tweets. Extracting tweet topics is one of the techniques that can be used for this purpose. Recently, LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) has been successfully used in analysis of tweet topics in English. However, LDA hasn't been tried on Turkish tweets. Turkish is an agglutinative language, which makes application of LDA a new challenge compared to LDA on English tweets. A series of preprocessing steps like stemming, stop word elimination, cleaning of punctuations and spelling errors etc. to make the tweet texts suitable for LDA analysis are used in our application. 6 6.000 tweets and 4.000 control tweets with Twitter4j library are crawled [2]. Zemberek library is used for stemming [3]. The language used in tweets -with its own rules, wide spread spelling errors or made-up words - make text analysis very difficult. Some of these problems are solved by adding new words into Zemberek library and some of the problematic words are completely removed. After preprocessing, LDA i s performed and 40 topics are extracted. The initial results look promising. Some significant topics such as football teams, celebrity names or hot news topics are detected. Using these results, automatic recommendation of relevant tweets will be performed.

Most existing methodologies process the queries merely considering user posted keywords and retrieve media labeled with tags that are similar to query words, while ignoring users implicit interests and preferences. This fact stimulates us to develop preference discovering models to reveal the users' latent intents. In this paper, we study the problem of finding user preference and interest from folksonomy corpus and propose a preference-topic model that exploits probabilistic graphical model and Gibbs sampling algorithm to infer the user interested latent semantic topics. The experimental results show that, with the help of the proposed model, preference topics of the web content creators can be effectively discovered. In addition, two exemplified applications are discussed briefly.

This approach models illegitimate users as ones who randomly access records. The goal is to use statistics, machine learning, knowledge of workflows and other techniques to support an anomaly detection framework that finds such users. In this paper we introduce and study a random topic access model or RTA aimed at users whose access may be illegitimate but is not fully random because it is focused on common semantic themes. We argue that this model is appropriate for a meaningful range of attacks and develop a system based on topic summarization that is able to formalize the model and provide anomalous user detection effectively for it. To this end, we use healthcare as an example and propose a framework for evaluating the ability to recognize various types of random users called random topic access detection or RTAD. Specifically, we utilize a combination of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), for feature extraction, a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm for outlier detection and evaluate the ability to identify different adversarial types. We validate the technique in the context of hospital audit logs where we show varying degrees of success based on user roles and the anticipated characteristics of attackers. In particular, it was found that RTAD exhibits strong performance for roles are described by a few topics, but weaker performance when users are more topic-agnostic.

I defined document as music track. Each music track is transformed to spectrogram, thanks that, I can use well known techniques to get words from images. I used SURF operation to detect characteristic points and novel approach for their description. The standard kmeans was used for clusterization. Clusterization is here identical with dictionary making, so after that I can transform spectrograms to text documents and perform TF-IDF and LDA. At the final, I can make a query in an obtained vector space. The research was done on 16 music tracks for training and 336 for testing, that are splitted in four categories: Hiphop, Jazz, Metal and Pop. Although used technique is completly unsupervised, results are satisfactory and encouraging to further research.

In this model, the topic is conditioned on the immediate history context and the document in the original PLSA model. This allows computing all the possible bigram probabilities of the seen history context using the model. It properly computes the topic probability of an unseen document for each history context present in the document. We compare our approach with a recently proposed unsmoothed bigram PLSA model where only the seen bigram probabilities are calculated, which causes computing the incorrect topic probability for the present history context of the unseen document. The proposed model requires a significantly less amount of computation time and memory space requirements than the unsmoothed bigram PLSA model. We carried out experiments on a continuous speech recognition (CSR) task using the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus. The proposed approach shows significant reduction in both perplexity and word error rate (WER) measurements over the other approach.	[Haidar, Md.

Probabilistic Explicit Topic Modeling Using Wikipedia	LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND KNOWLEDGE IN THE WEB	Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	25th International Conference of the German-Society-for-Computational-Linguistics-and-Language-Technology (GSCL)	SEP 25-27, 2013	Darmstadt, GERMANY	German Soc Computat Linguist & Language Technol, Tech Univ Darmstadt, Dept Comp Sci, Ubiquitous Knowledge Proc Lab			LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS	Despite popular use of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for automatic discovery of latent topics in document corpora, such topics lack connections with relevant knowledge sources such as Wikipedia, and they can be difficult to interpret due to the lack of meaningful topic labels. Furthermore, the topic analysis suffers from a lack of identifiability between topics across independently analyzed corpora but also across distinct runs of the algorithm on the same corpus. This paper introduces two methods for probabilistic explicit topic modeling that address these issues: Latent Dirichlet Allocation with Static Topic-Word Distributions (LDA-STWD), and Explicit Dirichlet Allocation (EDA). Both of these methods estimate topic-word distributions a priori from Wikipedia articles, with each article corresponding to one topic and the article title serving as a topic label. LDA-STWD and EDA overcome the nonidentifiability, isolation, and unintepretability of LDA output. We assess their effectiveness by means of crowd-sourced user studies on two tasks: topic label generation and document label generation. We find that LDA-STWD improves substantially upon the performance of the state-of-the-art on the document labeling task, and that both methods otherwise perform on par with a state-of-the-art post hoc method.

The extracted vectors serve as inputs for data mining models. Large vocabularies of natural languages imply a high dimensionality of input vectors; hence a substantial dimensionality reduction has to be made. We propose a new approach to a vector representation of text documents. Our representation takes into account an order of latent topics that generate observed words; an extracted document vector includes information about the adjacency of words in a document. We experimentally proved that the proposed representation enables to build document classifiers of higher accuracy using shorter document vectors. Short but informative document vectors enable to save memory for storing data, to use simpler models that learn faster and to significantly reduce an overfit effect.

This new phenomenon led to the emergence of a new line of work of mining the behavior of mobile users taking into account the spatio-temporal aspects of their engagement with online social media. In this paper, we address the problem of recommending the right locations to users at the right time. We claim to propose the first comprehensive model, called STT (Spatio-Temporal Topic), to capture the spatio-temporal aspects of user checkins in a single probabilistic model for location recommendation. Our proposed generative model does not only captures spatio-temporal aspects of check-ins, but also profiles users. We conduct experiments on real life data sets from Twitter, Gowalla, and Brightkite. We evaluate the effectiveness of STT by evaluating the accuracy of location recommendation. The experimental results show that STT achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art models in the areas of recommender systems as well as topic modeling.

Whereas, extracting the relationships among entities, words and topics through a large amount of news articles is nontrivial. Topic modeling like Latent Dirichlet Allocation has been applied a lot to mine hidden topics in text analysis, which have achieved considerable performance. However, it cannot explicitly show relationship between words and entities. In this paper, we propose a generative model, Entity-Centered Topic Model(ECTM) to summarize the correlation among entities, words and topics by taking entity topic as a mixture of word topics. Experiments on real news data sets show our model of a lower perplexity and better in clustering of entities than state-of-the-art entity topic model(CorrLDA2). We also present analysis for results of ECTM and further compare it with CorrLDA2.

Facing a huge number of services with similar functionalities, how to identify the core services in different domains and recommend the trustworthy ones for developers is an important issue for the promotion of the service ecosystem. In this paper, we present a heterogeneous network model, and then a unified reputation propagation (URP) framework is introduced to calculate the global reputation of entities in the ecosystem. Furthermore, the topic model based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used to cluster the services into specific domains. Combining URP with the topic model, we re-rank services' reputations to distinguish the core services so as to recommend trustworthy domain-aware services. Experiments on ProgrammableWeb data show that, by fusing the heterogeneous network model and the topic model, we gain a 66.67% improvement on top20 precision and 20%similar to 30% improvement on long tail (top200 similar to top500) precision. Furthermore, the reputation and domain-aware recommendation method gains a 118.54% improvement on top10 precision.

To characterize these aspects of language, we introduce the "Multi-Factor Sparse Plus Low Rank" exponential language model, which allows supervised joint training of arbitrary overlapping factor-specific model components. This flexible architecture has the advantage of being highly interpretable. The elements of sparse parameter matrices can be viewed as factor-dependent corrections (e.g. topic-or speaker-dependent phenomena). In topic modeling experiments on conversational telephone speech, we obtain modest perplexity reductions over an n gram baseline and demonstrate topic-dependent keyword extraction that leads to a 13% (absolute) improvement in precision over TF-IDF. We also show how keywords can be jointly learned for speakers, roles and topics in a study of Supreme Court oral arguments.

In this model, each word is allocated to a label-related topic or a label-unrelated topic. Label-related topics utilize label information, and label-unrelated topics utilize the framework of Bayesian Nonparametrics, which can estimate the number of topics in posterior distributions. Our model handles label-related and unrelated topics explicitly, in contrast to the earlier model, and improves the performances of applications to which is applied. Using real-world datasets, we show that our model outperforms the earlier model in terms of perplexity and efficiency for label prediction tasks that involve predicting labels for documents or pictures without labels.

On the other hand, various false information and rumor were also spread on Twitter. Therefore, it is required that people easily check information credibility. In this paper, we propose a method for automatically assessing the credibility of information based on the topic and opinion classifications. We assess the credibility of information by calculating the ratio of same opinions to all opinions about a topic. For identifying which topic is mentioned in a tweet, our method uses topic models generated by Latent Dirichlet Allocation.

We present a method for determining which information is important using a generative model for documents, introduced by Blei, Ng, and Jordan(3) in which each document is generated by choosing a distribution over topics and then choosing each word in the document from a topic selected according to this distribution. We use this algorithm to analyze synthetic aperture sonar data by using Bayesian model selection to establish the number of topics. We show that the extracted topics capture meaningful structure in the SAS data, consistent with the class designations provided, and demonstrate the transfer of this knowledge across sensor domains.

In this paper we address this challenge by proposing a multi-modal version of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model which provides a joint latent representation. We evaluate this representation on the Million Song Dataset by integrating three fundamentally different modalities, namely tags, lyrics, and audio features. We show how the resulting representation is aligned with common 'cognitive' variables such as tags, and provide some evidence for the common assumption that genres form an acceptable categorization when evaluating latent representations of music. We furthermore quantify the model by its predictive performance in terms of genre and style, providing benchmark results for the Million Song Dataset.

Based on the user interests, advertisers can significantly reduce their advertising cost by delivering the most relevant ads for the user. The state-of-the-art user Behavior Targeting (BT) models treat user behaviors as documents, and thus use topic models to extract their interests. A limitation of these methods is that user behaviors are usually described as unexplainable hidden topics, which cannot be directly used to guide online advertising. To this end, we propose in this paper a systematic User Interest Distribution Mining (UIDM for short) Framework to extract explainable user interests from big user behavior data. In the solution, we first use the Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) to discover the relationship between users and their behaviors, which can be described as hidden topics. Then, we construct a mapping matrix between the hidden topics and user interests by manually labeling a feature entity matrix. Experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We use qnantized Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) as low level features, and a temporally smoothed variant of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to compute both the region models, and most likely region labels associated with each time step in the robot's trajectory. We validate our technique by showing results from two datasets containing sound recorded from 51 and 43 minute long trajectories through downtown Montreal and the McGill University campus. Our preliminary experiments indicate that the regions discovered by the proposed technique correlate well with ground truth, labeled by a human expert.

In this paper, we introduce an on-line method that can classify genres of TV programs using audio content. We deploy an acoustic topic model (ATM) which was originally designed to capture contextual information embedded within audio segments. With a dataset based on RAI content, we perform both on-line and off-line classification; we segment audio signals with a fixed length and feed into the system for on-line classification tasks, while we use whole audio signals for off-line tasks. The off-line experimental results suggest that the proposed method using audio content yields competitive performance with conventional methods using audio-visual features and outperforms conventional audio-based approaches. The on-line results show promising results in classifying genre of TV programs with short segments and also suggest that ATM performs better than conventional GMM method if the length of audio segments is longer (> 1 second).

In this paper, we define the degree of involvement as the interest level that a group of participants show in the course of interactions, and propose the automatic detection scheme of scenes of high-interest based on multi-modal sensing. Our research is motivated by the fact that non-verbal information such as gesture and facial expressions plays an important role during a face-to-face conversation. Audio-visual features from the entire group are obtained by sensors located in a meeting room, and topics are extracted by applying latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to the features. Then Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to infer interest level from the topics. We conducted experiments using recording of conversational scenes (total 2hours 43 minutes) with interest level labels of a five point scale. Interest level 4 or over is assigned as high and interest level 3 or under is assigned as low, with the result that the highest accuracy of our inference model can reach 87.3 %.

This study is motivated by the hypothesis that experimental task contrast images share a common set of mental concepts. We represent the images as documents and the mental concepts as topics, and evaluate the effectiveness of unsupervised topic models for the recovery of the task to mental concept mapping, We also evaluate supervised topic models that explicitly incorporate the experimental task labels. Comparing the quality of the recovered topic assignments to known mental concepts, we find that the supervised models are more effective than unsupervised approaches. The quantitative performance results are supported by a visualization of the recovered topic assignment probabilities. Our results motivate the use of supervised topic models for analyzing cognitive function with fMRI.

But, complete assimilation of such massive amounts of data in its raw form is a daunting task. Automated text mining methods such as text summarization present the user with a condensed version of data containing only key information. This is especially useful in the case of online user forums that contain a large number of posts spread out across several threads. Document summarization methods have been extensively studied and several methods have been developed in the recent past. This paper aims at developing a new method for automatic summarization of online forums by using topic models and content/metadata sensitive clustering.

This paper proposes a probabilistic model that automatically discovers the correlation between perception tendency, gender, and personality traits of a target observer. Perception tendency, a probability distribution, explains how likely the observer is to perceive a certain state/level of a target emotion. Personality traits are measured by a variety of questionnaires. The proposed model links these three factors via a latent variable and explains observer's characteristics as a mixture of prototypical characters. An experiment is conducted with fifty observers. They watch 97 short conversation videos and give their impressions about the empathy between each interacting pair. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can find a reasonable framework that underlies the factors: e. g. 1) people who have high scores in Davis's empathy measures show empathy-biased response tendency, and 2) people who have strong sense of consideration for others tend to show an extreme response tendency, and such people are likely to be females. The proposed method shows promise in estimating an observer's perception tendency from his/her gender and personality traits, even when the target perception tendency is quite different from the average perception tendency among observers.

We propose a probabilistic behavior model for extracting latent classes of items that impact the users' item selections but cannot be inferred from the current knowledge of the managers. The proposed model assumes that the current knowledge is represented by categories of items that are defined in the EC site, and a user selects items depending on both of their categories and latent classes. By estimating latent classes, each of which shows items accessed by users with common interests, we can find interesting factors for explaining user behavior. We evaluate our proposed model using item-access log data observed in an EC site. The results show that our model can accurately predict users' item selection, and actually discover latent classes of items having similar latent characteristic such as "colored design" and "impression" by using item categories such as "coat" and "hat" as the current knowledge of the managers.

While there has been substantial research in the identification of facial Action Units as building blocks for the basic expressions, there is a new need to discover fine-grained facial descriptors that can explain the variations in the continuum of emotions. We propose a methodology to extract Latent Facial Topics (LFTs) from facial videos, by adapting Latent Dirichlet Allocation and supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic models for facial affect analysis. In this work, we study the application of topic models to both discrete emotion recognition as well as continuous emotion prediction tasks. We show that meaningful and visualizable LFTs can be extracted and used successfully for emotion recognition. We report our recognition results on the widely known Cohn Kanade Plus and AVEC 2012 FCSC challenge data sets, which have shown promise for both discrete and continuous emotion recognition problems.

It has been observed that most of the dissatisfaction cases in relevance are due to term mismatch between queries and documents (e.g., query "ny times" does not match well with a document only containing "New York Times"), because term matching, i.e., the bag-of-words approach, still functions as the main mechanism of modern search engines. It is not exaggerated to say, therefore, that mismatch between query and document poses the most critical challenge in search. Ideally, one would like to see query and document match with each other, if they are topically relevant. Recently, researchers have expended significant effort to address the problem. The major approach is to conduct semantic matching, i.e., to perform more query and document understanding to represent the meanings of them, and perform better matching between the enriched query and document representations. With the availability of large amounts of log data and advanced machine learning techniques, this becomes more feasible and significant progress has been made recently. This survey gives a systematic and detailed introduction to newly developed machine learning technologies for query document matching (semantic matching) in search, particularly web search. It focuses on the fundamental problems, as well as the state-of-the-art solutions of query document matching on form aspect, phrase aspect, word sense aspect, topic aspect, and structure aspect. The ideas and solutions explained may motivate industrial practitioners to turn the research results into products. The methods introduced and the discussions made may also stimulate academic researchers to find new research directions and approaches. Matching between query and document is not limited to search and similar problems can be found in question answering, online advertising, cross-language information retrieval, machine translation, recommender systems, link prediction, image annotation, drug design, and other applications, as the general task of matching between objects from two different spaces. The technologies introduced can be generalized into more general machine learning techniques, which is referred to as learning to match in this survey.

This short paper addresses the problem of automated social tagging, which aims to predict tags for webpages automatically and help with future navigation, filtering or search. We explore and find three foundations of the collaborative tags in social tagging services, that are consistency, sharability and stability. The complementary advantages are studied among three well-known methods, i.e. TF-weighted keyword extraction, collaborative filtering approach, and Corr-LDA (correspondence latent Dirichlet allocation) topic model. We then propose a blending model for automated social tagging to emphasize all the foundations, which linearly combines those tags generated by the three methods, and a permutation probability model is built to learn the linear blending. With the experiments on 50,000 training and 10,000 testing webpages from Del.icio.us database, the results show that our blending method outperforms the four baselines. Furthermore, compared with both topic models, Corr-LDA and mixed membership LDA, our approach results in 14.2% and 25.6% of NDCG(10) improvement separately.

Social networking reshaped worldwide communication significantly increased the speed of news spread, and connected the world stronger than ever. Although social networking has been such a revolutionary invention for the society, and many researchers have turned towards social media to explore trending topics, mainstream media still remains as the origin of the majority of the news discussed in social networking sites. Social stream mining to make video recommendations based on the trending topics has been an active direction in the research community. Understanding the trending topics and its impact on video sharing sites is very interesting for network traffic engineers. Quality of service can be significantly improved if we can predict what kind of video content will generate large traffic. The focus of this paper is to study which type of media, mainstream or social, can contribute better towards identifying trending topics. We present the experimental study of the story development process in mainstream and social media based on the real-world data. The study helps us properly identify which media source is more appropriate for the video recommendation and network traffic prediction systems.

When well written, it enables them to quickly and accurately identify the main ideas and contributions of the work presented. Hence writing an abstract is the most difficult part. Poorly written abstracts can affect negatively the significance and understanding of the paper. In order to investigate the rhetorical moves (or communicative stages) creating the meaning of abstracts, this study analyzes a corpus of 1,500 international conference papers (ICALT) using Corpus Linguistic tools and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) algorithm. This study shows that abstracts are written focusing on research purpose and methods rather than describing the background and commenting results. LDA algorithm provides a list of topics within the corpus of abstracts based on research areas. Future works on LDA algorithm should strengthen its semantic approach based on the rhetorical moves.

However, topic models, which have been widely used in information classification and retrieval, are not proper for some SNS such as microblogging. Moreover, It is also quite important but difficult to select topic number for a specific target. In this paper, first we present a new evaluation metric for topic models extraction from SNS dataset. Then, by combining LDA modeling with this metric, a self-adaptively LDA modeling method is proposed. Experiments were successfully performed, and the results show that the proposed LDA modeling method can self-adaptively reach the appropriate number of social topics without losing performance for microblogging-like dataset.

However, the rapid growth of online consumer product reviews makes browsing a large number of reviews and identifying information of interest time consuming and cognitively demanding. Although there has been extensive research on text review mining to address this information overload problem in the past decade, the majority of existing research mainly focuses on the quality of reviews and the impact of reviews on sales and marketing. Relatively little emphasis has been placed on mining reviews to meet personal needs of individual consumers. As an essential first step toward achieving this goal, this study proposes a product feature-oriented approach to the analysis of online consumer product reviews in order to support feature-based inquiries and summaries of consumer reviews. The proposed method combines LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and a synonym lexicon to extract product features from online consumer product reviews. Our empirical evaluation using consumer reviews of four products shows higher effectiveness of the proposed method for feature extraction in comparison to association rule mining.

It is widely used in current social media sites including Twitter and Google+, and serves as a significant meta tag to categorize users' messages, to propagate ideas and topic trends. The use of hashtags has become an integral part of the social media culture. However, the free-form nature and the varied contexts of hashtags bring challenges: how to understand hashtags and discover their relationships? In this paper, we propose Tag-Latent Dirichlet Allocation (TLDA), a new topic modeling approach to bridge hashtags and topics. TLDA extends Latent Dirichlet Allocation by incorporating the observed hashtags in the generative process. In TLDA, a hashtag is mapped into the form of a mixture of shared topics. This representation further enables the analysis of the relationships between the hashtags. Applying our model to tweet data, we first illustrate the ability of our approach to explain hard-to-understand hashtags with topics. We also demonstrate that our approach enables users to further analyze the relationships between the hashtags.

Instead of taking a binary or multi-class supervised learning approach, we take a one-class classification approach assuming that training dataset only contains usual events. The videos are modeled using a bag of words model for documents, where the words are prototypical sparse spatio-temporal feature descriptors extracted along moving objects in the scene of observation. We learn a probabilistic model of the training data as a corpus of documents, which contains a certain probabilistic mixture of latent topics, using Latent Dirichlet Allocation framework. In this framework, topics are further modeled as certain probabilistic mixture of words. Unusual events are video clips that probabilistically deviate more than a threshold from the distribution of the usual events. Our results indicate potential to learn usual events from a few examples, reliable flagging of unusual events, and sufficient speed for practical applications.

This involves integrating temporal ordering of SMS into a generative process in an iterative manner. The mobile SMS documents are partitioned into segments, wherein the discovered topics in each segment are propagated to influence the discovery of latent features. The proposed technique filters malicious mobile SMS communication and shows that topic models can effectively detect distinctive latent features to support automatic content filtering overtime. The practical implication of SMS communication filtering is apparent in designing systems that proactively detect information security threats to mobile subscribers and operators. The system can assist in optimum decision making, for instance in a scenario where an imposture attempts to sneak confidential information from unsolicited messages send to a subscriber or an operator.

This method relies on the analysis of user-generated tags, by using statistical models trained on both a small set of manually annotated data and a large data set collected from the Internet. Social event modeling relies on multi-span topic model based on LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation). Experiments are conducted in the experimental setup of MediaEval'2011 evaluation campaign. The proposed system outperforms significantly the best system of this benchmark, reaching a F-measure score of about 71%.

The proposed method combines an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, that extracts the spoken contents, and a keyword extraction component that aims at finding a small set of tags representing a video. In order to improve the robustness of the tagging system to the recognition errors, a video transcription is represented in a topic space obtained by a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), in which each dimension is automatically characterized by a list of weighted terms. Tags are extracted by combining the weighted word list of the best LDA classes. We evaluate this method by employing the user-provided tags of Youtube videos as reference and we investigate the impact of the topic model granularity. The obtained results demonstrate the interest of such model to improve the robustness of the tagging system.

In contrast to previous approaches, our technique is capable of finding examples of API usage that occur across several functions in a program. This distinction is important because of a gap between what current API learning tools provide and what programmers need: current tools extract relatively small examples from single files/functions, even though programmers use APIs to build large software. The small examples are helpful in the initial stages of API learning, but leave out details that are helpful in later stages. Our technique is intended to fill this gap. It works by representing software as a Relational Topic Model, where API calls and the functions that use them are modeled as a document network. Given a starting API, our approach can recommend complex API usage examples mined from a repository of over 14 million Java methods.

The proposed method is based on multimodal latent Dirichlet allocation (MLDA) and the nested Pitman-Yor language model (NPYLM). A robot obtains haptic, visual, and auditory information by grasping, observing, and shaking an object. At the same time, a user teaches object features to the robot through speech, which is recognized using only acoustic models and transformed into phoneme sequences. As the robot is supposed to have no language model in advance, the recognized phoneme sequences include many phoneme recognition errors. Moreover, the recognized phoneme sequences with errors are segmented into words in an unsupervised manner; however, not all words are necessarily segmented correctly. The words including these errors have a negative effect on the learning of word meanings. To overcome this problem, we propose a method to improve unsupervised word segmentation and to reduce phoneme recognition errors by using multimodal object concepts. In the proposed method, object concepts are used to enhance the accuracy of word segmentation, reduce phoneme recognition errors, and correct words so as to improve the categorization accuracy. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the accuracy of word segmentation and reduce the phoneme recognition error and that the obtained words enhance the categorization accuracy.

In a qualitative evaluation, gathering user's opinions and recommendations to the e-Government services are commonly used to get a real feedback from the citizens. However, such the user feedback commonly is containing a big text data from diversity of the citizens. It is necessary to do a text mining to assist an analyzing to find out quickly the point of what the citizens recommended. This study proposes an application of Topic Models to do analysis of the big text datasets of the user's feedback. Based on the qualitative analyses approach, the study analyzes user's opinion and recommendation to the e-Government services.

Often during large-scale disasters, cell towers become overloaded, and the only way of communication is through text messages. It becomes important to gather information from text messages sent to emergency numbers in order to respond quickly and efficiently with life-saving efforts. In addition, responders are unable to manually handle the large volume of incoming texts. To add to this difficult problem, these data sources tend to be microtext. This research developed a methodology to summarize text messages sent during an emergency, including analysis of locations. The real-time disaster needs were then input into a mixed integer programming resource allocation model for distribution of resources for disaster aid. Prior research included resource allocation and text modeling, but the combination of the two is a novel application not only in this arena, but more broadly across domains.

Among others, most businesses, smaller or bigger, present themselves to the world through their websites. Economic development analysts could make use of the information available on business websites to identify ways in which businesses in a region can be grouped together into clusters, and possibly partnership for mutual benefit, and thus for economics gains of that particular region. Automated clustering of businesses is especially useful, as the existing NAICS codes-based clustering is not very accurate, according to domain experts, and does not scale up well. Text analysis is a blooming field whose goal is to automatically extract useful information from natural language text. In this work, we perform a preliminary text analysis of business websites to build business profiles and to organize businesses into clusters. Our approach is based on representing businesses as a mixture of "topics" using a technique called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Given the business profiles represented as the topic distributions obtained with LDA, we construct preliminary clusters of businesses. Manual analysis of the results shows that the proposed approach has the potential for giving interesting and useful clusters, which have the potential to replace the existing NAICS codes-based clusters.

J	Perina, A; Jojic, N			IEEE	Perina, Alessandro; Jojic, Nebojsa			Capturing layers in image collections with componential models: from the layered epitome to the componential counting grid	2013 IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION (CVPR)	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition		English	Proceedings Paper	26th IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)	JUN 23-28, 2013	Portland, OR	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc				Recently, the Counting Grid (CG) model [5] was developed to represent each input image as a point in a large grid of feature counts. This latent point is a corner of a window of grid points which are all uniformly combined to match the (normalized) feature counts in the image. Being a bag of word model with spatial layout in the latent space, the CG model has superior handling of field of view changes in comparison to other bag of word models, but with the price of being essentially a mixture, mapping each scene to a single window in the grid. In this paper we introduce a family of componential models, dubbed the Componential Counting Grid, whose members represent each input image by multiple latent locations, rather than just one. In this way, we make a substantially more flexible admixture model which captures layers or parts of images and maps them to separate windows in a Counting Grid. We tested the models on scene and place classification where their componential nature helped to extract objects, to capture parallax effects, thus better fitting the data and outperforming Counting Grids and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, especially on sequences taken with wearable cameras.

A rapidly growing number of users of these social networks create tremendous amounts of information, such as social text and multimedia feeds. In this context finding specific information and keeping it accessible becomes more and more a challenge. In parallel information filtering, topic modeling and quality has become subject of researchers in the field of social network analysis. Here we introduce Collact.Me, a conceptual framework to extract and classify microblogging content in an automated manner. Domain-specific data from social Twitter streams are collected from which topic models are created. The training data is used to build classifiers that allow computationally efficient multi-label classification. Results are presented and visualized using a novel dot-plot chart, which displays quantities of classified tweets of user-defined topics in a temporal fashion. We applied Collact.Me to selected bioinformatics topics. Our results show that our framework helps users to identify and interpret the level of attention of topics and to understand the relations between different topics as well as indications of emerging patterns. http://collact.me	[Polatkan, Aydin Can; Nieselt, Kay] Univ Tubingen, Fac Sci, Ctr Bioinformat Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany	Polatkan, AC (reprint author), Univ Tubingen, Fac Sci, Ctr Bioinformat Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.	polatkan@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de; kay.nieselt@uni-tuebingen.de					Andrieu C, 2003, MACH LEARN, V50, P5, DOI 10.1023/A:1020281327116; Bekkerman R., 2004, USING BIGRAMS TEXT C, P1003; Blei DM, 2003, J MACH LEARN RES, V3, P993, DOI 10.1162/jmlr.2003.3.4-5.993; Bollegala D., 2007, 21 ANN C JAP SOC ART, P757; Cha M., 2010, 4 INT AAAI C WEBL SO, V14, P8; Cheong M., 2009, P 2 ACM WORKSH SOC W, P1, DOI DOI 10.1145/1651437.1651439; Facebook Official Videos, 2013, FACEBOOK OFFICIAL VI; Freeman L., 2004, DEV SOCIAL NETWORK A; Go A., 2009, TWITTER SENTIMENT CL, P1; Guille A., 2013, P 2013 ACM SIGMOD IN; Harris Z.

We first take the user's location information into account to do a geographic query expansion, then present an approach to personalizing web search for mobile users within language modeling framework. We estimate a user mixed model estimated according to both activated ontological topic model-based feedback and user interest model to re-rank the results from geographic query expansion. Experiments show that language model based re-ranking method is effective in presenting more relevant documents on the top retrieved results to mobile users. The main contribution of the improvements comes from the consideration of geographic information, ontological topic information and user interests together to find more relevant documents for satisfying their personal information need.

In this paper, Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm is used to extract the topics from nouns in the text, and the highest probability noun of each topic is selected as the centroids of the k-means algorithm. Experimental results show that this method can get better effects than the graph-based word clustering algorithms using a web search engine.

This task can be tackled using various techniques, typically ranking documents according to a relevance index or grouping documents based on various clustering algorithms. The task complexity produces results of varying quality that inevitably carry noise. Users must be careful when interpreting document relevance or groupings. We address this problem by computing cohesion measures for a group of documents confirming/infirming whether it can be trusted to form a semantically cohesive unit. The index is inspired from past work in social network analysis (SNA) and illustrates how document exploration can benefit from SNA techniques.

The notion of big data is efficiently leveraged through popular social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. Twitter is a most popular micro-blogging website enriched with many research issues. The users are allowed to put their ideas and thoughts in the form of messages called "Tweets" in twitter. In this study, the purpose of gathering the location specific tweets is to understand and surface the insights which are related to human dynamics. We have employed the data stream mining approach to process geo-spatial time invariant tweets in a distributed real-time environment to gain more useful information. Topic models were explored for identifying a particular topic of interest or to extract prudent information from the stream data. Our concentration is on the evolution of different topics at different places, a location-topic matrix is formed for the set of topics observed as most predominant for the specific locations. Then a user graph is generated for the volatile topics that help in analyzing the users who have tweeted or has been re-tweeted on a specific topic the most. From the properties of the generated graph, the disorientation of the topics is reported in the given locations by the use of a sentimental analysis that deems the topic discussed as positive or negative. These analyzes have shown that there is a possibility to outwit the useless and most rampant negative issues spread mutely on a specific location which later creates unnecessary panic to the society.

However, the platform does not provide any mechanism to filter the comments in order to get the most relevant ones, as the only provided ordering is in descending order of the publishing date. We propose a ranking mechanism for these comments that tries to determine the relevance of each comment to the individual video by automatically linking it to relevant web pages with textual information. Three different ranking methods are discussed and their results are presented in order to offer a comparison among them.

This method assumes that incoming speech frames are conditionally independent and exchangeable. While this leads to a loss of temporal structure, it is able to capture significant statistical information between frames. In contrast, a hidden Markov model-based approach captures the temporal structure in speech. Using the German emotional speech database EMO-DB for evaluation, we achieve an average classification accuracy of 80.7% compared to 73% for hidden Markov models. This improvement is achieved at the cost of a slight increase in computational complexity. We map the proposed algorithm onto an FPGA platform and show that emotions in a speech utterance of duration 1.5s can be identified in 1.8ms, while utilizing 70% of the resources. This further demonstrates the suitability of our approach for real-time applications on hand-held devices.

K-COMPONENT RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORK LANGUAGE MODELS USING CURRICULUM LEARNING	2013 IEEE WORKSHOP ON AUTOMATIC SPEECH RECOGNITION AND UNDERSTANDING (ASRU)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding (ASRU)	DEC 08-13, 2013	Olomouc, CZECH REPUBLIC	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, IEEE Signal Proc Soc		Recurrent Neural Networks; Language Models; Curriculum Learning; Latent Dirichlet Allocation; Topics; Socio-situational setting		Conventional n-gram language models are known for their limited ability to capture long-distance dependencies and their brittleness with respect to within-domain variations. In this paper, we propose a k-component recurrent neural network language model using curriculum learning (CL-KRNNLM) to address within-domain variations. Based on a Dutch-language corpus, we investigate three methods of curriculum learning that exploit dedicated component models for specific sub-domains. Under an oracle situation in which context information is known during testing, we experimentally test three hypotheses. The first is that domain-dedicated models perform better than general models on their specific domains. The second is that curriculum learning can be used to train recurrent neural network language models (RNNLMs) from general patterns to specific patterns. The third is that curriculum learning, used as an implicit weighting method to adjust the relative contributions of general and specific patterns, outperforms conventional linear interpolation. Under the condition that context information is unknown during testing, the CL-KRNNLM also achieves improvement over conventional RNNLM by 1 3 % relative in terms of word prediction accuracy. Finally, the CL-KRNNLM is tested in an additional experiment involving N-best rescoring on a standard data set. Here, the context domains are created by clustering the training data using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and k-means clustering.

We propose a k-component recurrent neural network language model (KARNNLM) that addresses these limitations by exploiting the long-distance modeling ability of recurrent neural networks and by making use of k different sub-models trained on different contextual domains. Our approach uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation to automatically discover k subsets of the training data, that are used to train k component models. Our experiments first use a Dutch-language corpus to confirm the ability of KARNNLM to automatically choose the appropriate component. Then, we use a standard benchmark set (Wall Street Journal) to perform N-best list rescoring experiments. Results show that KARNNLM improves performance over the RNNLM baseline; the best performance is achieved when KARNNLM is combined with the general model using a novel iterative alternating N-best rescoring strategy.

It is especially essential in the task of newspaper article topics identification. This paper presents a method based on general topic model normalisation for finding a threshold defining the boundary between the "correct" and the "incorrect" topics of a newspaper article. The proposed method is used to improve the topic identification algorithm which is a part of a complex system for acquisition and storing large volumes of text data. The topic identification module uses the Naive Bayes classifier for the multiclass and multi-label classification problem and assigns to each article the topics from a defined quite extensive topic hierarchy - it contains about 450 topics and topic categories. The results of the experiments with the improved topic identification algorithm are presented in this paper.

We concentrate on the DMOZ collection of Web extracts and propose a novel Tree Labeled LDA (tLLDA) algorithm to infer topic models using its manually compiled ontology. The algorithm takes advantage of the ontology structure and infers topic models by jointly modeling word and ontology node assignments for documents. We evaluate the performance of our topic modeling approach against that of four state-of-the-art algorithms (Labeled LDA, Hierarchically Labeled LDA, Hierarchically Supervised LDA and Supervised LDA) and show improvement in terms of perplexity and accuracy. Our evaluation shows that topic models produced by tLLDA outperform other algorithms in terms of perplexity for all test sets and all but one test case in terms of accuracy.

The proposed group detection method is anchored on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling technique, aiming at identifying clusters of twitter users that are optimal in terms of both spatial and topical compactness. Specifically, the group detection problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem taking into consideration two complementary cluster formation directives. The first objective, related to spatial compactness, is achieved by minimizing the overall deviation from the corresponding cluster centers. The second, related to topical compactness, is achieved by minimizing the portion of probability mass assigned to low probability topics for the corresponding cluster centroids. In our approach, optimization is performed by employing a multi-objective genetic algorithm, which results in a variety of cluster structures that are significantly more interpretable than cluster assignments obtained with traditional single-objective clustering algorithms.

Given a message, we classify its emotion as happy, sad, angry or surprise. Existing methods mostly use the bag-of-word representation or manually designed features to train supervised or distant supervision models. However, manufacturing feature engines is time-consuming and not enough to capture the complex linguistic phenomena on microblogs. In this study, to overcome the above problems, we utilize pseudo-labeled data, which is extensively explored for distant supervision learning and training language model in Twitter sentiment analysis, to learn the sentence representation through Deep Belief Network algorithm. Experimental results in the supervised learning framework show that using the pseudolabeled data, the representation learned by Deep Belief Network outperforms the Principal Components Analysis based and Latent Dirichlet Allocation based representations. By incorporating the Deep Belief Network based representation into basic features, the performance is further improved.

In this paper, we first introduce LDA and its distributed version Parallel LDA (PLDA), along with some popular implementations. Then we propose a systematic solution to evaluate stability and similarity of the trained models and classification results of LDA/PLDA. We address three key challenges within the evaluation solution: (i) topics matching in Kullback Liebler (KL) divergence calculation; (ii) calculation of stability using KL divergence and interpretation of relationship between KL divergence and stability of the trained model and the classification results; (iii) calculation and evaluation of similarity of trained models and classification results. Finally, we experiment with real life datasets to show that our solution is sufficient and efficient.

However, a review of engineering education literature reveals scant research on the use of online discussion forums for engineering learning beyond the classroom. This study addresses this gap in knowledge through a study of the "Homework Help" section on AllAboutCircuits.com to examine what students sought help for and for what purpose. We downloaded over 6,000 discussion messages spanning over 8 years and extracted the textual data with a Python program. Instead of analyzing the data through manual means, we utilized the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to capture textual patterns and leverage a topic modeling approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, to identify connected clusters of words. Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) analysis was also used to determine how often students use words associated with cognitive processes. We found that the homework help section of informal online discussion forums cater to students seeking help on fundamental ECE topics. Our findings also suggest that online discussion forums are supportive learning environments, as students freely engage in meaningful inquiries and social interactions with other learners.

Focusing on the problem of self-occlusion in the field of human action recognition, a new adaptive occlusion state behavior recognition approach was presented based on Markov random field and probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA). Firstly, the Markov random field was used to represent the occlusion relationship between human body parts in terms an occlusion state variable by phase space obtained. Then, we proposed a hierarchical area variety model. Finally, we use the topic model of pLSA to recognize the human behavior. Experiments were performed on the KTH, Weizmann, and Humaneva dataset to test and evaluate the proposed method. The compared experiment results showed that what the proposed method can achieve was more effective than the compared methods.

Our method decomposes the task into two steps: latent n-gram clustering using a semi-supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and sequence tagging for learning semantic structures in a CU system. Latent semantic modeling has been investigated to improve many natural language processing tasks such as syntactic parsing or topic tracking. However, due to several complexity problems caused by issues involving utterance length or dialog corpus size, it has not been analyzed directly for semantic parsing tasks. In this paper, we propose extending the LDA by introducing prior knowledge we obtain from semantic knowledge bases. Then, the topic posteriors obtained from the new LDA model are used as additional constraints to a sequence learning model for the semantic template filling task. The experimental results show significant performance gains on semantic slot filling models when features from latent semantic models are used in a conditional random field (CRF).

Indra			Analysis of Sentiments using Unsupervised Learning Techniques	2013 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION COMMUNICATION AND EMBEDDED SYSTEMS (ICICES)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Information Communication and Embedded Systems (ICICES)	FEB 21-22, 2013	Chennai, INDIA			Sentimental analysis; opinion mining; Joint Sentiment Topic Model (JST)		Sentimental analysis, a sub discipline within data mining and computational linguistics, refers to the computational methodology for mining, understanding and assessing the opinions expressed in many opinion rich resources like blogs, discussion forums etc. The goal of sentiment analysis is to identify emotional states in online text. Most of the time classifiers trained in one domain do not perform well in another domain. Also the problem in existing approaches is not to detect sentiment and topics. Sentiments may vary with topics. This paper proposes a new model called Combined Sentiment Topic (CST) model to detect sentiments and topics simultaneously from text. This model is based on Gibbs sampling algorithm. Besides, unlike supervised approaches to opinion mining which often fail to produce good performance when shifting to other domains, the unsupervised nature of CST makes it highly portable to other domains. CST model performs better compared to existing semi-supervised approaches.	[Usha, M. S.; Devi, M.

We examine empirically the effect of OCR noise on the ability of supervised topic models to produce high quality output through a series of experiments in which we evaluate three supervised topic models and a naive baseline on synthetic OCR data having various levels of degradation and on real OCR data from two different decades. The evaluation includes experiments with and without feature selection. Our results suggest that supervised topic models are no better, or at least not much better in terms of their robustness to OCR errors, than unsupervised topic models and that feature selection has the mixed result of improving topic quality while harming metadata prediction quality. For users of topic modeling methods on OCR data, supervised topic models do not yet solve the problem of finding better topics than the original unsupervised topic models.

Since fuzzy set can handle non-precision data well, the fuzzy algorithm can reduce the influences of the uncertainty of public opinion data. Based on LDA topic extraction we cluster the topical words by fuzzy method, and take the topic probability as word membership to the cluster. It can reduce the noise data and improve the ability of hotspot discovery that aggregate the similar and related topic to one class. The topical key words with high probability in cluster are the hotspot, and singular cluster with few words can be looked as outlier. The algorithm is demonstrated by example analysis in detail.

This approach ignores the correlation between the topics, so in some actual domain it is not enough to reflect the real situations of the topics. We can divide the topics into two classes: key topics and unimportant topics. The key topics can reflect the word attributes well, and other topics can be look as subordinate. Considering the relations of the topics, a topic reduction algorithm is proposed to retain the key topics and delete the redundant topics based on rough set. Because the LDA topics exists uncertainty distribution and rough set can deal with uncertain data well, so the algorithm based on rough set can improve the accuracy of topics analysis.

As a result, UGC quality may not be well-guaranteed. We put forward a synthetic evaluation method for UGC quality of content via user authority and topic distribution. We consider various features of users, including basic registration information, relative static online social relations and dynamic interactions between users. We adopt Link Analysis (LA) based on user credibility and Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) to rate user authority and then analyze the probabilistic topic distribution of authors and UGC based on textual content using Author-Topic Model (AT). We've also integrated the author's actual behavior during the composing of UGC to compute the contribution degree of user authority. Finally, we combined user authority and contribution degree to evaluate overall quality of a multi-author UGC. Experiments with real dataset collected from TianYa have shown that the proposed method could evaluate UGC reasonably.

The model considers each legislators constituency (location), the congressional session (time) of each vote, and the details (text) of each piece of legislation. The model can predict votes of new legislation from only text, while imposing smooth temporal evolution of legislator latent features, and correlation of legislators with adjacent constituencies. Additionally, the model estimates the number of latent dimensions required to represent the data. A Gibbs sampler is developed for posterior inference. The model is demonstrated as an exploratory tool of legislation and it performs well in quantitative comparisons to a traditional ideal-point model.

Our method learns a topic model over the reference database, which in turn is used to divide the reference database into scene groups. Each scene group consists of "visually similar" images as determined by the topic model. Next raw Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) features are collected from every image in a scene group a Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neightbours (FLANN) index is constructed. Given a query image, first its scene group is determined using the topic model and then its SIFT features are matched against the corresponding FLANN index. The query image is localized using the location information from the visually similar images in the reference database. We evaluate our approach on Google Map Street View dataset and demonstrate that our method outperforms a competing technique.

We propose a modified semi-supervised approach to study the word-level content structure with well-designed first-order logic features. The word-level content structure is the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) with latent word-level topic nodes. Introducing first-order logic features into our model can solve the long-distance dependency problem. The new approach is applied to two multi-aspect sentiment analysis tasks: the multi-aspect sentence labeling task and the multi-aspect rating prediction task. We use the data from Amazon corpus and movie-review corpus. We compare our method with other three hidden nodes graphical models, i.e. the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), the Hidden-Unit CRF (HUCRF), and the Content Structure using CRF (CSCRF, which is considered as our sentence-level baseline). Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the sentence-level baseline by 2.1% of the F1 measure in the multi-aspect sentence labeling task, and by 2.1% of the Accuracy in the rating prediction task. Our method outperforms other two methods at most by 16.6% and 10.3% separately in the multi-aspect sentence labeling task and the rating prediction task. By using 3000 unlabeled documents, our method improves the F1-measure in the multi-aspect sentence labeling task by 8.2%, and improves the Accuracy in the rating prediction task by 3.0%, using 400 unlabeled reviews.

It is a collaborative activity among developers who contribute their knowledge, ideas, and expertise to resolve bugs. Given a bug report, we would like to recommend the set of bug resolvers that could potentially contribute their knowledge to fix it. We refer to this problem as developer recommendation for bug resolution. In this paper, we propose a new and accurate method named DevRec for the developer recommendation problem. DevRec is a composite method which performs two kinds of analysis: bug reports based analysis (BR-Based analysis), and developer based analysis (D-Based analysis). In the BR-Based analysis, we characterize a new bug report based on past bug reports that are similar to it. Appropriate developers of the new bug report are found by investigating the developers of similar bug reports appearing in the past. In the D-Based analysis, we compute the affinity of each developer to a bug report based on the characteristics of bug reports that have been fixed by the developer before. This affinity is then used to find a set of developers that are "close" to a new bug report. We evaluate our solution on 5 large bug report datasets including GCC, OpenOffice, Mozilla, Netbeans, and Eclipse containing a total of 107,875 bug reports. We show that DevRec could achieve recall@5 and recall@10 scores of 0.4826-0.7989, and 0.6063-0.8924, respectively. We also compare DevRec with other state-of-art methods, such as Bugzie and DREX. The results show that DevRec on average improves recall@5 and recall@10 scores of Bugzie by 57.55% and 39.39% respectively. DevRec also outperforms DREX by improving the average recall@5 and recall@10 scores by 165.38% and 89.36%, respectively.

A bursty topic in Twitter is one that triggers a surge of relevant tweets within a short time, which often reflects important events of mass interest. How to leverage Twitter for early detection of bursty topics has therefore become an important research problem with immense practical value. Despite the wealth of research work on topic modeling and analysis in Twitter, it remains a huge challenge to detect bursty topics in real-time. As existing methods can hardly scale to handle the task with the tweet stream in real-time, we propose in this paper TopicSketch, a novel sketch-based topic model together with a set of techniques to achieve real-time detection. We evaluate our solution on a tweet stream with over 30 million tweets. Our experiment results show both efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. Especially it is also demonstrated that TopicSketch can potentially handle hundreds of millions tweets per day which is close to the total number of daily tweets in Twitter and present bursty event in finer-granularity.

With all object instances of the same category aligned to a canonical pose, the bounding box is discretized to form a 3D space dictionary for LDA. To enhance the spatial coherence of each part during model learning, we extend LDA by strategically constructing a Markov random field (MRF) on the part labels, and adding an extra spatial parameter for each part. We refer to the improved model as spatial latent Dirichlet Markov random fields (SLDMRF). The experimental results demonstrate that SLDMRF exhibits superior semantic interpretation and discriminative ability in model classification to LDA and other related models.

In order to mine semantically similar information from massive data, a fast and efficient matching method for short texts has become an urgent task. However, the conventional matching methods suffer from the data sparsity in short documents. In this paper, we propose a novel matching method, referred as semantically similar hashing (SSHash). The basic idea of SSHash is to directly train a topic model from corpus rather than documents, then project texts into hash codes by using latent features. The major advantages of SSHash are that 1) SSHash alleviates the sparse problem in short texts, because we obtain the latent features from whole corpus regardless of document level; and 2) SSHash can accomplish similar matching in an interactive real time by introducing hash method. We carry out extensive experiments on real-world short texts. The results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline methods on several evaluation metrics.

However, this kind of models is unable to directly model correlation between topics since topic proportions of an image are generated independently. Our model, called correspondence Correlated Topic Model (corrCTM), extends Correlated Topic Model (CTM) [2] from natural language processing to capture topic correlation from covariance structure of more flexible model distribution. Unlike previous LDA based models, topic proportions are correlated with each other in proposed corrCTM. And the topic correlation propagates from image features to annotation words through a generative process, and finally correspondence between images and words could be generated. We derive an approximate inference and estimation algorithm based on variational method. We examine the performance of our model on two benchmark image datasets, show improved performance over corrLDA for both annotation and modeling word correlation.

On the web forum, topics are often interactive, which means that new topics emerge and old ones decay and the number of topics is always in a dynamic change. This paper presents an on-line adaptive topic evolution model based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). This model uses the posterior of topics and word distribution in historical time window to adjust the prior of current by linear weighted, which is able to find the new topics and the vanished ones in text streams and automatically update the topic number. The experiment shows that the proposed model can identify the topic changes in terms of number well, and analyze their evolution in time and content; hence the hot spots can be discovered in time.

In this paper, we propose a new action recognition method which represents human actions as a bag of spatio-temporal words extracted from input video sequences and uses L-LDA (labeled Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model as a classifier. L-LDA is a supervised model extended from LDA which is unsupervised. The L-LDA adds a label layer on the basis of LDA to label the category of the train video sequences, so L-LDA can assign the latent topic variable in the model to the specific action categorization automatically. What's more, due to above characteristic of L-LDA, it can help to estimate the model parameters more reasonably, accurately and fast. We test our method on the KTH and Weizmann human action dataset and the experimental results show that L-LDA is better than its unsupervised counterpart LDA as well as SVMs (support vector machines).

Although keyword-based methods are superior in achieving faster detection, they fail to detect text content that is semantically objectionable. A novel framework based on adaptive topic modeling is proposed to detect objectionable text content. Firstly, a weighted graph is constructed based on several seed words and a set of training texts. Feature words are then selected from the graph according to the measure which shows how likely a word to be sensitive. Adaptive LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic model in which topic number can be automatically estimated is proposed to find the latent objectionable topic structure for the text set. An objectionable topic criterion is devised for the adaptive selection method which takes the objectionable topic characteristic into consideration. Finally, detection for a given text is evaluated based on its probability value with respect to the model. Extensive comparison experiments on real world text sets show that the proposed method can effectively detect objectionable text. The performance is superior to that of keyword-based methods with several different approaches to generate keyword list. Experiments also show that the performance is better than that of detection methods based on traditional topic modeling.

To achieve such capabilities, we propose a Labeled Multi-modal Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LM-LDA), which is a generative classifier trained with two different data cues, for instance, one cue can be traditional visual observation and another cue can be contextual information. The novel aspects of the LM-LDA classifier, compared to other methods for encoding contextual information are that, I) even with only one of the cues present at execution time, the classification will be better than single cue classification since cue correlations are encoded in the model, II) one of the cues (e. g., common grasps for the observed object class) can be inferred from the other cue (e. g., the appearance of the observed object). This makes the method suitable for robot online and transfer learning; a capability highly desirable in cognitive robotic applications. Our experiments show a clear improvement for classification and a reasonable inference of the missing data.

In this paper, we investigate the possibility to boost the action recognition performance by exploiting their scene context associated. To this end, we model the scene as a mid-level "hidden layer" to bridge action descriptors and action categories. This is achieved via a scene topic model, in which hybrid visual descriptors including spatiotemporal action features and scene descriptors are first extracted from the video sequence. Then, we learn a joint probability distribution between scene and action by a Naive Bayesian Nearest Neighbor algorithm, which is adopted to jointly infer the action categories online by combining off-the-shelf action recognition algorithms. We demonstrate our merits by comparing to state-of-the-arts in several action recognition benchmarks.

It could be, e. g., the product logo and the leading actor/actress in a TV commercial. We propose a topic model that incorporates a word co-occurrence prior for efficient discovery of topical video objects from a set of key frames. Previous work using topic models, such as Latent Dirichelet Allocation (LDA), for video object discovery often takes a bag-of-visual-words representation, which ignored important co-occurrence information among the local features. We show that such data driven co-occurrence information from bottom-up can conveniently be incorporated in LDA with a Gaussian Markov prior, which combines top down probabilistic topic modeling with bottom up priors in a unified model. Our experiments on challenging videos demonstrate that the proposed approach can discover different types of topical objects despite variations in scale, view-point, color and lighting changes, or even partial occlusions. The efficacy of the co-occurrence prior is clearly demonstrated when comparing with topic models without such priors.

Compared with the traditional medias, such as New York Times, tweets are structured data form and with shorter length. Although traditional topic modeling algorithms have been studied well, few algorithms are specially designed to mine Twitter data according to its own features. In this paper, according to the structure of Twitter data, we introduce Multi Topic Distribution Model to mine topics. In addition, we have observed that one tweet mostly discusses either public issues or personal lives. Former studies equally analyze all tweets and fail to discover interests of each individual. With the help of features of Twitter data, dividing topics into two types in semantics, our model not only efficiently discover topics, but also is able to indicate which topics are interested by an user and which topics are hot issues of the Twitter community. Through Gibbs sampling for approximate inference, the experiments are conducted in the TREC2011 data set. Experimental results on the data set have shown an comparison between our model and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Author Topic Model. We also illustrate an example of topics which are interested by the whole community and several users.

The objective is to better predict activities involved in documents by considering general topics of the activities for clustering. The proposed model is a supervised topic model based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). As a follow-up study of word-pair generation LDA (wpLDA) model, the model introduces the topic-specific activity distribution as an external input, with an activity node inserted into the main generation thread. In addition, we refer to D. Ramage et al.'s one-to-one correspondence to directly learn word-activity tags. An experiment was conducted to prove the feasibility of this model. We chose ten top-listed activities from the wish clusters obtained by the previous wpLDA research, and used each as the key words to extract thirty tweets for training and five for testing, respectively, tagging the tweets with the corresponding activities. By applying the proposed model, we obtained the expected tri-layer clusters in the training phase. Then, in the testing phase, we utilized the activity-specific word distribution derived from the training results to learn the activities of the testing documents. The Stanford Classifier was put forward as the control group, and the activity prediction accuracy demonstrates that the proposed model exhibits the superiority in multi-activity prediction.

J	Baum, D				Baum, Doris			Recognising speakers from the topics they talk about	SPEECH COMMUNICATION			English	Article						Speaker recognition; Topic classification; High-level features	MODELS; RECOGNITION	We investigate how a speaker's preference for specific topics can be used for speaker identification. In domains like broadcast news or parliamentary speeches, speakers have a field of expertise they are associated with. We explore how topic information for a segment of speech, extracted from an automatic speech recognition transcript, can be employed to identify the speaker. Two methods for modelling topic preferences are compared: implicitly, based on speaker-characteristic keywords, and explicitly, by using automatically derived topic models to assign topics to the speech segments. In the keyword-based approach, the segments' tf-idf vectors are classified with Support Vector Machine speaker models. For the topic-model-based approach, a domain-specific topic model is used to represent each segment as a mixture of topics; the speakers' score is derived from the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the topic mixtures of their training data and of the segment. The methods were tested on political speeches given in German parliament by 235 politicians. We found that topic cues do carry speaker information, as the topic-model-based system yielded an equal error rate (EER) of 16.3%. The topic-based approach combined well with a spectral baseline system, improving the EER from 8.6% for the spectral to 6.2% for the fused system. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Difficulties arise from the large variations of human appearance in different poses, and from the different camera views that may be involved, making low-level descriptor representation unreliable. In this paper, we propose a novel Attribute-Restricted Latent Topic Model (ARLTM) to encode targets into semantic topics. Compared to conventional topic models such as LDA and pLSI, ARLTM performs best by imposing semantic restrictions onto the generation of human specific attributes. We use MCMC EM for model learning. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ren, RD; Collomosse, J				Ren, Reede; Collomosse, John			Visual Sentences for Pose Retrieval Over Low-Resolution Cross-Media Dance Collections	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA			English	Article						Content based image retrieval; dance archives; low-resolution pose similarity	HUMAN-BODY CONFIGURATIONS; SEGMENTATION; MODELS	We describe a system for matching human posture (pose) across a large cross-media archive of dance footage spanning nearly 100 years, comprising digitized photographs and videos of rehearsals and performances. This footage presents unique challenges due to its age, quality and diversity. We propose a forest-like pose representation combining visual structure (self-similarity) descriptors over multiple scales, without explicitly detecting limb positions which would be infeasible for our data. We explore two complementary multi-scale representations, applying passage retrieval and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) techniques inspired by the text retrieval domain, to the problem of pose matching. The result is a robust system capable of quickly searching large cross-media collections for similarity to a visually specified query pose. We evaluate over a cross-section of the UK National Research Centre for Dance's (UK-NRCD), and the Siobhan Davies Replay's (SDR) digital dance archives, using visual queries supplied by dance professionals. We demonstrate significant performance improvements over two base-lines: classical single and multi-scale bag of visual words (BoVW) and spatial pyramid kernel (SPK) matching [5].

J	La, L; Guo, Q; Cao, QM; Li, QT				La Lei; Guo Qiao; Cao Qimin; Li Qitao			LDA boost classification: boosting by topics	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Latent Dirichlet Allocation; Topics; Boosting; Two-procedure iterative weighting; Text classification		AdaBoost is an efficacious classification algorithm especially in text categorization (TC) tasks. The methodology of setting up a classifier committee and voting on the documents for classification can achieve high categorization precision. However, traditional Vector Space Model can easily lead to the curse of dimensionality and feature sparsity problems; so it affects classification performance seriously. This article proposed a novel classification algorithm called LDABoost based on boosting ideology which uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to modeling the feature space. Instead of using words or phrase, LDABoost use latent topics as the features. In this way, the feature dimension is significantly reduced. Improved Naive Bayes (NB) is designed as the weaker classifier which keeps the efficiency advantage of classic NB algorithm and has higher precision. Moreover, a two-stage iterative weighted method called Cute Integration in this article is proposed for improving the accuracy by integrating weak classifiers into strong classifier in a more rational way. Mutual Information is used as metrics of weights allocation. The voting information and the categorization decision made by basis classifiers are fully utilized for generating the strong classifier. Experimental results reveals LDABoost making categorization in a low-dimensional space, it has higher accuracy than traditional AdaBoost algorithms and many other classic classification algorithms. Moreover, its runtime consumption is lower than different versions of AdaBoost, TC algorithms based on support vector machine and Neural Networks.

J	Guo, LQ; Wan, XJ				Guo, Liqiang; Wan, Xiaojun			Exploiting syntactic and semantic relationships between terms for opinion retrieval	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						information retrieval		Opinion retrieval is the task of finding documents that express an opinion about a given query. A key challenge in opinion retrieval is to capture the query-related opinion score of a document. Existing methods rely mainly on the proximity information between the opinion terms and the query terms to address the key challenge. In this study, we propose to incorporate the syntactic and semantic information of terms into a probabilistic model to capture the query-related opinion score more accurately. The syntactic tree structure of a sentence is used to evaluate the modifying probability between an opinion term and a noun within the sentence with a tree kernel method. Moreover, WordNet and the probabilistic topic model are used to evaluate the semantic relatedness between any noun and the given query. The experimental results over standard TREC baselines on the benchmark BLOG06 collection demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, in comparison with the proximity-based method and other baselines.

J	Shen, Y; Miao, Z				Shen, Y.; Miao, Z.			Multi-human tracking from sparse detection responses	IET COMPUTER VISION			English	Article							PARTICLE FILTER; OBJECT TRACKING; VISUAL TRACKING; TARGETS	In this study, the authors focus on the performance improvements of multi-human tracking from sparse detection responses. Many previous detection-based data association tracking methods used dense detection responses as input, but they did not take into account in the case of sparse detection responses. Dense detection responses are difficult to obtain in complex environments all the time. In order to achieve this goal, they propose a particle-filter-based triple threshold method to build reliable trajectories. Here, they apply topic model to represent human appearance. The appearance of each person can be considered as topic distribution. Then a cost function algorithm is used to associate these trajectories in a time sliding window for final tracking results. The cost function is composed of four parts: appearance cost, motion direction cost, object size cost and distance cost. These four parts are integrated into a unified formula to build this cost function. Finally, they use three challenging datasets to evaluate the performance of the author's approach in the case of dense and sparse detection responses, respectively, and compare with state-of-the-art approaches.

This paper proposed a framework for recognizing realistic human actions. Specifically, a new action representation is proposed based on computing a rich set of descriptors from keypoint trajectories. To obtain efficient and compact representations for actions, we develop a feature fusion method to combine spatial-temporal local motion descriptors by the movement of the camera which is detected by the distribution of spatio-temporal interest points in the clips. A new topic model called Markov Semantic Model is proposed for semantic feature selection which relies on the different kinds of dependencies between words produced by "syntactic" and "semantic" constraints. The informative features are selected collaboratively based on the different types of dependencies between words produced by short range and long range constraints. Building on the nonlinear SVMs, we validate this proposed hierarchical framework on several realistic action datasets.

In many topic models, the dimension of the latent topic space (the number of topics) is assumed to be a deterministic unknown. The number of topics significantly affects the prediction performance and interpretability of the estimated topics. In this paper, we propose a confidence-constrained rank minimization (CRM) to recover the exact number of topics in topic models with theoretical guarantees on recovery probability and mean squared error of the estimation. We provide a computationally-efficient optimization algorithm for the problem to further the applicability of the proposed framework to large real world datasets. Numerical evaluations are used to verify our theoretical results. Additionally, to illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework to practical problems, we provide results in image classification for two real world datasets and text classification for three real world datasets.

J	Krestel, R; Fankhauser, P				Krestel, Ralf; Fankhauser, Peter			Reranking web search results for diversity	INFORMATION RETRIEVAL			English	Article						Diversity; Web search; Reranking; Language models; Topic models; Variance; Diversity evaluation; Wikipedia	INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL; IR	Search engine results are often biased towards a certain aspect of a query or towards a certain meaning for ambiguous query terms. Diversification of search results offers a way to supply the user with a better balanced result set increasing the probability that a user finds at least one document suiting her information need. In this paper, we present a reranking approach based on minimizing variance of Web search results to improve topic coverage in the top-k results. We investigate two different document representations as the basis for reranking. Smoothed language models and topic models derived by Latent Dirichlet allocation. To evaluate our approach we selected 240 queries from Wikipedia disambiguation pages. This provides us with ambiguous queries together with a community generated balanced representation of their (sub)topics. For these queries we crawled two major commercial search engines. In addition, we present a new evaluation strategy based on Kullback-Leibler divergence and Wikipedia. We evaluate this method using the TREC sub-topic evaluation on the one hand, and manually annotated query results on the other hand. Our results show that minimizing variance in search results by reranking relevant pages significantly improves topic coverage in the top-k results with respect to Wikipedia, and gives a good overview of the overall search result. Moreover, latent topic models achieve competitive diversification with significantly less reranking. Finally, our evaluation reveals that our automatic evaluation strategy using Kullback-Leibler divergence correlates well with alpha-nDCG scores used in manual evaluation efforts.

The probabilistic topic modeling is a Bayesian method that is able to extract useful topical information from unlabeled data. When used to study microbial samples (assuming that relative abundance of functional elements is already obtained by a homology-based approach), each sample can be considered as a "document," which has a mixture of functional groups, while each functional group (also known as a "latent topic") is a weight mixture of functional elements (including taxonomic levels, and indicators of gene orthologous groups and KEGG pathway mappings). The functional elements bear an analogy with "words." Estimating the probabilistic topic model can uncover the configuration of functional groups (the latent topic) in each sample. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Obtaining text-based representation from quantization of mocap data turned out to be efficient. It becomes a fundamental step of many researches in human motion analysis. Geometric features are one of these techniques, which involve much prior knowledge and reduce data redundancy of numerical data. We describe geometric features as basic unit to define human motions (also called mo-words) and view a human motion as a generative process. Therefore, we obtain topic motions, which possess more semantic information using latent Dirichlet allocation by learning from massive training examples in order to understand motions better. We combine probabilistic model with human motion retrieval and come up with a new representation of human motions and a new retrieval framework. Our experiments demonstrate its advantages, both for understanding motions and retrieval. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In order to convert an MIL problem into a standard supervised learning problem, first, all the instances in training bags be clustered by K-Means method, and regards each cluster center as "visual-word" to build a visual vocabulary. Second, according to the distance between "visual-word" and instance, a fuzzy membership function is defined to establish a fuzzy term-document matrix, then use PLSA method to obtain bag's (image's) latent topic models, which can convert every bag to a single sample. Finally, in order to use the unlabeled images to improve retrieval accuracy, using semi-supervised TSVM to train classifiers. Experimental results on the COREL data sets show that the proposed method, named PLSA-SSMIL, is robust, and its performance is superior to other key existing MIL algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Shi, SK; Li, LM				Shi, Steve Kansheng; Li, Lemin			A Close-to-linear Topic Detection Algorithm using Relative Entropy based Relevance Model and Inverted Indices Retrieval	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Topic Detection; Link Topic Detection; Retrospective Event Detection; Information Retrieval; Relevance Models; Inverted Indices		Although timely access to information is becoming increasingly important and gaining such access is no longer a problem, the capacity for humans to assimilate such huge amounts of information is limited. Topic Detection(TD) is then a promising research area that addresses speedy access of desired information. However, ironically, the time complexity of existing TD algorithms themselves is usually O(n(3)) or up to the x-th power of e. Linear performance requirement of real world topic detection has not been significantly addressed. This paper reveals a new patented topic detection algorithm called RMIR that combines relevance model with information retrieval technique to improve on time efficiency. Relevance Model(RM) is a theoretical extension of statistical language modeling that was developed for the task of document retrieval. To reduce the costs of fetching RM, we reduce the number of comparisons for stories by a query-based approach that makes similar stories exist in the top-k query results. We also build our query based on inverted indices, which have the complexity close to linear. The time cost of rest of operations in the RMIR topic detection process is a constant. Hence, the total complexity of RMIR topic detection algorithm should be close to linear as shown in experimental results. In addition, RMIR also gains better detection rates and robustness by relative entropy based topic model design.

J	Fan, YW; Zheng, SB; Yang, H; Zhang, CY; Su, H				Fan, Yawen; Zheng, Shibao; Yang, Hua; Zhang, Chongyang; Su, Hang			Causality-weighted active learning for abnormal event identification based on the topic model	OPTICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						video surveillance; topic model; active learning; abnormal event identification		Abnormal event identification in crowded scenes is a fundamental task for video surveillance. However, it is still challenging for most current approaches because of the general insufficiency of labeled data for training, particularly for abnormal data. We propose a novel active-supervised joint topic model for learning activity and training sample collection. First, a multi-class topic model is constructed based on the initial training data. Then the remaining unlabeled data stream is surveyed. The system actively decides whether it can label a new sample by itself or if it has to ask a human annotator. After each query, the current model is incrementally updated. To alleviate class imbalance, causality-weighted method is applied to both likelihood and uncertainty sampling for active learning. Furthermore, a combination of a new measure termed query entropy and the overall classification accuracy is used for assessing the model performance. Experimental results on two real-world traffic videos for abnormal event identification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

J	Naptali, W; Tsuchiya, M; Nakagawa, S				Naptali, Welly; Tsuchiya, Masatoshi; Nakagawa, Seiichi			Topic-Dependent-Class-Based n-Gram Language Model	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						Language model; n-gram; perplexity; speech recognition; topic dependent	SPEECH RECOGNITION; ADAPTATION; CACHE	A topic-dependent-class (TDC)-based n-gram language model (LM) is a topic-based LM that employs a semantic extraction method to reveal latent topic information extracted from noun-noun relations. A topic of a given word sequence is decided on the basis of most frequently occuring (weighted) noun classes in the context history through voting. Our previous work (W. Naptali, M. Tsuchiya, and S. Seiichi, "Topic-dependent language model with voting on noun history,"ACM Trans. Asian Language Information Processing (TALIP), vol. 9, no. 2, pp. 1-31, 2010) has shown that in terms of perplexity, TDCs outperform several state-of-the-art baselines, i.e., a word-based or class-based n-gram LM and their interpolation, a cache-based LM, an n-gram-based topic-dependent LM, and a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-based topic-dependent LM. This study is a follow up of our previous work and there are three key differences. First, we improve TDCs by employing soft-clustering and/or soft-voting techniques, which solve data shrinking problems and make TDCs independent of the word-based n-gram, in the training and/or test phases. Second, for further improvement, we incorporate a cache-based LM through unigram scaling, because the TDC and cache-based LM capture different properties of the language. Finally, we provide an evaluation in terms of the word error rate (WER) and an analysis of the automatic speech recognition (ASR) rescoring task. Experiments performed on the Wall Street Journal and the Mainichi Shimbun (a Japanese newspaper) demonstrate that the TDC LM improves both perplexity and the WER. The perplexity reduction is up to 25.1% relative on the English corpus and 25.7% relative on the Japanese corpus. Furthermore, the greatest reduction in the WER is 15.2% relative to the English ASR and 24.3 relative to the Japanese ASR, as compared to the baseline.

J	Ihler, A; Newman, D				Ihler, Alexander; Newman, David			Understanding Errors in Approximate Distributed Latent Dirichlet Allocation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Data mining; topic model; parallel processing; error analysis		Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a popular algorithm for discovering semantic structure in large collections of text or other data. Although its complexity is linear in the data size, its use on increasingly massive collections has created considerable interest in parallel implementations. "Approximate distributed" LDA, or AD-LDA, approximates the popular collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm for LDA models while running on a distributed architecture. Although this algorithm often appears to perform well in practice, its quality is not well understood theoretically or easily assessed on new data. In this work, we theoretically justify the approximation, and modify AD-LDA to track an error bound on performance. Specifically, we upper bound the probability of making a sampling error at each step of the algorithm (compared to an exact, sequential Gibbs sampler), given the samples drawn thus far. We show empirically that our bound is sufficiently tight to give a meaningful and intuitive measure of approximation error in AD-LDA, allowing the user to track the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency while executing in parallel.

J	Wang, LD; Jei, Y				Wang, Lidong; Jei, Yuan			Enhancing Digital Book Clustering by LDAC Model	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						digital book clustering; topic model; Gibbs sampling; LDAC model	FEATURE-SELECTION	In Digital Library (DL) applications, digital book clustering is an important and urgent research task. However, it is difficult to conduct effectively because of the great length of digital books. To do the correct clustering for digital books, a novel method based on probabilistic topic model is proposed. Firstly, we build a topic model named LDAC. The main goal of LDAC topic modeling is to effectively extract topics from digital books. Subsequently, Gibbs sampling is applied for parameter inference. Once the model parameters are learned, each book is assigned to the cluster which maximizes the posterior probability. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach based on LDAC is able to achieve significant improvement as compared to the related methods.

J	Allen, TT; Xiong, H				Allen, Theodore T.; Xiong, Hui			Pareto charting using multifield freestyle text data applied to Toyota Camry user reviews	APPLIED STOCHASTIC MODELS IN BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY			English	Article						topic model; information retrieval; quality control; unsupervised learning	MODEL	This article proposes a method for Pareto charting that is based on unsupervised, freestyle text such as customer complaint, rework, scrap, or maintenance event descriptions. The proposed procedure is based on a slight extension of the latent Dirichlet allocation method to form multifield latent Dirichlet allocation. The extension is the usage of field-specific dictionaries for multifield databases and changes to recommended default prior settings. We use a numerical study to motivate the prior setting selection. A real-world case study associated with user reviews of Toyota Camry vehicles is used to illustrate the practical value of the proposed methods. The results indicate that only 4% of the words written by Consumer Reports reviewers from the last 10 years relate to the widely publicized unintended acceleration issue.

Specifically, our method aims to model the user interest in the UIQA systems with latent topic method, and extract interests for users by mining the questions they asked, the categories they participated in and relevant answer providers. We apply the TUI model to the application of question recommendation, which automatically recommends to certain user appropriate questions he might be interested in. Data collection from Yahoo!

J	Brahmi, A; Ech-Cherif, A; Benyettou, A				Brahmi, Abderrezak; Ech-Cherif, Ahmed; Benyettou, Abdelkader			Arabic texts analysis for topic modeling evaluation	INFORMATION RETRIEVAL			English	Article						Arabic stemming; Topic model; Linguistic analysis; Classification; Test collections		Significant progress has been made in information retrieval covering text semantic indexing and multilingual analysis. However, developments in Arabic information retrieval did not follow the extraordinary growth of Arabic usage in the Web during the ten last years. In the tasks relating to semantic analysis, it is preferable to directly deal with texts in their original language. Studies on topic models, which provide a good way to automatically deal with semantic embedded in texts, are not complete enough to assess the effectiveness of the approach on Arabic texts. This paper investigates several text stemming methods for Arabic topic modeling. A new lemma-based stemmer is described and applied to newspaper articles. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation model is used to extract latent topics from three Arabic real-world corpora. For supervised classification in the topics space, experiments show an improvement when comparing to classification in the full words space or with root-based stemming approach. In addition, topic modeling with lemma-based stemming allows us to discover interesting subjects in the press articles published during the 2007-2009 period.

However the previous works only used a fixed visual vocabulary, which is formed by vector quantizing SIFT like region descriptors, and so the learned visual topic models are also only based on the fixed vocabulary. This paper presents a novel approach to cluster visual objects in an incremental manner. Given a new batch of images, we firstly expand the visual vocabulary to include the new visual words, and then adjust the objects clustering model to absorb these new words, and finally give the clustering result. We achieve our goal by adapting to the visual domain of the incremental pLSA model previously used for text analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and stability of the growing vocabulary tree and the clustering performance using the images from seven categories in a dynamic environment.

Topics naturally evolve with multiple timescales. For example, some words may be used consistently over one hundred years, while other words emerge and disappear over periods of a few days. Thus, in the proposed model, current topic-specific distributions over words are assumed to be generated based on the multiscale word distributions of the previous epoch. Considering both the long- and short-timescale dependency yields a more robust model. We derive efficient online inference procedures based on a stochastic EM algorithm, in which the model is sequentially updated using newly obtained data; this means that past data are not required to make the inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of predictive performance and computational efficiency by examining collections of real documents with timestamps.			iwata.tomoharu@lab.ntt.co.jp					AHMED A., 2010, P 26 INT C UNC ART I; Ahmed A., 2008, P SIAM INT C DAT MIN; AlSumait L, 2008, IEEE DATA MINING, P3, DOI 10.1109/ICDM.2008.140; Andrieu C, 2003, MACH LEARN, V50, P5, DOI 10.1023/A:1020281327116; Banerjee A, 2007, P SIAM INT C DAT MIN; BLEI D., 2010, P INT C MACH LEARN I; Blei D.M., 2006, P 23 INT C MACH LEAR, P113, DOI DOI 10.1145/1143844.1143859; Blei DM, 2003, J MACH LEARN RES, V3, P993, DOI 10.1162/jmlr.2003.3.4-5.993; Canini K.

J	Zhu, WJ; Zhang, LQ; Bian, QW				Zhu, Wenjun; Zhang, Liqing; Bian, Qianwei			A hierarchical latent topic model based on sparse coding	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Latent topic model; Sparse coding; Laplace distribution	SCENE	We propose a novel hierarchical latent topic model based on sparse coding in this paper. Unlike the other topic models applied in the computer vision field, the words in our model are not discrete but continuous. They are generated by sparse coding and represented with n-dimensional vectors in R-n. In sparse coding, only a small set of components of each word is active, so we assume the probability distribution over these continuous words is Laplace and the parameters of the Laplace distribution depend on topics, which are the latent variables in this model. The relationship among word, topic, document and corpus in our model is similar to latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Thereby this model is a generalization of the traditional LDA by introducing the concept-continuous words. We use an EM algorithm to estimate the parameters in our model. And the proposed method is applied to some significant computer vision problems such as natural scene categorization and object classification. The experimental results show the method is a valuable direction to generalize topic models. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Users frequently look for important aspects of a product or service in the reviews. Usually, they are interested in semantic (i.e., sentimentoriented) aspects. However, extracting semantic aspects with supervised methods is very expensive. We propose a domain independent unsupervised model to extract semantic aspects, and conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments to evaluate the extracted aspects. The experiments show that our model effectively extracts semantic aspects with correlated top words. In addition, the conducted evaluation on aspect sentiment classification shows that our model outperforms other models by 5-7% in terms of macro-average F1.

Shopping sites such as amazon.com, dangdang. com provide consumers with a hierarchical navigation for selecting products easily from overwhelming amount of products. However, those man-made navigations are so general and professional that consumers still need to spend much time in filtering out their own undesired products personally. Shopping sites provide abundant textual product descriptions for most products, which describes the details of the product. In this paper, we propose a novel model to build a topic hierarchy from the detailed product descriptions, which can automatically model words into a tree structure by hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (hLDA), besides, our model can also augment words level allocations with the conceptual relation between words in WordNet automatically. Each node in the hierarchical tree contains some relevant keywords of product descriptions, thus clarifying the meaning of the concept in the node. Therefore, consumers can pick out their interested products by using the discovered descriptive and valuable navigation of products. The experimental results on amazon. com, one of the most popular shopping sites in America, demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

In this approach, bags of instances are represented as distributions using the principle of MaxEnt. We learn basis functions which span the space of distributions for jointly regularized density estimation. The basis functions are analogous to topics in a topic model. We propose a distance metric for measuring similarities at the bag level which captures the statistical properties of each bag. We provide a convex optimization method to learn the metric and compare the results with distance based multi-instance learning algorithms, e. g., Citation-kNN and bag-level kernel SVM on two real world datasets. The results show that regularized MDE produces a comparable results in terms of accuracy with reduced computational complexity.

Our approach is based upon the sociological notion that group identity forms the basis for behavioral change [1]. We begin by inferring social values from social media text data by combining information regarding topic content and sentiment. Next, groups are inferred as a latent variable mediating between individual social media authors and social values.

This paper presents a Bayesian non-parametric learning approach to tackle these two issues. We develop a topic-based language model where the numbers of topics and n-grams are automatically determined from data. To cope with this model selection problem, we introduce the nonparametric priors for topics and backoff n-grams. The infinite language models are constructed through the hierarchical Dirichlet process compound Pitman-Yor (PY) process. We develop the topic-based hierarchical PY language model (THPY-LM) with power-law behavior. This model can be simplified to the hierarchical PY (HPY) LM by disregarding the topic information and also the modified Kneser-Ney (MKN) LM by further disregarding the Bayesian treatment. In the experiments, the proposed THPY-LM outperforms state-of-art methods using MKN-LM and HPY-LM.

Each utterance is represented as a node of the graph, and the edge between two nodes is weighted by the similarity between the two utterances, which is the topical similarity, as evaluated by probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA). We model intra-speaker topics by sharing the topics from the same speaker and inter-speaker topics by partially sharing the topics from the adjacent utterances based on temporal information. For both manual transcripts and ASR output, experiments confirmed the efficacy of combining intra- and inter-speaker topic modeling for summarization.

The compromised legitimate websites served the malicious content to its users who ended up getting infected. In this paper we present web crawling, inlink search, topic modeling and computational intelligent techniques to attribute the topics targeted by the attackers. We also identify the attack vector used by the attackers with respect to the topics, in targeting the internet users. A computational intelligent technique relying on Gibbs random sampling was used to extract the topics automatically from a set of webpages under study. The extracted topics are correlated with Google Trends to put forward some interesting properties that are helpful in detecting the malicious websites proactively. We identified the primary topics from the topic models generated by Gibbs random sampling across each month and analyzed the features of the targeted topics with respect to its importance then. We identified the words that were consistently targeted across the period of our study and analyzed the topics on which the attackers are always after.

However, topics in real-world stream data are non-stationary. Training a reliable topic model is a challenging study. Further, the usage of words in different paragraphs within a document is varied due to different composition styles. This study presents a hierarchical segmentation model by compensating the heterogeneous topics in stream level and the heterogeneous words in document level. The topic similarity between sentences is calculated to form a beta prior for stream-level segmentation. This segmentation prior is adopted to group topic-coherent sentences into a document. For each pseudo-document, we incorporate a Markov chain to detect stylistic segments within a document. The words in a segment are generated by identical composition style. This new model is inferred by a variational Bayesian EM procedure. Experimental results show benefits by using the proposed model in terms of perplexity and F measure.

In this work, we aim to take advantage of the superior unsupervised learning ability of the framework, and use it to uncover topic structure embedded in the corpora in an entirely data-driven fashion. In addition, we describe a bi-level inference and classification method that allows topic clustering at the utterance level while preserving the document-level topic structures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed topic clustering pipeline in a state-of-the-art Arabic broadcast transcription system. Experiments show that optimizing LM in the LDA topic space leads to 5% reduction in language model perplexity. It is further shown that topic clustering and adaptation is able to attain 0.4% absolute word error rate reduction on the GALE Arabic task.

Real-world deployments of topic models, however, often require intensive expert verification and model refinement. In this paper we present Termite, a visual analysis tool for assessing topic model quality. Termite uses a tabular layout to promote comparison of terms both within and across latent topics. We contribute a novel saliency measure for selecting relevant terms and a seriation algorithm that both reveals clustering structure and promotes the legibility of related terms.

Instead of using the 1-best input given by the speech recognizer, the proposed model takes confusion network as an input to alleviate recognition errors. We incorporate a selection variable which helps reweight the recognition output, thus creating a more accurate latent topic estimate.

In this paper we propose a new unsupervised SITS analysis method based on the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model, a hierarchical model originally developed for text analysis. In this model documents are represented as random mixture of latent topics, each topic being characterized by a distribution over words. This paper extends the use of LDA model for satellite image time series analysis by proposing a description language for SITS modeling according to the LDA model, and is applied on a SITS of 11 Landsat TM scenes acquired in 2007.

When speaking of social trust mainly homophily (similarity) has been the most successful metric for learning trustworthy links, specially in social web applications such as collaborative filtering recommendation systems. While pure homophily such as Pearson coefficient correlation and its variations, have been favorable to finding taste distances between individuals based on their rated items, they are not necessarily useful in finding opinion distances between individuals discussing a trending topic, e. g. Arab spring. At the same time text mining techniques, such as vector-based techniques, are not capable of capturing important factors such as saliency or polarity which are possible with topical models for detecting, analyzing and suggesting aspects of people mentioning those tags or topics. Thus, in this paper we are proposing to model opinion distances using probabilistic information divergence as a metric for measuring the distances between people's opinion contributing to a discussion in a social network. To acquire feature sets from topics discussed in a discussion we use a very successful topic modeling technique, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We use the distributions resulting to model topics for generating social networks of group and individual users. Using a Twitter dataset we show that learned graphs exhibit properties of real-world like networks.

Topics of love discussion were then extracted from the corpus by means of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Finally, on the basis of these features, a cross-cultural comparison was carried out. For the purpose of cross-cultural analysis, the experimental focus was on comparing data from a culture from the East (India) with a culture from the West (United States of America). Similarities and differences between these cultures have been analyzed with respect to the usage of emotions, their intensities and the topics used during love discussion in social media.

We model roof-top as the connected structural elements. The proposed method contains two major steps: 1) Detect structural elements, different from earlier structure detector, the proposed method automatically learn the types of elements from unlabeled samples; 2) Connect these elements to form roof-top boundary, where the relationships between elements are estimated by hierarchical topic model. This approach belongs to generative method where only a small number of roof-top samples are required. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Unlike classical topic tracking that usually relies on previously trained topic models, our method is purely data-driven and is able to simultaneously determine the common stories of the input texts. Specifically, we propose an iterative four-step MRF solution to the problem of story co-segmentation using lexical cues only. We first construct a sentence-level graph formulation of the input news transcripts, and initialize foreground and background labeling by lexical clustering. We then update both foreground and background models based on the current labeling. We formalize story co-segmentation as a Gibbs energy minimization problem that balances the optimal objectives of foreground/background likelihood, intra-doc coherence, and inter-doc similarity. Finally, the labeling refinement is obtained by hybrid optimization with QPBO and BP. The effectiveness of our method has been validated on real-world CCTV corpus.

However, social inequalities have traditionally meant that some communities, where there is a concentration of poverty, are both less likely to exhibit these democratic behaviors and less likely to benefit from any additional boost as a result of technology use. We argue that some new technologies afford opportunities for communication that bridge this divide. Using temporal topic modeling, we compare informal conversational activity that takes place online in communities of high and low poverty. Our analysis is based on data collected through i-Neighbors, a community website that provides neighborhood discussion forums. To test our hypotheses, we designed a novel time series segmentation algorithm that is driven by topic dynamics. We embed an LDA algorithm in a segmentation strategy and develop an approach to compare and contrast the resulting topic models underlying time series segments. We examine the adoption of i-Neighbors by poverty level, and apply our algorithm to six neighborhoods (three economically advantaged and three economically disadvantaged) and evaluate differences in conversations for statistical significance. Our findings suggest that social technologies may afford opportunities for democratic engagement in contexts that are otherwise less likely to support opportunities for deliberation and participatory democracy.

This paper presents a novel unsupervised learning algorithm for discovering object category and their locations in video sequences. Both appearance consistency and motion consistency of local patches across frames are exploited. Video patches are first extracted and represented by spatial-temporal context words. A dynamic topic model is then introduced to learn object categories in video sequences. The proposed dynamic model can categorize and localize multiple objects in a single video. Experimental results on the CamVid dataset and the VISAT (TM) dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Latent Dirichlet allocation is applied to sliding temporal windows of utterances, resulting in a topic model which captures the fluid transitions from topic to topic which occur in multi-party discourse. Further processing discretizes the continuous topic mixtures into sequential topic segments. Features are extracted from topic shift regions and used to train a binary role classifier. The added topic shift features significantly improve the baseline performance on two corpora, demonstrating both the value of the features and the robustness of the unsupervised segmentation. Furthermore, our classification results on the ICSI corpus, using automatically segmented topics, are better than the results using ground truth segmentations.

Observed n-grams in the training set are assigned to topics using soft and hard clustering. In soft clustering, each n-gram is assigned to topics such that the total count of that n-gram for all topics is equal to the global count of that n-gram in the training set. Here, the normalized topic weights of the n-gram are multiplied by the global n-gram count to form the topic n-gram count for the respective topics. In hard clustering, each n-gram is assigned to a single topic with the maximum fraction of the global n-gram count for the corresponding topic. Here, the topic is selected using the maximum topic weight for the n-gram. The topic n-gram count LMs are created using the respective topic n-gram counts and adapted by using the topic weights of a development test set. We compute the average of the confidence measures: the probability of word given topic and the probability of topic given word. The average is taken over the words in the n-grams and the development test set to form the topic weights of the n-grams and the development test set respectively. Our approaches show better performance over some traditional approaches using the WSJ corpus.	[Haidar, Md.

LSM is a unigram probability distribution over words and is estimated using the LDA model. A hard-clustering method is used to form topics. Each document is assigned to a topic based on the maximum number of words chosen from the topic for that document in LDA analysis. An LDA-adapted model is created using the weighted combination of topic models. The LDA-adapted model is modified by using the LSM as dynamic marginals, and a new adapted model is formed by using the minimum discriminant information (MDI) approach, which minimizes the distance between the new adapted model and the LDA-adapted model. We apply LM adaptation approaches for original and automatic (recognition results after first-pass decoding) transcriptions test data and have seen significant perplexity and word error rate (WER) reductions over a traditional approach.

Latent topic modeling has traditionally been applied to bag-of-words representations that ignore word sequence information that can aid in semantic understanding. In this work we introduce a method for efficiently incorporating arbitrarily long word sequences into a topic modeling approach. This method iteratively constructs a constrained set of phrase trees in an unsupervised fashion from a document collection using weighted pointwise mutual information statistics to guide the process. In experiments on the Fisher Corpus of conversational speech, the incorporation of learned phrases into a latent topic model yielded significant improvements in the unsupervised discovery of the known topics present within the data.

To this end we employ the notion of Bayesian surprise, as defined in [9,10], in which an event is considered surprising if its occurrence leads to a large change in the probability of the world model. We propose to compute this abstract measure of surprise by first modeling a corpus of video events using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model. Subsequently, we measure the change in the Dirichlet prior of the LDA model as a result of each video event's occurrence. This leads to a closed form expression for an event's level of surprise. We tested our algorithm on a real world video data, taken by a camera observing an urban street intersection.

These documents are meant to be tightly coupled with the actual implementation of the features they describe. In this paper we evaluate the value of high-level topic-based requirements traceability in the version control system, using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We evaluate LDA topics on practitioners and check if the topics and trends extracted matches the perception that Program Managers and Developers have about the effort put into addressing certain topics. We found that effort extracted from version control that was relevant to a topic often matched the perception of the managers and developers of what occurred at the time. Furthermore we found evidence that many of the identified topics made sense to practitioners and matched their perception of what occurred. But for some topics, we found that practitioners had difficulty interpreting and labelling them. In summary, we investigate the high-level traceability of requirements topics to version control commits via topic analysis and validate with the actual stakeholders the relevance of these topics extracted from requirements.

Topic models, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), have been proposed and shown to be useful for text analysis. The existing topic models focus on traditional document collections, which consist of a relatively small number of long and high-quality documents. However, user-generated texts tend to be shorter and noisier than traditional content. Besides, the social networks have two novel features: context information on nodes, such as user features, and edges, such as relationship, which have not been considered by the existing topic models. In this paper, we pose the problem of finding user topics in large-scale collection of documents from online social networks. We propose a comprehensive Feature based and a Social based Topic model, taking into account the user features and social networks. We demonstrate that our models have better performance than a baseline LDA in the Epinions, Twitter, and Google+ data sets.

Topic Model based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is widely used for the statistical analysis of document collections and other discrete data. The LDA model assumes that the words of each document arise from a mixture of topics, each of which is a multinomial distribution over the vocabulary. To apply the original LDA to process continuous data, discretization based vector quantization must be done beforehand, which usually results in information loss. In the proposed model, we consider continuous emission probability, Gaussian instead of multinomial distribution. This new topic model demonstrates higher performance than standard LDA in the experiments of audio retrieval.

Ideally, users would like to be alerted when bad queries are present, which helps eliminate latency as well as waste of bandwidth, especially in 3G wireless environment. In this paper, we propose a visual query performance prediction (v-QPP) approach to predict the retrieval effectiveness. We employ latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) to derive latent topics from image database. From the collection statistics, we model the query's specificity based on topics. High specificity helps a retrieval system to derive user's search intent exactly. Moreover, as low discriminative content is difficult to search in terms of distinguishing relevant images from irrelevant one, we propose a topics based inverse concept frequency (t-ICF) model to deal with specific queries but difficult to discriminate in the reference database. Comparison experiments over MPEG CDVS benchmarking datasets have shown our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in document retrieval.

The micro-blogging messages published by a user contain the user's interest information; intuitively, the message that was published recently by a user should have a bigger impact on the user's current interest than a message that was published long time ago. This paper uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation to extract topics from all messages posted by a user; then, clusters the user's all messages, and represent user's interests with the centers of the clusters. When clustering objects, if apply a time-varying influence function on each object, each object has different influence on clustering process; we call this clustering process as clustering method with weight. The experiment shows that the centers of clusters generated by clustering method with weight can depict user's temporal dynamic profile more accurately than the centers of clusters generated by clustering method without weight.

In this paper, we formally define the problem of Topic Diffusion Behavior Tracking and propose a novel model by investigating users' topic interest. Our algorithm is developed based on the combination of personal interest and friend influence. First, probability topic model is defined to model topic content efficiently by historical behavior. Second, to integrate topic content and friend influence, we develop a topic behavior tracking model based on random walk. Finally, we propose a novel measure called Topic-Interest-Rank (TIR), which ranks users according to how important they are in sociological phenomena, to predict the topic behavior in future. Comprehensive experimental studies on two different real world data sets show that our approach outperforms existing ones and well matches the practice.

Although the traditional methods have gained significant performance, they ignore the topic information and the distribution of words in calculating the sentence similarity. In this paper, the authors propose a topic model to discover the latent topics in the content of sentences, and combine the latent topic based similarity with TF-IDF into a unified framework for data selection. Furthermore, the authors combine a cross-lingual projecting method with the topic model, which makes the data selection depend on the source input directly. Large-scale experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the traditional approaches on both LM perplexity and SMT performance.

Our method exploits metadata information available with the images to get category information using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Using this category information for each image, we solve the underlying classification problem by building a sparse classifier model for each concept. We demonstrate that the images that specify the sparse model form a good summary. In particular, our summary satisfies important properties such as likelihood, diversity and balance in both visual and semantic sense. Furthermore, the framework allows users to specify desired distributions over categories to create personalized summaries. Experimental results on seven broad query types show that the proposed method performs better than state-of-the-art methods.			dhrumaha@microsoft.com; ssrajan@microsoft.com; subhajit.sanyal@gmail.com; amadaan@thefind.com					Berg T., 2009, CVPR WORKSH; Blei DM, 2003, J MACH LEARN RES, V3, P993, DOI 10.1162/jmlr.2003.3.4-5.993; Crandall D.

Our goal is the discovery and analysis of mobility patterns which characterize the behavior of the stations of a bike-sharing system based on the number of available bikes along a day. An unsupervised methodology based on probabilistic topic models has been used to achieve these goals. Topic models are probabilistic generative models for documents that identify the latent structure that underlies a set of words. In particular, Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) has been used to discover mobility patterns. Our database has been collected for almost half a year from the Bicicas bike sharing system in Castellon (Spain). A set of experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the type of patterns that can be effectively discovered by using the proposed framework.

In addition, this research strives to improve topic models in the 'real time' environment of online learning. In total, seventeen different nuclear radioisotopes are classified, and performance of Higher-Order versus traditional techniques is evaluated. This project employs LDA and HO-LDA on a nuclear detection numeric dataset to gain a topic decomposition of instances. These learned topics are then used as features in a traditional supervised classification algorithm. In essence, the LDA or HO-LDA topic assignments are used as features in supervised learning algorithms that predict the class (isotope), treating LDA or HO-LDA as a feature space transform. Using Topic Modeling on numeric nuclear detection data is cutting edge, as to our knowledge this has never been done before on a nuclear detection dataset. Two methods of feature transformation are evaluated, including Multinomial Feature Creation and Maximum Channel Value Feature Creation. Results demonstrate further evidence that Higher Order Learning techniques can be usefully applied in topic modeling applied to nuclear detection.

Existing techniques for feature location broadly fall into three categories, based on the type of information they use: text, static, and dynamic. The techniques based on dynamic may generate large amount of data and is difficult to utilize. This paper presents a method combing the text and static techniques. A feature location technique based on topic modeling is introduced, and the topic cohesion and coupling is computed by software dependency network to improve the effects of feature location. When the topic cohesion degree is low and topic coupling degree is high, software dependency network is used to find additional candidate program elements. This method is empirically evaluated through several experiments. Experimental results show that the topic modeling based feature location improves the effectiveness of feature location when compared with other techniques.

The method is based on the user profiling using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Fraudulent behavior is detected with use of a threshold-type classification algorithm, allocating the telecommunication accounts into one of two classes: fraudulent account and non-fraudulent account. The paper provides also a method for automatic threshold computation. The accounts are classified with use of the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence). Therefore, we also introduce three methods for approximating the KL-divergence between two LDAs. Finally, the results of experimental study on KL-divergence approximation and fraud detection in telecommunications are reported.

However, there exist important applications where topic models must be learned over an audio corpus of spoken language. Unfortunately, speech-to-text programs can have very low accuracy. We therefore propose a novel topic model for spoken language that incorporates a statistical model of speech-to-text software behavior. Crucially, our model exploits the uncertainty numbers returned by the software. Our ideas apply to any domain in which it would be useful to build a topic model over data in which uncertainties are explicitly represented.

Previous probabilistic topic model algorithms, which are based on the bag-of-words representations of visual features, ignore the temporal dependencies of word occurrences. Thus, it is not suitable for analyzing sequential behaviors of the various objects in video sequences. The spatial-temporal hierarchical probabilistic latent semantic analysis (ST-HpLSA) is considered to describe spatial-temporal behavior patterns of moving objects in the crowded traffic scenes. The ST-HpLSA is able to detect the behaviors which occur both locally and globally over time and space. The ST-HpLSA is evaluated using the crowded traffic scene dataset. The experiments show that the ST-HpLSA yields good performance in analyzing behaviors and detecting irregular behaviors.

This paper is about, analyzing web documents in an enhanced way and delve the distillation web document will be the next pace in hypertext mining. The sparse document is a very little data on the web, which may face problems like different words with almost identical or similar meanings and sparseness. Natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) are the main obstacles of the above problem. The mining of hidden terms discovers the search queries from large external datasets (universal datasets). It helps to handle unseen data in a better way. The goal of this web document mining consists of an efficient information finding, filtering information based on user query, and discovers more topic focused keywords based on the rich source of global information datasets. The proposed method we use the Distillation model, it is the integration of probabilistic generative model, Gibbs sampling algorithm and deployment method. This model can be applied for different natural languages and data domains for achieving the goal. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Firstly, an image collection is implicitly generated by partitioning a large satellite image into densely overlapped sub-images. Then, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation with a hierarchy Dirichlet process is employed to model the image collection. Gibbs sampling is adopted for parameter estimation and image clustering. Specifically, the introduction of Dirichlet process is purposed to extend the LDA to an infinite mixtures model which can estimate the number of components (e. g. clusters in image analysis) automatically. Finally, the effect of the proposed algorithm is analyzed through experiments, and the results of it with the traditional K-means method over a QUICKBIRD image are compared.

We approach the novel problem of estimating the approximate age of Historical Handwritten Documents using Handwriting styles. This system will have many applications in handwritten document processing engines where specialized processing techniques can be applied based on the estimated age of the document. We propose to learn a distribution over styles across centuries using Topic Models and to apply a classifier over weights learned in order to estimate the approximate age of the documents. We present a comparison of different distance metrics such as Euclidean Distance and Hellinger Distance within this application.

People use these tools for a better communication with friends, colleagues and relatives. These have also been adopted by companies and organizations to improve their interactions with customers. Therefore, a description of the posting dynamics would further enhance the analysis by describing future tendencies. Current methods of diffusion analysis rely on machine learning techniques that analyze content activity history in OSNs. Our work presents a stochastic model based on decision making psychology to describe content posting dynamics on OSNs and VCs. Our proposal was simulated on a real VC, recovering most of its average content generation behavior. Simulated posted topic distribution becomes near to observed data within a mean absolute percentage error MAPE of 1.2%.

We propose a new semi-supervised method that uses the simplest topic model yielded by the standard EM algorithm; model calculation is very rapid. Furthermore our approach allows a dictionary to be modified interactively and the final dictionary has a hierarchical structure. This paper makes three contributions. First, it proposes a world-based semi-supervised topic model. Second, we apply the semi-supervised topic model to interactive learning; this approach is called the Interactive Topic Model. Third, we propose a score function; it extracts the related words that occupy the middle layer of the hierarchical structure. Experiments show that our method can appropriately retrieve the words belonging to an arbitrary class.

Twitter, as a popular source of real-time information, plays an important role in this respect, as both the follower-followee graph and the many relationships among users provide a rich set of information pieces about the social network. However, many hidden factors must be considered if social data are to successfully support the search for high-quality information. Here we focus on one of these factors, namely the relationship between content similarity and social distance in the social network. We compared two methods to compute content similarity among twitter users in a one-per-user document collection, one based on standard term frequency vectors, the other based on topic associations obtained by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). By comparing these metrics at different hop distances in the social graph we investigated the utility of prominent features such as Retweets and Hashtags as predictors of similarity, and demonstrated the advantages of topical proximity vs. textual similarity for friend recommendations.

We first introduce how the indexing quality of a speech document is evaluated. Then, we present our method to predict the indexing quality of a speech document. It is based on confidence measure provided by an automatic speech recognition system and the detection of semantic outliers implemented with the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. Experiments are conducted on the French Broadcast news campaign ESTER2 in a classical SDR scenario where users submit text-queries to a search engine. Results demonstrate an overall improvement when the detection is done with the LDA model. The detection rate is always above 70%.

Extant research has approached writer identification by using writing styles as a discriminative function between writers. In contrast, we model writing styles as a shared component of an individual's handwriting. We develop a theoretical framework for this conceptualization and model this using a three level hierarchical Bayesian model (Latent Dirichlet Allocation). In this text-independent, unsupervised model each writer's handwriting is modeled as a distribution over finite writing styles that are shared amongst writers.

We take a discriminative model-based approach, using Support Vector Machines to segment BN transcriptions into thematically coherent stories within the real-time constraints defined by BMS. We extract lexical, topical and story boundary cue features from source language transcriptions, machine translated (MT) English and metadata generated by BMS. We leverage BBN's Topic Classification technique to extract topic persistence features, and incorporate topic supporting words and topic clusters to encode thematic transitions. Using the discriminative model-based approach, we get a relative gain of 27.9% on English BN and 22.0% on Arabic BN over a rule-based system. We also demonstrate a relative improvement of 11.8% in segmentation performance using features extracted from MT English compared to Arabic source features. We highlight the impact of topic model training in our story segmentation approach by varying corpus size to achieve a 13.7% relative gain with increase in number of topics.

Most past research efforts on data dissemination examined syntactic redundancy between data items (e.g., common bit strings, entropy coding and compression, etc.), but only limited work has examined the problem of reducing semantic redundancy with the goal of providing higher quality information to end users. In this paper we propose to measure semantic redundancy in large volume text streams using online topic models and opinion analysis (e.g., topic = Location X and opinion = possible_hazard(+), safe_zone(-)). By suppressing semantically redundant content one can better utilize bottleneck resources such as bandwidth on a resource constrained network or attention time of a human user. However, unlike syntactic redundancy (e.g., lossless compression, lossy compression with small reconstruction errors), a semantic redundancy based approach is faced with the challenge of having to deal with larger inaccuracies (e.g., false positive and false negative probabilities in an opinion classifier). This paper seeks to quantify the effectiveness of a semantic redundancy based approach (over its syntactic counterparts) as a function of such inaccuracies and present a detailed experimental evaluation using realistic information flows collected from an enterprise network with about 1500 users(1).

This paper presents a method for solving WSI problem based on the context clustering approach. The idea behind this approach is that similar contexts indicate similar meanings. Specifically, we have successfully applied Correlated Topic Model (CTM) to partition contexts of a word into clusters, each representing a sense of that word. Different from some previous systems where a single model is built for all words, in our system, each word has its own model. Experimental result on the SemEval-2010 dataset shows that CTM is a strong tool for modelling the word's contexts. Our system has significantly better performance than all systems participated in the SemEval-2010 workshop. In comparison to the use of other topic models for WSI, our system can explore additional useful information which is the relationship between senses of a word. The prospect of using CTM for discovering the correlation between senses of multiple words is also discussed at the end of this paper.

Analyses of past records can provide important information on those attacks and enable appropriate actions to prevent similar attacks in the future. In this research, we present a novel method based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation to analyze data collected by START (Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism) from 1970 to 2010. The first step in our method consists of generating topic models from the data. We then identify the most frequent terms occurring across various topic distributions. Moreover, we study the evolution of different kinds of attacks that occurred over time. The results show that a distinct change in attack patterns emerges over the past four decades.

The feature extraction algorithms encode the image, while an analysis of topic discovery will decode and send its content to the user in the shape of a semantic map. We consider this approach for a real meaning based semantic annotation of very high resolution remote sensing images. The scene content is described using a multi-level hierarchical information representation. Feature hierarchies are discovered considering that higher levels are formed by combining features from lower level. Such a level to level mapping defines our methodology as a deep learning process. The whole analysis can be divided in two major learning steps. The first one regards the Bayesian inference to extract objects and assign basic semantic to the image. The second step models the spatial interactions between the scene objects based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation, performing a high level semantic annotation. We used a WorldView2 image to exemplify the processing results.

The information in HRM complements a variety of other clinical metrics including electrocardiographic (ECG) measures. While the HRM approach has value, it suffers from a focus on identifying and using information related to only a small number of discriminative patterns in heart rate time series, which loses valuable information among the full set of patterns in the data. We present a method based on topic models, an approach traditionally used in text analysis, to learn structure in the full set of short heart rate patterns in long-term ECG recordings. This model provides an interpretable representation of long-term ECG recordings and finds relationships amongst all short heart rate patterns across the entire patient population. When evaluated on data from 4,557 patients admitted with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome, we show that heart rate topic models significantly improve risk stratification. This improvement is consistent even when considering information already available through the TIMI risk score and left ventricular ejection fraction, as well as several heart rate variability metrics.

Current approaches to document zone identification mostly rely on supervised machine learning methods, which require a large amount of annotated data, which is often difficult and expensive to obtain. In order to overcome this bottleneck, we propose graphical models based on the popular Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. The first model, which we call zoneLDA aims to cluster the sentences into zone classes using only unlabelled data. We also study an extension of zoneLDA called zoneLDAb, which makes distinction between common words and non-common words within the different zone types. We present results on two different domains: the scientific domain and the technical domain. For the latter one we propose a new document zone classification schema, which has been annotated over a collection of 689 documents, achieving a Kappa score of 85%. Overall our experiments show promising results for both of the domains, outperforming the baseline model. Furthermore, on the technical domain the performance of the models are comparable to the supervised approach using the same feature sets. We thus believe that graphical models are a promising avenue of research for automatic document zoning.

The heart of our algorithm is a probabilistic topic model that assumes that topics are multinomial distributions of words, and jointly learns the co-occurrence of textual words and the visual information in the video stream. Empirical results show that this alternate way of organizing query suggestions can better elucidate the high level query intent, and more effectively help a user meet his information need.

A speech segment in BOA is simply represented as a set of counts for unique arcs in a finite state machine. Similar to the Bag Of Words model (BOW), BOA disregards the order of arcs, and thus, efficiently models speech segments. A strong motivation to use BOA is provided by a fact that the BOA representation is tightly connected to the output of a Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based ASR decoder. Thus, BOA directly represents elements in the search network of a WFST-based ASR decoder, and can include information about context-dependent HMM topologies, lexicons, and back-off smoothed n-gram networks. In addition, the counts of BOA are accumulated by using the WFST decoder output directly, and we do not require an additional overhead and a change of decoding algorithms to extract the features. Consequently, we can combine the ASR decoder and post-processing without a process to extract word features from the decoder outputs or re-compiling WFST networks. We show the effectiveness of the proposed approach for some ASR post-processing applications in utterance classification experiments, and in speaker adaptation experiments by achieving absolute 1% improvement in WER from baseline results. We also show examples of latent semantic analysis for BOA by using latent Dirichlet allocation.

When we need to decide whether to purchase a product or not on line, the opinions of others become important. The convenience of new web technologies enables us to freely express our opinions and reviews for various products we have purchased which leads to a serious problem, information overloading. How to mine these review data to understand customers' preferences and make recommendations is crucial to merchants and researchers. Traditional collaborative filtering (CF) algorithm is one of the most successful recommendation system technologies. The core idea of CF algorithm is to recommend products based on other people who have similar tastes with target users. However, the ability of CF is limited by the sparsity problem, which is very common in reality. The reason derives from the fact that traditional CF method only takes users' ratings into account. In this paper, we propose a new personalized recommendation model, i.e. topic model based collaborative filtering (TMCF) utilizing users' reviews and ratings. We exploit extended LDA model to generate topic allocations for each review and then obtain each user's preference. Moreover, a new metric is designed to measure similarity between users alleviating the sparsity problem to a large extent. Finally, recommendations are made based on similar users' ratings. Experiments on seven data sets indicate better prediction accuracy than other traditional and state-of-the-art methods with substantial improvement in alleviating the sparsity problem.

Our approach does not rely on object tracking, and is robust to camera movements. We use sparse coding for classification, and test our approach on various datasets. Our proposed approach outperforms a state-of-the-art work which uses the social force model and Latent Dirichlet Allocation.

It provides high level knowledge to software stakeholders, helps them to make important decisions. Unfortunately, retrieving software maintenance history is a heavy manual work so it can be invalid or even misleading. This paper use topic models to organize software maintenance documents such as bug reports into topics. Event detection tool is adopted to identify maintenance events from these topics. Finally, the identified events reconstruct software maintenance history. Retrieval results on 100,000 Eclipse bug reports are in accordance with Eclipse history records.

Such inherent community structures make us deeply understand about the networks and therefore have drawn signi cant interests among researchers. This paper describes a probabilistic community detection algorithm by modeling topic on sampling subgraphs. In this algorithm, the communities are modeled as latent topic variables of an LDA topic model and the vertices of sampling subgraphs are drawn from these topics with different probabilities. This paper also proposes a subgraph sampling algorithm and explores its impact on community detection performance. Our algorithm is evaluated by extensive experiments using many computer-generated arti cial graphs and real-world networks. The results show that our algorithm is effective in detecting probabilistic community.

Traditional topic detection methods could not be applied due to the microblog short text features and structural characteristics. We taken advantage of availability of latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) to expand the text feature space, and used frequency statistics for our topic ranking, and improved it based on the microblog nontext element data and word element. We taken into account both the text context similarity and semantic similarity in order to make it possible that the traditional clustering method can make difference in the microblog text topic analysis.

We propose an improved feature with optical flow to build our bag of words. This feature is able to reduce the high dimension of the pure optical flow template and also has abundant motion information. Then, we use the topic model of pLSA (probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis) to classify human actions in a special way. We find that the existing methods lead to some mismatching of words due to the k-means clustering approach. To reduce the probability of mismatching, we add the spatial information to each word and improve the training and testing approach. Our approach of recognition is tested on two datasets, the KTH datasets and WEIZMANN datasets. The result shows its good performance.

However, object labeling is expensive and subjective in real applications. Thus, a hybrid semi-supervised topic model is proposed, which uses a small amount of labels to help the generative topic model find semantic topics and cluster the unlabeled data to the same class. We applied the model to obtain the semi-supervised LDA and pLSA methods. Experimental results on natural scene and head pose classification tasks show that the proposed method remains promising using only partial labels in the training process, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

As the emerge of food safety related multimedia data, topic analysis based on single media data can't obtain full topics, causing the problem of inadequacy of semantic. A cross-media topic analysis framework is proposed in this paper. Firstly, generative methods are used to get semantic of text and image data respectively. Then a visual topic learning algorithm is presented to construct visual topic model and map visual data to text topics. This method can solve the problem of consistent semantic description of cross-media data. On this basis, food safety topic tracking is achieved and experiment results also show its effectiveness.

Latent topic model-based group activity discovery	VISUAL COMPUTER			English	Article						Group activity; Surveillance; Topic models; Activity discovery		Surveillance videos of public places often consist of group activities composed from multiple co-occurring individual activities. However, latent topic models, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which have been successfully used to discover individual activities, do not discover group activities. In this paper we propose a method to discover group activities along with individual activities. We use a two layer latent structure where a latent variable is used to discover correlation of individual activities as a group activity using multinomial distribution. Each individual activity is in turn represented as a distribution over local visual features. We use a Gibbs sampling-based algorithm to jointly infer the individual and group activities. Our method can summarize not only the individual activities but also the common group activities in a video. We demonstrate the strength of our method by discovering activities and the salient correlation amongst them in real life videos of crowded public places.	[Faruquie, T.

J	Tang, H; Boujemaa, N; Chen, YH; Deng, L				Tang, Hong; Boujemaa, Nozha; Chen, Yunhao; Deng, Lei			Modeling loosely annotated images using both given and imagined annotations	OPTICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						image annotation; probabilistic latent semantic analysis; image retrieval	PICTURES	In this paper, we present an approach to learn latent semantic analysis models from loosely annotated images for automatic image annotation and indexing. The given annotation in training images is loose due to: 1. ambiguous correspondences between visual features and annotated keywords; 2. incomplete lists of annotated keywords. The second reason motivates us to enrich the incomplete annotation in a simple way before learning a topic model. In particular, some "imagined" keywords are poured into the incomplete annotation through measuring similarity between keywords in terms of their co-occurrence. Then, both given and imagined annotations are employed to learn probabilistic topic models for automatically annotating new images. We conduct experiments on two image databases (i.e., Corel and ESP) coupled with their loose annotations, and compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art discrete annotation methods. The proposed method improves word-driven probability latent semantic analysis (PLSA-words) up to a comparable performance with the best discrete annotation method, while a merit of PLSA-words is still kept, i.e., a wider semantic range.

Non-Parametric Estimation of Topic Hierarchies from Texts with Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						hierarchical Dirichlet processes; probabilistic topic models; topic distributions; ontology learning from text; topic hierarchy		This paper presents hHDP, a hierarchical algorithm for representing a document collection as a hierarchy of latent topics, based on Dirichlet process priors. The hierarchical nature of the algorithm refers to the Bayesian hierarchy that it comprises, as well as to the hierarchy of the latent topics. hHDP relies on nonparametric Bayesian priors and it is able to infer a hierarchy of topics, without making any assumption about the depth of the learned hierarchy and the branching factor at each level. We evaluate the proposed method on real-world data sets in document modeling, as well as in ontology learning, and provide qualitative and quantitative evaluation results, showing that the model is robust, it models accurately the training data set and is able to generalize on held-out data.

J	Baillie, M; Carman, M; Crestani, F				Baillie, Mark; Carman, Mark; Crestani, Fabio			A multi-collection latent topic model for federated search	INFORMATION RETRIEVAL			English	Article						Distributed information retrieval; Topic models; Retrieval; Collection selection	DATABASES	Collection selection is a crucial function, central to the effectiveness and efficiency of a federated information retrieval system. A variety of solutions have been proposed for collection selection adapting proven techniques used in centralised retrieval. This paper defines a new approach to collection selection that models the topical distribution in each collection. We describe an extended version of latent Dirichlet allocation that uses a hierarchical hyperprior to enable the different topical distributions found in each collection to be modelled. Under the model, resources are ranked based on the topical relationship between query and collection. By modelling collections in a low dimensional topic space, we can implicitly smooth their term-based characterisation with appropriate terms from topically related samples, thereby dealing with the problem of missing vocabulary within the samples. An important advantage of adopting this hierarchical model over current approaches is that the model generalises well to unseen documents given small samples of each collection. The latent structure of each collection can therefore be estimated well despite imperfect information for each collection such as sampled documents obtained through query-based sampling. Experiments demonstrate that this new, fully integrated topical model is more robust than current state of the art collection selection algorithms.

J	Jin, F; Huang, ML; Zhu, XY				Jin, Feng; Huang, Min-Lie; Zhu, Xiao-Yan			Guided Structure-Aware Review Summarization	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Review						structure-aware summarization; review mining; topic model; importance is modeled		Although the goal of traditional text summarization is to generate summaries with diverse information, most of those applications have no explicit definition of the information structure. Thus, it is difficult to generate truly structure-aware summaries because the information structure to guide summarization is unclear. In this paper, we present a novel framework to generate guided summaries for product reviews. The guided summary has an explicitly defined structure which comes from the important aspects of products. The proposed framework attempts to maximize expected aspect satisfaction during summary generation. The importance of an aspect to a generated summary is modeled using Labeled Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Empirical experimental results on consumer reviews of cars show the effectiveness of our method.

Multi-view methods for protein structure comparison using latent dirichlet allocation	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	19th Annual International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology/10th European Conference on Computational Biology	JUL 17-19, 2011	Vienna, AUSTRIA				STRUCTURE ALIGNMENT; CLASSIFICATION; PDB	Motivation: With rapidly expanding protein structure databases, efficiently retrieving structures similar to a given protein is an important problem. It involves two major issues: (i) effective protein structure representation that captures inherent relationship between fragments and facilitates efficient comparison between the structures and (ii) effective framework to address different retrieval requirements. Recently, researchers proposed vector space model of proteins using bag of fragments representation (FragBag), which corresponds to the basic information retrieval model. Results: In this article, we propose an improved representation of protein structures using latent dirichlet allocation topic model. Another important requirement is to retrieve proteins, whether they are either close or remote homologs. In order to meet diverse objectives, we propose multi-viewpoint based framework that combines multiple representations and retrieval techniques. We compare the proposed representation and retrieval framework on the benchmark dataset developed by Kolodny and co-workers.

J	Nguyen, VC; Nguyen, LM; Shimazu, A				Viet Cuong Nguyen; Le Minh Nguyen; Shimazu, Akira			Learning to Generate a Table-of-Contents with Supportive Knowledge	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						text summarization; supportive knowledge; semi-supervised learning		In the text summarization field, a table-of-contents is a type of indicative summary that is especially suited for locating information in a long document, or a set of documents. It is also a useful summary for a reader to quickly get an overview of the entire contents. The current models for generating a table-of-contents produced relatively low quality output with many meaningless titles, or titles that have no overlapping meaning with the corresponding contents. This problem may be due to the lack of semantic information and topic information in those models. In this research, we propose to integrate supportive knowledge into the learning models to improve the quality of titles in a generated table-of-contents. The supportive knowledge is derived from a hierarchical clustering of words, which is built from a large collection of raw text, and a topic model, which is directly estimated from the training data. The relatively good results of the experiments showed that the semantic and topic information supplied by supportive knowledge have good effects on title generation, and therefore, they help to improve the quality of the generated table-of-contents.

Our model combines a bag-of-words component with supervised latent topic models. A video sequence is represented as a collection of spatiotemporal words by extracting space-time interest points and describing these points using both shape and motion cues. The supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA) topic model, which employs discriminative learning using labeled data under a generative framework, is introduced to discover the latent topic structure that is most relevant to action categorization. The proposed algorithm retains most of the desirable properties of generative learning while increasing the classification performance though a discriminative setting. It has also been extended to exploit both labeled data and unlabeled data to learn human actions under a unified framework. We test our algorithm on three challenging data sets: the KTH human motion data set, the Weizmann human action data set, and a ballet data set. Our results are either comparable to or significantly better than previously published results on these data sets and reflect the promise of hybrid generative-discriminative learning approaches.

Although LDA has been mostly used as a strictly lexicalized approach, it can be effectively applicable to a much richer set of linguistic structures. A novel application of LDA is here presented that acquires suitable grammatical generalizations for semantic tasks tightly dependent on NL syntax. We show how the resulting topics represent suitable generalizations over syntactic structures and lexical information as well. The evaluation on two different classification tasks, such as predicate recognition and question classification, shows that state of the art results are obtained.

The number of topics in the model plays an important role in terms of accuracy. We consider the problem of estimating the number of topics. In [1], a convex optimization approach was proposed to solve the problem via a constrained nuclear norm minimization. A standard semidefinite programming (SDP) was applied to solve the convex optimization only for a small size problem (e. g. 100x 100 matrix) due to its high computational complexity. To extend the applicability of the approach to large scale problems, we propose an accelerated gradient algorithm (AGA). Numerical results show that proposed algorithm can reliably solve a wide range of large scale problems in a shorter time than SDP solvers. Moreover, algorithms applied to a fairly large size real world dataset and results are provided.

Such models provide a probabilistic framework for characterizing a corpus of documents (or images) in the bag-of-words representation. Key feature of such models is that a low dimensional representation is facilitated through latent topic variables. Most inference algorithms in topic models assume a fixed number of topics and determine the number of topics empirically. In this paper, we consider the problem of identifying the number of topics in topic models. We present a rank minimization framework and provide sufficient conditions, which guarantee exact recovery of the number of topics. Moreover, we propose a heuristic convex relaxation to the rank minimization. Using simulations, we show that the proposed convex relaxation provides exact rank recovery under the sufficient conditions proposed for the rank minimization problem.

A shared parts latent topic model is presented to share mixture components between categories. Different categories share the similar parts which make the model more accurate. As the number of components is unknown and is to be inferred from the train set, the Dirichlet process is introduced into the model to provide a nonparametric prior for the number of mixture components within each category.

Automatic knowledge extraction from manufacturing research publications	CIRP ANNALS-MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Management; Decision making; Document retrieval technique		Knowledge mining is a young and rapidly growing discipline aiming at automatically identifying valuable knowledge in digital documents. This paper presents the results of a study of the application of document retrieval and text mining techniques to extract knowledge from CIRP research papers. The target is to find out if and how such tools can help researchers to find relevant publications in a cluster of papers and increase the citation indices their own papers. Two different approaches to automatic topic identification are investigated. One is based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation of a huge document set, the other uses Wikipedia to discover significant words in papers. The study uses a combination of both approaches to propose a new approach to efficient and intelligent knowledge mining. (C) 2011 CIRP.

The approach is based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. The application of the LDA model is shown using a real dataset of occupancy logs from the sensor network of a modern office building. LDA is a generative and unsupervised probabilistic model for collections of discrete data. Continuous sequences of just binary sensor readings are segmented together in order to build the dataset discrete data (bag-of-words). Then, these bag-of-words are used to train the model with a fixed number of topics, also known as routines. Preliminary obtained results state that the LDA model successfully found latent topics over all rooms and therefore obtain the dominant occupancy patterns or routines on the sensor network.

We use labeled utterance information to capture latent topics, which directly correspond to semantic domains. Additionally, we introduce an 'informative prior' for Bayesian inference that can simultaneously segment utterances of known domains into classes and divide them from out-of-domain utterances. We show that our model generalizes well on the task of classifying spoken language utterances and compare its results to those of an unsupervised topic model, which does not use labeled information.

This study presents a new Bayesian nonparametric approach to conduct unsupervised learning of a hierarchical topic and sentence model (HTSM). This HTSM discovers an extended hierarchy in the nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP) where each sentence is assigned by a hierarchical topic path. A tree structure with distributions ranging from broad topics to precise topics is established. The dependencies among sentences are characterized. The words in different sentences are represented by a shared hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP). The topic mixtures in word level and sentence level are estimated according to unsupervised nonparametric processes based on HDP and nCRP, respectively. Compared with the nCRP representing a document based on a single path, the proposed HTSM is flexible with a new nCRP where multiple paths are incorporated to generate different sentences of a document. A summarization system is developed to extract semantically-rich sentences from documents. A new Gibbs sampling algorithm is developed to infer the structural parameters of HTSM. In the experiments on DUC corpus, the proposed HTSM outperforms the other methods for document summarization in terms of ROUGE measures.

The Bayesian learning is performed by incorporating the spike-and-slab priors so that the words with spiky distributions are filtered and those with slab distributions are selected as features for estimating the topic model (TM) based on latent Dirichlet allocation. The variational inference procedure is developed to train sTM parameters. In the experiments on document modeling using TM and sTM, we find that the proposed sTM does not only reduce the model perplexity but also reduce the memory and computation costs. Bayesian feature selection method does effectively identify the representative topic words for building a sparse learning model.

The most popular MCMC sampling algorithm for the hierarchical PDP and hierarchical Dirichlet Process is to conduct an incremental sampling based on the Chinese restaurant metaphor, which originates from the Chinese restaurant process (CRP). In this paper, with the same metaphor, we propose a new table representation for the hierarchical PDPs by introducing an auxiliary latent variable, called table indicator, to record which customer takes responsibility for starting a new table. In this way, the new representation allows full exchangeability that is an essential condition for a correct Gibbs sampling algorithm. Based on this representation, we develop a block Gibbs sampling algorithm, which can jointly sample the data item and its table contribution. We test this out on the hierarchical Dirichlet process variant of latent Dirichlet allocation (HDP-LDA) developed by Teh, Jordan, Beal and Blei. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms their "posterior sampling by direct assignment" algorithm in both out-of-sample perplexity and convergence speed. The representation can be used with many other hierarchical PDP models.

The fundamental problems facing SDR are generally three-fold: 1) a query is often only a vague expression of an underlying information need, 2) there probably would be word usage mismatch between a query and a spoken document even if they are topically related to each other, and 3) the imperfect speech recognition transcript carries wrong information and thus deviates somewhat from representing the true theme of a spoken document. To mitigate the above problems, in this paper, we study a novel use of a relevance language modeling framework for SDR. It not only inherits the merits of several existing techniques but also provides a flexible but systematic way to render the lexical and topical relationships between a query and a spoken document. Moreover, we also investigate representing the query and documents with different granularities of index features to work in conjunction with the Various relevance cues.

In particular, we learn the states, observations, as well as transition and observation functions based on a Bayesian latent topic model using unannotated human-human dialogues. As a matter of fact, we use the Bayesian latent topic model in order to learn the intentions behind user's utterances. Similar to recent dialogue POMDPs, we use the discovered user's intentions as the states of dialogue POMDPs. However, as opposed to previous works, instead of using some keywords as POMDP observations, we use some meta observations based on the learned user's intentions. As the number of meta observations is much less than the actual observations, i.e. the number of words in the dialogue set, the POMDP learning and planning becomes tractable. The experimental results on real dialogues show that the quality of the learned models increases by increasing the number of dialogues as training data. Moreover, the experiments based on simulation show that the introduced method is robust to the ASR noise level.

The choice of a knowledge base, as long as it is reduced to small domains, is still manageable in a semi-automatic mode. However, in wider contexts, where a higher scalability is required, a fully automatic procedure is needed. In this paper, we show how a procedure to extract an ontology from a collection of documents can be completely automatised by making use of an optimization procedure. To this aim, we have defined a suitable fitness function and we have employed a Random Mutation Hill-Climbing algorithm to explore the solution space in order to evolve a near-optimal solution. The experimental findings show that our method is effective.

Our approach utilizes latent Dirichlet allocation and time-varying dynamic latent Dirichlet allocation, with the goal of identifying significant co-occurrences of types of network traffic, these forming topics of user behavior. In our experiments, these topics of user behavior included: (i) web traffic, (ii) email client and instant messaging, (iii) Microsoft file access, (iv) email server, and (v) other miscellaneous traffic. Each identified behavior topic included a variety of different, but related, protocols without using any a priori knowledge of the purpose of the protocol. We believe that the techniques presented in this paper can be used to form more complex topics through the use of deep packet inspection, and that such topic models could prove useful in the identification of zero-day exploits or other network threats.

TopicView uses multiple linked views to visually analyze both the conceptual content and the document relationships in models generated using different algorithms. To illustrate TopicView, we apply it to models created using two standard approaches: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Conceptual content is compared through the combination of (i) a bipartite graph matching LSA concepts with LDA topics based on the cosine similarities of model factors and (ii) a table containing the terms for each LSA concept and LDA topic listed in decreasing order of importance. Document relationships are examined through the combination of (i) side-by-side document similarity graphs, (ii) a table listing the weights for each document's contribution to each concept/topic, and (iii) a full text reader for documents selected in either of the graphs or the table. We demonstrate the utility of TopicView's visual approach to model assessment by comparing LSA and LDA models of two example corpora.

Intuitively, there are two types of explicit grouping exists in research papers (I) authors who have co-authored with author A in one document (subgroup) and (2) authors who have co-authored with author A in all documents (group). Traditional methods use graph-link structure by using keywords based matching and ignored semantics-based information, while topic modeling considered semantics-based information but ignored both types of explicit grouping e.g. State-of-the-art Author-Topic model used only one kind of explicit grouping single document (subgroup) for finding author interest. In this paper, we introduce Group-Author-Topic (GAT) modeling which exploits both types of grouping simultaneously. We compare four different topic modeling methods for same task on large DBLP dataset. We provide three performance measures for method evaluation from different domains which are; perplexity, entropy, and prediction ranking accuracy. We show the trade of between these performance evaluation measures. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperformed the baselines in finding author interest. The trade of between used evaluation measures shows that they are equally useful for evaluating topic modeling methods.

Firstly, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model is used to reveal to the latent topical facets in texts. Then a two a two-layer conditional random fields is introduced to analyze sentiment of every topic in the texts. Empirical results show that this approach is effective for extracting subtopics and identifying sentiments of each topic.

In this paper, we apply a novel hierarchical topic model, which builds a multi-level image representation covers texture and semantic region, to image segmentation. Specifically, the proposed method firstly assigns texture-topic to each pixel according to the low-level model defines on visual word and neighboring constraint. Furthermore, inspired by the connection between image patch and linguistic sentence, we model semantic segments of natural scene as the combinations of texture topics. Finally, the segmentation result is achieved by finding homogeneous regions in topic field. Experimental results on natural scene images demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

However, point clouds are frequently subject to non-negligible amounts of sensor noise. In this paper, we analyze the effect on classification accuracy of noise added to both an artificial data set and data collected from a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) scanner, and show that topic models are less robust to 'misspelled' words than the more native k-means classifier. Furthermore, standard spin images prove to be a more robust feature under noise than their derivative, 'angular' spin images. We additionally show that only a small subset of local features are required in order to give comparable classification accuracy to a full feature set.

Usually a Blog page includes more than one theme. However the existing researches of multi-aspect sentiment analysis focus on the product reviews. In this paper, we propose a multi-aspect Chinese Blog sentiment analysis method based on LDA topic model and Hownet lexicon. At first, we use a Chinese Blog corpus to train a LDA topic model and identify the themes of this corpus. Then the LDA model which has been trained is used to segment the themes of Blog pages with paragraphs. After that the sentiment word tagging method based on Hownet is used to calculate the sentiment orientation of every Blog theme. So the sentiment orientation of the Blog pages can be represented by the sentiment orientation of multi-aspect Blog themes. The experiment results on SINA Blog dataset show our method not only gets good topic segments, but also improves the sentiment classification performance.

Topic models such as probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have shown great success in object recognition and localization. In this paper, we introduce a supervised topic model for region-based image annotation. Images are segmented into superpixels, and visual features are extracted from each superpixel region. Boosted classifiers are then trained for each class, and the output of boosted classifiers are quantized as boosted visual words. The proposed model builds a generative model on both visual words and corresponding class labels. We tested the model on the 21-class MSRC dataset. Experimental results show that our model improves the annotation performance comparing with boosted classifiers.

In specific, we propose a latent sentiment model (LSM) based on latent Dirichlet allocation where sentiment labels are considered as topics. Prior information extracted from English sentiment lexicons through machine translation are incorporated into LSM model learning, where preferences on expectations of sentiment labels of those lexicon words are expressed using generalized expectation criteria. An efficient parameter estimation procedure using variational Bayes is presented. Experimental results on the Chinese product reviews show that the weakly-supervised LSM model performs comparably to supervised classifiers such as Support vector Machines with an average of 81% accuracy achieved over a total of 5484 review documents.

In this paper, we present an approach that uses topic models to learn the distributions for non-terminals in each SCFG rule, based on which we further derive static features for the discriminative framework of statistical machine translation. Experimental results on three corpora show that we can obtain some gains in BLEU by using these features derived from topic models to alleviate the over-generation problem in hierarchical phrase-based translation.

The proposed method is based on particle-based trajectories, analyzed through a cascade of HMM and HDP-HMM models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for scene activity recognition task on a road intersection dataset.

The main advantage of our approach resides in the fact that labeling words is less expensive than labeling documents. We propose two methods, the first of which seeks to minimize the divergence between the distributions of the source domain, which contains labeled features, and the target domain, which contains only unlabeled data. The second method augments the labeled features set in an unsupervised way, via the discovery of a shared latent concept space between source and target. We empirically show that our approach outperforms standard supervised and semi-supervised methods, and obtains results competitive to those reported by state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods, while requiring considerably less supervision.

We address the novel task of discovering first-person action categories (which we call ego-actions) which can be useful for such tasks as video indexing and retrieval. In order to learn ego-action categories, we investigate the use of motion-based histograms and unsupervised learning algorithms to quickly cluster video content. Our approach assumes a completely unsupervised scenario, where labeled training videos are not available, videos are not pre-segmented and the number of ego-action categories are unknown. In our proposed framework we show that a stacked Dirichlet process mixture model can be used to automatically learn a motion histogram codebook and the set of ego-action categories. We quantitatively evaluate our approach on both in-house and public YouTube videos and demonstrate robust ego-action categorization across several sports genres. Comparative analysis shows that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art topic models with respect to both classification accuracy and computational speed. Preliminary results indicate that on average, the categorical content of a 10 minute video sequence can be indexed in under 5 seconds.

One of the advantages of Supervised-LDA over unsupervised LDA is that it can potentially learn topics that are inline with the class label. The variational Bayes algorithm proposed in [1] for inference in Supervised-LDA suffers from high computational complexity. To address this issue, we develop computationally efficient inference methods for Supervised-LDA. Specifically, we present collapsed variational Bayes and MAP inference for parameter estimation in Supervised-LDA. Additionally, we present computationally efficient inference methods to determine the label of unlabeled data. We provide an empirical evaluation of the classification performance and computational complexity (training as well as classification run-time) of different inference methods for the Supervised-LDA model and a classifier based on probabilistic latent semantic analysis.

Our approach automatically chooses a document explaining a given newly coined word among candidate documents from multiple web references using Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis [1]. Briefly, it involves finding the topic of a document containing the newly coined word and computing the conditional probability of the topic given each candidate document. We validate our methodology with two real datasets from MySpace forums and Twitter by referencing three web services, Google, Urbandictionary, and Wikipedia, and we show that we properly recommend the meanings of a set of given newly coined words with 69.5% and 80.5% accuracies based on our three recommendations, respectively. Moreover, we compare our approach against three baselines where one references the result from each web service and our approach outperforms them. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Language recognition is then performed in a low dimensional simplex defined by the latent topics. We apply the Bhattacharyya measure to compute the n-gram similarity in the topic simplex. Our study shows that some of the latent topics are language specific while others exhibit multilingual characteristic. Experiment conducted on the NIST 2007 language detection task shows that language cues can be sufficiently preserved in the topic simplex.

Dirichlet Compound Multinomial Latent Dirichlet Allocation (DCMLDA) introduces this word burstiness mechanism into Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). However, in DCMLDA, there is no restriction on the word burstiness intensity of each topic. Consequently, as shown in this paper, the burstiness intensities of words in major topics will become extremely low and the topics' ability to represent different semantic meanings will be impaired. In order to get topics that represent semantic meanings of documents well, we introduce constraints on topics' word burstiness intensities. Experiments demonstrate that DCMLDA with constrained word burstiness intensities achieves better performance than the original one without constraints. Besides, these additional constraints help to reveal the relationship between two key properties inherited from DCM and LDA respectively. These two properties have a great influence on the combined model's performance and their relationship revealed by this paper is an important guidance for further study of topic models.

The proposed model follows the bag-of-word framework like the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model. The traditional Latent Dirichlet Allocation model for scene recognition only uses the orderless bag of features called global features without considering spatial constraints on these features. Different from this model, our proposed model can combine both global features and local region features for improving the recognition performance. In our method, local region features are gotten by adding a simple spatial constraint on the orderless bag of features. Experiments on three scene datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

Learning Better Image Representations Using 'Flobject Analysis'	2011 IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION (CVPR)	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)	JUN 20-25, 2011	Colorado Springs, CO	IEEE				Unsupervised learning can be used to extract image representations that are useful for various and diverse vision tasks. After noticing that most biological vision systems for interpreting static images are trained using disparity information, we developed an analogous framework for unsupervised learning. The output of our method is a model that can generate a vector representation or descriptor from any static image. However, the model is trained using pairs of consecutive video frames, which are used to find representations that are consistent with optical flow-derived objects, or 'flobjects'. To demonstrate the flobject analysis framework, we extend the latent Dirichlet allocation bag-of-words model to account for real-valued word-specific flow vectors and image-specific probabilistic associations between flow clusters and topics. We show that the static image representations extracted using our method can be used to achieve higher classification rates and better generalization than standard topic models, spatial pyramid matching and gist descriptors.

However, the traditional PLSA method considers each image (document) independently, which would often be conflict with the real occasion. In this paper, we presents an improved PLSA model, named Correlated Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (C-PLSA). Different from PLSA, the topics of the given image are modeled by the images that are related to it. In our method, each image is represented by bag-of-visual-words. With this representation, we calculate the cosine similarity between each pair of images to capture their correlations. Then we use our C-PLSA model to generate K latent topics and Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is utilized for parameter estimation. Based on the latent topics, image clustering is carried out according to the estimated conditional probabilities. Extensive experiments are conducted on the publicly available database. The comparison results show that our approach is superior to the traditional PLSA for image clustering.

This overlay supports similarity search with its locality-preserving feature based on modified Skip Graph and HSFC (Hilbert Space Filling Curve).

Since speakers generally express their intents in different styles, the responses of an SDS should be versatile instead of invariable, planned responses. Moreover, the IS of dialogue turns can be affected by dialogue topics and speakers' emotional states. In this study, three base-level classifiers are employed for preliminary detection, including latent Dirichlet allocation for dialogue topic categorization, support vector machine for prosody-based emotional state identification and maximum entropy for semantic label-based emotional state identification. Finally, an artificial neural network is adopted for IS detection considering the scores estimated from the aforementioned classifiers. To evaluate the proposed approach, an SDS in a chatting domain was constructed for evaluation. The performance of IS detection can achieve 82.67%.

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is an approach trying to capture the semantic dependencies among words. However, using as document representation. LDA has no successful applications in information retrieval (IR). In this paper, we propose a single-document-based LDA (SLDA) document model for IR. The proposed work has been evaluated on four TREC collections, which shows that SLDA document modeling method is comparable to the state-of-the-art language modeling approaches. and it's a novel way to use LDA model to improve retrieval performance.

In order obtain statistical insight into the underlying patterns of motions in activities, we propose a supervised dynamic, hierarchical Bayesian model which connects low-level visual features in videos with poses, motion patterns and classes of activity. Our proposed generative model harnesses both the temporal ordering power of dynamic Bayesian networks such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and the automatic clustering power of hierarchical Bayesian models such as the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. We demonstrate the strength of this model by profiling different activities in scenes of varying complexities, by clustering visual events into poses which in turn are clustered into motion patterns. The model also correlates these motion patterns over time in order to define the signatures for classes of activities. We test our model on several publicly available datasets and achieve high accuracy rates.

Query reformulation based on the query clustering approach addresses this issue by expanding a new query with related existing queries that were generated by other users. However, the query clustering approach is unable to cluster queries that are intrinsically related but neither contain common terms nor return common clicked Web page URLs. More importantly, it does not address the issue of ranking retrieved results according to their relevance to the search goal. In this paper, we present new query reformulation approach based on a novel probabilistic topic model to discovering the latent semantic relationships between the queries and the URLs. It can not only discover related queries that cannot be clustered by existing query clustering approaches but also rank retrieved results according to the similarities of probability distributions over the latent topics among the queries and the URLs. The results of our experiments have shown that this approach can significantly improve the performance of an informational search task in terms of search accuracy and search efficiency.

Our aim is to improve the generalization power of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) by using document timestamps. Many previous works model topical trends by making latent topic distributions time-dependent. We propose a straightforward approach by preparing a different word multinomial distribution for each time point. Since this approach increases the number of parameters, overfitting becomes a critical issue. Our contribution to this issue is two-fold. First, we propose an effective way of defining Dirichlet priors over the word multinomials. Second, we propose a special scheduling of variational Bayesian (VB) inference. Comprehensive experiments with six datasets prove that our approach can improve LDA and also Topics over Time, a well-known variant of LDA, in terms of test data perplexity in the framework of VB inference.

Our input data is a large scale set of bibliographic references each given as an unsegmented sequence of word tokens. Our problem is to segment each reference into bibliographic elements, e.g. authors, title, journal, pages, etc. We solve this problem with an LDA-like topic model by assigning each word token to a topic so that the word tokens assigned to the same topic refer to the same bibliographic element. Topic assignments should satisfy contiguity constraint, i.e., the constraint that the word tokens assigned to the same topic should be contiguous. Therefore, we proposed a topic model in our preceding work [8] based on the topic model devised by Chen et al. [3]. Our model extends LDA and realizes unsupervised topic assignments satisfying contiguity constraint. The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of a semi-supervised learning for our proposed model. We assume that at most one third of word tokens are already labeled. In addition, we assume that a few percent of the labels may be incorrect. The experiment showed that our semi-supervised learning improved the unsupervised learning by a large margin and achieved an over 90% segmentation accuracy.

Our problem is to segment a word token sequence representing a citation into subsequences each corresponding to a different bibliographic element, e.g. authors, paper title, journal name, publication year, etc. Obviously, each bibliographic element should be represented by contiguous word tokens. We call this constraint contiguity constraint. Therefore, we should infer a sequence of assignments of word tokens to bibliographic elements so that this constraint is satisfied. Many HMM-based methods solve this problem by prescribing fixed transition patterns among bibliographic elements. In this paper, we use generalized Mallows models (GMM) in a Bayesian multi-topic model, effectively applied to document structure learning by Chen et al. [4], and infer a permutation of latent topics each of which can be interpreted as one among the bibliographic elements. According to the inferred permutation, we arrange the order of the draws from a multinomial distribution defined over topics. In this manner, we can obtain an ordered sequence of topic assignments satisfying contiguity constraint. We do riot need to prescribe any transition patterns among bibliographic elements. We only need to specify the number of bibliographic elements. However, the method proposed by Chen et al. works for our problem only after introducing modification. The main contribution of this paper is to propose strategies to make their method work also for our problem.

Concept identification is fundamental to program comprehension, software maintenance, and evolution. Different static, dynamic, and hybrid approaches for concept identification exist in the literature. Both static and dynamic techniques have advantages and limitations. In fact, they can be considered to complement each other. Indeed, recent works focused on hybrid techniques to improve the performance in time as well as accuracy (i.e., precision and recall) of the concept location process. Furthermore, sometimes only a single execution trace is available, however, to the best of our knowledge, only few works attempt to automatically identify concepts in a single execution trace. We propose an approach built upon a dynamic-programming algorithm to split an execution trace into segments likely representing concepts. The approach improves performance and scalability with respect to currently available techniques. We also plan to use techniques derived from Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to automatically assign meanings to segments.

The robot uses its physical embodiment to grasp and observe an object from various view points, as well as to listen to the sound during the observing period. This multimodal information is used for categorizing and forming multimodal concepts using multimodal LDA. At the same time, the words acquired during the observing period are connected to the related concepts, which are represented by the multimodal LDA. We also provide a relevance measure that encodes the degree of connection between words and modalities. The proposed algorithm is implemented on a robot platform and some experiments are carried out to evaluate the algorithm. We also demonstrate simple conversation between a user and the robot based on the learned model.

The resulting amount of data associated with users of social networks has created great opportunities for data mining problems. One data mining problem of interest for social networks is the friendship link prediction problem. Intuitively, a friendship link between two users can be predicted based on their common friends and interests. However, using user interests directly can be challenging, given the large number of possible interests. In the past, approaches that make use of an explicit user interest ontology have been proposed to tackle this problem, but the construction of the ontology proved to be computationally expensive and the resulting ontology was not very useful. As an alternative, we propose a topic modeling approach to the problem of predicting new friendships based on interests and existing friendships. Specifically, we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to model user interests and, thus, we create an implicit interest ontology. We construct features for the link prediction problem based on the resulting topic distributions. Experimental results on several LiveJournal data sets of varying sizes show the usefulness of the LDA features for predicting friendships.

J	Perina, A; Jojic, N			IEEE	Perina, Alessandro; Jojic, Nebojsa			Image analysis by counting on a grid	2011 IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION (CVPR)	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)	JUN 20-25, 2011	Colorado Springs, CO	IEEE				In recent object/scene recognition research images or large image regions are often represented as disorganized "bags" of image features. This representation allows direct application of models of word counts in text. However, the image feature counts are likely to be constrained in different ways than word counts in text. As a camera pans upwards from a building entrance over its first few floors and then above the penthouse to the backdrop formed by the mountains, and then further up into the sky, some feature counts in the image drop while others rise - only to drop again giving way to features found more often at higher elevations (Fig. 1). The space of all possible feature count combinations is constrained by the properties of the larger scene as well as the size and the location of the window into it. Accordingly, our model is based on a grid of feature counts, considerably larger than any of the modeled images, and considerably smaller than the real estate needed to tile the images next to each other tightly. Each modeled image is assumed to have a representative window in the grid in which the sum of feature counts mimics the distribution in the image. We provide learning procedures that jointly map all images in the training set to the counting grid and estimate the appropriate local counts in it. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the resulting representation captures the space of feature count combinations more accurately than the traditional models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation, even when modeling images of different scenes from the same category.

As people rely more on portable devices for performing search, it becomes increasingly important to analyze user queries in order to achieve more targetted results over a broad set of search entities. While most previous work has relied on lexico-syntactic features and handcrafted knowledge sources, this paper investigates methods for learning latent semantic features from unlabelled user-generated content. We extract word-topic associations by training a Latent Dirichlet Allocation model on a corpus of online reviews, and show that this information improves named-entity classification performance over broad domain search queries. We believe that topical features provide a rich source of information from data with minimal manual effort, and no dependency on a specific language.

However, there are still many challenges that can affect the quality of artifact-based studies, especially those studies examining software evolution. Large commits, which we refer to as "Cliff Walls," are one significant threat to studies of software evolution because they do not appear to represent incremental development. We used Latent Dirichlet Allocation to extract topics from over 2 million commit log messages, taken from 10,000 Source Forge projects. The topics generated through this method were then analyzed to determine the causes of over 9,000 of the largest commits. We found that branch merges, code imports, and auto-generated documentation were significant causes of large commits. We also found that corrective maintenance tasks, such as bug fixes, did not play a significant role in the creation of large commits.

Automatically generating the description of the videos from the Web is a hard task. In this paper, we propose a method which utilizes the titles of videos and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a hidden topic model, to generate pseudo-descriptions for videos. In our method, we first evaluate video titles' expression ability. The title which has enough information to outline the video it belongs to will be send to the trained LDA to get its topic distributions. Using the topic distributions and word-topic distributions gotten from the LDA, we get the most likely words that belong to the video as its pseudo-description. In experiments, 62305 Chinese automotive video titles are crawled from web for testing our method. The generated descriptions of videos are evaluated manually. The result shows that the pseudo-descriptions can describe the videos to some extent, and this method provides a promising way for automatically generating descriptions of the Web videos.

Until now, the secretion mechanism has not been fully understood yet. Recently, a lot of emphasis has been put on identifying type III secreted effectors (T3SE) in order to uncover the signal and principle that guide the secretion process. However, the amino acid sequences of T3SEs have great sequence diversity through fast evolution and many T3SEs have no homolog in the public databases at all. Therefore, it is notoriously challenging to recognize T3SEs. In this paper, we use amino acid sequence features to predict T3SEs, and conduct feature reduction using a topic model. The experimental results on Pseudomonas syringae data set demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively reduce the features and improve the prediction accuracy at the same time.

Since complex questions are investigated by many researches, how to acquire accurate answers still becomes a core problem for complex QA. In this paper, we propose an approach that estimates the similarity by topic model. After summarizing relevant texts from web knowledge bases, an answer sentence acquisition model based on Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis is introduced to seek sentences, in which the topic is similar to those in definition set. Then, an answer ranking model is employed to select both statistically and semantically similar sentences between sentences retrieved and sentences in the relevant text set. Finally, sentences are ranked as answer candidates according to their scores. Experiments show that our approach achieves an increase of 5.19% F-score than the baseline system.

However the online EM algorithm is restricted to models in which an analytical expectation can be computed for the E-step. In this paper, we show that a new algorithm called the simulated online EM algorithm may be applied to a broad class of models used in signal processing and machine learning. These models, which are characterized by the presence of latent (or unobserved) positive factors, include in particular probabilistic variants of Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). We provide the main convergence properties of the simulated online EM algorithm and detail its application to the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model.

A collapsed Gibbs sampler is. derived for batch learning with labeled training dataset and an efficient learning method for testing data is also discussed. We describe the resulting temporal latent topic model (TLTM) in detail and show how it can be applied to facial expression recognition. Experiments on CMU expression database illustrate that the proposed TLTM is very efficient in facial expression recognition.

Songs are generally classified according to genres, which don't entirely reflect sentiments. Thus, we require an unsupervised scheme to mine them. Sentiments are classified into either two (positive/negative) or multiple (happy/angry/sad/...) classes, depending on the application. We are interested in analyzing the feelings invoked by a song, involving multi-class sentiments. To mine the hidden sentimental structure behind a song, in terms of "topics", we consider its lyrics and use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Each song is a mixture of moods. Topics mined by LDA can represent moods. Thus we get a scheme of collecting similar-mood songs. For validation, we use a dataset of songs containing 6 moods annotated by users of a particular website.	[Sharma, Govind; Murty, M.

The proposed method, named semi-supervised canonical density estimation, makes use of unlabeled sound data in two ways: 1) a low-dimensional latent space representing topics of sounds is extracted by a semi-supervised variant of canonical correlation analysis, and 2) topic models are learned by multi-class extension of semi-supervised kernel density estimation in the topic space. Real-world audio tagging experiments indicate that our proposed method improves the accuracy even when only a small number of labeled sounds are available.

J	Tang, YJ				Tang Yingjun			THE VARIANT OF LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION FOR NATURAL SCENE CLASSIFICATION	COMPUTING AND INFORMATICS			English	Article						LDA; CCLDA; topic; visual visterm; scene classification		The paper proposes a novel model based on classic LDA (latent Dirichlet allocation), which is used to learn and recognize natural scene category. Uunlike previous work, the model performs variational Bayesian inference (VB) two times in order to get more precise prior Dirichlet parameters for each scene category. Although the scenes is represented in common topic simplex, the model has retained the diversities of each scene category based on the same topic simplex. Furthermore, two discriminations have been clone to get good performance. We investigated the classification performance with classic 13 scenes image database and the experiments had demonstrated that our method can get better performance with less training time.

It is, however, not widely used due to the low precision of speech recognizers when applied to conversations. To solve this problem, we propose a method that uses a topic model to reduce incorrectly recognized words. Specifically, we measure relevancy between a term and the other words in the conversation and remove those that come below the threshold. An audio lifelog search system was implemented using the method. Experiments showed that our method is effective in compensating recognition errors of speech recognizers. We observed increase in both precision and recall. The results indicate that our method has an ability to reduce errors in the index of a lifelog search system.

We propose the use of statistical topic models to automatically discover structure in these textual repositories. This discovered structure has the potential to be used in software engineering tasks, such as bug prediction and traceability link recovery. Our research goal is to address the challenges of applying topic models to software repositories.

Almost previous works on unsupervised text segmentation are based on the assumption of lexical cohesion, which is indicated by relations between words in the two units of text. However, they only take into account the reiteration, which is a category of lexical cohesion, such as word repetition, synonym or superordinate. In this research, we investigate the non-systematic semantic relation, which is classified as collocation in lexical cohesion. This relation holds between two words or phrases in a discourse when they pertain to a particular theme or topic. This relation has been recognized via a topic model, which is, in turn, acquired from a large collection of texts. The experimental results on the public dataset show the advantages of our approach in comparison to the available unsupervised approaches.

The bilingual Latent Dirichlet Allocation model (BiLDA) creates an interlingual representation, which can be used as a translation resource in many different multilingual settings as comparable corpora are available for many language pairs. The probabilistic interlingual representation is incorporated in a statistical language model for information retrieval.

In particular, stochastic optimization of the variational Bayes (VB) objective function with a natural gradient step was proved to converge and able to process massive document collections. To reduce noise in the gradient estimation, it considers multiple documents chosen uniformly at random. While it is widely recognized that the scheduling of documents in stochastic optimization may have significant consequences, this issue remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address this issue. Specifically, we propose residual LDA, a novel, easy-to-implement, LDA approach that schedules documents in an informed way. Intuitively, in each iteration, residual LDA actively selects documents that exert a disproportionately large influence on the current residual to compute the next update. On several real-world datasets, including 3M articles from Wikipedia, we demonstrate that residual LDA can handily analyze massive document collections and find topic models as good or better than those found with batch VB and randomly scheduled VB, and significantly faster.

They can be used for query expansion and result structuring in information retrieval and as an important component in services such as recommender systems and user adaptive advertising. In large scale applications both the size of the database (number of documents) and the size of the vocabulary can be significant challenges. Here we discuss two mechanisms that can make scalable solutions possible in the face of large document databases and large vocabularies. The first issue is addressed by a parallel distributed implementation, while the vocabulary problem is reduced by use of large and carefully curated term set. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed system and in the process break a previously claimed 'world record' announced April 2010 both by speed and size of problem. We show that the use of a WordNet derived vocabulary can identify topics at par with a much larger case specific vocabulary.

Unlike existing approaches, the proposed model is able to handle "noisy" links, i.e., observed links between nodes for which there is limited or no similarity in the associated text. This decoupling between links and text is made possible by incorporating random effects in the probabilistic model, and leads to improved text modeling and link prediction performance. The model allows efficient inference using fully conjugate Gibbs sampling, obviating the need for any maximum-likelihood parameter setting. Experiments are conducted using scientific paper citation and co-authorship network datasets, with the proposed approach outperforming previous state-of-the-art results.

This paper presents an approach to detect visual interesting regions in aerial video using pLSA topic model. Traditional interesting region detection approaches just use bottom-up information, such as color, orientation and movement etc. Our proposed method can discover the semantic content of the whole image, the co-occurrence of local image patches via pLSA model, and consequently improve detection result significantly in real world scenes. First, we extract frames from aerial video as documents. Then we use vector quantized SIFT descriptors as words. Third, we discover topics (e. g. plants, roads, buildings) and the relation among them using pLSA model. Finally, we can detect interesting regions as we need according to calculated models. Experimental observations show the success of our approach on interesting region detection in aerial video.

In this paper, we present a method of extraction using a topical N-gram model with a background distribution (TNB). Unlike most topic models, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which relies on the bag-of-words assumption, our model treats words in their textual order. Each news report is represented as a combination of a background distribution over the corpus and a mixture distribution over hidden news threads. Thus our model can model "presidential election" of different years as a background phrase and "Obama wins" as a thread for event "2008 USA presidential election". We apply our method on two different corpora. Evaluation based on human judgment shows that the model can generate meaningful and interpretable threads from a news corpus.

In this paper, we present a new approach to lyric emotion regression. We first build a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model from a large corpus of unlabeled lyrics. Based on the model, we can infer the latent topic probabilities of lyrics. Based on the latent topic probabilities of labeled lyrics, we devise a scheme for training and integrating emotion regression models, in which separate models are trained for latent topics and the outputs of those models are combined to get the final regression result. Experimental results show that this scheme can effectively improve the emotion regression accuracy.

User modeling, building a model for user's interests, is a key problem in many social networking applications, such as recommendation, advertisement, etc. This paper focuses on data selection for user modeling in Twitter-like services. That is, we study the problem of how to select useful data to model a user's interests. Using different data, three user modeling methods are proposed and experiments on a real Twitter-like service are conducted to verify the effectiveness of proposed approaches. Experimental results shows that modeling user's interests with what he/she wrote and selectively what he read performs the best among the three methods we proposed.

In this paper, we propose a new 4-dimensional (4D) local spatio-temporal feature that combines both intensity and depth information. The feature detector applies separate filters along the 3D spatial dimensions and the 1D temporal dimension to detect a feature point. The feature descriptor then computes and concatenates the intensity and depth gradients within a 4D hyper cuboid, which is centered at the detected feature point, as a feature. For recognizing human activities, Latent Dirichlet Allocation with Gibbs sampling is used as the classifier. Experiments are performed on a newly created database that contains six human activities, each with 33 samples with complex variations.

It has been well-used and achieved a lot of success in modeling English documents. However, unlike English and the majority of alphabetic languages. the basic structural unit of Chinese language is character instead of word, and Chinese words are written without spaces between them. Most previous research of using topic models for Chinese documents did not take the Chinese character-word relationship into consideration and simply take the Chinese word as the basic term of documents. In this paper, we propose a novel model to consider the character-word relation into topic modeling by placing an asymmetric prior on the topic-word distribution of the standard Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. Compared to LDA, this model can improve performance in document classification especially when test data contains considerable number of Chinese words not appeared in training data.

How to organize these existing computer audit methods and use them intelligently have become a fundamental and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose to use topic-driven clustering methods to organize computer audit methods according to the system of computer audit methods that is issued by the National Audit Office of China. We also apply Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) analysis to audit method datasets at different levels of granularity. Our experimental results on social insurance computer audit methods show that the topic-driven clustering scheme with topics created by domain experts is the overall best scheme. It achieved an average purity of 0.862 across the datasets. Topics discovered by LDA were consistent with classes defined in the taxonomy for four out of five datasets, and they were effective when used in the topic-driven clustering scheme.

Different from existing approaches of learning semantic regions either from optical flows or from complete trajectories, our model assumes that fragments of trajectories (called tracklets) are observed in crowded scenes. In advances the existing Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model, by integrating the Markov random fields (MRF) as prior to enforce the spatial and temporal coherence between tracklets during the learning process. Two kinds of MRF, pairwise MRF and the forest of randomly spanning trees, are defined. Another contribution of this model is to include sources and sinks as high-level semantic prior, which effectively improves the learning of semantic regions and the clustering of tracklets. Experiments on a large scale data set, which includes 40,000+ tracklets collected from the crowded New York Grand Central station, show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods both on qualitative results of learning semantic regions and on quantitative results of clustering tracklets.

Flickr is one of Web resources, which is used to share photos. Complex event detection on Flickr includes the detection of tourist features, user's interest, and so on. With the increasing user requirements of efficient and personalized services, the detection of scene features in Flickr is urgently needed. In this paper we propose a novel method to detect tourist features of every scene, and its difference in different seasons as a probabilistic combination of tags. The use of topic models enables the automatic detection of such patterns, which can translate unstructured tag information into structured event form. The experimental evaluation using real datasets in Flickr show the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method.

However, they ignore relationships among objects. In this paper. two types of relationships between objects, topic based similarity and word based similarity, are combined together to improve the performance of a ranking model. The two types of similarities are calculated using LDA and tf-idf methods, respectively. A novel ranking function is constructed based on the similarity information. Traditional gradient descent algorithm is used to train the ranking function. Experimental results prove that the proposed ranking function has better performance than the traditional ranking function and the ranking function only incorporating word based similarity between documents.

Scientific impact is measured by the biased PageRank score toward topics created by the latent topic model. The TEF metric considers the impact of an academic entity in multiple granular views as well as in a global view. Experiments on a computational linguistics corpus show that the method is a useful and promising measure to assess scientific impact.

J	Sun, H; Wang, C; Wang, BL; El-Sheimy, N				Sun, Hao; Wang, Cheng; Wang, Boliang; El-Sheimy, Naser			Unsupervised video-based lane detection using location-enhanced topic models	OPTICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						lane detection; shape descriptor; unsupervised learning; topic models	FEATURES; TRACKING	An unsupervised learning algorithm based on topic models is presented for lane detection in video sequences observed by uncalibrated moving cameras. Our contributions are twofold. First, we introduce the maximally stable extremal region (MSER) detector for lane-marking feature extraction and derive a novel shape descriptor in an affine invariant manner to describe region shapes and a modified scale-invariant feature transform descriptor to capture feature appearance characteristics. MSER features are more stable compared to edge points or line pairs and hence provide robustness to lane-marking variations in scale, lighting, viewpoint, and shadows. Second, we proposed a novel location-enhanced probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) topic model for simultaneous lane recognition and localization. The proposed model overcomes the limitation of a pLSA model for effective topic localization. Experimental results on traffic sequences in various scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. (C) 2010 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

Additionally, in order to employ an approach based on bag-of-features, language models represented by pLSA and LDA (Latent Dirichlet, Allocation) have to be applied to. These are unsupervised learning, but they require the number of latent topics to be set manually. In this study, in order to perform the LDA without specifying the number of the latent topics, and also to deal with multiple words concurrently, we propose unsupervised Multiple Instances Hierarchical Dirichlet Process MI-HDP-LDA by employing the local information concurrently. The proposed method, unsupervised MI-HDP-LDA, was evaluated for Weizmann dataset.

J	Bahrani, M; Sameti, H				Bahrani, Mohammad; Sameti, Hossein			A New Bigram-PLSA Language Model for Speech Recognition	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS; PROBABILITIES	A novel method for combining bigram model and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) is introduced for language modeling. The motivation behind this idea is the relaxation of the "bag of words" assumption fundamentally present in latent topic models including the PLSA model. An EM-based parameter estimation technique for the proposed model is presented in this paper. Previous attempts to incorporate word order in the PLSA model are surveyed and compared with our new proposed model both in theory and by experimental evaluation. Perplexity measure is employed to compare the effectiveness of recently introduced models with the new proposed model. Furthermore, experiments are designed and carried out on continuous speech recognition (CSR) tasks using word error rate (WER) as the evaluation criterion. The superiority of the new bigram-PLSA model over Nie et al.'s bigram-PLSA and simple PLSA models is demonstrated in the results of our experiments. Experiments on BLLIP WSJ corpus show about 12% reduction in perplexity and 2.8% WER improvement compared to Nie et al.'s bigram-PLSA model.

The proposed technique first performs topic decomposition (TD) on the combined dataset of domain-specific and general-domain data. Then it derives latent topic distribution of the interested domain, and derives domain-specific word n-gram counts with a PLSA style mixture model. Finally, it uses traditional n-gram modeling to construct domain-specific LMs from the domain-specific word n-gram counts. Experimental results show that this technique outperforms both states-of-the-art relative entropy text selection and traditional supervised training methods.

A significant step forward in this regard was made by Hofmann[3], who presented the probabilistic LSI (PLSI) model, as an alternative to LSI. If we wish to consider exchangeable representations for documents and words, PLSI is not successful which further led to the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model [4]. A new local Latent Semantic Indexing method has been proposed by some authors called "Local Relevancy Ladder-Weighted LSI" (LRLW-LSI) to improve text classification [5]. In this paper we study LSI and its variants in detail, analyze the role played by them in text classification and conclude with future directions in this area.

This problem deals with obtaining one or several topics for each transcribed, possibly noisy, sentence of the user. In this work, we apply the recent unsupervised learning method, Hidden Topic Markov Models (HTMM), for finding the intention of the user in dialogues. This technique combines two methods of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in order to learn topics of documents. We show that HTMM can be also used for obtaining intentions for the noisy transcribed sentences of the user in spoken dialogue systems. We argue that in this way we can learn possible states in a speech domain which can be used in the design stage of its spoken dialogue system. Furthermore, we discuss that the learned model can be augmented and used in a POMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) dialogue manager of the spoken dialogue system.

However, the lack of context information in short queries makes some classical named entity recognition (NER) algorithms fail. In this paper, we propose to utilize the search session information before a query as its context to address this limitation. We propose to improve two classical NER solutions by utilizing the search session context, which are known as Conditional Random Field (CRF) based solution and Topic Model based solution respectively. In both approaches, the relationship between current focused query and previous queries in the same session are used to extract novel context aware features. Experimental results on real user search session data show that the NERQ algorithms using search session context performs significantly better than the algorithms using only information of the short queries.

Their effectiveness, however, depends on the size of the domain that they cover. The main bottleneck in expanding the classifier domain is the degradation in accuracy as the number of classes increase. Here we introduce a hierarchical classification process that aims to scale up the domain without compromising the accuracy. We propose to exploit the categorical associations that naturally appear in the training data to split the domain into sub-domains with fewer classes. We use two methods of language model based classification and topic modeling with latent Dirichlet allocation to use the discourse information for sub-domain detection. The classification task is performed in two steps. First the best category for the discourse is detected using one of the above methods. Then a sub-domain classifier limited to that category is deployed. Empirical results from our experiments show higher accuracy for the proposed method compared to a single layered classifier.

A vast majority of existing coupling metrics rely on structural information, which captures interactions such as usage relations between classes and methods or execute after associations. However, these metrics lack the ability to identify conceptual dependencies, which, for instance, specify underlying relationships encoded by developers in identifiers and comments of source code classes. We propose a new coupling metric for object-oriented software systems, namely Relational Topic based Coupling (RTC) of classes, which uses Relational Topic Models (RTM), generative probabilistic model, to capture latent topics in source code classes and relationships among them. A case study on thirteen open source software systems is performed to compare the new measure with existing structural and conceptual coupling metrics. The case study demonstrates that proposed metric not only captures new dimensions of coupling, which are not covered by the existing coupling metrics, but also can be used to effectively support impact analysis.

We formed topic clusters by a hard-clustering method assigning one topic to one document based on the maximum number of words chosen from a topic for that document in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) analysis. The new weighting idea is that the unigram count of the topic generated by hard-clustering is used to compute the mixture weights instead of using an LDA latent topic word count used in the literature. Our approach shows significant perplexity and word error rate (WER) reduction against the existing approach.

In high dimensional problems, such as document or image clustering, the direct method is suffered from over-fitting and the curse of the dimensionality. In many cases, we firstly reduce the dimensionality, then apply the clustering algorithm. However these methods neglect the interaction among two processes. In this report, we propose the hierarchical joint distribution of Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Polya, Mixture and give the parameter estimation algorithm by Gibbs sampling method. Some benchmarks show the effectiveness of the proposed method.	Nihon Unisys Ltd, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan	Hosino, T (reprint author), Nihon Unisys Ltd, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.

The topics are first extracted from the two document sets provided in the task of update summarization by means of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model. Then, the correlation between the new topics and the old topics are identified, based on which we further defined four categories of topic evolution patterns to capture the topic shift between the two document collections. We develop a new sentence ranking algorithm, i.e. CorrRank, which fully incorporates the topic evolution in the process of sentence ranking and sentence selection in update summarization. We choose the DUC 2008 and 2009 query-oriented multi-document update summarization tasks to examine the proposed model. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the LDA topic correlation analysis based update summarization framework.

The usefulness of the information depends on how we accomplish these steps and present the most relevant information to the analyst. One method for extracting information from free text is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a document categorization technique to classify documents into cohesive topics. Although LDA accounts for some implicit relationships such as synonymy (same meaning) it often ignores other semantic relationships such as polysemy (different meanings), hyponym (subordinate), and meronym (part of). To compensate for this deficiency, we incorporate explicit word ontologies, such as WordNet, into the LDA algorithm to account for various semantic relationships. Experiments over well-known document collections, 20 Newsgroups, NIPS, and OHSUMED, demonstrate that incorporating such background knowledge improves perplexity measure over LDA alone.

Generative models like latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and its variants are popular methods for unsupervised object segmentation, but they lack comprehensive consideration of structure correlations. Even small amounts of globally distributed noise in the image can negatively effect results. In this paper, we introduce a structure preserving semantic coherent model (SP-SC) to support more comprehensive object segmentation. Our approach combines Euclidean distance, graph distances and structural similarity of homogeneous patches in a unified framework. The method groups structural and semantic coherent patches together thereby overcoming false segmentation due to many kinds of noise and scene complexities. Comparative results in segmentation experiments using standard image data sets show the efficacy of proposed approach.

Many existing approaches ignore text semantics and can not recommend new tags which are not in the training dataset (e.g., FolkRank). Some exceptional semantic approaches use a probabilistic latent semantic method to recommend tags in terms of topic knowledge (e.g.. ACT model). However, they do not perform well because many entities in these models result in much noise. In this paper, we propose hybrid approaches in folksonomy to challenge these problems. Hybrid approaches are combination of Language Model (LM) for keyword based approach and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Tag-Topic (TT) model and User-Tag-Topic (UTT) model for topic based approaches. Our approaches can recommend meaningful tags and can be used to discover resource implicit correlations. Experimental results on Bibsonomy dataset show that LM performs better than all other hybrid and non-hybrid approaches.

Specifically, the focus of this paper is on using naive text to create input queries describing the desired information of the users. Using naive text queries, however, raises interoperability issues between annotation and retrieval processes due to the wide variety of available audio descriptions. In this paper, we propose an intermediate audio description layer (iADL) to solve the interoperability issues between the annotation and retrieval processes. The iADL comprises two axes corresponding to semantic and onomatopoeic descriptions based on human-to-human communication experiments on how humans express sounds verbally. Various text modeling schemes, such as latent semantic analysis (LSA) and latent topic model, are utilized to transform the naive text onto the proposd iADL.

The overwhelming amount of new articles published every day makes it necessary to filter out unimportant ones and detect ground breaking new articles. In this paper, we propose the use of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to find the hidden factors of important news stories. These factors are then used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify new news items as they appear. We compare our results with SVMs based on a bag-of-words approach and other language features. The advantage of a LDA processing is not only a better accuracy in predicting important news, but also a better interpretability of the results. The latent topics show directly the important factors of a news story.

To achieve a robust and discriminative performance for gender recognition, visual observations from both face and corresponding fingerprints are fused to serve for the task. The bag-of-words model is employed to structure the image representation. We propose a novel supervised method to construct the visual words, by which the redundant feature dimensions are discarded and the important dimensions for gender classification are highlighted. The dimension rearrangement is achieved by aligning the feature dimensions to a common normal vector of the hyperplane between categories. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is extended to incorporate discriminative clues for supervised classification. We build the novel Discriminative LDA (D-LDA) model by maximizing the inter-class margins, which can significantly enhance the discriminative power of the whole model. Experiments on a large face and fingerprint database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed new feature and model. Complementary advantages benefited from face-fingerprint fusion to a robust gender recognition framework also get validated.

Abandoning the "bag of words" assumption in traditional topic models, A Firm incorporates spatial structure into traditional LDA. AITM extends LDA by modeling visual words with latent affine transformations as well as latent topics, treating topics as different parts of objects and assuming a common affine transformation of visual words given a certain topic. MCMC is employed to make inference for latent variables, MCMC-EM algorithm is used to parameter estimation, and Bayesian decision rule is used to perform classification. Experiments on two challenging data sets demonstrate the efficiency of AITM.

In this paper, we answer this question by analyzing distribution laws for keywords from image descriptions and comparing with traditional techniques in NLP, thereby propose three assumptions: Sparse Distribution Attribute, Local Convergent Assumption and Global Convergent Conjecture. They are essential for keywords selection and image content understanding to overcome the semantic gap. Experiments are performed on a 60,000 web crawled images, and the correctness is validated by the performance.

In many cases documents such as news articles and product reviews are in some specific domains. Domain knowledge may be important information for term rankings. In this paper, we present to model domain knowledge using latent topic models, referred to as Domain-Topic Model (DTM). Using DTM we perform domain-specific term rankings according to the relatedness between terms and domains. Experimental results on both keyword extraction and tag recommendation show advantages of DTM for domain-specific term rankings.

Even though different methods are proposed to exploit both the link structure and the content information, no existing approach can effectively deal with this evolution. We propose a novel joint model, called Link-IPLSI, to combine texts and links in a topic modeling framework incrementally. The model takes advantage of a novel link updating technique that can cope with dynamic changes of online document streams in a faster and scalable way. Furthermore, an adaptive asymmetric learning method is adopted to freely control the assignment of weights to terms and citations. Experimental results on two different sources of online information demonstrate the time saving strength of our method and indicate that our model leads to systematic improvements in the quality of classification.

We model topical trends by per-topic Beta distributions as in Topics over Time (TOT), proposed as an extension of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). However, TOT is likely to overfit to timestamp data in extracting latent topics. Therefore; we apply prior distributions to Beta distributions in TOT. Since Beta distribution has no conjugate prior; we devise a trick, where we set one among the two parameters of each per-topic Beta distribution to one based on a Bernoulli trial and apply Gamma distribution as a conjugate prior. Consequently; we can marginalize out the parameters of Beta distributions and thus treat; timestamp data in a Bayesian fashion. In the evaluation experiment, we compare our method with LDA and TOT in link detection task on TDT4 dataset. We use word predictive probabilities as term weights and estimate document similarities by using those weights in a TFIDF-like scheme. The results show that our method achieves a moderate fitting to timestamp data.

The precision of a long-distance language model including LDA is influenced by a context length, or a length of the history used for prediction. In the proposed method, each of multiple LDA units estimates an optimum context length separately, then those predictions are integrated and N-gram probabilities are calculated. The method directly estimates the optimum context length suitable for prediction. Results show the method improves topic-dependent N-gram probabilities, particularly of a word related to specific topics, yielding higher and more stable performance comparing to an existing method.			naka@eco.rd.sanyo.co.jp; hayamizu@gifu-u.ac.jp					[Anonymous], 2006, THE MAINICHI NEWSPAP; Blei DM, 2003, J MACH LEARN RES, V3, P993, DOI 10.1162/jmlr.2003.3.4-5.993; Chueh C.H., 2009, P ANN C INT SPEECH C, P372; Doucet A., 2001, SEQUENTIAL MONTE CAR; Gildea D, 1999, P EUROSPEECH, P2167; Griffiths TL, 2004, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V101, P5228, DOI 10.1073/pnas.0307752101; Hofmann T, 1999, SIGIR'99: PROCEEDINGS OF 22ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, P50; KNESER R, 1995, INT CONF ACOUST SPEE, P181, DOI 10.1109/ICASSP.1995.479394; Minka T., 2003, ESTIMATING A DIRICHL; Mochihashi D., 2005, PROC NIPS2005, P907; Nakamura A., 2009, JOURNAL OF INFORMATI, V50, P1375; Sadamitsu Kugatsu, 2007, Systems and Computers in Japan, V38, DOI 10.1002/scj.20629; Zhao B., PROC NIPS2007	13	0	0	ISCA-INST SPEECH COMMUNICATION ASSOC	BAIXAS	C/O EMMANUELLE FOXONET, 4 RUE DES FAUVETTES, LIEU DIT LOUS TOURILS, BAIXAS, F-66390, FRANCE			978-1-61782-123-3				2010							3066	3069				4	Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications	Engineering; Telecommunications	BDG18	WOS:000313086500379

As the project evolves, the team is expected to develop a shared understanding. However, students often become overwhelmed by the amount of information available and lose sight of the big picture. Instructors may also find it difficult to keep track of individual and team activities and are often forced to evaluate the product instead of the learning process. This paper presents preliminary results from a tool that supports effective knowledge management for engineering design projects. This framework, called Design Webs, automatically extracts conceptual maps from the team's evolving set of documents and discussions about an engineering artifact. It uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation, hierarchical clustering, and other machine learning techniques to generate a navigable web-based graph. Both instructors and students can browse this graph interactively to explore the concepts embedded inside design team documents and the connections between them. An experiment performed on documents obtained from a project course shows the effectiveness of DesignWebs in synthesizing the design knowledge from multiple sources of information in engineering project teams.

In this paper we propose the tool, namely Topic(XP), to support developers during such software maintenance tasks by extracting and analyzing unstructured information in source code identifier names and comments using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Topic(XP) enables developers to gain an overview of a software system under analysis by extracting and visualizing natural language topics, which generally correspond to concepts or features implemented in software classes. Topic(XP) is implemented as an open-source Eclipse plug-in, which proposes interactive visualization of topics along with structural dependencies between underlying classes implementing these topics. The paper also presents the results of a preliminary user study aimed at evaluating Topic(XP).

When developing a curriculum, topics, such as natural science, informatics, and so on are set first, course syllabi are written accordingly. However, the topics actually covered by the courses are not guaranteed to be identical to the initially set topics. To find out if the actual topics are covered by the developed course syllabi, we developed a method of systematically analyzing syllabi that uses latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and Isomap. We applied this method to the syllabi of MIT and those of the Open University, and verified that the method is effective.

To handle new stories more precisely, an adaptive topic modeling method that incorporates probabilistic pseudo feedback is proposed in this paper to tune every topic model with a changed environment. Differently, this method considers every incoming story as pseudo feedback with certain probability, which is the similarity between the story and the topic. Experiment results show that probabilistic pseudo feedback brings promising improvement to online topic detection.

Recently, it was even shown that relations among documents such as hyper-links or citations allow one to share information between documents and in turn to improve topic generation. Although fully generative, in many situations we are actually not interested in predicting relations among documents. In this paper, we therefore present a Dirichlet-multinomial nonparametric regression topic model that includes a Gaussian process prior on joint document and topic distributions that is a function of document relations. On networks of scientific abstracts and of Wikipedia documents we show that this approach meets or exceeds the performance of several baseline topic models.

We introduce a generative model for hypothesizing facets in the (news) video domain by combining the complementary information in the visual keyframes and the speech transcripts. We evaluate the efficacy of our multimodal model on the standard TRECVID-2005 video corpus annotated with facets. We find that: (1) the joint modeling of the visual and text (speech transcripts) information can achieve significant F-score improvement over a text-alone system; (2) our model compares favorably with standard diverse ranking algorithms such as the MMR [1]. Our FTR model has been implemented on a news search prototype that is undergoing commercial trial.

It is challenging to construct an adaptive model to classify a large amount of documents containing different domains. The classifiers trained from a source domain shall perform poorly for the test data in a target domain due to the domain mismatch. In this study, we build a topic-bridged latent Dirichlet allocation (TLDA) model from a variety of labeled and unlabeled documents and perform the transfer learning for document classification. The severe change of word distributions is compensated by bridging the latent topics of source and target data which are drawn by the Dirichlet priors. A variational inference procedure is performed for semi-supervised learning. In the experiments on text categorization using 20 Newsgroups dataset, the proposed TLDA model achieved higher classification performance compared to the other methods.

However, the vector space model based distance, such as cosine-like distance, will get a low precision and recall when the corpus contains many related topics. In this paper, we propose a new distance measure method: the Topic Model (TM) induced distance. Assuming that the distribution of word is different in each topic, the documents can be treated as a sample of the mixture of k topic models, which can be estimated using expectation maximization (EM). A biased initiation method is proposed in this paper for topic decomposition using ETA, which will generate a converged matrix for the generation of TM induced distance. The collections of web news are clustered into classes using this TM distance. A series of experiments are described on a corpus containing 5033 web news from 30 topics. K-means clustering is processed on test set with different topic numbers. A comparison of clustering result using the TM induced distance and the traditional cosine-like distance are given. The experiment results show that the proposed topic decomposition method using biased initiation is effective than the topic decomposition using random values. The TM induced distance will generate more topical groups than the VS model based cosine-like distance. In the web news collections containing related topics, the TM induced distance can achieve a better precision and recall.

In previous work, many researchers decompose this task into two separate steps: they first use a generative latent topic model to learn low-dimensional semantic representations of documents; and then train a max-margin predictor using them as features. In this work we demonstrate that it is beneficial to combine both steps of learning low-dimensional representations and training a predictor into one step of minimizing a singe learning objective. We present a novel step-wise convex optimization algorithm which solves this objective properly via a tight variational upper bound. We conduct an extensive experimental study on public available movie review and 20 Newsgroups datasets. Experimental results show that compared with state of art results in the literature, our one step approach can train noticeably better predictors and discover much lower-dimensional representations: a 2% relative accuracy improvement and a 95% relative number of dimensions reduction in the classification task on the Newsgroups dataset; and a 5.7% relative predictive R(2) improvement and a 55% relative number of dimensions reduction in the regression task on the movie review dataset.

Such a problem has been studied in the case that each party is semi-honest. Here we propose a new solution based on a weaken assumption that some of the parties may collaborate together to extract information of other parties.

The method works at the level of image patches. In the first stage, codebook-based local appearance features are regularized and reduced in dimension using latent topic models, combined with spatial pyramid matching based spatial layout features, and fed into logistic regression classifiers to produce an initial patch level labeling. In the second stage, these labels are combined with patch-neighborhood and global aggregate features using either a second layer of Logistic Regression or a Conditional Random Field. Finally, the patch-level results are refined to pixel level using MRF or over-segmentation based methods. The CRF is trained using a fast Maximum Margin approach. Comparative experiments on four multi-class segmentation datasets show that each of the above elements improves the results, leading to a scalable algorithm that is both faster and more accurate than existing patch-level approaches.

Many competitors proposed various kinds of data mining model trying to achieve the best prediction performance. The first place winner among the competitors got the best root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.256. Most of the models applied statistical machines learning techniques with collaborative mining approach to achieve their best performance. In this paper, a hybrid recommendation model is proposed to get better prediction result which combines both content-based and collaborative recommendation approaches with latent topic discovery and social network analysis. This model was tested using 2007 KDD Cup movie dataset and found that either with single content-based approach or single collaborative approach is hard to get better RMSE result than hybrid models. By combining both kinds of approaches, the latent-topic-only approach observed in our experiment achieves only RMSE=0.274, while with Bonacich power centrality in social network get better improvement to 0.252, which proved that our model is better than all of the competitors in the contest.

First of all, an image collection is generated from a high-resolution image by partitioning it into densely overlapped sub-images. The image collection is divided into two subsets, i.e., training images and testing images. The training images are used to estimate the number of topics, and to learn topic models. The training images are densely overlapped and are folded in using the learned topics to make sure that every pixel in each document is allocated to a topic label. Therefore, every pixel in the initial large image might be allocated multiple topic labels since it might belong to multiple sub-images. By selecting the road segments samples, several cluster centers will be assumed as labels of road objects. The semantic information can improve the extraction accuracy of road segments. The central lines of the road segments will be extracted basing on some image filter algorithms and Hough transform. Experimental results over EROS-B images show that road segments can be effectively detected by the proposed algorithm and an initial road network can be formed	[Yi, Wenbin; Chen, Yunhao] Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China	Chen, YH (reprint author), Beijing Normal Univ, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.	cyh@ires.cn	li, dongsheng/B-2285-2012				Akcay HG, 2008, IEEE T GEOSCI REMOTE, V46, P2097, DOI 10.1109/TGRS.2008.916644; BLEI DM, 2003, MACH LEARN, P993; Hofmann T., 1999, PROBABILISTIC LATENT; JIANG YH, 2005, RADAR SCI TECHNOLOGY, V3, P156; LIENOU M, 2008, SEMANTIC ANNOTATION; Niu XT, 2006, ISPRS J PHOTOGRAMM, V61, P170, DOI 10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2006.08.004; Quelhas P, 2007, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V29, P1575, DOI 10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1155; Steyvers M, 2007, HDB LATENT SEMANTIC; WANG X, 2007, SPATIAL LATENT DIRIC	9	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA			978-1-4244-9566-5	INT GEOSCI REMOTE SE			2010							445	448		10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5650966		4	Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing	Geology; Remote Sensing	BTS07	WOS:000287933800115

However, previous approaches fail to use them in a unified way. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for social recommendation. Entities like users and items are described by their tags. We model each entity using topic models like Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) and then connect these topic models to form a multi-relational network. Various relations between entities in recommender systems such as rating relation or user friend relation can be expressed as edges in the multi-relational network. We evaluate our model on a real-life dataset collected from a commercial recommender website. Experiments validate the generative performance and predictive performance of our model.

Unlike previous work, which considered the discrepancy and common property separately among all categories, Our approach combines universal topics from all categories with specific topics from each category. As a result, the model is implemented to produce a few but specific topics and more generic topics among categories, and each category is represented in a different topics simplex, which correlates well with human scene understanding. We investigate the classification performance with variable scene category tasks. The experiments have shown Our model outperforms latent-space methods with less training data.

The height of the topic tree is assumed as fixed, while the number of topics on each level as unknown a priori and to be inferred from data. Taking a nonparametric Bayesian approach to this problem, we propose a new probabilistic generative model based on the nested hierarchical Dirichlet process (nHDP) and present a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm for the inference of the topic tree structure as well as the word distribution of each topic and topic distribution of each document. Our theoretical analysis and experiment results show that this model can produce a more compact hierarchical topic structure and captures more fine-grained topic relationships compared to the hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation model.

Current measures for assessing sample quality are too coarse grain to be informative. This paper outlines a measure of finer granularity based on probabilistic topic models of text. The assumption we make is that a representative sample should capture the broad themes of the underlying text collection. If these themes are not captured, then resource selection will be affected in terms of performance, coverage and reliability. For example, resource selection algorithms that require extrapolation from a small sample of indexed documents to determine which collections are most likely to hold relevant documents may be affected by samples which do not reflect the topical density of a collection. To address this issue we propose to measure the relative entropy between topics obtained in a sample with respect to the complete collection. Topics are both modelled from the collection and inferred in the sample using latent Dirichlet allocation. The paper outlines an analysis and evaluation of this methodology across a number of collections and sampling algorithms.

These libraries often need to manually verify that contributed resources cover topics that fit within the theme of the library. We show that such scope judgments can be automated using a combination of text classification techniques and topic modeling. Our models address two significant challenges in making scope judgments: only a small number of out-of-scope resources are typically available, and the topic distinctions required for digital libraries are much more subtle than classic text classification problems. To meet these challenges, our models combine support vector machine learners optimized to different performance metrics and semantic topics induced by unsupervised statistical topic models. Our best model is able to distinguish resources that belong in DLESE from resources that don't with an accuracy of around 70%. We see these models as the first steps towards increasing the scalability of digital libraries and dramatically reducing the workload required to maintain them.

In LDA, each document is modeled as a mixture of topics and the topic proportions are generated from the unimodal Dirichlet distribution prior. When a collection of documents are drawn from multiple classes, this unimodal prior is insufficient for data fitting. To solve this problem, we exploit the multimodal Dirichlet mixture prior, and propose the Dirichlet mixture allocation (DMA). We report experiments on the popular TDT2 Corpus demonstrating that DMA models a collection of documents more precisely than LDA when the documents are obtained from multiple classes.

In our setup, for every category an own collection of topics is assigned, and for a labeled training document only topics from its category are sampled. Thus, compared to the classical LDA that processes the entire corpus in one, we essentially build separate LDA models for each category with the category-specific topics, and then these topic collections are put together to form a unified LDA model. For an unseen document the inferred topic distribution gives an estimation how much the document fits into the category. We use this method for Web document classification. Our key results are 46% decrease in 1-AUC value in classification accuracy over tf.idf with SVM and 43% over the plain LDA baseline with SVM. Using a careful vocabulary selection method and a heuristic which handles the effect; that similar topics may arise in distinct categories the improvement; is 83% over tf.idf with SVM and 82% over LDA with SVM in 1-AUC.

LDA extracts the latent topics across documents. Words in a document are generated by the same topic distribution. However, in real-world documents, the usage of words in different paragraphs is varied and accompanied with different writing styles. This study extends the LDA and copes with the variations of topic information within a document. We build the nonstationary LDA (NLDA) by incorporating a Markov chain which is used to detect the stylistic segments in a document. Each segment corresponds to a particular style in composition of a document. This NLDA can exploit the topic information between documents as well as the word variations within a document. We accordingly establish a Viterbi-based variational Bayesian procedure. A language model adaptation scheme using NLDA is developed for speech recognition. Experimental results show improvement of NLDA over LDA in terms of perplexity and word error rate.

The Textual Analysis (TA), which makes use of statistical techniques, ensures the systematic exploration of the structure of the text (size, occurrence, etc.) and simultaneously the possibility to return at any time to the original text for the appropriate interpretations. In this work we test a new technique based on a probabilistic model of language known in the literature as "topic model" for analyzing corpora of documents about electromagnetic pollution. The proposed method is able to reveal how the meaning of a document is distributed all along its spectrum (word-frequency) indicating that the real meaning of a document can be inferred following a multilevel analysis. Such analysis is carried out exploiting a new concept of ontology already used in literature and deeply explained here.

Unlike subscription-based alerts, alerting is implemented as a personalized service where the system is trained to recognize potentially important news based on user preferences. Preferences are expressed as combinations of topics and can change dynamically. The system employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic discovery and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) for alerting.	[Haque, Sk.

However, these models assume that if a document is relevant to a topic, then all tokens in the document are relevant to that topic. This could limit model robustness and effectiveness. In this study, we propose a Latent Dirichlet relevance model, which relaxes this assumption. Our approach derives from current research on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic models. LDA has been extensively explored, especially for discovering a set of topics from a corpus. LDA itself, however, has a limitation that is also addressed in our work. Topics generated by LDA from a corpus are synthetic, i.e., they do not necessarily correspond to topics identified by humans for the same corpus. In contrast, our model explicitly considers the relevance relationships between documents and given topics (queries). Thus unlike standard LDA, our model is directly applicable to goals such as relevance feedback for query modification and text classification, where topics (classes and queries) are provided upfront. Thus although the focus of our paper is on improving relevance-based language models, in effect our approach bridges relevance-based language models and LDA addressing limitations of both.

Each document is interpreted as a generative topic model, belonging to many topics. The relevance of a document to a query is expressed by the probability of a query word being generated by the model. Different from the conventional vector space model where the matching between query and document is at the word level, the topic model complete its matching in the concept or semantic level. So, the problem of term mismatch in the information retrieval can be improved, that is, the relevant documents have possibilities to be retrieved even if the query words do not appear in them. The method also benefit the retrieval of spoken document containing "term misrecognitions", which is peculiar to the speech transcripts. By using this approach, experiments are conducted on a test collection of corpora of spontaneous Japanese (CSJ), where some of the evaluating queries and answer references are suited to retrieval in semantic level. The retrieval performance is improved by increasing the number of topics. When the topic number exceeds a threshold, the NMF's retrieval performance surpasses the tf-idf-based vector space model (VSM). Furthermore, compared to the VSM-based method, the NMF-based topic model also shows its strongpoint in dealing with term mismatch and term misrecognition.			xinhui.hu@nict.go.jp; hideki.kashioka@nict.go.jp; ryosuke.isotani@nict.go.jp; satoshi.nakamura@nict.go.jp					AKIBA T, 2008, P LREC 2008; Chen B., 2009, ACM T ASIAN LANG INF, V8, P1; Hoffman T., 1999, P 22 ANN INT ACM SIG, P50; KITA K, 2003, INFORM RETRIEVAL ALG; Lee D.D., 2001, NIPS, V13; Maekawa K., 2003, SSPR 2003; Nakamura S, 2006, IEEE T AUDIO SPEECH, V14, P365, DOI 10.1109/TSA.2005.860774; Saraclar M, 2004, HLT-NAACL 2004: HUMAN LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE OF THE NORTH AMERICAN CHAPTER OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS, PROCEEDINGS OF THE MAIN CONFERENCE, P129	8	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743		978-3-642-04768-8	LECT NOTES COMPUT SC			2009	5839						149	156				8	Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BMY88	WOS:000273954100013

In this paper, we consider counting less on these body components that have less discriminative information amongst different human motions. To this end, we present a new topic model, probabilistic latent semantic analysis based on multiple bags (M-PLSA), in which not all body components are considered equally important, i.e., motion features of less discriminative components are made less use of so that their contributions for classification are reduced. We use sparse spatio-temporal features extracted from videos to create visual words which are later assigned to different body components that they are detected from, so that co-occurrence matrices of different components can be calculated based on their corresponding vocabularies. Such label task can be automatically fulfilled by using the query visual words, i.e., words whose component labels are unknown, to traverse an automatic label tree (ALT) that grows from the training words with component labels. We show the performance of our approach on KTH dataset [1].

Standard LDA treats documents as bags of words, ignoring the syntactic structures of sentences. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that embeds hidden Markov models (HMMs) within LDA topics to jointly model both the topics and the syntactic structures within each topic. Our model is general and subsumes standard LDA and HMM as special cases. Compared with standard LDA and HMM, our model can simultaneously discover both topic-specific content words and background functional words shared among topics. Our model can also automatically separate content words that play different roles within a topic. Using perplexity as evaluation metric, our model returns lower perplexity for unseen test documents compared with standard LDA, which shows its better generalization power than LDA.

We propose to use latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model for capturing the semantic information on word transcription. The LDA model is employed for estimating topic distribution in queries and word transcribed spoken documents, and the matching is performed at the topic level. Acoustic matching between query words and phonetically transcribed spoken documents is performed using phone-based matching algorithm. The results of acoustic and topic level matching methods are compared and shown to be complementary.

Such R&D problems include global warming, emerging infectious diseases, and energy issues. One typical approach for identifying a group of expert candidates is to first come up with an initial expert and then use his/her referral to find additional experts. Hence the traditional process relies significantly on humans and their personal interrelationship. However with an increasing in the availability and accessibility of R&D information in electronic forms, one can apply techniques in the fields of information retrieval, natural language processing, and machine learning to automatically retrieve experts and their areas of expertise from such information sources. In this paper, we present an approach based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method to discover experts and their associated areas of expertise from R&D bibliographic data. The LDA method could generate multiple hidden topics underlying the given data set. These topics are representatives for those multiple areas of expertise in which individual experts could be assigned into. As an illustration, we apply our approach to analyze abstracts from Compendex database in the domain of Emerging Infectious Diseases (EIDs). Our approach can help enhance the traditional expert identification process in term of topical coverage and unbiased selection of expert candidates.

When LDA is applied to text classification, smoothing is essential to classification performance. In this paper, we propose a feature-enhanced smoothing method in the idea that words not appeared in the training corpus can help to improve the classification performance. The key point is fully considering the relativity between the new document and training corpus, and enhancing the document's class feature by regarding the words not appeared in the training corpus. Evaluations on 20newsgroups show feature-enhanced smoothing can significantly improve the performance in Bi-class text classification.

However, the relationship between stories occurred during the topic developing process can not be exhibited clearly. By analyzing the evolution of the topic, the concept subtopic is put forward and the focus of topic evolution analysis is subtopic instead. Four levels topic model is constructed. The subtopic detection algorithm, time slices partition algorithm and topic evolution analysis algorithm are designed. These algorithms make use of the temporal characteristic of topic, partition the news stories into time slices and compute the similarity of these units. As a result, the relationships between the various subtopics in the process of the topic evolution are achieved. Experiments show our algorithms are effective.

Currently, most of the existing service discovering and matching approaches are based on keywords-based strategy However, this method is inefficient and time-consuming. In this paper, we present a novel approach for discovering web services Based on the current dominating mechanisms of discovering and describing Web Services with UDDI and WSDL, the proposed approach utilizes Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to capture semantic concepts hidden behind words in the query and advertisements in services so that services matching is expected to carry out at concept level. We also present related algorithms and preliminary experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.

Even though different methods have been proposed to exploit the link structure in identifying hubs and authorities in a set of linked documents, no existing approach can effectively deal with its changing situation. This paper explores changes in linked documents and proposes an incremental link probabilistic framework, which we call IPHITS. The model deals with online document streams in a faster, scalable way and uses a novel link updating technique that can cope with dynamic changes. Experimental results on two different sources of online information demonstrate the time saving strength of our method. Besides, we make analysis of the stable rankings under small perturbations to the linkage patterns.

Given a set of documents, the system automatically extracts the mentioned topics and assists the user to select their optimal number. The user-validated topics are exploited to build a model for multi-label document classification. While topic extraction is performed by using an optimized implementation of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model, multi-label document classification is performed by using a specialized version of the Multi-Net Naive Bayes model. The performance of the system is investigated by using 10,056 documents retrieved from the WEB through a set of queries formed by exploiting the Italian Google Directory. This dataset is used for topic extraction while an independent dataset, consisting of 1,012 elements labeled by humans, is used to evaluate the performance of the Multi-Net Naive Bayes model. The results are satisfactory, with precision being consistently better than recall for the labels associated with the four most frequent topics.

BoT is an extension of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and has two remarkable features when compared with a previously proposed Topics over Time (ToT), which is also an extension of LDA. First, we can avoid overfitting to temporal data, because temporal data are modeled in a Bayesian manner similar to word frequencies. Second, BoT has a conditional probability where no functions requiring time-consuming computations appear. The experiments using newswire documents show that BoT achieves more moderate fitting to temporal data in shorter execution time than ToT.

Topicality information can be used to improve transcription quality and enable content navigation. In this paper, we give a novel quality measure for topic segmentation algorithms that improves over previously used measures. Our measure takes into account not only the presence or absence of topic boundaries but also the content of the text or speech segments labeled as topic-coherent. Additionally, we demonstrate that topic segmentation quality of spoken language can be improved using speech recognition lattices. Using lattices, improvements over the baseline one-best topic model are observed when measured with the previously existing topic segmentation quality measure, as well as the new measure proposed in this paper (9.4% and 7.0% relative error reduction, respectively).

In this paper, we propose a new approach to a topic dependent LM, where the topic is decided in an unsupervised manner. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is employed to reveal hidden (latent) relations among nouns in the context words. To decide the topic of an event, a fixed size word history sequence (window) is observed, and voting is then carried out based on noun class occurrences weighted by a confidence measure. Experiments on the Wall Street Journal corpus and Mainichi Shimbun (Japanese newspaper) corpus show that our proposed method gives better perplexity than the comparative baselines, including a word-based/class-based n-gram LM, their interpolated LM, a cache-based LM, and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-based topic dependent LM.

The strong independence assumption inherent in the bag-of-features representation is not realistic however: patches often overlap and share underlying image structures. Moreover, important information with respect to relative scales of the features is completely ignored, for the sake of scale invariance. Considering both spatial and scale-based constraints one can derive spatially constrained natural feature hierarchies within images. We explore the use of topic models that build such spatially constrained scale-induced hierarchies of the features in an unsupervised fashion. Our model uses standard topic models as a starting point. We then incorporate information about the hierarchical and spatial relations of the features into the model. We illustrate the hierarchical nature of the resulting models using datasets of natural images, including the MSRC2 dataset as well as a challenging set of images of trees collected from the Internet.

We present a novel approach to the extraction of user context, casting the problem of context recovery as an unsupervised, clustering problem. A well known density-based clustering technique, DBSCAN, is adapted to recover user context that includes user motion state, and significant places the user visits from WiFi observations consisting of access point id and signal strength. Furthermore, user rhythms or sequences of places the user visits periodically are derived from the above low level contexts by employing a state-of-the-art probabilistic clustering technique, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to enable a variety of application services. Experimental results with real data are presented to validate the proposed unsupervised learning approach and demonstrate its applicability.

However, further analysis and interpretation of gathered data is needed to address tasks such as habitat characterization and monitoring. This analysis stage is performed by human experts which limits the amount and speed of data processing. While it is unlikely that machines will match humans at fine-scale classification, machines can now perform preliminary, coarser classification to provide timely and relevant feedback to assist human decisions and enable adaptive AUV behavior. This paper presents a preliminary investigation into using a 'bag of features' object recognition system for unsupervised clustering of marine habitat imagery. In addition to directly using the high dimensional signature vectors, we also perform clustering based on a low dimensional topic model of the images. We use an AUV transect in the Great Barrier Reef that covers distinct habitat to illustrate the behavior of hierarchical clustering using both representations. Results suggest that both approaches generate clusters of images that are easily recognizable by humans, with significant computational gains to be made by using a topic-based model.

Generalization over users by grouping them into user groups is beneficial when a rating is to be predicted for a relatively new document, having only few observed ratings. The same applies for documents in the case of new users. We have shown earlier that if there are both new users and new documents, two-way generalization becomes necessary, and introduced a probabilistic Two-Way Model for the task. The task of finding a two-way grouping is a non-trivial combinatorial problem, which makes it computation ally difficult. We suggest approximating the Two-Way Model with two URP models; one that groups users and one that groups documents. Their two predictions are combined using a product of experts model. This combination of two one-way models achieves even better prediction performance than the original Two-Way Model.

When developing a curriculum, topics, such as natural science, informatics, etc. are set first, and then course syllabi are written accordingly. However, there is no guarantee that the topics actually covered by the course syllabi are identical to the initially set topics. To find out if the actual topics covered by the developed course syllabi, we developed a method of systematically analyzing course syllabi that uses latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and Isomap. We applied this method to the syllabi of MIT and the Open University curricula, and verified the method is promising.

The motivation stems from the limitations of topic models such as Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA), that have found wide use in the analysis of non-negative data apart from text corpora such as images, audio spectra, gene array data among others. The goal of this paper is to remove the non-negativity requirement for datasets so that these models can work on datasets with both positive and negative entries. We start by showing that PLSA is equivalent to finding a set of components that define the corners of a simplex within which all datapoints lie. We formalize this intuition by introducing the notion of Simplex Decompositions - PLSA and extensions are specific examples - and generalize the idea to be applicable to arbitrary real datasets with both positive and negative entries. We present algorithms and illustrate the method with examples.	Mars Inc, Mt Olive, NJ 07828 USA	Shashanka, M (reprint author), Mars Inc, 100 Int Dr, Mt Olive, NJ 07828 USA.

The estimation of the parameters is speeded up by fast Gibbs sampling. Words which do not appear in the analyzed document can be inferred as topic with the help of word clustering of background. Topics are represented by means of word groups. The experiment results show that our approach performs far better than other methods.

In this work we study a recently proposed model, the Correlated Topic Model (CTM) [1], in the context of large-scale image retrieval. This approach is able to explicitly model such correlations of topics. We experimentally evaluate the proposed retrieval approach on a real-world large-scale database consisting of more than 246,000 images and compare the performance to related approaches.

Since the data in text categorization are high-dimensional, feature selection is broadly used in text categorization systems for reducing the dimensionality. In the literature, there are some widely known metrics such as information gain and document frequency thresholding. Recently, a generative graphical model called latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) that can be used to model and discover the underlying topic structures of textual data, was proposed. In this paper, we use the hidden topic analysis of LDA for feature selection and compare it with the classical feature selection metrics in text categorization. For the experiments, we use SVM as the classifier and tf*idf weighting for weighting the terms. We observed that almost in all metrics, information gain performs best at all keyword numbers while the LDA-based metrics perform similar to chi-square and document frequency thresholding.

We employ a generative probabilistic model, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), so as to capture latent aspects of a video, using facial semantic information derived from the video. We use the bag-of-words concept, (bag-of-faces in our case) in order to ensure exchangeability of the latent variables (e.g. topics). The video topics are modeled as a mixture of distributions of faces in each video. This generative probabilistic model has already been used in the case of text modeling with good results. Experimental results provide evidence that the proposed method performs very efficiently for video fingerprinting.

The representation with coarse resolution is often regarded as being able to capture intrinsic semantic structure of the original documents. Probabilistic topic models for document modelling attempt to search for richer representations of the structure of linguistic stimuli and as such support the process of human cognition. The topics inferred by the probabilistic topic models (latent topics) are represented as probability distributions over words. Although they are interpretable, the interpretation is not sufficiently straightforward for human understanding. Also, perhaps more importantly, relationships between the topics are difficult, if not impossible to interpret. Instead of directly operating on the latent topics, we extract topics with labels from a document collection and represent them using fictitious documents. Having trained the probabilistic topic models, we propose a method for deriving relationships (more general or more specific) between the extracted topics in the semantic space. To ensure a reasonable accuracy of modeling in a given semantic space we have conducted experiments with various dimensionality of the semantic space to identify optimal parameter settings in this context.

As a most popular recommendation approach, collaborative filtering (CF) obtains great success in practice. To overcome the inherent problems of CF, such as sparsity and scalability, we proposed a semantic based mixture CF in this paper. Our approach decomposes the original vector into semantic component and residual component, and then combines them together to implement recommendation. The semantic component can be extracted by topic model analysis and the residual component can be approximated by top values selected from the original vector respectively. Compared to the traditional CF, the proposed mixture approach has introduced semantic information and reduced dimensions without serious information missing owe to the complement of residual error. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach can indeed provide better recommendations in both accuracy and efficiency.

Most of the metrics observe scientific quality in a global view instead of in multiple fine-grained views. In this paper, we suggest to apply Topic Model and adaptive PageRank algorithm to assess the relative importance of scientific objects including articles, authors, conferences and journals. The scientific quality is measured by an aggregation PageRank metric towards some topics. This metric considers the impact of a paper both in global view and local view. The experiments on A CL Anthology bibliographic corpus show our method is a useful measure to observe scientific quality on multi-views.

However, previous research on enterprise data mining often treats these two kinds of data independently and omits mutual benefits. We explore the approach to incorporate a common type of structured data (i.e. organigram) into generative topic model. Our approach, the Partially Observed Topic model (POT), not only considers the unstructured words, but also takes into account the structured information in its generation process. By integrating the structured data implicitly, the mixed topics over document are partially observed during the Gibbs sampling procedure. This allows POT to learn topic pertinently and directionally, which makes it easy tuning and suitable for end-use application. We evaluate our proposed new model on a real-world dataset and show the result of improved expressiveness over traditional LDA. In the task of document classification, POT also demonstrates more discriminative power than LDA.

Topic model based dimension reduction can minimize the structural risk with limited training data. But dimension reduction will go against the completeness of feature space. It is very difficult to obtain the convergence rate and the completeness at the same time only by one kind of feature. This paper uses supervised dual-PLSA for Dimensionality Reduction and presents a multi-layer features model, which employs two layer features and adopts a novel method to combine them. Experiments show that multi-layer features model have the best performance.

Topic model based dimension reduction can minimize the structural risk with limited training data. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised dual-PLSA which estimate topics with many kinds of observable data, i.e. labeled and unlabeled documents, supervised information about topics. c-w PLSA model is first proposed, in which word and class are observable variables and topic is latent. Then, two generative models, c-w PLSA and typical PLSA, are combined to share observable variables in order to utilize other observed data. Furthermore, supervised information about topic is employed. This is supervised dual-PLSA. Experiments show the dual-PLSA has a very fast convergence. Within 100 gold standard feedback, dual-PLSA's cumulative error rate drops to 9%. Its total error rate is 6.94%, which is the lowest among all the filters.

The state-of-the-art solution for QC is to employ a bridging classifier via an intermediate taxonomy. In this paper, we advanced the bridging method by leveraging probabilistic topic models. The topic model, referred as RCTM (Regularized Correlated Topic Model), is an extension of the conventional CTM (Correlated Topic Model). RCTM learns a topic model by leveraging weak supervision from existing annotated data rather than in an unsupervised fashion, and thus it can effectively address the problem in topic modeling while the topics are predefined. The experimental evaluations show that our QC approach outperforms other baseline methods.

The approach is capable of learning a compact and low dimensional representation for multiple visual categories from multiple view points without labeling of the training instances. The learnt object components range from local structures over line segments to global silhouette-like descriptions. This representation can be used to discover object categories in a totally unsupervised fashion. Furthermore we employ the representation as the basis for building a supervised multi-category detection system making efficient use of training examples and outperforming pure features-based representations. The proposed speed-ups make the system scale to large databases. Experiments on three databases show that the approach improves the state-of-the-art in unsupervised learning as well as supervised detection. In particular we improve the stateof-the-art on the challenging PASCAL'06 multi-class detection tasks for several categories.

Many scholars used the topic model to analyze the theme development, such as LDA. However, these methods need a pre-specified number of latent topics and manual topic labeling, which is usually difficult for people. Aiming to this problem, this paper proposes a method to analyze theme development with topic clustering. Different from the existing works, this paper uses the sliding window to cluster topics extracted in different time incrementally, the topic distance can be measured with KL-divergence. Some experiments on real data sets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

We propose an approach that can incorporate images with labels drawn from a semantic hierarchy, and can also readily cope with missing labels, and roughly-specified object boundaries. We introduce a new form of latent topic model, learning a novel context representation in the joint label-and-image space by capturing co-occurring patterns within and between image features and object labels. Given a topic, the model generates the input data, as well as a topic-dependent probabilistic classifier to predict labels for image regions. We present results on two real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements gained by including the coarsely labeled images.

We implemented two different models: a mixture language model and a topic model. For the language model, we focused on the question of how shallow features of text display information in an XML document can be used to enhance retrieval effectiveness. Our language model combined estimates based on element full-text and the compact representation of the element. We also used non-content priors, including the location the element appears in the original document, and the length of the element path, to boost retrieval effectiveness. For the topic model, we looked at a recent statistical model called Latent Dirichlet Allocation[1], and explored how it could be applied to XML retrieval.

When writing a research paper, researchers often cite oil the order of tens of references which do not provide the complete coverage of the research context especially when the targeted research is multidisciplinary. Author-topic profiling can help researchers discover a broader picture of their topic of interest including topical relationships and research community. We apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to generate multinomial distributions over words and topics to discover author-topic relations from text collections. As ail illustration, we apply the methodology to bibliographic abstracts related to Emerging Infectious Diseases (ElDs) research topic.

However various scene types need different camera calibration schemes. A few fixed scene modes oil digital camera to facilitate the users have been. proposed. These common scene modes(e.g. landscape, portrait, night scene, etc.) for daily use are optimized specific scenes and photographic conditions. When selected, a scene mode can often give better results than shooting in. fully automatic mode. In this paper an approach for automatic recognition of scene types based on semantic features is presented. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topic model is adopted to generate semantic features from Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) image descriptors. Semantic features in this approach are nor only a better dimensional representation for original image data, but also reports satisfactory classification performance oil datasets of complex scenes, especially for small size training sets. Furthermore, as it is not possible for fixing all scene hypes beforehand in camera, our approach gives an fine new scenes through a cluster-option for the users to de based retraining method, only several new training examples are. required. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective and flexible for automatic scene recognition in camera.

We formulate salient object sequence detection as energy minimization problem in a conditional random field framework, while static and dynamic salience, spatial and temporal coherence, global topic model are well defined and integrated to identify a salient object sequence. Dynamic programming algorithm is designed to resolve a global optimization, with a rectangle to represent each salient object.

To handle such information, statistical models that capture dependencies between named entities and topics can serve an important role. Although some relationships between who and where should be mentioned in such a document, no statistical topic models explicitly addressed the textual interactions between a who-entity and a where-entity. This paper presents a statistical model that directly captures dependencies between an arbitrary number of word types, such as who-entities, where-entities and topics, mentioned in each document. We show how this multi-type topic model performs better at making predictions on entity networks, in which each vertex represents an entity and each edge weight represents how a pair of entities at the incident vertices is closely related, through our experiments on predictions of who-entities and links between them.

However, for the task of retrieving annotated documents when using the LDA-based methods, some post-processing is required outside the model in order to make use of multiple word types that are specified by the annotations. In this paper, we explore new retrieval methods using a 'multitype topic model' that can directly handle multiple word types, such as annotated entities, category labels and other words that are typically used in Wikipedia. We investigate how to effectively apply the multitype topic model to retrieve documents from an annotated collection, and show the effectiveness of our methods through experiments on entity ranking using a Wikipedia collection.

Unsupervised discovery of visual object class hierarchies	2008 IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION, VOLS 1-12	PROCEEDINGS - IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	JUN 23-28, 2008	Anchorage, AK	IEEE Comp Soc				Objects in the world can be arranged into a hierarchy based on their semantic meaning (e.g. organism - animal - feline - cat). What about defining a hierarchy based on the visual appearance of objects? This paper investigates ways to automatically discover a hierarchical structure for the visual world from a collection of unlabeled images. Previous approaches for unsupervised object and scene discovery focused on partitioning the visual data into a set of non-overlapping classes of equal granularity. In this work, we propose to group visual objects using a multi-layer hierarchy tree that is based on common visual elements. This is achieved by adapting to the visual domain the generative Hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (hLDA) model previously used for unsupervised discovery of topic hierarchies in text. Images are modeled using quantized local image regions as analogues to words in text. Employing the multiple segmentation framework of Russell et al. [22], we show that meaningful object hierarchies, together with object segmentations, can be automatically learned from unlabeled and unsegmented image collections without supervision. We demonstrate improved object classification and localization performance using hLDA over the previous non-hierarchical method on the MSRC dataset [33].

This model is inspired by the hierarchical Gaussian process latent variable models (GP-LVM). DCTM is essentially a non-linear dimension reduction technique which is capable of (1) detecting topic evolution within a document corpus, (2) discovering topic correlations between document corpora, (3) monitoring topic and correlation trends dynamically. Unlike generative aspect models such like LDA, DCTM demonstrates a much faster converging rate with better model fitting to the data. We empirically assess our approach using 268,231 scientific documents, from the year 1988 to 2005. Posterior inferences suggest that DCTM is useful for capturing topic and correlation dynamics, as well as predicting their trends.	[Song, Yang; Giles, C.

To increase information sharing, organisational learning, decision-making and productivity, large amounts of unstructured text need to be analysed on a daily basis. Full text searching alone is not sufficient as a first approach to help users understand what a collection of electronic documents is about, since it does not provide the user with an overview of the underlying concepts in the document collection. A topic model is a useful mechanism for identifying and characterising various concepts embedded in a document collection allowing the user to navigate the collection in a topic-guided manner. Topics, made up of significant words, provide the user with an overview of the content of the document collection. Each document is represented as a mixture of automatically constructed topics and the user may select documents related to a specific topic of interest and vice versa. Similarities between documents may be found by looking at what documents are assigned to a specific topic enabling the user to find other documents related to a given document. This methodology enables users to digest a larger number of documents, assisting them in spending more of their time in actually reading than finding relevant information.	[Uys, J. W.; du Preez, N.

The idea is that for cluster ensemble we think every base clustering is not equally important, and thus we give the different weight to each base clustering and assume that the results of each base clustering is a multinomial ditribution. First, we state a soft cluster ensemble model of WLDA and the latent variables in WLDA is defined for cluster ensemble. Second, WLDA is inferred with variation approximation and EM algorithm for WLDA is stated. Third, we choose some dataset of large number of instances for experiment. Compared with MCLA, CSPA and HGPA, WLDA runs a better results and furthermore the outputs of WLDA can show the structure of data points.

It has many real-world applications and has recently attracted much attention. However, the existing methods are not versatile and entirely suit for the special requirements from academic area where the co-authorship and the citation relation play important roles in judging researchers' achievement. In this paper, we propose and develop a flexible data schema and a topic-sensitive co-pagerank algorithm for studying this problem. The main idea is measuring the authors' authorities with considering topics bias on the basis of their social networks and citation networks, and then, recommending expert candidates for the requests. To infer association between authors and topics, we derive a probability model on the basis of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. We further propose several techniques such as reasoning the interested topics of query, modeling author profile on the supporting documents to instruct the practices. Our experiments show that the proposed strategies are all effective to improve retrieval accuracy.

The probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) are popular paradigms of document models where word/document correlations are inferred by latent topics. In PLSA and LDA, the unseen words and documents are not explicitly represented at the same time. Model generalization is constrained. This paper presents the Bayesian latent topic clustering (BLTC) model for document representation. The posterior distributions combined by Dirichlet priors and multinomial distributions are not only calculated in document level but also in word level. The modeling of unseen words and documents is tackled. An efficient variational inference method based on Gibbs sampling is presented to calculate the posterior probability of complex variables. In the experiments on TREC and Reuters-21578, the proposed BLTC performs better than PLSA and LDA in model perplexity and classification accuracy.

Recently, probabilistic topic models, which were originally developed for text analysis, have been used for image categorization successfully Usually, "topics" which represent contents of an image is detected based on the underlying probabilistic model, then image categorization is carried out using topic distribution as the input feature. Typical method is to use k-nearest neighbor classifier based on L2-distance after topic discovery In the method, topic distribution is just treated as a feature point. In this paper, we propose a categorization method based on more natural use of the topic distribution, which is derived by using pLSA model. Categorization is carried out by estimating canditional probability p(category\data). We present two types of image categorization tasks, scene classification and document image segmentation, and show the proposed method performs very well. In addition, we also examine the performance of the proposed method under the situation where only the limited number of labeled examples are available. Me show our method can perforin quite well even in the circumstances.

Our novel method is based on the Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) model, which is a generative probabilistic topic model. Firstly, we gather images related to the given keywords from the Web with Web search engines. Secondly, we choose pseudo-training images from them by simple heuristic HTML analysis, and train our PLSA-based probabilistic model with them. Finally, we select relevant images from all the gathered images with the learned model. The experimental results shows that the results by the proposed method is almost equivalent to the results by existing methods, although our method does not need to prepare negative training samples in advance unlike existing methods.

However, LDA alone does not perform well in IR application. We alleviate it by biased parameter estimation, which makes the topics in LDA more independent than standard LDA. We introduced the background for the biased estimation at first. Then we detailed method for the bias estimation within LDA frame. We reported the result of the biased model in Ad hoc IR experiment showing that the biased estimation outperforms the basic EM method Finally, the influence of some model parameters was analysis briefly.

Though Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is one of the widely-used topic models for textual and image data, its Dirichlet distribution does not capture correlations between topics very well. To overcome the drawback, directed acyclic graph (DAG) and other algebra distribution, such as logistic normal distribution, were used to describe the correlations between topics. They are effective but relatively expensive. Avoiding repetition is a regular rule in English document, which was ignored in previous related works. We proposed a less expensive amend LDA model considering the avoiding repetition as a kind of topic correlations. We introduced the principium and concept of amend model based on related basic works at first. Then we describe the additive functions in details. We report the result of the adjusted model in Ad hoe IR experiment, which showed that the amend model outperform the basic LDA model. Finally, the influence of some model parameters was analysis briefly.
