We propose a novel semiblind Decision Feedback (DF) receiver based on the Maximum Likelihood (ML) principle that simultaneously exploits the transmission of training sequences and the statistical information concerning the unknown transmitted symbols. The Space Alternating Generalized Expectation Maximization (SAGE) algorithm allows an efficient iterative implementation of the receiver.

A new criterion for the selection of the linear receiver coefficients, based on the Maximum Likelihood (ML) principle, is derived and a practical implementation by means of a fast Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is suggested. The semiblind criterion is obtained from a purely statistical point of view where the aim of training data is not to enhance performance but to eliminate misconvergence problems.

In this paper we propose a novel approach to linear interference suppression based on the Maximum Likelihood (ML) principle. The method is termed semiblind because it simultaneously exploits the transmission of training sequences and the probability density function of the unknown transmitted symbols. A block-iterative algorithm based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) approach is proposed in order to obtain the filter coefficients. Computer simulations show that the resulting multiuser receiver exhibits a performance close to the linear Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) receiver.

The region in question comprises some 24 million hectares of land. This has resulted in a wide variety of stakeholders requesting quantitative information regarding historical, present and future trends in land condition and use. Historically, two methods have been widely used to obtain information: (1) surveys requesting land managers to provide estimates of land use and condition; and (2) human interpretation of aerial photography. Data obtained from the first approach has in the past been incomplete, inaccurate and non-spatial. The second approach is relatively expensive and as a result is incomplete and is not regularly updated. In this paper, we describe an approach to land use/condition monitoring using remotely sensed and other data such as digital elevation models (DEMs). We outline our methodology and give examples of mapping and monitoring change in woody vegetation and salinity.

In our approach, there are no limitations regarding if the person is white or black, once the model is able to learn automatically the ethny of the people involved. We propose to model the skin color in the chromatic subspace, which is by default normalized with respect to illumination. First, skin samples from both white and black people are collected. These samples are then used to estimate a parametric statistical model, which consists of a mixture of gaussian probability density functions (pdf's). Estimation is performed by a learning process based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In the following, experiments are carried out and receiving operating characteristics (ROC curves) are obtained to analyse the performance of the estimated model and compare it to outcomes of models that use a single gaussian density. Finally, conclusions are presented and future work is outlined.

J	Carroll, RB; Mair, BA				Carroll, RB; Mair, BA			A new model and reconstruction method for 2D PET based on transforming detector tube data into detector arc data	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL IMAGING AND VISION			English	Article						positron emission tomography; PET; image reconstruction; mathematical model	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION; ITERATIVE RECONSTRUCTION; ALGORITHMS; MAXIMUM; SCANNER	The popular Radon transform approximation used in the modeling and reconstruction of positron emission tomography (PET) images fails to account for the non-trivial size of PET detectors. Currently, all reconstruction algorithms which account for detector width are based on the iterative EMML (expectation maximization maximum likelihood) method which uses computational approximations of the true point spread function. Starting with the angle-of-view model for the point spread function, a new integral equation model is obtained by applying a simple linear transformation to the emission sinogram which produces detections in arcs of various widths, instead of the usual detector tubes. In this paper, an exact mathematical representation for the new point spread function is obtained in terms of line integrals involving the Green's function and Poisson kernel for the unit disk. By applying appropriate mathematical transforms, this representation leads to a method for reconstructing two dimensional PET images in terms of an orthogonal basis consisting of tensor products of classical harmonics and Bessel functions. The paper contains details of the mathematical derivation of the representation for the point spread function, and the resulting reconstruction technique. It also contains numerical results which indicate that this new method produces images which are comparable (and sometimes superior) in quality to the EMML method, with a reconstruction speed which is similar that of the filtered back projection method.

J	Cavanaugh, JE; Oleson, JJ				Cavanaugh, JE; Oleson, JJ			A diagnostic for assessing the influence of cases on the prediction of missing data	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES D-THE STATISTICIAN			English	Article						case deletion diagnostic; EM algorithm; forecasting; influence diagnostic; predictive influence function; time series	TIME-SERIES; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; REGRESSION; ALGORITHM; MODELS; VIEW; EM	An important aspect of statistical modelling involves the identification of cases that have a significant influence on certain Inferential results. In modelling problems where data are missing, the predicted values for the missing observations are frequently of interest. To assist in the identification of cases that substantially affect these predicted values, we introduce a case deletion diagnostic which is often conveniently evaluated in the setting of the EM algorithm. Our diagnostic is defined as the Kullback-Leibler information between two versions of the conditional density of the missing data given the observed data: one based on the parameter estimates arising from the full data set; the other based on the parameter estimates arising from the case-deleted data set. We outline the computation of the diagnostic for two Gaussian frameworks: for bivariate data applications In which some of the data pairs are incomplete, and for time series forecasting applications in which the missing observations are future realizations of the series. Our analyses involve bivariate data from the 1998 American Major League Baseball season and a time series consisting of cardiovascular mortality readings from the Los Angeles area.

In this paper, we propose unconditional maximum likelihood method for estimating direction. of arrival and angle parameters of near-field sources. However, calculation of ML estimation from corresponding likelihood function results in difficult nonlinear constraint optimization problem. We therefore employed Expectation/Maximization iterative method for obtaining ML estimates. The most important feature of the EM algorithm is that it decomposes the observed data into its components and then estimates the parameters of each signal component separately providing computationally efficient solution resulting optimization problem.

Since the direct maximum likelihood estimation of near-field source parameters results in complicated multi-parameter optimization problems, we reformulated the estimation problem in terms of actual-data sample, called the incomplete data and a hypothetical data set, called the complete data and then devised the Expectation/Maximization iterative method for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates. The performance analysis of the proposed algorithm is then carried out through the evaluation of Cramer-Rao bounds. Finally, some simulation results are presented.

EM algorithm is a well known recursive method for locating modes of a likelihood function which is characterized by simple implementation and stability. Unfortunately the slow convergence associated with EM makes it less attractive. The recently proposed SAGE algorithm, based on the same idea of data augmentation, preserves the advantage of simple implementation and has the potential to speed up convergence. Theoretical analysis shows that SAGE has faster convergence rate than EM under certain conditions. This conclusion is also supported by numerical experiments: carried out over a wide range of SNRs and different numbers of snapshots.

The EM algorithm is a general and popular numerical method for finding maximum likelihood estimates which has usually simple implementation and stable convergence. However, the computational cost caused by the slow convergence of the EM algorithm is still immense for the direction finding problem. Motivated by componentwise convergence of the EM algorithm, we suggest to use smaller search spaces after a few iterations. In this way, the overall computational cost can be reduced drastically. An adaptive procedure which determines the search spaces involved in the maximization (M) step is proposed. With numerical experiments we demonstrate the improvement of computational efficiency by using the proposed algorithm.

However, it is impractical to measure network traffic at all points in the network. A promising alternative is to measure only at the edge of the network and infer internal behavior from these measurements. In this paper we concentrate on the estimation and localization of internal delays based on end-to-end delay measurements from sources to receivers. We develop an EM algorithm for computing MLEs of the internal delay distributions in cases where the network dynamics are stationary over the observation period. For time-varying cases, we propose a sequential Monte Carlo procedure capable of tracking non-stationary delay characteristics. Simulations are included to demonstrate the promise of these techniques.

The method is a three-stage procedure: 1) Exclusion of background and skull voxels using threshold-based region growing techniques with fully automated seed selection. 2) Expectation Maximization algorithms are used to estimate the probability density function (PDF) of the remaining pixels, which are assumed to be mixtures of gaussians. These pixels can then be classified into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white matter and grey matter. Using this procedure, our method takes advantage of using the full covariance matrix (instead of the diagonal) for the joint PDF estimation. On the other hand, logistic discrimination techniques are more robust against violation of multi-gaussian assumptions. 3) A priori knowledge is added using Markov Random Field techniques. The algorithm has been tested with a dataset of 30 brain MRI studies (co-registered T1 and T2 MRI). Our method was compared with clustering techniques and with template-based statistical segmentation, using manual segmentation as a 'gold-standard'. Our results were more robust and closer to the gold-standard.

The first scheme is multistage iterative alternative detection of the users of the two groups combined with interference cancellation. The bit-error rate performance analysis of this scheme using Gaussian approximation is also derived and it is shown that this scheme is the realization of the Space Altering Generalized Expectation Maximization Algorithm known in signal processing literature. As an improvement for the shortcomings of the first scheme in near-far situations, group orthogonal sequence allocation scheme is introduced. It is demonstrated that it can lead to efficient optimal multi-user detection. It is also shown that if all groups of sequences attain the Welch bound for the sum of squared sequence correlation coefficients than the optimal joint multi-user detection maximizes the sum capacity of the channel.

The developed receiver uses an iterative algorithm based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm instead of using the standard maximum likelihood (ML) procedure, Direct application of the ML procedure to this problem results in a complex and unpractical receiver due to the unavailability of an efficient way to perform the maximization of the likelihood function. The iterative algorithm used in the receiver reduces the complexity and performs the task of that has been previously too complex to perform. Simulations are performed to validate the theoretical developments and to measure the performance of the algorithm. The performance of the algorithm is measured in terms of the normalized mean square error of estimation.

Though such auxiliary features are considered to be the factors that degrade the performance of speech recognizers, the proposed MR-HMM adapts its model parameters, i.e. mean vectors of output probability distributions, depending on these auxiliary information to improve the recognition accuracy. Formulation for parameter reestimation of MR-HMM based on the EM algorithm is given in the paper. Experiments of speaker-dependent isolated word recognition demonstrated that MR-HMMs using F-0 based auxiliary features reduced the error rates by more than 20% compared with the conventional HMMs.	Japan Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Tatsuno Kuchi, Ishikawa 9231292, Japan	Fujinaga, K (reprint author), Japan Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Tatsuno Kuchi, Ishikawa 9231292, Japan.

The similarity between two sample data is defined as the probability that the two samples are classified into the same cluster. In practice, assuming the various mixture models and estimating each set of model parameters by using the EM algorithm, every sample is classified into each appropriate cluster for every reasonable model, and then the similarity is evaluated. This similarity measure can be consistent with the categorization and clustering based on the same mixture model.

We consider the situation where the mean of the unknown quantity being measured is different within subgroups of the population. Method of moments and maximum likelihood estimators are considered for estimating the parameters in the model. Large sample inference is facilitated by the derivation of the asymptotic variances. An application to a data set which indeed motivated the consideration of such general model and was obtained by measuring the heights of a group of trees with five different instruments is considered.

This model can be seen as a two-stage hierarchical model with local and global predictors. This parameter-driven model causes the counts within a cluster to share a common latent factor and to be correlated. Maximum likelihood (ml) estimation based on an EM algorithm for the model is discussed. Simulation study is carried out to assess the benefit of using mi estimates compared to a standard Poisson regression analysis that ignores the within cluster correlation.

While most previous methods premised mixtures of a few sounds and had difficulty dealing with such complex signals, our method can estimate the F0 of the melody and bass lines without assuming the number of sound sources in compact-disc recordings. In this paper we propose the following three extensions to our previous PreFEst to make it more adaptive and flexible: introducing multiple harmonic-structure tone models, estimating the shape of tone models. and introducing a prior distribution of its shape and F0 estimates. These extensions were implemented by the MAP (Maximum A Posteriori Probability) estimation by using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Experimental results with compact-disc recordings showed that our real-time system based on the extended PreFEst achieved performance improvement.

A generic body model is first adapted to the specific person geometry. Then, the mean square error between the synthetic depth image, produced by model rendering, and the original depth image is minimized using the Downhill Simplex minimization method. Use of this error norm is seen to yield improved results, when compared to two alternative error norms, which were also evaluated. Results are presented for the specific application, where six animation parameters of the arm and the palm are estimated. In this application, an initial estimate is obtained by applying an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which identifies three arm parts and two joint positions (elbow, wrist). A significant advantage of this procedure is that the resulting information can be exploited for reducing the search space and for automatic scale adaptation of each body part.

We here extend an information theortic extremal property for source coding from Gaussian sources to Gauss mixtures using high rate quantization theory and extend a method originally used for LPC speech vector quantization to provide a Lloyd clustering approach to the design of Gauss mixture models. The theory provides formulas relating minimum discrimination information (MDI) for model selection and the mean squared error resulting when the MDI criterion is used in an optimized robust classifed vector quantizer. It also provides motivation for the use of Gauss mixture models for robust compression systems for general random vectors.

To make it practical, we apply a deterministic annealing algorithm to the method in order to avoid the dependence of the MAP estimate on the initial conditions. The Bayesian reconstruction method used a novel pointwise prior in the form of a mixture of gamma distributions. The prior models the object as comprising voxels whose values (attenuation coefficients) cluster into a few classes (e.g. soft tissue, lung, bone). This model is particularly applicable to transmission tomography since the attenuation map is usually well-clustered and the approximate values of attenuation coefficients in each region are known. The algorithm is implemented as two alternating procedures, a regularized likelihood reconstruction and a mixture parameter estimation. The Bayesian reconstruction algorithm can be effective, but has the problem of sensitivity to initial conditions since the overall objective is non-convex. To make it more practical, it is important to avoid such dependence on initial conditions. Here, we implement a deterministic annealing (DA) procedure on the alternating algorithm. We present the Bayesian reconstructions with/out DA and show the independence of initial conditions with DA.

We show that just the same algorithm as the GMDD can be derived from a modified objective function of Fuzzy c-Means (FCM) clustering with the regularizer by K-L information, only when ;the parameter lambda equals 2. Although the fixed-point iteration scheme of FCM is similar to that of the GMDD, the FCM has more flexible structure since the algorithm is based on the objective function method. In a slightly different manner such as installing a deterministic annealing or an addition of Gustafson and Kessel's constraint, the proposed algorithm is likely to provide more valid clustering results.

The expectation - maximization (EM) algorithm is employed for code delay acquisition. It is shown that the systematic application of EM on the flat-fading channel yields a parallel interference cancellation (PIC)-based technique for acquisition. On the frequency-selective channel, it is necessary to jointly estimate both the code delays and multipath coefficients. The EM approach in this latter case yields an algorithm that combines PIC with an eigendecomposition/eigenvalue maximization step for channel identification.

Its applications therein include the EM algorithm, Bayesian estimation and Bayesian inference. Jensen computes simple lower bounds on otherwise intractable quantities such as products of sums and latent log-likelihoods. This simplification then permits operations like integration and maximization. Quite often (i.e. in discriminative learning) upper bounds are needed as well. We derive and prove an efficient analytic inequality that provides such variational upper bounds. This inequality holds for latent variable mixtures of exponential family distributions and thus spans a wide range of contemporary statistical models. We also discuss applications of the upper bounds including maximum conditional likelihood, large margin discriminative models and conditional Bayesian inference. Convergence, efficiency and prediction results are shown.	MIT, Media Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA	Jebara, T (reprint author), MIT, Media Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.

The PET images can be reconstructed by iterative methods, e.g., the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The computation-bound problem is expected to be exacerbated due to the ever-increasing demand for faster image reconstruction and higher resolution PET images. As Java technology matures, a number of parallel/distributed applications are implemented in Java because of its rich sets of packages. In this paper, we propose the design and implementation of component-based parallel software system to facilitate the PET image reconstruction process on a clustered environment. Performance issues are addressed in the design of the system, which are essential to the success of any parallel computing environment. The system introduces Java Bean component model and class libraries which are written in Java and that run on any machine that implements the Java Virtual Machine. it is user friendly and its operation requires little software/hardware knowledge from the user.

The switching linear model using active contour model well corresponds to temporal shapes and motions of hands. Inference in the switching linear model is computation ally intractable, and therefore the learning process cannot be performed via the exact EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm. However, we present an approximate EM algorithm using a collapsing method in which some Gaussians are merged into a single Gaussian. Tracking is performed through the forward algorithm based on Kalman filtering and the collapsing method. We also present the regularized smoothing which plays a role of reducing jump changes between the training sequences of state vectors to cope with complex-variable hand shapes. The recognition process is performed by the selection of a model with the maximum likelihood from some learned models while tracking is being performed. Experiments for several shape-changing hand gestures are demonstrated.

Based on this correlation model, it can be proved that expressing the probability of a sequence of observations as a product of probabilities of decorrelated individual observations doesn't require the assumption of frame independence. Under the maximum likelihood (ML) criteria, we also derived re-estimation formulae for the parameters (mean vectors, covariance matrix, and diagonal regression matrice) of the new HMMs using an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. From the formulae, it's interesting to see that the new HMMs have extended the standard HMMs by relaxing the frame independence limitation. Initial experiment conducted on WSJ20K task shows an encouraging performance improvement with only 117 additional parameters in all.

The intrinsic structures, like the number of clusters, are key issues of data mining. In this paper, we propose some genetic-guided model-based clustering techniques to determine the optimal number of clusters and the characteristics of these clusters automatically. The model-based clustering techniques are used to describe the clusters and tune their descriptions, while genetic algorithms lead the search to some promising search space. Several clustering-specific genetic operators ore developed to enhance the search procedure. The simulation results, on both synthetic and real-life data sets, demonstrate that our proposed clustering techniques outperform two widely-used model-based clustering algorithms.

Mixture models are a class of generative models particularly suitable for clustering. They assume that each data sample stems from one of a set of sources that generate data independently. It is then desirable to model the data with a mixture of "experts" corresponding to the sources. The experts cannot be fit to data autonomously, since each of them needs to know the contribution of the others. In this paper we introduce a mixture of autonomous experts model that approximates the plain mixture density model but consists of experts that learn autonomously. Each expert stores simplified representations of the other experts and uses them to judge the contribution of the others. The representations are updated intermittently. During learning the task becomes divided and conquered automatically.

This can be done by means of experiments or simulations. When the time history of the loads is known, it should be transformed into a form that is suitable for the prediction of the fatigue damage. This fatigue damage of the structure depends heavily on the load cycles that are included in the load time history. Load cycles are extracted from the load time history with different counting methods. A rainflow counting method is widely used in the automotive industry. The rainflow counting method results in a matrix I of the relative frequencies of the load cycles, which are included in the load time history. With an approximation of the rainflow matrix by a continuous probability density function, random fluctuations of the relative frequencies are reduced and an extrapolation of the probability of the load cycles that were not actually recorded is made possible. In our paper a method of modelling the rainflow matrices by means of a mixture of Gaussian functions will be presented. Unknown parameters of the normal mixture will be estimated with a maximum-likelihood method. The effectiveness of this method will be presented and discussed with an example of the load time histories of a real structure. (C) 2001 Journal of Mechanical Engineering. All rights reserved.

We use the differential epipolar constraint to measure the consistency of the local flow estimates with 3D rigid body, motion and employ a probabilistic interpretation of the overall flow field in terms of mixture models. The estimation of 3D motion parameters as well as the refinement of the initial motion segmentation is carried out using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The algorithm is guaranteed to improve the overall likelihood of the data. The proposed technique is a step towards estimation of 3D motion of independently moving objects in the presence of egomotion.

In this paper, a new word recognition method is proposed, that takes into consideration the dependency of deformation between characters. The stochastic model used in our method. which is to sav a bigram model of character patterns, is constructed on the assumption that there is a Markovian property underlying in the deformation of a character string, and has a learning algorithm based nn the EM algorithm. Experimental results in ZIP code recognition show effectiveness of our method.

This paper proposes a method for estimation of not only rigid-body motion such as gross head motion, but also non-rigid-body motion like pulsatile blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow. Our method estimates these types of movements by using optical flow on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We extend generalized gradient schemes in order to compute probability distributions of optical flow. The crux of our method is to compute optical flow on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Although many other methods assume that the subject movement is rigid-body motion, our method does not require this assumption. We demonstrate that the detection of brain activation areas can be improved by motion correction based on our method.

An alternative is measurement of diagnostic reliability as relative percent agreement (RPA). A large set of mammograms read with and without computer aided diagnosis (CAD) was used to compare the ROC area (Az) using proof and RPA using agreement. A subset of 767 (416 normal and 351 abnormal) cases read by 5 generalists and 5 mammographers; was selected from the readings on 900 proved mammograms read with and without CAD. The Az was calculated using the multireader-multicase (MRMC) method. The RPA was calculated from a mixture distribution analysis (MDA) using the EM algorithm. Individual reader values were calculated by a jackknife procedure. With and without CAD the Az was .90 and .88 for the mammographers (p=.04) and .87 and .86 for the generalists (p=.5). The RPA was 90 and 83 for mammographers (p=.08) and 82 and 85 for generalists (p=.3). The correlation between Az and RPA was 0.6. The larger variance of the R-PA decreases statistical power. The NMA may be a useful method for comparing imaging modalities in clinical studies where definitive proof can not be obtained.

It explicitly takes several main affecting factors as multiplicative companding parameters and estimates all model parameters by an EM algorithm. Experimental results showed that the variance of the observed syllable duration was greatly reduced from 183.4 frame(2) (1 frame = 5 ms) to 18.5 frame(2) by eliminating effects from these affecting factors. Besides, the estimated companding values of these affecting factors agreed well to our prior linguistic knowledge. A preliminary study of applying the proposed model to predict syllable duration for TTS is also performed. Experimental results showed that it outperformed the conventional regressive prediction method. Lastly, an extension of the approach to incorporate initial and final duration modeling is presented. This leads to a better understanding of the relation between the companding factors of initial and final duration models and those of syllable duration model.

Each entry is organized into a hierarchy of senses, which include definitions, labels and cited quotations. Subject labels distinguish the subject classification of a sense, for example they signal how a word may be used in Anthropology, Music or Computing. Unfortunately subject labeling in the dictionary is incomplete. To overcome this incompleteness, we attempt to classify the senses (i.e., definitions) in the dictionary by their subjects, using the citations as an information guide. We report on four different approaches: k Nearest Neighbors, a standard classification technique; Term Weighting, an information retrieval method dealing with text; Naive Bayes, a probabilistic method; and Expectation Maximization, an iterative probabilistic method. Experimental performance of these methods is compared based on standard classification metrics.

For diffuse targets, this process is zero-mean complex Gaussian. The data consists of a realization of this process, observed through a linear transformation, and corrupted by additive noise. Image formation corresponds to estimating the elements of a diagonal covariance matrix. In general, maximum-likelihood estimates of these parameters cannot be computed in closed form. Snyder, O'Sullivan, and Miller proposed an expectation-maximization algorithm for computing these estimates iteratively. Straightforward implementations of the algorithm involve multiplication and inversion operations on extremely large matrices, which makes them computationally prohibitive. We present an implementation which exploits Strassen's recursive strategy for matrix multiplication and inversion, which may make the algorithm feasible for image sizes of interest in high-resolution radar applications.

Transportation researchers usually assume only one uncertainty for travel choice behavior modeling, and the assumption is based on that travelers of their sample present a homogeneous population. However, traveler perceptions. may differ at the individual level of familiarity with the network attributes Therefore, it is important to consider the heterogeneity of traveler perceptions in sample data and to employ a different methodology by their uncertainty types, In this paper, a latent class clustering modelin approach is applied or considering the heterogeneity of traveler perceptions in sample data. In addition, random utility models and fuzzy reasoning models considering the heterogeneity are developed to find an appropriate model by the types of uncertainty, All results of the paper emphasize the necessity ora combined model, which can consider the randomness and the vagueness uncertainty simultaneously.

Chemiluminescence and fluorescence are emerging as promising tools for these tasks. These molecules emit optical photons that can be observed outside the body. Unfortunately, they are heavily scattered and absorbed in biological tissue. This is an obstacle for determining a way of mapping an original source distribution. In order to overcome this obstacle, we suggest a new concept, Optical Emission Computed Tomography(OpECT) and test its feasibility with computer simulation.

The proposed algorithm iterates between a symbol estimator, which uses tentative channel estimates to provide soft symbol estimates, and a channel estimator, which uses the symbol estimates to improve the channel estimates. The proposed algorithm shares some similarities with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm but with lower complexity and better convergence properties. Specifically, the complexity of the proposed scheme is linear in the memory of the equalizer, and it avoids most of the local maxima that trap the EM algorithm.

First, we propose a maximum-likelihood (ML) receiver for STBC-OFDM systems based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. By assuming that the fading processes remain constant over the duration of one STBC code word, and by exploiting the orthogonality property of the STBC as well as the OFDM modulation, we show that the EM-based receiver has a very low computational complexity, and that the initialization of the EM receiver is based on the linear minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) channel estimate for both the pilot and the data transmission. Since the actual fading processes may vary within one STBC code word, we also analyze the effect of a modelling mismatch on the receiver performance, and show both analytically and through simulations that the performance degradation due to such a mismatch is negligible for practical Doppler frequencies. We further propose a Turbo receiver based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP)-EM algorithm for STBC-OFDM systems with outer channel coding. Compared with the previous non-iterative receiver employing a decision-directed linear channel estimator, the iterative receivers proposed here significantly improve the receiver performance and can approach the ML performance in typical wireless channels with very fast fading, at a reasonable computational complexity well suited for real-time implementations.

The method is purely structural, that is to say it uses only the edge or connectivity structure of the graph and does not draw on node or edge attributes. We make two contributions. Commencing from a probability distribution for matching errors, we show how the problem of graph-matching can be posed as maximum likelihood estimation using the apparatus of the EM algorithm. Our second contribution is to cast the recover), of correspondence matches between the graph-nodes in a matrix framework. This allows us to efficiently recover correspondence matches using singular value decomposition. We experiment with the method on both real-world and synthetic data, Here we demonstrate that the method offers comparable performance to more computationally demanding methods.

The objective of this algorithm is to maximize the normalized frame likelihood of training data. Instead of gradient descent techniques usually applied for objective function optimization in other discriminative algorithms such as Minimum Classification Error (MCE) and Maximum Mutual Information (MMI), we used a modified Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm which greatly simplifies and speeds up the training procedure. Evaluation experiments showed better recognition rates compared to both the Maximum Likelihood (ML) training method and MCE/GPD discriminative method. In addition,the MNLE algorithm showed better generalization abilities and was faster than MCE/GPD.

In the current approach, the coefficients are endowed with a probabilistic model. Gradient ascent updates to coefficient probabilities are computable using recursions developed by means of the EM algorithm. Reduced-complexity approximations are also developed by reducing the number of coefficients propagated at each stage.

This method finds a maximum-likelihood estimate of the distortion without a priori knowledge of the microphone characteristics by using the expectation-maximization algorithm. The autoregressive signal model coefficients are solved jointly with the nonlinearity estimate created by an extended Kalman filter. Also, a new family of nonlinear functions is developed for use with this algorithm, although the method can estimate the shape of any parametric zero-memory nonlinearity. These nonlinear distortions can degrade speech recognition rates, yet lower the perceptual quality only slightly.

In a first step unsupervised clustering in the color and position space is performed in order to separate the objects. The clusters are handed over to the feature extraction, which is basically a polar subsampling and finally rotation invariant Markov models are trained on those features. After presenting a query object, the HMMs which represent the individual clusters in the images are matched against the feature sequence calculated on the query image. Those database elements whose corresponding Markov models generated the highest similarity scores are retrieved. Three different clustering techniques, namely k-means clustering, LBG-algorithm and EM-algorithm are evaluated. Retrieval efficiencies up to 56.25% have been achieved on this challenging task.

First, an iterative joint maximum likelihood (ML) phase estimator and data detector is derived using conditional maximization steps. Secondly, an iterative joint ML nondata-aided (NDA) phase and power spectral density estimator is derived for uncoded and coded transmitted signals. The main difference between the approaches is that the first estimator uses hard decisions whereas the second estimator uses soft decisions about the data symbols at each iteration. Furthermore, the mean-squared performance of the second estimator is approximated by the inverse of the empirical observed Fisher information. Finally, it is shown that the recursive approximations of both estimators lead to the Costas type of loops introduced earlier in the literature.

Given a set of time correlated frames, ve attempt to extract a reduced number of image-like data structures which are semantically meaningful and that have the ability of representing the sequence evolution. To this end, ive present a generative model which involves jointly the representation and the evolution of appearance. Applying Linear Dynamical System theory to this problem, ve discuss how the temporal information is encoded yielding a manner of grouping the iconic representations of the video sequence in terms of invariance. The formulation of this problem is driven in terms of a probabilistic approach, which affords a measure of perceptual similarity taking both learned appearance and time evolution models into account.

In the paper a method for the complete mixture initialization based on a product kernel estimate of probability density function is proposed. The mixture components are assumed here to correspond to local maxima of optimally smoothed kernel density estimate. The gradient method is used for local extrema finding. Then, local extrema are grouped together to form component candidates and these are merged by the 4hierarchical clustering method. Finally, the initial mixture parameters are estimated. A comparison to scale-space approaches for finding of the number of components is given on examples.

Int Neural Network Soc, IEEE, Neural Networks Council				Density estimation based on a mixture of Gaussian components is particularly, suited to the solution of function approximation problems. When dealing with numerical examples of the function to be approximated, the corresponding neural network architecture can be trained by using a clustering procedure based on the well-known EM algorithm. However, the latter is characterized by some serious drawbacks that we overcome in this paper, For instance, we propose a constructive procedure that increases progressively, the number of Gaussian components; it yields improvements of both the speed and the quality of the EM convergence. Moreover, it also drastically reduces the computational cost of the optimization procedure that we further propose in order to select automatically the optimal number of Gaussian components of the neural network. The performance of the proposed approach is compared in the paper with respect to well-known neural network approaches.

The technique involves scalar-quantizing and entropy-coding pixels sequentially, such that the quantizer's offset is always chosen to minimize the expected number of bits emitted for each pixel, where the expectation is based on the predictive distribution used for entropy coding. To accomplish this, information is fed back from the entropy coder's statistical modeling unit to the quantizer. This feedback path is absent in traditional compression schemes. Encouraging but preliminary experimental results are presented comparing the technique with JPEG and with fixed-offset quantization on a scanned grayscale text image.

These classical methods generally work on the assumption that this latter test is perfect, i.e., its sensitivity and specificity are equal to one. Most of the time, no real "gold standard" is available. This can seriously bias the estimation of the diagnostic values of the challenged tests. In the absence of a "gold standard", statistical methods are available for the estimation of the accuracy of diagnostic tests. These approaches assume that the infectious status of the individuals is unknown, but may be estimated from their result pattern; these models are referred to as "latent class models". Maximum likelihood methods may then be used for the estimation of the diagnostic values and the disease prevalence within the population(s). This paper describes the development of functions for this purpose, implemented in S-Plus and R software: these functions may incorporate data obtained from several populations, using several tests, and may take into account data obtained from reference population(s), i.e, population(s) with a known infectious status (infected or disease-free), if available. Two estimation methods are used: the classical Newton-Raphson procedure, and an Expectation-Maximisation (EM) procedure. Test independence is assumed conditionally on the infectious status of the individual, as is constant test performance within each population. Use of a goodness-of-tit statistic and the residuals of pairwise correlation coefficients are proposed as checks for validity of these assumptions. These functions, available on request from the author, can help epidemiologists in this important field of test validation.

The method of measurement results processing was proposed, what resulted in the considerable reduction of the measured data errors level. The errors were classified as following: impulse disturbances, stochastic scatter of measurement results and errors resulting from the limitation of the field strength measurement instrument sensibility. The scope of applicability of the image reconstruction methods in electromagnetic geotomography was characterised. For this purpose, the following algorithms were selected: EM (expectation maximisation), MAP (non-linear maximum a posteriori probability) and RAMLA (Row-Action Maximum Likelihood Algorithm). The results of the image reconstruction of the electromagnetic waves attenuation distribution investigated in two different regions were illustrated. The comparative characteristics of the utilisation effectiveness of the particular algorithms for the mentioned purpose was presented.

Ill posedness is solved by penalizing, the likelihood function. In the Bayesian framework, it amounts to incorporating an inverted gamma prior in the likelihood function. A penalized version of the Em algorithm is derived, which is, still explicit and which intrinsically assures that the estimates are not singular. Numerical evidence of the latter property is put forward with a test.

We estimate a matrix whose entries represent similarity probabilities between local motion estimates. We adopt a two step iterative algorithm which consists of a variant of the expectation-maximization algorithm for segmenting regions with similar motion. The proposed algorithm updates cluster memberships in one step while it maximizes the expected log-likelihood in the second step. The performance of the algorithm is improved greatly by the use of modal sharpening.

To obtain an image of the sky sources one has to treat mathematically the detected image, usually by correlating it with a reconstruction array (correlation methods). Unfortunately this kind of methods, although quite fast, have some limitations in the reconstructed image and in handling the real telescope response. To improve these results, several reconstruction methods have been developed and used. In the case of LEGRI (a gamma -ray coded-mask telescope developed for the University of Valencia) we have used the EM algorithm, an iterative maximum likelihood algorithm with very good response and with good handling of the telescope response.

The model construction is based on the model validation philosophy of architecture selection [8]. In contrast with the k-means clustering approach, the number of segments in the proposed scheme is determined completely automatically. We show that the modelling method can be strengthened by, incorporating spatial contextual information. The proposed approach speeds tip the modelling process by a factor of three. The advocated methodology is successfully applied to the problem of lip pixel segmentation in face images.

The algorithm resolves the received signals at each antenna into components corresponding to each path for every user. Estimated components are combined for obtaining the next sequence estimate for all users, and thus, no signal energy is lost. Sequence estimation is based on convex set maximization of the likelihood function termed the generalized decorrelator approach. The continuous log-likelihood maximization technique used here is the expectation-maximization approach to parameter estimation, for superimposed signals introduced by Feder and Weinstein. Its resulting solution embodies an iterative non-quantized signal path estimator and an MMSE channel estimator.

IEEE Comp Soc, Tech Comm Pattern Anal & Machine Intelligence			EM ALGORITHM; IMAGES	Non-rigid image registration is a prerequisite for many medical image analysis applications such as image fusion of multi-modality images and quantitative change analysis of a temporal sequence in computer-aided diagnosis. By establishing the point correspondence of the extracted feature points, it is possible to recover the deformation using nonlinear interpolation methods such as the thin-plate-spline approach. However it is a difficulty task to establish exact point correspondence due to the high complexity of nonlinear deformation existed in medical images. lit this paper, a mixture of principal axes registration (mPAR) method is proposed to resolve the correspondence problem through a neural computational approach. The novel feature of mPAR is to align two point sets without needing to establish explicit point correspondence. Instead, it aligns the two point sets by minimizing the relative entropy between their probability distributions resulting in a maximum likelihood estimate of the transformation matrix. The registration process consists of: (1) a finite mixture scheme to establish all improved point correspondence and (2) a multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP) to recover the nonlinear deformation. The neural computation for registration used a committee machine to obtain a mixture of piece-wise rigid registrations, which gives a reliable point correspondence using multiple extracted objects in a finite mixture scheme. Then the MLP is used to determine the coefficients of a polynomial transform using extracted cross points of elongated structures as control points. We have applied our mPAR method to a temporal sequence of mammograms of a single patient. The experimental results show that mPAR not only improves the accuracy of the point correspondence but also results in a desirable error-resilience property for control point selection errors.

In this paper we define a stochastic compositional model that synthesizes these two approaches: an observation is modeled as a constrained linear combination of random vectors. Parameters of the model are estimated using an iterative expectation-maximization maximum likelihood algorithm. The model may be used to estimate fractional abundances of the classes and to estimate the most likely contributor to each observation from each class. Anomaly and likelihood ratio detection algorithms are derived from the model. The linear mixture model and the stochastic compositional model are applied to simulated data and the abundance estimation error and anomaly detection performance are compared.

Conventional trackers are point trackers, and point measurement estimation procedures pose problems for tracking signal energy that is distributed across many sensor cells. Such signals are sometimes termed "over-resolved." Large arrays provide greater resolution with the potential for improved detection and classification performance, but higher resolution is in direct conflict with tracking over-resolved signals. The Histogram-Probabilistic Multi-Hypothesis Tracker (H-PMHT) algorithm addresses these issues and provides a means for modeling and tracking signals that are spread across several contiguous sensor cells. H-PMHT models the cell responses as a received energy histogram, and the probability density underlying this histogram is modeled by a mixture density. Elements of the H-PMHT signal model, theory; and algorithm are presented for linear Gauss-Markov targets. Tracking examples using simulated azimuth beam data are presented.

In this scheme, speech line spectral frequencies (LSF) are modeled as i.i.d realizations of a multivariate Gaussian mixture density. The mixture model parameters are efficiently estimated using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. An efficient quantization scheme using transform coding and bit allocation techniques which allows for easy and computationally efficient mapping from observation to quantized value is developed for both fixed rate and variable rate systems. An attractive feature of this method is that source encoding using the resultant codebook involves very few searches and its computational complexity is minimal and independent of the rate of the system. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is bit scalable and can switch between memoryless and quantizer with memory seamlessly. The performance of the memoryless quantizer is 2-3 bits better than conventional quantization schemes.

The model attempts to explain observed transition probabilities by a latent mobility table and a set of transition probabilities from latent classes to observed classes. The model captures asymmetry in observed mobility tables by asymmetric latent mobility tables. It may be viewed as a special case of both the latent class model and DEDICOM with special constraints. A maximum penalized likelihood (MPL) method was developed for parameter estimation. The EM algorithm was adapted for the MPL estimation. An example was given to illustrate the proposed method.

IEMA introduces the evolutionary algorithm and EM algorithm into the process of incremental learning, can not only avoid getting into local maxima, but also incrementally learn Bayesian networks with high accuracy in presence of missing values and hidden variables. In addition, we improved the incremental learning process by Friedman et al. The experimental results verified the validity of IEMA. In terms of storage cost, IEMA is comparable with the incremental learning method of Friedman et al, while it is more accurate.

The aim is to estimate some parameter of the distribution of the complete data. In this situation, the stochastic version of the EM algorithm is sometimes a viable option. It is an iterative algorithm that produces an ergodic Markov chain on the parameter space. The stochastic EM (StEM) estimator is then a sample from the equilibrium distribution of this chain. Recently, a method called 'coupling from the past' was invented to generate a Markov chain in equilibrium. We investigate when this method can be used for a StEM chain and give examples where this is indeed possible.

In this approach, a signal prior is set up by modeling the image wavelet coefficients as independent Gaussian mixture random variables. We first specify a uniform (non-informative) prior distribution on the mixing parameters, which leads to a simple and efficient iterative algorithm for MAP estimation. This algorithm is similar to the EM algorithm in that it alternates between a state estimation step and a maximization step. Moreover, we show that our algorithm converges monotonically to a local maximum of the posterior distribution. We next generalize the result to non-uniform priors and develop an efficient integer programming algorithm that enables a similar alternating optimization procedure.

Typical media descriptors, such as texture features, are high dimensional and are not uniformly distributed in the feature space. The performance of many existing methods degrade if the data is not uniformly distributed. The proposed method offers an efficient solution to this problem. First, the data's marginal distribution along each dimension is characterized using a Gaussian mixture model. The parameters of this model are estimated using the well known Expectation-Maximization (EM) method. These model parameters can also be estimated sequentially for on-line updating. Using the marginal distribution information, each of the data dimensions can be partitioned such that each bin contains approximately an equal number of objects. Experimental results on a real image texture data set are presented. Comparisons with existing techniques, such as the well known VA-File, demonstrate a significant overall improvement.

This problem, could be alleviated by self-supervised learning techniques, which take a hybrid of labeled and, unlabeled training data to learn classifiers. Discriminant-EM (D-EM) proposed a framework for such tasks and current D-EM algorithm employed linear discriminant analysis. However. the algorithm. is limited by its dependence on linear transformations. This paper extends the linear D-EM to nonlinear kernel algorithm. Kernel D-EM. based on. kernel multiple discriminant analysis (KMDA). KMDA provides better ability to simplify the probabilistic structures of data distributions in a discrimination space. We propose two novel data-sampling schemes for efficient training of kernel discriminants. Experimental results show that classifiers using KMDA learning compare with SVM performance on standard benchmark tests, and that Kernel D-EM outperforms a variety of supervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms for a, hand-gesture recognition task, and fingertip tracking task.

Wavelet coefficients are modeled independently and identically by a two-state Gaussian mixture model, while their spatial dependence is characterized by a Markov random field imposed on the hidden state of Gaussian mixtures. The EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm is used to estimate hyperparameters which specify the mixture model, and simulated annealing is implemented to optimize the state configuration. The noise-free wavelet coefficients are finally estimated by a shrinkage function based on local weighted averaging of the Bayesian estimator. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms standard wavelet denoising techniques in terms of MSE measure. It also achieves better performance than the refined Lee filter in the case of low noise levels.

At each frame, the method generates a set of samples, approximating the posterior distribution of speech and noise parameter given observation sequences till the current frame. Explicit model representing noise effects on speech features is used, so that an extended Kalman filter is constructed in each sample, generating updated continuous state as the estimation of the noise parameter, and prediction likelihood as the weight of each sample for minimum mean square error inference of the time-varying noise parameter over these samples. A selection step and a smoothing step are used to improve efficiency. Through experiments, we observed significant performance improvements, over that achieved by noise compensation with stationary noise assumption. It also performed better than the sequential EM algorithm in Machinegun noise.

Based on this model, an unsupervised multiresolution segmentation algorithm in Wavelet-Domain is proposed. We use a Gaussian mixture model to characterize wavelet coefficients at each scale and each subband. We also use the Markov Random Field (MRF) to model the class label of each wavelet coefficient. The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate the parameters of this model directly from images. Ultimately the multiresolution classifications are fused by the Hybrid Contextual Labeling Tree (HCLT) to obtain a reliable and accurate segmentation.

This paper proposes a method to compensate the variation in handset characteristics, In the method, a number of Gaussian mixture models axe independently trained to identify the most likely handset given a test utterance. The identified handset is used to select a compensation vector from a set of pre-computed vectors, where the pre-computed vectors axe the average frame-by-frame differences between the clean and distorted utterances. The clean features are then recovered by subtracting the selected compensation vector from the distorted vectors. Experimental results based on 138 speakers of the YOHO and telephone YOHO corpora show that the proposed approach is computationally efficient and is able to increase the accuracy from 17% (without compensation) to 85% (with compensation).

The NGnet is trained by an on-line EM algorithm in order to learn the vector field of the chaotic dynamics. We also investigate the robustness of our approach to two kinds of noise processes: system noise and observation noise. It is shown that the trained NGnet is able to reproduce a chaotic attractor, even under the two kinds of noise. The trained NGnet also shows good prediction performance. When only part of the dynamical variables are observed, the NGnet is trained to learn the vector field in the delay coordinate space. It is shown that the chaotic dynamics is able to be learned with this method under the two kinds of noise. (C) 2001 Scripta Technica.

B	Zhang, R; Ding, XQ; Zhang, JY			IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY; IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY	Zhang, R; Ding, XQ; Zhang, JY			Offline handwritten character recognition based on discriminative training of orthogonal gaussian mixture model	SIXTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DOCUMENT ANALYSIS AND RECOGNITION, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR)	SEP 10-13, 2001	SEATTLE, WA	Int Assoc Pattern Recognit				The statistical approach to offline handwritten character recognition has been used widely, in which classifier design is very important. For approximating the class conditional density more precisely, it can be represented by orthogonal Gaussian mixture model (OGMM). The parameters of OGMM are commonly estimated by expectation-maximization algorithm (EM), which converges to the maximum likelihood estimation (ML). Since ML cannot directly minimize the classification errors as the goal of classifier design, to solve this problem, the discriminative training method based on the minimum classification error criterion (MCE) is used to adjust the parameters of OGMM. In order to achieve a good generalization, the complexity of the classifier, namely the component number of OGMM, is determined following the structure risk minimization principle (SRM). Finally, the recognition performance is demonstrated by applying it to the handwritten numerals in the NIST database.

The algorithm is adapted to the sampling and regular forms of representing the initial information. The realization of w-weighted (in L.D. Meshalkin's sense) estimates of partial distributions permits efficient operation of the algorithm with small samples, small interclass distances, and degenerate distributions. The convergence of the algorithm for different learning quality functionals is studied by the method of digital modeling. It is shown that the maximum likelihood criterion ensures a higher rate of convergence as compared with the Bhattacharrya distance and Kullback divergence.

Moreover, suppose the unit is operated for a certain period of time in the first environment and is then transferred to the second environment. Thus we observe a censored lifetime in the first environment and a failure time of a "used" unit in the second environment. We propose an EM algorithm approach for obtaining a self-consistent estimator of F using observations from both environments. The case where failure times are subject to right censoring is considered as well. We also establish the maximum likelihood estimator of F when the unit is repairable. Application and simulation studies are presented to illustrate the methods derived.

Working hours of the components in condition 1 and condition 2 air respectively observed. Of interest is the lifetime distribution F of the component in the second condition only, i.e., the distribution without the prior exposure to the first condition. In this paper, we propose a method to transform the lifetime obtained in condition 1 to an equivalent lifetime in condition 2 and then use the transformed data to estimate F. Both parametric and nonparametric approaches each with complete and censored data are discussed. Numerical studies are presented to investigate the performance of the method.

J	Ghosh, S; Majumder, PP				Ghosh, S; Majumder, PP			An improved procedure of mapping a quantitative trait locus via the EM algorithm using posterior probabilities	JOURNAL OF GENETICS			English	Article						recombination fraction; linkage; maximum likelihood estimation	LINKAGE ANALYSIS; PEDIGREES	Mapping a locus controlling a quantitative genetic trait (e.g. blood pressure) to a specific genomic region is of considerable contemporary interest. Data on the quantitative trait under consideration and several codominant genetic markers with known genomic locations are collected from members of families and statistically analysed to estimate the recombination fraction, theta, between the putative quantitative trait locus and a genetic marker. One of the major complications in estimating theta for a quantitative trait in humans is the lack of haplotype information on members of families. We have devised a computationally simple two-stage method of estimation of theta in the absence of haplotypic information using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In the first stage, parameters of the quantitative trait locus (QTL) are estimated on the basis of data of a sample of unrelated individuals and a Bayes's rule is used to classify each parent into a QTL genotypic class. In the second stage, we have proposed an EM algorithm for obtaining the maximum-likelihood estimate of theta based on data of informative families (which are identified upon inferring parental QTL genotypes performed in the first stage). The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether, instead of using genotypically 'classified' data of parents, the use of posterior probabilities of QT genotypes of parents at the second stage yields better estimators. We show, using simulated data, that the proposed procedure using posterior probabilities is statistically more efficient than our earlier classification procedure, although it is computationally heavier.

The bottom topography of the inner Gulf was modeled by introducing the concept of a topographical basin model, as the basis for the projection of the sample survey estimates to the entire inner gulf. The bottom depth contours and volumes for the basin model were constructed from nautical charts. The estimates of sample abundance were made for the fish in the inner Gulf using the acoustic methods, EMS (Expectation Maximization and Smoothing) and echo integration. The estimates of population were made by the multiplication of the topographic model's estimate of water volume and a model of fish density dependent on bottom depth. The results showed a general decrease in fish density biomass with bottom depth, and a simultaneous tendency for maximum concentrations over bottom depths of about four meters. The Four meter bottom depth includes a broad expanse of the inner Gulf located south of Isla Chira. Overall estimates of volumetric density (0.269 Fish/m(3)) and of areal densities (1.88 fish/m(2)) ate comparable to other estuarine shallow water environments.

It turns out that in the one-way analysis of variance situation there is an optimal choice. Connections with Empirical Bayes estimation is stressed as well as the use of the EM-algorithm. We demonstrate that for the latter, care must be taken with the choice of parameters to be declared "missing", for a wrong choice could lead to inconsistent estimators or estimators with poor mean-square behaviour. The discussion is in the context of one-way analysis of variance. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The authors describe a simple semiparametric model which does not require this information. Natural deaths during the experiment and the usual terminal sacrifice provide sufficient information to ensure that the tumour incidence rates, which are of primary interest in occult-tumour studies, can be estimated nonparametrically. The advantages of this semiparametric approach to the analysis of survival/sacrifice experiments are illustrated using data from a study on benzyl acetate conducted under the U. S. National Toxicology Program. The results derived compare favourably with those obtained using a previously published approach to the analysis of tumorigenicity data.

These signals ale segmented and approximated as time series with piecewise linear instantaneous frequency and piecewise constant amplitude. Frequency I ate, center frequency, and energy features are estimated in each segment of data using chirped autocorrelations and the fractional Fourier transform. These features ale tracked across segments using linear dynamical models whose parameters are estimated using an expectation-maximization algorithm. A new cross-covariance estimator for adjacent states of the dynamical model is given. The feature extraction/tracking algorithm is used to characterize a measured marine-mammal localization. Application of the representation algorithm to signal classification is discussed.

This work establishes a complete methodology based on self-organized maps (SOM) and the expectation - maximization (EM) algorithm that finds an abstract probability function, which is a mix of local experts. An application of this methodology is presented as a case study, where the problem is robot navigation in noisy environments. Readings from seven robot sonars were taken as input for the system, mapped into a two dimension space and grouped into abstract observations, in order to make recognition of navigation space environment dependant and accurate. The goal is to build the capability of predicting observations and of recognizing abstractions that were defined over the data itself.

The crux of our method is a technique which we call clustered component analysis (CCA). Clustered component analysis is a method for identifying the distinct component vectors ill a multivariate data set. CCA is distinct from principal components analysis (PCA), and independent components analysis (ICA), because it is not constrained to produce orthogonal component vectors and it does not assume that components are indepedent. CCA employs Bayesian estimation methods such as expectation-maximization (EM) and Rissanen order identification to determine the best set of component vectors.

We investigate the bit error rate and the frame error rate performance of this technique applied to two families of error-control codes: simple nonrecursive binary convolutional codes and parallel turbo codes based on two recursive constituents. Two different types of fading channels are considered: independent Aat Rayleigh and block fading channels.

Over large databases, the cost of the numerous scans required to converge and large memory requirements of the algorithm becomes prohibitive. We present a decomposition of the EM algorithm requiring a small amount of memory by limiting iterations to small data subsets. The scalable EM approach requires at most one database scan and is based on identifying regions of the data that are discardable, regions that are compressible, and regions that must be maintained in memory. Data resolution is preserved to the extent possible based upon the size of the memory buffer and fit of the current model to the data. Computational tests demonstrate that the scalable scheme outperforms similarly constrained EM approaches.								Bennett KP, 1999, P 5 INT C KNOWL DISC, P233, DOI 10.1145/312129.312236; Bishop C.

The framework for our study is the recently reported dual-step EM algorithm of Cross and Hancock (3). This provides a statistical framework in which the structural arrangement of the point-sets provides constraints on the pattern of correspondences used to estimate alignment parameters. In this paper our representation of point-set structure is based on the point-adjacency matrix. Using ideas from spectral graph-theory, we show how the eigen-vectors of the point-adjacency matrix can be used to compute point correspondence probabilities. We show that the resulting correspondence matching algorithm can be used to track deforming point-sets detected in motion sequences.

Unlike the usual methods which assume the detectors are small, the method is based on an accurate system response model which is valid for PET detectors of arbitrary; size. The emission profile is represented as an orthogonal series of basis functions (on the circuar region inside the scanner ring) which are tensor products of Bessel functions in the radial direction, and classical harmonics in the angular direction. Rv applying a simple linear transformation to the emission sinogram, it call be viewed as data corresponding to detector arcs, and represented by basis functions involving Chebyshev polynomials and classical harmonics. The coefficients in the orthogonal series for the emission intensity are obtained by solving a block diagonal linear system in which the data vector consists of the coefficients of the orthogonal series of the transformed sinogram. The coefficient matrix of this system is obtained from an orthogonal series representation of the probability that an emission is detected in one of the detector arcs. The mathematical description of this probability and the reconstruction method was developed in a recent paper by the authors. In this paper we discuss details of the numerical implementation and present numerical results obtained from applying this method to simulated data. The results indicate that our method produces reconstructions which are comparable in quality to the maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) method with a speed which is similar that of the filtered back projection (FBP) method.

To account for serial correlation, we may use an autoregressive (AR) model, in particular the AR(I) model. However, when t = 1, the previous outcome Y-0 is unobserved. To overcome such problems in binary regression, we may simply set Y-10 = 0 and the contribution of the possible errors from one or several such initial cases to the model is small when each time series is sufficiently long. Another approach is to model the initial cases separately by using a marginal model and the rest of the observations by using a conditional AR(1) model. We consider the Bayesian approach of modelling the outcomes Y-10 by a beta prior and the resulting model is a two-point mixture model such that the outcome Y-10 = k occurs with probability pi (k), k = 0, 1, and pi (0) + pi (1) = 1. These models are demonstrated and compared by using a methadone clinic data set. A simulation study reveals that the mixture model is better than the conditional AR(1) model as it gives smaller relative biases and mean-squared errors for most covariates. Also, the standard deviation to standard error ratios in the mixture model are closer to 1 than in the conditional AR(1) model for most covariates.

Unlike tradition mutation operators that scatter offspring with a fixed probabilistic distribution, the SF uses the shape of the population chosen by the selection operator as the probabilistic distribution in order to conform the offspring settlement to the fitness landscape. Experiments on test functions show that the SF is feasible both in search exploitation and exploration. Finally, the SF is applied to parameter estimation of a Kalman filter example that constitutes a 19-dimensional problem. Benchmarking with the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, the SF produces lower mean-square-estimates consistently The robustness and feasibility of SF to practical problems are verified.

Thus, utilization of the popular maximum likelihood expectation-maximization (ML-EM) methods, or derivations thereof, which assume the underlying Poisson distribution, may be disputed. Specifically, it is not appropriate to assume that the iterations will necessarily converge to the true solution, and hence an alternative formulation is needed. It is well-known that both the transition matrix, and the projection data, which are needed for iterative reconstruction of the image, are contaminated by error. This suggests that methods based on a Total Least Squares (TLS) formulation may be appropriate to solve this ill-conditioned problem. Here we discuss the utilization of the TLS for image reconstruction. Our goal is the design of an algorithm that is both fast and robust, and hence can successfully be adopted for three-dimensional image reconstruction.

With our algorithm reconstruct the true coincidence events and random coincidence events were reconstructed separately. We also calculated the random ratio from the measured projection data (singles) using line and cylindrical phantoms, respectively. From cylindrical phantom experiments, the random event ratio was 41.8% to 49.1% in each ring. These results are close to the ratios obtained from geometric calculation, which range from 45.0% to 49.5%. The random ratios and the patterns of random events provide insightful information for random correction. This information is particularly valuable when the delay window correction is not available as in the case of our PET system.

Recently, the computational effects required for IR of positron emission tomography (PET) studies have been reduced to make it practically appealing. We have made an implementation of the improved Maximum Likelihood-Expectation Maximization (ML-EM) algorithm. The transition matrix was generated based on the geometry of the instrument. Phantoms of 6 line sources and 19 line sources were used to test our accelerated ML-EM algorithms against the FBP method. The singles were used to calculate the random coincidence rates by a well known formula and were compared to the randoms obtained by another geometric method. We also designed a new model using two line sources to determine the ratio of random events to true events. The artifacts near those line sources were eliminated with the ML-EM method. With decay correction, the RC events were uniformly distributed in whole field after 10 iterations. The ML-EM reconstructed images are superior to those obtained with FBP. The patterns of randoms provide insightful information for random correction, which the hardware correction by the delay window can not provide. This information is particular valuable when the delay window correction is not available in the old fashion PET scanner.

By explicitly modeling such information, discrete tomography aims to achieve better reconstruction quality and accuracy for these cases. The paper attempts to develop a framework for a general discrete tomography problem. The approach starts with an explicit model of the discreteness using a Bayesian formula. Class label variables are defined to denote the probabilities of each object point belonging to one particular class. The reconstruction then becomes the problem of assigning labels to each object point in the volume (3D) or image (2D) to be reconstructed, Unsurprisingly, this Bayesian labeling process resembles a segmentation process whose goal is also to estimate a discrete-valued field from continuous-valued observations. An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is developed: to estimate the class label variables. By introducing another set of variables, the EM algorithm iteratively alternates the estimations of these two sets of variables. A linear equation is finally derived, composed of two terms. One accounts for the effect of the discreteness, and the other represents the integral property of the projection in tomography. This linear equation reveals a very interesting relationship between the discrete tomography and ordinary tomography, suggesting that the ordinary tomography may be treated as a special case of discrete tomography where the discreteness term is neglected. Solving the linear equation is usually very computational. The paper, however, derives an efficient algorithm by using concepts developed previously in the rho-filtered layergram method for conventional tomography. With the proposed high-pass filter, the solution for the linear equation can be computed very efficiently in the Fourier domain. In case the class values are unknown in advance, another level of EM algorithm is invoked to estimate these class values. The paper also discusses a Markov random field (MRF) model for non-stationary a priori probability, encouraging the local regularity and smoothness in the reconstruction. The experimental results demonstrate that discrete tomography using the proposed method improves the reconstruction quality greatly, especially when fewer projections are given.

The both schemes rely either on directional information or the spatial diversity of the mobile radio channel. It is shown via simulations that for a large number of waves impinging at the receiver the latter scheme being less complex is more robust in terms of the achievable bit-error rates than the former one while the performance is similar in channels with a small angular spread.

These entailments are found in the representational models of Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) and in the model of the mechanics of the voice as revealed by the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Results to date have been obtained from examining samples in the TIMIT database and human subjects. Local features correlated with individual speakers for selected vowel sounds have been found in CWT space. Features of NLP representation systems have also been found and are compared with voice features for speakers whose NLP representation systems are known a priori. Gaussian mixture models are used to calculate probability density functions from the local feature distributions. This speaker identification strategy combines three elements of novelty. First, it exploits the fact that the two-dimensional CWT of a one-dimensional signal can be interpreted as an image, and uses feature extraction techniques first developed for image processing. Second, this is the first known study in which voice waveforms are systematically studied to identify features that are attributed to the speaker's mental representation. Third, the reliability of the identification with be strengthened by combining entailments from these two completely different aspects of the speaker's identity, the mechanical aspects of the speaker's vocal tract, and the pattern of representation.

No specific assumptions are made regarding the second or higher order statistics of the sources. Assuming additive Gaussian noise the pdf is a mixture of Gaussians centered at points that uniquely determine (a) the mixing parameters and (b) the source signals up to a permutation and a sign ambiguity. In this paper we present both the theoretical framework for this novel approach and a new recursive blind separation algorithm based on our framework. Simulations show that the method can successfully separate at least up to 10 binary source signals at different noise levels.

One impediment to the implementation of multiuser detection techniques in practical systems (such as in DS-CDMA) has been the difficulty of dealing with the large number of random variables present in such systems. Graphical techniques, which have been previously applied to inference problems in many random variables, can give new insight into the handling of this problem. The main focus of our work is on asynchronous channels, which may be effectively modeled with a Markov chain model. A new implementation of the EM algorithm over factor graphs is introduced. Modifications to the EM Algorithm to implement approximate inference with reduced complexity are discussed.

Examples include a video of an unknown object that randomly moves in the field of view; a speech signal that is corrupted by a selection from different types of office noise (chatter, keyboard typing, etc.); and a tomographic signal that is phase-wrapped by an unknown number of wavelengths. We show how transformations in the input, such as translation and shearing in images, can be incorporated into an iterative, adaptive filter that uses the expectation maximization algorithm. The underlying system model is a hidden Markov model (HMM) and the iterative filter estimates the parameters of the HMM and performs inference in the HMM in a way that is invariant to transformations in the input. We illustrate the iterative filter on a toy example and on video sequences of people and trucks.

The color space transformation, from RGB to LUV, contributes to a perceptually reasonable segmentation result. The MRF-EM algorithm permits unsupervised segmentation and enforces a region smoothness constraint. The narrow-band, multiresolution implementation confines fine resolution processing to a small fraction of the image, thereby achieving significant acceleration over traditional multiresolution schemes. Experimental results on dermatoscopic images demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique.

A practical solution to the problem of simultaneously estimating the channel state and the channel parameters is proposed. Based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm in [1], the procedure of iterating batches of data is simpliffed to an adaptive algorithm with only forward time recursions, which helps remove the required training sequences, and signiffcantly reduces the memory requirement. Through computer simulations, we have found a near ideal MRC BER performance and demonstrated the eficacy of the new algorithm when applied to channels with changing Doppler spreads.

The probabilistic hierarchical clustering of large-scale sparse min high-dimensional data collections is achieved by the development of a family of latent class models which are parameterised using the expectation maximisation algorithm. The framework is based on a hierarchical probabilistic mixture methodology Two classes of models enlarge front the analysis and these have been termed as symmetric and asymmetric models. For tt,rt data specifically both asymmetric and symmetric models based on the multinomial and binomial distributions are most appropriate. The subsequent visualisation of document collections is achieved by exploiting the topographic relations between similar documents. A latent trait model is developed which provides the means of viewing vector space document representations on a 2-D grid and thereby visualising the inherent structure of the document collection. A number of experiments are provided to demonstrate the technique and a concluding discussion on the proposed models is given.

A multi-path slowly Rayleigh Fading channel is considered. Both perfect and non-perfect channel estimations are studied with the pilot-to-data amplitude ratio as a parameter, when pilot symbols are transmitted in parallel with data. For channel estimation we use Expectation Maximization (EM) and Spaced Alternating Generalized Expectation Maximization (SAGE) algorithms; for symbol detection we use interference cancellation. Bit Error Probabilities (BER) are derived using Monte Carlo simulations for Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK). The users may have different bit rates. In addition the Mean Squared Estimation Error (MSEE) of channel gains is computed and compared to the classical Cramer-Rao lower Bound (CRLB).

Therefore, in the present paper, an estimation method for multiple motions and multiple planes is proposed in order to expand the conventional method However, this expansion causes a clustering problem whereby feature points do not belong to the correct plane, and therefore the reliability of each plane is reduced The observed noise model for the feature points is assumed as two-dimensional Gaussian noise, and the likelihood function is defined with respect to this observed noise. Then, by assuming a Gaussian mixture model, both the parameter estimation problem and the clustering problem can be formulated. In order to solve these problems, an iterative computation method based on the EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm is applied. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by computational simulation results and the real image experiment.

We have developed an anatomical pixellation method of incorporating registered MR or CT information in brain SPECT image reconstruction. This produces a functional image constrained by an anatomical segmentation. The method has been tested with simulated SPECT images containing a region of increased uptake (hot spot). Using least squares, the simulated image is fitted to the uniform regions defined by MR segments. Hot spots are identified by refining the segmentation based upon assessment of the unprocessed and processed SPECT images. This approach may offer a practical alternative to the more computationally demanding maximum likelihood expectation maximization (mL-EM) Bayesian approach which is the most commonly reported method of incorporating anatomy.

We describe a way to add transformation invariance to a generative density model by approximating the nonlinear transformation manifold by a discrete set of transformations. An EM algorithm for the original model can be extended to the new model by computing expectations over the set of transformations. We show how to add a discrete transformation variable to Gaussian mixture modeling, factor analysis and mixtures of factor analysis. We give results on filtering microscopy images, face and facial pose clustering, and handwritten digit modeling and recognition.

The models are fitted to unknown input patterns by applying the EM algorithm to minimize a measure of fittness. To avoid falling into local minima, multiresolutional approach is introduced. Moreover, nonlinear transformation is adopted to realize more flexible matching. Experiments performed on Japanese characters show effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, many researchers have found that, after allowing for heteroskedastic behaviour, the conditional distributions remain fat-tailed. Consequently, one approach adopted by applied econometricians has been to postulate a fat-tailed conditional distribution. In the multivariate context, few such distributions offer tractable solutions which accurately capture multivariate deviations from normality. The approach taken in this paper is to model the multivariate dynamics of the conditional covariance matrix with a parsimonious regime-switching factor GARCH model. The factor loading matrix switches within a finite state-space according to the value of an unobserved Markov state variable. The conditional distribution of the process is then a mixture of multivariate normals. Fat-tails are explicitly generated by the presence of structural breaks or changes of regime. We develop some theoretical properties of such models, and filters for inference about the unobserved factor process and Markov chain, as well as maximum likelihood estimation via the EM algorithm. We fit our model to daily changes in the term structure of US interest rates and apply one-step ahead distributional forecasts in a simple portfolio risk management context.

We incorporate the Wavelet transform (WT) into the ML framework, and obtain a new iterative algorithm that incorporates local and multiresolution properties of the WT within the structure of the EM. Using the WT allows one to embed regularization procedures (filtering) into the iterative process, by imposing a new set of parameters on a subset of wavelet coefficients with a desired resolution. Properties of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated on reconstructions of a synthetic brain phantom.

Emission-based tomography in medical imaging is a particularly important and common example of this type of problem. In this paper we provide an overview of the methodology and illustrate its application to problems in emission tomography through a series of simulated and real-data examples. The framework rests on the special manner in which a multiscale representation of recursive dyadic partitions (essentially an unnormalized Haar analysis) interacts with the statistical likelihood of data with Poisson noise characteristics. In particular, the likelihood function permits a factorization, with respect to location-scale indexing, analogous to the manner in which, say, an arbitrary signal allows a wavelet transform. Recovery of an object from tomographic data is then posed as a problem involving the statistical estimation of a multiscale parameter vector. A type of statistical shrinkage estimation is used, induced by careful choice of a Bayesian prior probability structure for the parameters. Finally, the ill-posedness of the tomographic imaging problem is accounted for by embedding the above-described framework within a larger, but simpler statistical estimation problem, via the so-called Expectation-Maximization (EM) approach. The resulting image reconstruction algorithm is iterative in nature, entailing the calculation of two closed-form algebraic expressions at each iteration. Convergence of the algorithm to a unique solution, under appropriate choice of Bayesian prior, can be assured.

Zero-memory nonlinear (ZMNL) functions may be applied to limit the influence of impulsive noise, but ZMNL pre-processing generally destroys the low-rank signal subspace. We develop a robust covariance matrix estimate that suppresses impulsive noise a while also performing a model-based interpolation to restore the signal subspace. The approach is based on modeling the noise with a finite Gaussian mixture distribution, cmd an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is used for parameter estimation. The method is robust to noise model mismatch and works well with infinite-variance noise. Simulation results are included that illustrate the improved performance in detecting the number of sources and estimating the angles of arrival.

Various sophisticated methods employing segmentation, maximizing likelihood by expectation maximization (MLEM), maximizing a posteriori (MAP), etc. have been proposed for attenuation correction in quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) using count-limited transmission data. This study aims at demonstrating that a simple attenuation correction method based on the filtered backprojection (FBP) can give a quantitatively accurate emission image with low count transmission data if optimal pre- and postfilters an used. Methods. By using the mathematical cardiac-torso (MCAT) phantom, we evaluated myocardial PET images corrected by transmission data with various incident counts per bin (N-0) down to 1.5. The present method based on FBP was compared with the conventional method of blank-to-transmission (B-to-T) ratio and MLEM-based method. We employed nonlinear Gaussian (NLG) filter as an edge preserving postfilter. Results. The conventional B-to-T method is useful for N-0 > 10. For N-0 < 10, postfiltering effectively improved accuracy of attenuation corrected emission image. The FBP-based method has achieved an accuracy of emission intensity better than 5% for N-0 > 3, which is almost comparable with that achieved by MLEM-based method. Conclusions. The FBP-based method has an advantage over B-to-T method in accuracy and over MLEM-based method in simplicity.

Research into the FORE+OSEM and FORE+AWOSEM statistical image reconstruction methods tailored to whole-body 3D PET oncology imaging have indicated potential improvements in image SNR compared to currently used analytic reconstruction methods (FBP). To assess the resulting impact of these reconstruction methods on the performance of human observers in detecting and localizing tumors, we use a non-Monte Carlo technique to generate multiple statistically accurate realizations of 3D whole-body PET data, based on an extended MCAT phantom and with clinically realistic levels of statistical noise. For each realization, we add a fixed number of randomly located 1 cm diam. lesions whose contrast is varied among pre-calibrated values so that the range of true positive fractions is well sampled. The observer is told the number of tumors and, similar to the AFROC method, asked to localize all of them. The true positive fraction for the three algorithms (FBP, FORE+OSEM, FORE+AWOSEM) as a function of lesion contrast is calculated, although other protocols could be compared.

The image classes are modeled using an ICA (independent component analysis) mixture model that assumes that the data was generated by several mutually exclusive data classes whose components are a mixture of non-Gaussian sources. The parameters of the model can be adapted using an approximate expectation maximization approach to maximize the data likelihood. We demonstrate that this method can learn classes of efficient codes to represent images that contain a variety of different structures. The learned codes can be used for image compression, de-noising and classification tasks. Compared to standard image coding methods, the ICA mixture model gives better encoding results because the codes are adapted to the structure of the data.

Spectrum prediction may be useful in a packet transmission system where the sensitivity to packet losses is a major problem. Models of speech are trained by the Expectation Maximization algorithm using pairs, triples etc, of consecutive cepstral vectors. The models an used to design first, second etc. order predictors. The prediction schemes are evaluated using the spectral distortion criterion and compared to a simple reference method. The best prediction scheme obtains an average spectral distortion that is 0.46 dB less than for the reference method.

The spectrum is represented by the cepstral coefficients resulting from linear prediction analysis of speech. The models are Gaussian mixture densities, estimated iteratively using two expectation maximization type algorithms. The contribution is an investigation of the algorithms using theoretical measures well as practical applications. The applications are spectrum coding and prediction. Some low-dimensional modeling examples, illustrating the behavior of the two algorithms graphically are given. One of the algorithms has the bounded support issue of the source incorporated in its update equations, resulting in improved modeling accuracy.

Given an initial solution -a set of segments that reasonably describe the input binary edge image-, the algorithm efficiently updates the parameters of these segments to track the movements of objects in the image in successive image frames. The proposed method is based on the EM algorithm-a technique for parameter estimation of statistical distributions in presence of incomplete data-, used here to estimate the parameters of a mixture density. The algorithm is highly susceptible of parallelization, because of the uncoupled nature of the computations needed on its main data structures. This property is exploited in order to make an efficient version for parallel distributed memory environments, under the message passing paradigm. We carefully describe the details of the implementation, and finally, we show an evaluation of the algorithm in a NOW (Network Of Workstations), using the standard Message Passing Interface (MPI) library. Our evaluation shows that the reached speedup is very close to the ideal optimum.

The method is purely structural, that is to say it uses only the edge or connectivity structure of the graph and does not draw on node or edge attributes. We make two contributions. Commencing from a probability distribution for matching errors, we show how the problem of graph-matching can be posed as maximum likelihood estimation using the apparatus of the EM algorithm. Our second contribution is to cast recovery of correspondences matches between the graph-nodes in a matrix framework. This allows us to efficiently recover correspondence matches using singular value decomposition. We experiment with the method on both real-world and synthetic data. Here we demonstrate that the method offers comparable performance to more computationally demanding methods.

Selected sets of Gaussian clusters, estimated via Expectation Maximization on the texture features, are grouped together to form composite texture classes. Our cluster grouping technique exploits the inherent local spatial correlation among posterior distributions of clusters belonging to the same texture class. Despite its simplicity, this algorithm can model even very complex distributions, typical of natural outdoor images.

The probability density function (PDF) of each image to be segmented is modeled as a mixture of independent object PDFs. In the first image of the sequence, the parameters of the mixture are initially estimated based on user interaction. These parameters are then iteratively updated using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. A classification procedure applied to the results of the EM algorithm allows an object-based segmentation of the image to be constructed. In subsequent images of the sequence, the segmented objects are automatically tracked using motion estimation/compensation and a similar EM-based segmentation framework. Results indicate that accurate object segmentations and robust tracking can be obtained using this flexible approach.

This algorithm is derived by computing the likelihood ratio of incomplete data through an extended logarithm; namely, the alpha-logarithm. The case of alpha = -1 corresponds to the logarithm. The number a adjusts eigenvalues of update matrices by reflecting the optimization function's second-order properties with respect to the estimation parameter. This property shows merits on speedup of convergence. In the text, derivation of the algorithm is given first. Then, convergence and speedup properties are discussed. Finally, applicability of the alpha-EM algorithm and examples are shown.

Usage of alpha-related information measures based upon this extended logarithm is expected to be effective to speedup of convergence, i.e., on the improvement of learning aptitude. In this paper, two typical cases are investigated. One is the alpha-EM algorithm (alpha-Expectation-Maximization algorithm) which is derived from the alpha-log-likelihood ratio. The other is the alpha-ICA (alpha-Independent Component Analysis) which is formulated as minimizing the alpha-mutual information. In the derivation of both algorithms, the alpha-divergence plays the main role. For the alpha-EM algorithm, the reason for the speedup is explained using Hessian and Jacobian matrices for learning. For the alpha-ICA learning, methods of exploiting the past and future information are presented. Examples are shown on single-loop alpha-EM's and sample-based alpha-ICA's. In all cases, effective speedups are observed. Thus, this paper's examples together with formerly reported ones are evidences that the speed improvement by the alpha-logarithm is a general property beyond individual problems.

J	McClean, S; Devine, C				McClean, S; Devine, C			Nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation for artificially truncated absence data	COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS			English	Article						incomplete data; EM algorithm; manpower planning	BIAS	In manpower planning it is commonly the case that employees withdraw from active service for a period of time before returning to take up post at a later date. Such periods of absence are frequently of major concern to employers who are anxious to ensure that employees return as soon as possible. The distribution of duration of such periods of absence are therefore of considerable interest as is the probability that such employees will ever return to active service. In this paper we derive a nonparametric estimator for such a lifetime distribution based on renewal data which are subject to various forms of incompleteness, namely right censoring, left and right truncation, and forward recurrence. Artificial truncation is used to ensure that the data are time homogeneous. A nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator for the lifetime distribution is derived using the EM algorithm. The data analysed concern the Northern Ireland nursing profession.

The proposed receivers are optimum in the sense that they make full use of the available statistical information to compute the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimate of the multiuser channel using the Expectation Maximization (Ehl) algorithm and perform hit detection of the transmitted symbols. Computer simulations show that both proposed demodulators attain optimum performance in Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) time dispersive channels. The semiblind approach, in addition, is highly robust to the local misconvergence problems of the EM algorithm.

Generally the OS algorithm uses a fixed number of projections, so called "subset levels", and the recovered frequency component of a reconstructed image depends on the number of projections in a subset. In 1998 we proposed a new method which modified the number of projections in a subset for each iteration step in an OS-BR algorithm to recover various frequency components in early iteration steps. In this paper we introduced our algorithm to the rescaled BI (RBI) version of the ML-EM algorithm RBI-EM, and the RBI version of the MAP-FM algorithm RBI-BR. And we evaluated the performance of proposed methods by using several simulation phantoms in comparison with those of ML-EM, MAP-FM, OS-FM and OS-BR.

In contrast to clustering methods and dimensionality reduction, multiple cause models are capable of turning local features on and off and this makes them a more realistic model for many types of data. However, inference and learning in general multiple cause models takes an amount of time that is exponential in the number of causes. We present an approximate inference algorithm that examines only sparse cause patterns, i.e., those configurations of causes where only a small number of causes are active at a time. This leads to an approximate EM algorithm that maximizes a lower bound on the likelihood of a data set. We show that this sparse multiple cause model can model different types of human facial expression patterns. Performance comparison of the MCM classifier with the SNoW (Sparse Network of Winnows) architecture and the Nearest Neighbor classifier reveals significant improvement in classification accuracy using the MCM classifier.

In this paper, we present a: scheme for extracting moving objects. First, three:different resolutions of the dense optical flow fields are calculated using a complex discrete wavelet transform. Surface fitting of all levels of these vectors is then performed over the affine parametric motion model. Next, the clustering by Competitive Agglomeration algorithm is applied in the parameter space of the coarsest level. The results of this step are the optimum number of clusters and the center of each cluster. Using information from the previous level, the parameter spaces of the following levels are then segmented using the classical mixture model and the expectation-maximization algorithm. Finally, the individual moving object and background are represented in layers. Experimental results showing the significance of this proposed method are provided.

The class of multiscale priors has the interesting feature that the "non-informative" member yields the traditional maximum likelihood solution; other choices are made to reflect prior belief as to the smoothness of the unknown intensity. Remarkably, this Bayesian multiscale framework admits a novel maximum a posteriori (MAP) reconstruction procedure using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, in which the Ehl update equations have simple, closed-form expressions. The potential of this new framework is assessed using the Zubal brain phantom and simulated SPECT studies.

A common approach is to apply a Principle Component Analysis to the data, to reduce the dimensionality of the representation.: However, a single multivariate Gaussian model of the probability density, estimated from the principle covariances, can be substantially inaccurate. In this paper, we examine how the specificity of a model can be improved by using a mixture of Gaussians, trained with the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, with reference to hand and vehicle profiles.

A nondata-aided(NDA) scheme is considered for the joint timing and phase synchronizer which maximizes the low SNR limit of the likelihood function averaged over the M-PSK signal costellation. For this, an Ehl algorithm is derived which estimates the timing offset and the phase rotations of each subcarrier iteratively and which converges to the true ML estimation of the unknown timing and phase. It is shown that the algorithm becomes independent of the signal-to-noise ratio for both low and high SNR cases. The algorithm is applied to the QPSK modulated OFDM systems and it is concluded that for SNR values greater than 10 dB the convergence is achieved in first iteration and for SNR values less than 10 dB, at most in three iterations. It is also concluded that the convergence is independent of the initial starting points.

We formulate the tracking problem as an incomplete data problem and apply the EM algorithm to obtain the MAP estimate. The resulting filter has a recursive structure analogous to the Kalman filter. The difference is that the measurements deals deals with multiple measurements and the parameter-update can estimate the system parameters. Through extensive experiments, it turns out that the proposed system is better than PDAF and NNF in tracking the targets. Also, the performance degrades gracefully as the disturbances become stronger.

By using the EM formulation to marginalize over the channel coefficient distribution, maximum-likelihood estimates of the transmitted sequence are obtained. This EM algorithm is shown to perform better, in terms of BER, than existing algorithms which perform jointly-optimal sequence and channel estimation, or which do not take into account fast time-varying channel effects.

Our previous work(2-3,) introduced the multigrid EM (MGEM) and multiresolution (MREM) and Wavelet based Multiresolution EM (WMREM) algorithm(26) for PET image reconstruction. This paper investigates the use of various wavelets in the new Wavelet based Multiresolution EM (WMREM) algorithm. The wavelets are used to construct a multiresolution data space, which is then used in the estimation process. The beauty of the wavelet transform to provide localized frequency-space representation of the data allows us to perform the estimation using these decomposed components. The advantage of this method lies with the fact that the noise in the acquired data becomes localized in the high-high or diagonal frequency bands and not using these bands for estimation at coarser resolution helps speed up the recovery of various frequency components with reduced noise estimation. Different wavelet bases result in different reconstructions. Custom wavelets are designed for the reconstruction process and these wavelets provide better results than the commonly known wavelets. The WMREM reconstruction algorithm is implemented to reconstruct simulated phantom data and real data.

This alignment is a form of image registration. The solution is based on generating vectors from known, predominantly common points in the images to be registered. All potential transforms between the vectors are generated, with the correct registration producing a tight cluster of data points in the space of transform coefficients. This cluster is identified using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, and the optimum global transform calculated. The technique has been applied to two types of retinal image - optical photographs and fluorescein angiograms, demonstrating that it can be readily used to provide cross-modal registration. An objective analysis of this system is also outlined, and examples of an application to real clinical images presented.

This paper addresses this problem with respect to likelihood maximization using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Two different approaches are compared. The first one consists in defining mixture models that take into account noise. The second one is based of robust estimation of the model parameters in the maximization step of EM Both have been tested separately, then jointly. Finally, a hybrid model is proposed. Results on artificial data are given and discussed.	UPRES EA 1216, F-17042 La Rochelle 1, France	Saint-Jean, C (reprint author), UPRES EA 1216, L3I,Ave Marillac, F-17042 La Rochelle 1, France.

We show that, in a classical sensorimotor paradigm (finger-tapping), the performance of the proposed method (in terms of number and location of the detected activity-related voxels) is very similar to that of voxel-by-voxel linear regression, but does not require an explicit model of the activation pattern and/or of the hemodynamic response. In addition, if the number of mixture elements is increased, our method is capable of detecting additional activity-related areas.

The class-conditional feature distributions depend on the source of the patterns. Several sources may share the same distribution, or style. The style-conditional distributions are estimated from the training set. The optimal field-classifier computes the class-conditional field-feature-probabilities as the sum of class-and-style-conditional field-feature-probabilities, weighted by the prior probabilities of the styles. We compare the decision regions and error rates of style-weighted classification in a minimal family of examples, and discuss some related practical considerations.

One problem is the initialisation of the EM algorithm. Standard initialisation schemes can lead to poor formant trajectories. But these trajectories however are important for vowel intelligibility The aim of this paper is to investigate the suitability of subspace identification methods to initialise EM, The paper compares the subspace state space system identification (4SID) method with the EM algorithm, The 4SID and EM methods are similar in that they both estimate a state sequence (but using Kalman filters and Kalman smoothers respectively), and then estimate parameters (but using least-squares and maximum likelihood respectively). The similarity of 4SID and EM motivates the use of 4SID to initialise EM, Also, 4SID is non-iterative and requires no initialisation, whereas EM is iterative and requires initialisation. However 4SID is sub-optimal compared to EM in a probabilistic sense. During experiments on real speech, 4SID methods compare favourably with conventional initialisation techniques. They produce smoother formant trajectories, have greater frequency resolution, and produce higher likelihoods.

This algorithm is based on paraboloidal surrogate functions to simplify the optimization problem and a concavity technique developed by De Pierro to simultaneously update a sec of pixels. To obtain large step sizes which affect the convergence rate, we choose the paraboloidal surrogate functions that have small curvatures. The concavity technique is applied to separate pixels into partitioned sets so that parallel processors can be assigned to each set. The partitioned separable paraboloidal surrogates are maximized by using coordinate ascent (CA) algorithms. Unlike other existing algorithms such EM and CA algorithms, the proposed algorithm not only requires less time per iteration to converge, but is guaranteed to monotonically increase the objective function and intrinsically accommodates nonnegativity constraints as well.

We show that any distribution of images can be factored exactly into conditional distributions of feature vectors at one resolution (pyramid level) conditioned on the image information at lower resolutions. We would like to factor this over positions in the pyramid levels to make it tractable, but such factoring may miss long-range dependencies. To capture long-range dependencies, we introduce hidden class labels at each pixel in the pyramid. The result is a hierarchical mixture of conditional probabilities, similar to a hidden Markov model on a tree. The model parameters can be found with maximum likelihood estimation using the EM algorithm. We have obtained encouraging preliminary results on the problems of detecting various objects in SAR images and target recognition in optical aerial images.

For this purpose, speech LSF's are modeled as i,i.d realizations of a multivariate normal mixture density. The mixture model parameters are efficiently estimated from the training data using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The estimated density is suitably quantized using transform coding and bit-allocation techniques for both fixed rate and variable rate systems. Source encoding using the resultant codebook involves no searches and its computational complexity is minimal and independent of the rate of the system. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme provides 2-3 bits gain over conventional MSVQ schemes. The proposed memoryless quantizer is enhanced to form a quantizer with memory. The quantizer with memory provides transparent quality speech at 20 bits/frame.

Parametric Estimation methods are adopted in training images to obtain means and covariance of the background pixels, They are processed in pixel classification step to extract moving people and eliminate their shadows. Our tracking algorithm consists of two levels: region level and blob level. The region level tracks a whole human by utilizing the position information of the detected persons, The EM algorithm is adopted at the blob level to segment human image into different parts. When region level tracking fails, the system switches to blob-level tracking, Average Bhattacharyya distances between corresponding blobs of consecutive frames are calculated to get the correct match between different regions. Potential applications of the proposed algorithm include HCI and visual surveillance, Experimental results are given to demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our algorithm.

Our objectives were to develop a method for estimating the detected scatter counts in an arbitrary energy window and to incorporate that method into iterative SPECT reconstruction. METHODS: The scatter estimation method calculates the expected scatter projection data by forward projecting an "effective" scatter source distribution through an attenuation distribution. This "effective" scatter source distribution is approximated by convolving an estimated primary source distribution with a kernel that is pre-calculated using the EGS4 Monte Carlo code. This scatter estimation method was confirmed by Independent, Monte Carlo-simulated acquisitions of several phantom configurations, including point sources, uniform tanks, and spheres within nonuniform tanks. In addition, this scatter estimation method was incorporated into an iterative Maximum Likelihood, Expectation Maximization (MLEM) reconstruction code and used to reconstruct scatter-corrupted data to demonstrate the effects of scatter correction. RESULTS: Line profiles through Monte Carlo-simulated data and scatter data estimated using this convolution-projection technique demonstrated good agreement for Tc-99m. Uniform tanks reconstructed with this scatter estimation scheme were within 2% of known activity concentrations. Without scatter correction, reconstructed activity concentrations were overestimated by more than 20%, CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a method for estimating detected scatter counts that is suitable for iterative SPECT reconstruction.

Relevance feedback was proposed [1] to take into account of the above characteristics in CBIR. Although relevance feedback incrementally supplies more information for fine retrieval, two challenges exist: (1) the labeled images from the relevance feedback are still very limited compared to the large unlabeled images in the image database. (2) relevance feedback does not offer a specific technique to automatically weight the low-level feature. In this paper, image retrieval is formulated as a transductive learning problem by combining unlabeled images in supervised learning to achieve better classification. Experimental results show that the proposed approach has a satisfactory performance for image retrieval applications.

The mechanism is an indirect parametric motion estimation technique. Firstly, a robust technique based on the fundamental constraint equation of multiple optical flow is used to estimate a dense multiple vector field of the scene. Secondly, from the recovered low-level data, motion models and their corresponding regions of support are estimated through a variant of the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm. The proposed algorithm is shown to provide good motion estimates and regions of support.

This approach gets flexibility enough to fit distorted shapes in the drawing while keeping fidelity to the ideal shape of the symbol. In this work we define the similarity measure between an image and a symbol based on the distance from every pixel in the image to the lines in the symbol. Matching is carried out using an implementation of the EM algorithm. Thus, we can improve recognition rates and computation time with respect to our previous formulation based on a simulated annealing algorithm.

The standard processing of the list mode-data is Single Slice Rebinning (with a maximum acceptance angle) to 2D histogrammed projections followed by Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization reconstruction. This method has several disadvantages: sampling accuracy is lost by histogramming events, axial resolution degrades with increasing distance from the center of rotation and useful events, with angle bigger than the acceptance angle, are not included in the reconstruction. Therefore an iterative reconstruction algorithm, operating directly on list-mode data, has been implemented. The 2D and 3D version of this iterative list-mode algorithm have been compared with the aforementioned standard reconstruction method. A higher number of events is used in the reconstruction, which results in a lower standard deviation. Resolution is fairly constant over the Field of View. The use of a fast projector and backprojector reduces the reconstruction time to clinical acceptable times.

J	Wu, L; Perlman, MD				Wu, L; Perlman, MD			Efficiency of lattice conditional independence models for multinormal samples with non-monotone missing data	COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						closed-form MLE; EM algorithm; model-restricted MLE; simulation; Stein's loss	EM ALGORITHM; INCOMPLETE-DATA	For multivariate normal data with non-monotone (i.e. arbitrary) missing data patterns, lattice conditional independence (LCI) models determined by the observed data patterns can be used to obtain closed-form MLEs (Andersson and Perlman, 1991, 1993). In this paper, three procedures - LCI models, the EM algorithm, and the complete-data method - are compared by means of a Monte Carlo experiment. When the LCI model is accepted by the LR test, the LCI estimate is more efficient than those based on the EM algorithm and the complete-data method. When the LCI model is not accepted, the LCI estimate may lose efficiency but still may be more efficient than the EM estimate if the observed data is sparse. When the LCI model appears too restrictive, it may be possible to obtain a less restrictive LCI model by discarding only a small portion of the incomplete observations. LCI models appear to be especially useful when the observed data is sparse, even in cases where the suitability of the LCI model is uncertain.

The derivation is based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Simulation results indicate that the derived receiver performs better than an iterative receiver with hard decision feedback, for both uncoded data and convolutionally coded data. The combination with turbo codes is also investigated Three kinds of decision feedback are proposed and compared, namely, re-encoder soft decision feedback and quantizer. It is shown via simulation that soft decision feedback is the best while quantizer has similar performance. Re-encoder on the other hand, has performance degradation.

The group membership function is to describe the probability that any two components belong to the same group. And we present the unsupervised learning method based on group membership functions for the Gaussian mixture density estimation. The experiments illustrated that the algorithm based on group membership functions has similar performance as supervised EM algorithm.

As a function approximator, we employ a Normalized Gaussian network (NGnet), which is trained by an on-line EM algorithm. In order to deal with the partial observation, we propose a new embedding method based on smoothing filters, which is called integral embedding. The NGnet is trained to learn the dynamical system in the integral coordinate space. Experimental results show that the trained NGnet is able to reproduce a chaotic attractor that well approximates the complexity and instability of the original chaotic attractor, even when the data involves large noise. In comparison with our previous method using delay coordinate embedding, this new method is more robust to noise and faster in learning.

Our RL method has an architecture like the actor-critic model. The critic tries to approximate the Q-function, which is the expected future return for the current state-action pair. The actor tries to approximate a stochastic soft-max policy defined by the Q-function. The soft-max policy is more likely to select an action that has a higher Q-function value. The on-line EM algorithm is used to train the critic and the actor. We apply this method to two control problems. Computer simulations show that our method is able to acquire fairly good control in the two tasks after a few learning trials.

This batch estimator is an iterative algorithm employing a nested pair of Expectation Maximization (EM) based algorithms.

In this paper, the batch method is extended to operate in a sequential manner by defining a moving batch window and stride for processing the incoming data. Comparisons to the full batch method are presented and discussed.

Increasing database sizes strain the scalability of many data mining algorithms. Data clustering is one of the fundamental techniques in data mining solutions. The many clustering algorithms developed face new challenges with growing data sets. Algorithms with quadratic or higher computational complexity, such as agglomerative algorithms, drop out quickly. More efficient algorithms, such as K-Means EM with linear cost per iteration, still need work to scale up to large data sets. This paper shows that many parameter estimation algorithms, including K-Means, K-Harmonic Means and EM, can be recast without approximation in terms of Sufficient Statistics, yielding an superior speed-up efficiency. Estimates using today's workstations and local area network technology suggest efficient speed-up to several hundred computers, leading to effective scale-up for clustering hundreds of gigabytes of data. Implementation of parallel clustering has been done in a parallel programming language, ZPL. Experimental results show above 90% utilization.

However, being a histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation - no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined images with low noise level. In this paper, rye propose a novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated by a Markov random field whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be observed through observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences of neighbouring sites. To fit the HMRF model, an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is used. We show that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into an HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved, which is demonstrated by comparison experiments with the FM model-based segmentation.

A maximum likelihood estimation algorithm is developed to jointly identify the degradation system and estimate short-time signal spectra. A source signal is assumed to be generated by a hidden Markov model (HMM) with state-dependent short-time spectral distributions of mixtures of Gaussian densities. The distortion channel is linear time-invariant and the noise is Gaussian. The unknown parameters of channel and noise an estimated iteratively using the EM algorithm, and the signal spectra are obtained from the posterior estimates of sufficient statistics of the source signal. Simulation results are provided at the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of 20 dB down to 0 dB and the proposed algorithm is shown to produce convergent estimation and significantly reduced spectral distortion.

Any speech features derivable from power spectra can then be approximately estimated by minimum mean-squared error estimation. Experiments were performed on speaker-independent continuous speech recognition using as features the perceptually based linear prediction cepstral coefficients, energy, and temporal regression coefficients. Speech data were taken from the TIMIT database and were degraded by a distortion channel and colored noise at various SNR levels. Experimental results indicate that the proposed technique leads to convergent identification of channel and noise and significantly improved recognition accuracy.

It is based on the Expectation, Conditional Maximization (ECM) algorithm. In the modified algorithm, the M-step is replaced by a sequence of conditional maximization steps which either conditionally maximizes the expectation of the complete data or the actual likelihood. The modified EM algorithm is computationally efficient, and yields a faster convergence rate than the EM algorithm. Computer simulations are used to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

We adopt a Gibbs-type sampling method for estimating the posterior distribution of this sequence. In the second part, we apply recent results on stochastic versions of the well-known EM algorithm with averaging and acceleration techniques, to estimate some parameters of the model.

J	Liou, M; Cheng, PE; Wu, CJ				Liou, M; Cheng, PE; Wu, CJ			Using repeaters for estimating comparable scores	BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							CONTINGENCY-TABLES	Multiple forms of a test for placement services and for Licensure or certification exams are developed for measuring the same competence and need to be scaled so that observed scores on these forms are comparable. Conventionally, comparable studies have used the common-item design to adjust selection-bias between candidates taking different forms. In practice, the common-item scores may not be immediately available for comparability studies; even when available, they can be contaminated by non-random error due to test disclosure. On the other hand, scores from candidates repeatedly taking more than one form of text can be used to scale test forms to achieve comparability. This study considers comparability studies using repeaters as an incomplete-data problem, that is, most candidates have observed scores on one form and missing scores on the other, but repeaters have both. We propose a general model for estimating score distributions for test forms that would have observed if all takers had no missing scores. The score distributions based on all candidates can then be used to find comparable scores by the equipercentile method. The model parameters are estimated by maximizing the incomplete-data likelihood via an EM algorithm. The standard errors of comparable scores are also derived under the proposed model. The use of repeaters for establishing score comparability is investigated in an empirical study.

In situations where there are constraints in some markets that lead to spillovers to others it is useful to build this explicitly into the model. In this paper I present a theoretical model that is related to the disequilibrium and the spatial econometric literature. Under certain conditions the model may be estimable and an appropriate estimation technique that uses the EM algorithm, is put forward. A data set from the U.K. market for secondary school places provides a test for the procedure.

J	Parida, L; Geiger, D				Parida, L; Geiger, D			Mass estimation of DNA molecules and extraction of ordered restriction maps in optical mapping imagery	ALGORITHMICA			English	Article						flip cut; optical mapping; shortest path algorithm		The Human Genome project has been considered "one of the great enterprises of 20th Century Science" [8]. The ultimate goal of many efforts in molecular biology, including the Human Genome Project, is to determine the entire sequence of human DNA and to extract genetic information from it. In this context an important step is to build restriction maps (location of certain identifiable markers) of portions of the DNA [8]. Optimal Mapping [24], [17], [21], a process that fixes elongated DNA molecules onto treated surfaces, is a very promising emerging technology for rapid production of ordered restriction maps. Our modeling and solution of detection, mass estimation, and extraction of ordered restriction maps of DNA molecules attempts to understand/answer questions of significant importance to geneticists, biologists, and chemists. In this paper we first describe the vision process that identifies the DNA molecules along with the restriction sites, and then model the restriction map problem and describe the algorithm that we use to extract the maps from the data. The input to the vision process is an image of the DNA molecules. We propose a simple Markov chain to model the DNA fragments, and use Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) algorithms to detect and measure the apparent length of the DNA fragments. This is at the heart of the imaging software in use at the laboratory for over 2 years: the practical implementation continues to undergo various fine-tuning processes. In the second part we model the ordered restriction map as a combinatorial problem which we call the Binary Flip Cut (BFC) problem. We prove hardness results for this and several of its variants and offer a practical solution using techniques from mean field annealing/EM algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness in practice.

In response, the authors show that this assertion is incorrect, because the model considered by Walker and Damien is not equivalent to Ramaswamy, Chatterjee, and Cohen's model. The authors discuss and clarify issues of identifiability pertaining to latent segmentation models.

The classifier is trained by maximizing the joint-likelihood of features and labels over all the data set (labeled and unlabeled). The classifier builds grey-level images with estimation of class-posteriors (as many images as classes) that feed the segmentation algorithm. The paper is focused on the adaptive classification part of the algorithm. The classification tests are performed over Landsat TM mini-scenes. We asses the efficiency of the adaptive classifier depending on the model complexity and the proportion of labeled/unlabeled data.

S	Attias, H			IEE; IEE	Attias, H			Blind source separation by dynamic graphical models	NINTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS (ICANN99), VOLS 1 AND 2	IEE CONFERENCE PUBLICATIONS		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (ICANN99)	SEP 07-10, 1999	EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND	IEE, Informat Div, Asian Pacific Neural Network Assembly, British Neurosci Assoc, European Neural Network Soc, Inst Math & Applicat, Int Neural Networks Soc, Inst Phys, Neural Comp Applicat Forum	UNIV EDINBURGH		COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ALGORITHM; DECONVOLUTION	This paper presents a new approach to the blind source separation problem. This approach is based on a formulation of blind separation as a problem of learning and inference in a dynamic graphical model. In this model, the sources are described by independent hidden Markov models, which capture not only the one-point histogram but also temporal structure of the sources. Using the model, we derive unsupervised learning algorithms that learn the source densities and temporal structure, as well as the mixing matrix, from the observed data. Inference in this model provides an optimal reconstruction of the sources from data. We present demonstrate an expectation-maximization algorithm for square, zero-noise mixing, and algorithms for the general case, where the number of sources may differ from the number of observed mixtures and the data are noisy. In the latter case, the complexity of the graphical model makes exact learning and inference computationally intractable. An approximate algorithm based on the variational approach, which maximizes a lower bound on the likelihood, is presented and shown to be quite accurate.

To do this optimally, it is necessary to optimize the data PDE which may be modeled as a mixture density, jointly over the parameters of all the signal models. This can present a problem of enormous complexity if the number of signal classes is large. This paper describes a algorithm for jointly estimating the parameters of the various signal types, each with different parameterizations and associated sufficient statistics. In doing so, it maximizes the likelihood function of all the parameters jointly, but does so without incurring the full dimensionality of the problem. It allows lower-dimensional sufficient statistics to be utilized for each signal model, yet still achieves joint optimality. It uses an extension of the class-specific decomposition of the Bayes minimum error probability classifier.

Solutions for the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator yield powerful learning algorithms that combine all the charms of expectation-maximization and deterministic annealing. Contained as special cases are the methods of maximum entropy, maximum likelihood, and a new method, maximum structure. We focus on the maximum structure case, in which entropy minimization maximizes the amount of evidence supporting each parameter while minimizing uncertainty in the sufficient statistics and cross-entropy between the model and the data. In iterative estimation, the MAP estimator gradually extinguishes excess parameters, sculpting a model structure that reflects hidden structures in the data. These models are highly resistant to over-fitting and have the particular virtue of being easy to interpret, often yielding insights into the hidden causes that generate the data.

The main results are: 1) An entropic prior that favors small, unambiguous, maximally structured models. 2) A prior-balancing manipulation of Bayes' rule that allows one to gradually introduce or remove constraints in the course of iterative reestimation. #1 and #2 combined give the information-theoretic free energy of the model and the means to manipulate it. 3) Maximum a posterori (MAP) estimators such that entropy optimization and deterministic annealing can be performed wholly within expectation-maximization(EM). 4) Trimming tests that identify excess parameters whose removal will increase the posterior, thereby simplifying the model and preventing over-fitting. The end result is a fast and exact hill-climbing algorithm that mixes continuous and combinatoric optimization and evades sub-optimal equilibria.

These applications require the availability of a training set (and hence of ground-truth information) for each new image analyzed. However, the collection of ground truth information is a complex and expensive process that only in few cases can be performed every time that a new image is acquired. This represents a serious drawback of classical supervised classifiers. In order to overcome such a drawback, an unsupervised retraining technique for supervised maximum-likelihood (ML) classifiers is proposed in this paper. Such a technique, which is based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, allows the statistical parameters of an already trained ML classifier to be updated so that a new image, for which a training set is not available, can be classified with an acceptable accuracy. Experiments, which have been carried out on a multitemporal data set, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique.

Our approach employs the EM algorithm to solve the concurrent mapping and localization problem. To accommodate the spatial nature of range data, it relies on a two-layered representation of maps, where global maps are composed from a collection of small, local maps. To avoid local minima during likelihood maximization, a softmax version of the M step is proposed that is gradually annealed to the exact maximum. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is well suited for constructing large maps of typical indoor environments using sensors as inaccurate as sonars.

Extracting such counts is a fundamental step in learning algorithms for constructing a variety of models including decision trees, decision graphs, Bayesian networks, and naive-Bayes clustering models. The second technique is an algorithm that efficiently performs the E-step of the EM algorithm (i.e., inference) when applied to a naive-Bayes clustering model. Using real-world data sets, we demonstrate a dramatic decrease in running time for algorithms that incorporate these techniques.

J	Cho, YB; Gweon, DG				Cho, YB; Gweon, DG			Conditional variance estimation using stochastic learning algorithm	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article							NEURAL NETWORKS	Aritificial neural networks may be used for a function approximator which includes not only deterministic but also probabilistic model. Conditional variance estimation using a neural network is a good example of probabilistic model approximation, because conditional variance, which is a function of input variable, is an important parameter to describe a Gaussian probabilistic model. The majority of learning algorithms are based on a concept of likelihood maximization or expectation maximization method. This article presents an alternative learning algorithm based on a different concept for a multilayer perceptron. The proposed variance learning algorithm can be regarded as a kind of modified delta rule, where delta is determined by an iterative estimation algorithm, which is also proposed in this article. The proposed learning algorithm has stochastic property because the delta is stochastically determined by the estimation algorithm. Relationships of delta to the transient and steady state of the learning process are also stochastic. First, the iterative variance estimation algorithm is explained. Second, the transient state behavior is investigated to have an insight into convergence and stability properties with respect to delta. Third, the steady state analysis is described to show the relationship of delta to steady state error bound. Theoretical analysis on steady state behavior produces analytic formula for steady state error bound of the variance learning algorithm in terms of the delta. Finally, multilayer perceptron using the proposed learning algorithm is simulated for the demonstration of variance estimation.

However such methods can be slow to converge. Here a method for estimating such probabilities is presented, which uses an entropy maximisation procedure to incorporate information regarding the nature of the missing data mechanism. If such information can be expressed by linear equalities, of a nature elaborated below, then explicit point estimates can usually be found. When data are missing at random, the method is equivalent to a localised EM algorithm.

The novel contributions are three-fold. Firstly, we describe how a template-based feature enhancement operator can be learned using a variant of the exponential correlation associative memory (ECAM). Secondly, we show how a uniformly initialised mesh of Bezier spline control points can be fitted to the resulting feature characteristics. Finally, we develop a mesh-pruning strategy that can be used to effect perceptual grouping of the resulting local splines into a quasi-global contour representation. The new framework for spline-fitting is demonstrated on the problem of extracting road structures from noisy milli-metre radar data.

These models deal with the data that arrive in unequal intervals such as financial transctions or heart attacks. The models treat both the time between event arrivals and the observed marks as stochastic processes. We propose and investigate a class of bivariate distributions to form the bivariate mixture transition distribution(BMTD). In these models the bivariate conditional distribution of the next observation given the past is a mixture of conditional distributions given each one of the :last k observations. The identifiability of the model is investigated, and EM algorithm is developed to obtain estimates of the model parameters.

We introduce the negative log probability of the data sample as the error function and motivate its use by showing its correspondence to the Kullback-Leibler distance between the unknown true distribution of data and our empirical models. We present a general winner search procedure based on this probability measure and an update step based on its gradients. As an application, we derive the learning rules for a particular probabilistic model that is used in user profiling in mobile communications network. Due to the constrained nature of the parameters of our probabilistic model, we introduce a new parameter space, in which the gradient update step is performed. In the experiments, we show clustering of user profiles using calling data involving normal users of mobile phones and users that are known to be victims of fraud. In the summary, we discuss further applications of the approach.

Fewer algorithms have been developed for identifying local consensus patterns or motifs in biological sequences. These two important problems have different biological constraints and, consequently, different computational approaches. The difficulty of finding the biologically meaningful motifs results from the variability in (1) the bases at each position in the motif, (2) the location of the motif in the sequence and (3) the multiplicity of motif occurrences within a given sequence. In addition the short length of many biologically significant motifs and the fact that motifs gain biological significance only in combinations, makes them. difficult to determine using standard statistical methods. In this paper we introduce our own approach, DMS, which combines multiple objective functions with an improved iterative sampling search method. We compare the main approaches for finding motifs and test the effectiveness of the various algorithms by comparing them on ten real domains and fourteen artificial domains. The main advantage of DMS is that it is better able to find shorter motifs.

These acquired data are only indirectly related to the source distribution within the body. This latter distribution can only be inferred indirectly (by mathematical analysis) from the camera projection data. Both transmission and emission tomography are well modelled by a description(1) based on a spatially inhomogeneous Poisson point process. If f(s) is the (unknown) distribution, then the distribution of recorded activity (on a camera) is expressible as g(t) = integral(2 is an element of chi) a(t \ s)f(s)ds, for t is an element of y or, in suitably discretized form, g = Af, with A = (a(ts)). Reconstruction (i.e. estimating f from observations on g) constitutes an inverse problem. Conditional probabilities a(t \ s) are determined by characteristics defining the acquisition system and the physics of photon transport and may be regarded as known. Issues for effective reconstruction are the high dimensionality and statistical variability. Both row and column dimensions of A are very large, and usually unequal. Algorithms utilising the sparse structure of A can be effective. Statistical variability arises because g is only realized in an empirical distribution function (e.g. histogram counts y). We present algorithms suitable for solving linear systems y = Ax, for x greater than or equal to 0 with a general sparse, nonnegative matrix A. Ill-conditioned systems will be common, and statistical variability requires attention. The linear system will be studied under different conditions. In consistent linear systems a feasible solution x greater than or equal to 0 exists. If the linear system is inconsistent, estimation of parameters of a General Linear Model (GLM) specifying a Poisson sampling distribution is of interest. The model for Poisson distributed counts y (the bin counts of data from g) then involves a linear predictor eta and link function specifying the relationship between eta and mu = Ey. We formulate our goal as minimizing a suitable objective function. Cases of interest include: NNLS: non-negative least squares seeks x greater than or equal to 0 which minimizes //y - Ax//(2). A unique minimizer exists in a linear system of full rank. Emission: the minimizer x greater than or equal to 0 of deviance 2[Sigma y(i) log y(i)/mu(i) - Sigma (y(i) - mu(i))] (1) where mu = eta (identity link) and eta = Ax; Transmission: the minimizer x greater than or equal to 0 of the above deviance, but with fitted value mu = mu(0) exp(-eta) (log-link), with eta = Ax, and known offset eta(0) = log mu(0). Note that for consistent (i.e. noise-free) transmission data, log transformation (y) over tilde = - log y/mu(0) produces the linear system (y) over tilde = Ax. Iterative statistical algorithms exist for solving the constrained linear and non-linear optimizations above. Algorithms include generalized iterative scaling, Shepp and Vardi's(2) application of the EM algorithm in emission tomography, and accelerated forms like our ordered subsets EM (OSEM). Properties in consistent (no noise) and Poisson noise conditions will be considered. We also introduce applications in some newly emerging applications in medical emission tomography of the flexible algorithmic technology described.

Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is a popular iterative method that requires a significant amount of computation and memory in approximating the incomplete data for many real-world problems. In this paper lye propose a sparse matrix compaction technique to speed up the computation by better manipulating the probability matrix. The sparse matrix compaction method is made more efficient by both taking advantage of the geometrical information of the application and removing of indirect addressing overheads that is associated with most of the compressed sparse matrix method. Load balancing is also achieved by a better distribution scheme implemented in the pre-processing phase of the algorithm. By using the proposed method in handling the sparse matrix, our study demonstrates a promising result for the parallelization of the algorithm.

The studies are based on fluorescence imaging and optical sectioning. An automated image-acquisition system was developed to collect two-dimensional microscopic images. Images were reconstructed by the Linear Maximum a Posteriori method and the non-linear Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (ML-EM) method. In addition, because of the high computational demand of the ML-EM algorithm, we have developed a fast variant of this method. 1) Advanced image analysis techniques were applied for accurate and automated cell volume determination. 2) The sensitivity and accuracy of the reconstruction methods were evaluated by using fluorescent micro-beads with known diameter.

The results showed that the ML-EM reconstructed images are adequate for the determination of volume changes in cells or parts thereof.

We developed a new algorithm called Multiresolution Regularized Expectation Maximization (MREM), which explicitly accounts for spatial correlations in the image by using wavelets (Dixon et al. 1998). We demonstrate that MREM largely suppresses image noise in the reconstruction, showing only significant structures that are present in the data. Application to 1.8 MeV data results in a sky map that is much smoother than the maximum entropy reconstructions presented previously, but it shows the same characteristic emission features which have been established earlier.

Our previous work has been to develop a robot localisation system, namely the Gaussian Mixture Bayes with Regularised Expectation Maximisation (GMB-REM), using a single sensor. It allows a robot position to be modelled as a probability distribution, and uses the Bayes' theorem to reduce the uncertainty of a robot's location. In this paper, a new system, which is enhanced from the GMB-REM system in order to perform a sensor selection task, is introduced. Empirical results show the proposed new system outperforms the GMB-REM system with sonar alone. That is, the new system can deal with multiple sensors and further minimise the average localisation error of the robot by performing the sensor selection task.

Three methods have been proposed: Fourier filtering in four dimensions, space-time Gibbs priors in 4D MAP reconstruction, and Karhunen-Loeve (KL) filtering along the time axis with 3D MAP reconstruction. We demonstrate that all three are cases of 4D MAP reconstruction with space-time priors. Through simulation experiments with a realistic beating heart phantom, we show that nonquadratic space-time Gibbs priors produce less error in edge location and volume estimation than the other two methods for the same degree of noise smoothing. We attribute this to the time-global nature of the Fourier and KL smoothing versus the time-local nature of the space-time Gibbs model. We conclude that the 4D MAP method is most effective in our study, but that there are many variables deserving of further study.

Usually, the pi-constellations performance results suppose a perfect channel estimate. Here, we propose to give their performance results coupled with a channel estimator. The channel estimation scheme used is the pilot symbol assisted modulation (PSAM) method. We treat two kinds of channel estimators : Wiener Filter and an estimator from the expectation maximisation (E.M.) algorithm. Simulation results show that modulation diversity coupled with a channel estimator are still attractive.

Consequently, these algorithms often suffer from over-localization. In order to benefit from the inter-block dependency, an image classification algorithm based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) is developed. An HMM for image classification, a two dimensional extension from the one dimensional HMM used for speech recognition, has transition probabilities conditioned on the states of neighboring blocks from both directions. Thus, the dependency in two dimensions can be reflected simultaneously The HMM parameters are estimated by the EM algorithm. A two dimensional version of the Viterbi algorithm is also developed to classify optimally an image based on the trained HMM. An application of the HMM algorithm to document image and aerial image segmentation shows that the algorithm performs better than CART.

We show, at least, an algorithm for each level of a generic computer vision system (low, medium and high level vision) with the common basis of the EM algorithm applied in parameter estimation for mixture statistical models. We present an efficient implementation in parallel for all of them under a common scheme. Also, we show an evaluation of a medium-level vision EM application in a cluster of PCs. The results we have obtained in terms of both speedup and execution time are very good. Moreover, the paper gives us the guidelines for extending the method for related problems, and, in general, for many applications with mixture parameter estimation with EM as its main ask.

The aim is to improve the robustness of the Procrustes alignment to noise and clutter. By constructing a Gaussian mixture model over the missing correspondences between individual points, we show how alignment can be realised by applying singular value decomposition to a weighted point correlation matrix. Moreover, by gauging the relational consistency of the assigned correspondence matches, we can edit the point sets to remove clutter. We illustrate the effectiveness of the method matching stereogram. We also provide a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the operational advantages of the method.

Two of them are methods of fuzzy clustering: (a) the fuzzy c-regression methods, and (b) an entropy method proposed by the authors. Two others are probabilistic methods of (c) the deterministic annealing, and (d) the mixture distribution method using the EM algorithm. It is shown that the entropy method yields the same formula as that of the deterministic annealing. Clustering results as well as classification functions are compared. The classification functions for fuzzy clustering are fuzzy rules interpolating cluster memberships, while those for the latter two are probabilistic rules. Theoretical properties of the classification functions are studied. A numerical example is shown.

This paper focuses on the choice of the gating network. First, a localized gating network based on a mixture of linear latent variable models is proposed that extends a gating network introduced by Xu et al. [9], based on Gaussian mixture models. It is shown that this localized mixture of experts model, can be trained with the Expectation Maximization algorithm. The localized model is compared on a set of classification problems, with mixtures of experts having single or multilayer perceptrons as gating network. It is found that the standard mixture of experts with feedforward networks as gate often outperforms the other models.

The problem of determining feedback coefficients in the absence of noise is now classical (Massey's algorithm). In the current approach to the problem of estimation with noisy observations, the coefficients are endowed with a probabilistic model and the problem. Gradient ascent updates to coefficient probabilities are computable using recursions developed by means of the EM algorithm. Reduced-complexity approximations are also developed by reducing the number of coefficients propagated at each stage. Applications of this method may include soft decision decoding and blind spread spectrum interception.

The idea underlying pose clustering is to decompose the objects under consideration into k-tuples of primitive parts. By bringing pairs of k-tuples into correspondence, sets of alignment parameters are estimated. The global alignment corresponds to the set of parameters with maximum votes. The work reported here offers two novel contributions. Firstly, we impose structural constraints on the arrangement of the k-tuples of primitives used for pose clustering. This limits problems of combinatorial background and eases the search for consistent pose clusters. Secondly, we use the EM algorithm to estimate maximum likelihood alignment parameters. Here we fit a mixture model to the set of transformation parameter votes. We control the order of the underlying mixture model using a minimum description length criterion.

These methods have recently become very popular in the statistical and signal processing communities as they allow highly complex inference problems in detection and estimation to be addressed. However, MCMC is not currently well adapted to the problem of marginal maximum a posteriori (MMAP) estimation. In this papa, we present a simple and novel MCMC strategy, called State-Augmentation for Marginal Estimation (SAME), that allows MMAP estimates to be obtained for Bayesian models. The methodology is very general and we illustrate the simplicity and utility of the approach by examples in MAP parameter estimation for Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and for missing data interpolation in autoregressive time series.

We specify proper prior distributions for all unknown quantities including the seismic wavelet, the parameters of the reflectivity sequence and noise. To solve this estimation problem, an algorithm close to a stochastic version of the EM algorithm is used. The random variables are generated iteratively by a simple Monte-Carlo method namely the Gibbs sampler. But the direct application of this procedure often leads to a local minimum of the likelihood function resulting in a shifted and distorted wavelet. We propose a general method to obtain the true solution which systematycally uses different shifted wavelets to reinitialize the algorithm. Then we rerun the procedure on each initialization and retain the wavelet which minimizes the noise variance.

We develop a general expression for the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for direction finding using arrays for deterministic signals plus lid non-Gaussian noise, generalizing the Gaussian CRB. The CRBs for the noise and direction parameters decouple. The CRB for direction finding is expressed as a product of two terms that depend on the noise distribution, and the signal, respectively We illustrate the results for a Gaussian mixture pdf, and present simulation results comparing five direction finding algorithms. An approach based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, that simultaneously estimates the noise parameters, the signal directions, and the signal waveforms, is shown to achieve the CRB over a wide SNR range.

A widespread practice to overcome this problem involves over-iteration of an image estimate followed by smoothing. In this work, we investigate the qualitative and quantitative accuracy of the cross-validation procedure (CV) as a stopping rule, in comparison to over-iteration and post-filtering, for the reconstruction of phantom and small animal dynamic FDG-PET data acquired in 2-D mode. The CV stopping rule ensured visually acceptable image estimates with balanced resolution and noise characteristics. However, quantitative accuracy required more than 10(5) events per image. The effect of the number of ML-EM iterations on time-activity curves and metabolic rates of glucose extracted from image series is discussed. A dependence of the CV defined number of iterations on projection counts was found which simplifies reconstruction and reduces computation time.

This general framework can be directly extended to clustering of sequential data, based on finite mixtures of sequential models. In this paper we consider the problem of fitting mixture models where both multivariate and sequential observations are present. A general EM algorithm is discussed and experimental results demonstrated on simulated data. The problem is motivated by the practical problem of clustering individuals into groups based on both their static characteristics and their dynamic behavior.

The methods select among mixtures in which each mixture component is a directed acyclic graphical model (mixtures of DAGs or MDAGs), and can be applied to incomplete data sets. The model-selection criterion that we consider is the posterior probability of the model (structure) given data. Our model-selection problem is difficult because (1) the number of possible model structures grows super-exponentially with the number of random variables and (2) missing data necessitates the use of computationally slow approximations of model posterior probability. We argue that simple search-and-score algorithms are infeasible for a variety of problems, and introduce a feasible approach in which parameter and structure search is interleaved and expected data is treated as real data. Our approach can be viewed as the combination of (1) a modified Cheeseman-Stutz asymptotic approximation for model posterior probability and (2) the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We evaluate our procedure for selecting among MDAGs on synthetic and real examples.	Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA 98052 USA	Thiesson, B (reprint author), Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA 98052 USA.

A family of fuzzy EM algorithms of various degrees of fuzziness is presented where the EM algorithm is referred to as a fuzzy EM algorithm of degree of fuzziness of one. This fuzzy approach can apply to EM-style algorithms such as the Baum-Welch algorithm for hidden Markov models, the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixture models in speech and speaker recognition. The fuzzy EM algorithm for Gaussian mixture models is considered in detail as a demonstration for applying the fuzzy EM algorithm.

In this paper, we consider applications of the EM algorithm to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) sequence decoding in channels described by hidden Markov models (HMMs). It is well known that HMMs can accurately approximate large variety of communication channels with memory and, in particular, wireless fading channels with noise. The direct maximization of the a posteriori probability is too complex. The EM algorithm allows us to obtain the MAP sequence estimation iteratively.

In this paper we apply the EM algorithm to fit a mixture of Gaussian conditional densities when the parameters of the mixture, i.e., priors, means, and variances are all functions of the inputs. Our method becomes an interesting alternative to previous approaches based on nonlinear optimization.

This paper reports the development of an automated and intelligent procedure for generating the hierarchy of minimax entropy models and principal component visualization spaces for improved data explanation. The proposed hierarchical minimax entropy modeling and probabilistic principal component projection are both statistically principled and visually effective at revealing all of the interesting aspects of the data set. The methods involve multiple use of standard finite normal mixture models and probabilistic principal component projections. The strategy is that the top-level model and projection should explain the entire data set, best revealing the presence of clusters and relationships, while lower-level models and projections should display internal structure within individual clusters, such as the presence of subclusters and attribute trends, which might not be apparent in the higher-level models and projections. With many complementary mixture models and visualization projections, each level will be relatively simple while the complete hierarchy maintains overall flexibility yet still conveys considerable structural information. In particular, a model identification procedure is developed to select the optimal number and kernel shapes of local clusters from a class of data, resulting in a standard finite normal mixtures with minimum conditional bias and variance, and a probabilistic principal component neural network is advanced to generate optimal projections, leading to a hierarchical visualization algorithm allowing the complete data set to be analyzed at the top level, with best separated subclusters of data points analyzed at deeper levels. Hierarchical probabilistic principal component visualization involves (1) evaluation of posterior probabilities for mixture data set, (2) estimation of multiple principal component axes from probabilistic data set, and (3) generation of a complete hierarchy of visual projections. With a soft clustering of the data set ti via the EM algorithm, data points will effectively belong to more than one cluster at any given level with posterior probabilities denoted by z(ik). Thus, the effective input values are z(ik)t(i) for an independent visualization space k in the hierarchy. Further projections can again be performed using the effective input values z(ik)z(j\k)t(i) for the visualization subspace j. The complete visual explanation hierarchy is generated by performing principal projection (dimensionality reduction) and model identification (structure decomposition) in two iterative steps using information theoretic criteria, EM algorithm, and probabilistic principal component analysis.

J	Wu, L; Reeves, J; Perlman, MD				Wu, L; Reeves, J; Perlman, MD			Some model-restricted shrinkage estimators for contingency tables with missing data	METRIKA			English	Article						sparse data; empirical Bayes estimator; lattice conditional independence model; EM algorithm; restricted maximum likelihood estimator	INCOMPLETE-DATA	For contingency tables with extensive missing data, the unrestricted MLE under the saturated model, computed by the EM algorithm, is generally unsatisfactory. In this case, it may be better to fit a simpler model by imposing some restrictions on the parameter space. Perlman and Wu (1999) propose lattice conditional independence (LCI) models for contingency tables with arbitrary missing data patterns. When this LCI model fits well, the restricted MLE under the LCI model is more accurate than the unrestricted MLE under the saturated model, but not in general. Here we propose certain empirical Bayes (EB) estimators that adaptively combine the best features of the restricted and unrestricted MLEs. These EB estimators appear to be especially useful when the observed data is sparse, even in cases where the suitability of the LCI model is uncertain. We also study a restricted EM algorithm (called the ER algorithm) with similar desirable features.

We examine a numerical method for solving fixed points of dynamical systems derived from the algebraic reconstruction technique (ART) and the expectation maximization (EM) formulation, giving rise to the very first convergence for CT reconstruction.

It is seen that the iterative EM algorithm obtains at each iteration an estimate of the interference which is then subtracted from the data before a new sequence estimate is produced. Both uncoded and trellis coded systems are studied, and the EM-based algorithm is seen to perform well, outperforming a receiver that uses an optimized notch filter to remove the intereference, especially for large interference levels.

It may be caused by a semi-lethal factor acting in the filial generations. Although general methods have been developed to find semi-lethal factors, so far no method is available to estimate semi-lethal factors in the organisms, for example Bombyx mori and Drosophila melanogaster, in which no crossing-over occurs in meiosis in either of the sexes. In this report, a method is presented for estimating the recombination values between a semi-lethal factor locus and neighboring dominant molecular markers, e.g. RAPDs and AFLPs, and the relative viability of gametes or zygotes affected by the semi-lethal factor in an F-2 population for such species by using the maximum likelihood method associated with the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Five selection models of gamete or zygote were considered, and the most likely one was determined by goodness of fit of the observed counts of phenotypes to the expected ones under the models. The method was applied to segregation data of RAPD markers of an F-2 population with 101 individuals developed from the 'C108' x 'p50' cross in silkworm, B. mori. The presence of two semi-lethal factor loci (L-1 and L-2) located on the linkage groups 22a and 27b causing partial selection was suggested. The semi-lethal factors L1 and L2 were theoretically predicted to affect viability of male gametes and zygotes, respectively.

This Bayesian approach is applied to SPECT projection data acquired from a realistic torso phantom with spherical defects in the lungs simulating perfusion deficits. Both the scatter subtraction constant (k) and the smoothing parameter beta (beta) characterizing the prior are varied to study their effect on image quality and quantification. Region of interest (ROI) analysis is used to compare MAP-EM radionuclide concentration estimates with those derived from a "clinical" implementation of filtered backprojection (CFBP), and a quantitative implementation of FBP (QFBP) utilizing nonuniform attenuation and scatter compensation. Qualitatively, the MAP-EM images contain reduced artifacts near the lung boundaries relative to the FBP implementations. Generally, the MAP-FM image's visual quality and the ability to discern the areas of reduced radionuclide concentration in the lungs depend on the value of beta and the total number of iterations. For certain choices of beta and total iterations, MAP-EM lung images are visually comparable to FBP. Based on profile and ROI analysis, SPECT QFBP and MAP-EM images have the potential to provide quantitatively accurate reconstructions when compared to CFBP. The computational burden, however, is greater for the MAP-EM approach. To demonstrate the clinical efficacy of the methods, we present pulmonary images of a patient with lung cancer.

To improve these results, other reconstruction methods have been developed, such as the maximum entropy methods or the Iterative Removal Of Sources (IROS). However, such kind of methods are slower and can be impracticable for very complex telescopes. In this paper we present an alternative image reconstruction method, based on an iterative maximum likelihood algorithm called the EM algorithm, easy to implement and that can be successfully used for not very complex coded mask systems, as is the case of the LEGRI telescope. This is the first time this algorithm has been applied in gamma-ray astronomy. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Malcolm, WP; White, LB				Malcolm, WP; White, LB			Spatial filtering of general linear Gauss-Markov processes	SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						EM algorithm; fixed interval smoothing; Cramer-Rao bound; spatial filtering; analytic M-step	EM ALGORITHM; LIKELIHOOD	In this correspondence, an algorithm to jointly estimate signal directions and signal parameters for a class of analogue communications signals collected by a uniform linear array is presented. It has been shown that for the combination of quadrature baseband model and linear Gauss-Markov sources, the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm can be used to jointly estimate both signal directions of arrival and signal parameters. The EM algorithm presented uses fixed interval smoothing in the E-step, and an exact M-step for a two sensor array. Having an exact M-step for an EM algorithm significantly reduces computation. An iterative method to estimate an empirical Fisher information matrix (FIM) is applied to calculate the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). For the algorithm presented, several important properties such as robust performance are identified through computer simulations, while the estimated CRB is used to indicate performance.

MDPSM parameters can be trained in one of three different ways: (1) segment clustering; (2) expectation maximization (EM) training of mean trajectories; and (3) EM training of mean and variance trajectories. These parameter estimation methods were evaluated in TIMTT vowel classification experiments. The experimental results showed that modelling both the mean and variance trajectories is consistently superior to modelling only the mean trajectory. We also found that modelling both trajectories results in significant improvements over the conventional HMM. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

Assuming a zero false negative screening rate, we develop a score test for comparing treatments while adjusting for the mode of discovery based on a three-state progressive disease model with a discrete proportional hazards formulation of the treatment effect. By simulation we evaluate and compare the performance of the score test to the log-rank test. The results suggest that the score test is more efficient when screening rates are balanced between groups, and it greatly reduces the bias in the situation of asymmetric screening intensity.

This paper offers an alternative procedure for maximum likelihood estimation without relying an the EM algorithm: the center is estimated by minimizing the sum of the distances between the center and the observed partial rankings, and the scale parameter is estimated by solving a relatively simple equation.

Geyer and Thompson (1992) proposed a Markov chain Monte Carlo method that can be used to approximate these constants when they are difficult to calculate exactly. In the present paper, their method is applied to the conditional estimation of person parameters in the Rasch model. The results obtained with the Monte Carlo method can be very accurate, but in that case the method is rather slow. However, for only slightly less precise results the Monte Carlo method can be faster than the exact calculations. For the estimation of the ability parameters in a 5 item test taken by 1000 persons the Monte Carlo method took about half the time needed for the exact calculations; and still the difference between two corresponding estimates was less than 1 percent of the associated standard error in all cases.

In our approach, each source density is described by a model that is quite general and fully adaptive. Based on this model, we derive and demonstrate unsupervised learning algorithms not only for square noiseless mixing, but also for the general case where the number of sources may differ from the number of observed mixtures and the data are noisy. These algorithms use expectation-maximization to estimate the arbitrary source densities, mixing matrix and noise covariance from the input data. An approximate algorithm, based on the variational framework, is developed for cases where exact learning is intractable.

Two aspects must be considered: (1) some types of events (e.g., abnormal or rare) will not appear in the data set, but the system should be able to detect them, (2) not only classification of signals but also their interpretation are important for nuclear plant monitoring. We address both issues with a mixture of mixtures of Gaussians in which some parameters are shared to reflect the similar signals observed in different states of the reactor. An EM algorithm for these shared Gaussian mixtures is presented. Experimental results on nuclear plant data demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach with respect to the above two points.

In this contribution, an alternative fast-converging approach for maximum likelihood estimation of HMM parameters is described. This new techniques is based on the use of general purpose quasi-Newton optimization methods as well as on an efficient purely recursive algorithm for computing the log-likelihood and its derivative.

We model the communication system as a frequency Selective fading channel with multipath propagation. The number of active propagation channels is unknown and time-varying. Estimates Of input sequences and unknown parameters, such as e.g. time delays and the number of multipaths, are computed via a variant of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, known as the space-alternating generalized expectation maximization (SAGE) algorithm.

First, we propose a modified PMC method where adjustment term in the model parameter adaptation is varied depending on mixture components of HMM to obtain more reliable modeling. A state-dependent association factor that controls the average parameter variability of Gaussian mixtures and the variability of the respective mixtures is used to find the final optimum model parameters. Second, we propose a re-estimation solution of environmental variables with additive noise and spectral tilt based on expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm in the cepstral domain. The approach is based on the vector Taylor series (VTS) approximation. In our experiments on a speaker independent isolated Korean word recognition, the modified PMC show better performance than the Gales' PMC and the proposed VTS is superior to both of them.

Classifier design has a long history and they have been put to a large number of uses [1]. In this paper we continue the task of categorizing classifiers by their computational complexity as begun in [3]. In particular, we derive analytical formulas for the number of arithmetic operations in the probabilistic neural network (PNN) and its polynomial expansion, also known as the Polynomial Discriminant Method (PDM) and the mixture model neural network ((MN2)-N-2). In addition we perform tests of the classification accuracy of the PDM with respect to the PNN and the (MN2)-N-2 find that all three are close in accuracy. Based on this research we now have the ability to choose one or the other based on the computational complexity, the memory requirements and the size of the training set. This is a great advantage in an operational environment. We also discuss the extension of such methods to hyperspectral data and find that only the (MN2)-N-2 is suitable for application to such data.

This poses an extremely severe computational burden. A compromise is proposed in this paper: time-varying kernels are optimised for specific regions in the time-frequency plane. The regions, designed to isolate separate components comprising the signal, are determined by modelling the TFD using a finite mixture model of Gaussian distributions. The parameters of the model are estimated using a combination of the expectation-maximisation algorithm and functional merging. The regional optimisation provides improved separation and resolution of closely-spaced components when compared to methods using a solely time-varying kernel, without incurring an overwhelming computational expense.

Firstly, in the expectation step of the algorithm we update the probabilities of correspondence matching using contextual constraints provided by the network structure of the blood-vessel pattern in the angiograms. The second novel idea is to recover affine transformation parameters by applying the Gustafson fuzzy clustering procedure to the expected log-likelihood function.

A simple model with a fixed number of parameters often performs inadequately when the ultrasonic wavelet is propagated through inhomogeneous materials and/or reflected by complex objects. In this study, we model the detected ultrasonic signal as a superposition of many Gaussian echoes corrupted with measurement noise. To estimate the parameters of multiple Gaussian echoes, a Space Alternating Generalized Expectation Maximization (SAGE) algorithm has been developed. In performance evaluation of the SAGE algorithm, Monte-Carlo simulation has been used. The estimated parameters have been found to be unbiased and their variances achieve analytical Cramer-Rao Lower Bounds (CRLB) for Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) as low as 3 dB. The CRLB also constitutes the resolution bounds on the estimated parameters. Furthermore, the SAGE algorithm has been applied to experimental ultrasonic data consisting of multiple interfering echoes. It has been observed that the model fits accurately to the measured signal (estimation SNR is as high as 24 dB) and the estimated parameters display a high resolution and accurate characterization of the measurement.

The approach is Bayesian: the observed image intensity is assumed to be a random variable with gamma density; the image to be restored (mean amplitude) is modeled by a compound Gauss-Markov random field which enforces smoothness on homogeneous regions while preserving discontinuities between neighboring regions. A Neyman-Pearson detection criterion is used to infer the discontinuities, thus allowing to select a given false alarm probability maximizing the detection probability. The whole restoration scheme is then cast into a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) problem. An expectation maximization type iterative scheme embedded in a continuation algorithm is used to compute the MAP solution. An application example performed on radar data is presented.

While it has been shown that in certain situations, models possessing a 1/f-type power spectrum, perform well as regularizers to stabilize these ill-posed inverse problems, the optimal parameters for the model are rarely known a priori. Previously, it was demonstrated that the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm can satisfactorily perform the estimation of the model parameters in the unblurred one-dimensional case. In this paper, we extend this analysis to the situation of two-dimensional objects and an environment which includes blurring. We show that again the EM algorithm performs well. In addition, we examine performance in terms of the variance of the estimates and bounds on these quantities.

In Bayesian image analysis, this requires fusing together local predictions for the class labels with a prior model of segmentations. Markov Random Fields (MRFs) have been used to incorporate some of this prior knowledge, but this not entirely satisfactory as inference in MRFs is NP-hard. The multiscale quadtree model of Bouman and Shapiro (1994) is an attractive alternative, as this is a tree-structured belief network in which inference can be carried out in linear time (Pearl 1988). It is an hierarchical model where the bottom-level nodes are pixels, and higher levels correspond to downsampled versions of the image. The conditional-probability tables (CPTs) in the belief network encode the knowledge of how the levels interact. In this paper we discuss two methods of learning the CPTs given training data, using (a) maximum likelihood and the EM algorithm and (b) conditional maximum likelihood (CML). Segmentations obtained using networks trained by CML show a statistically-significant improvement in performance on synthetic images. We also demonstrate the methods on a real-world outdoor-scene segmentation task.

We present a method for supervised and unsupervised model parameter estimation using a general Bayesian formulation of deformable templates. In the supervised estimation the parameters are estimated using a likelihood and a least squares criterion given a training set. For most deformable template models the supervised estimation provides the opportunity for simulation of the prior model. The unsupervised methods is based on a modified version of the EM algorithm. Experimental results for a deformable template used for textile inspection are presented.

Among the techniques proposed to date, the Monte-Carlo EM algorithm (MCEM) proposed by Wei and Tanner [1] has a strong potential but very few is known on its behavior and on strategies for monitoring its convergence. In this contribution, the convergence of MCEM is investigated with a particular emphasis on the stability issue (which is not guaranteed in the original algorithm described by Wei and Tanner). A random truncation strategy, inspired by the Chen's truncation method for stochastic approximation algorithms, is proposed and analyzed. Finally, the application of our results to blind estimation problems in which the complete data likelihood is from the exponential family is discussed.

In quality performance evaluation studies using factorial experiments, the method of a normal probability plot is routinely used for screening out factors with insignificant effect on the quality characteristic. We demonstrate that the method of a normal probability plot for factor screening can be misleading. A screened out factor may turn out to be significant in the presence of certain interactions. Three methods of analysis in the presence of missing data for explanatory or response variables are considered under the multiple linear regression model by ignoring the missing data rows, substituting the corresponding column means from the data rows with no missing data, and substituting the Yates/EM algorithm estimates for the missing data. Five illustrative examples are given. In all examples, the third method has turned out to be the winner.

Iterative reconstruction with the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm provides an attractive solution for SPECT in that the physics of photon transport can be modeled into the projector and backprojector operations. Unfortunately, the implementation of this algorithm (including modelling of the physics) requires a large computational load which makes it unsuitable for routine clinical use. One acceleration method that has been suggested is to use a mis-matched projector and backprojector pair. By doing this, the computational time can be greatly reduced. Barrett et at. have recently presented a theory which describes how noise in the projection data is propagated to the reconstructed image when using the EM algorithm. We have used this theory to evaluate and compare the differences in pixel mean and variance, as well as performance for the task of estimating activity within a region-of-interest, when reconstructing using the EM algorithm with a matched and mismatched projector-backprojector pair. Results indicate that EM reconstruction can be accelerated by not modeling attenuation into the backprojection process, with little penalty in terms of estimating activity in regions-of-interest.

This algorithm is based on a unique spatially-variant mixture model and has the flexibility of incorporating any useful prior information on the potential label configurations. Specifically, two different priors are proposed for pixel labeling and their effectiveness is assessed quantitatively on simulated images at various noise levels. A qualitative evaluation has also been performed using clinical magnetic resonance images of the human brain.

All the optimization tasks make use of a suitably modified EM algorithm.

J	Grim, J				Grim, J			Mixture of experts architectures for neural networks as a special case of conditional expectation formula.	KYBERNETIKA			English	Article							EM ALGORITHM; CONVERGENCE PROPERTIES	Recently a new interesting architecture of neural networks called "mixture of experts" has been proposed as a tool of real multivariate approximation or prediction. We show that the underlying problem is closely related to approximating the joint probability density of involved variables by finite mixture. Particularly, assuming normal mixtures, we can explicitly write the conditional expectation formula which can be interpreted as a mixture-of-experts network. In this way the related optimization problem can be reduced to standard estimation of normal mixtures by means of EM algorithm. The resulting prediction is optimal in the sense of minimum dispersion if the assumed mixture model is true. It is shown that some of the recently published results can be obtained by specifying the normal components of mixtures in a special form.

Whether this is a good idea or not depends on the robustness with respect to deviations from the postulated model. We study this question experimentally in a restricted, yet non-trivial and interesting case: we consider a conditionally independent attribute (CIA) model which postulates a single binary-valued hidden variable z on which all other attributes (i.e., the target and the observables) depend. In this model, finding the most likely value of any one variable (given known values for the others) reduces to testing a linear function of the observed values. We learn CIA with two techniques: the standard EM algorithm, and a new algorithm we develop based on covariances. We compare these, in a controlled fashion, against an algorithm (a version of Winnow) that attempts to find a good linear classifier directly. Our conclusions help delimit the fragility of using the CIA model for classification: once the data departs from this model, performance quickly degrades and drops below that of the directly-learned linear classifier.

Information extraction algorithm performance is strongly related to the quantitative precision with which the desired classes are defined, a characteristic which increases rapidly with dimensionality. Due to the limited number of training samples used in defining classes, the information extraction of hyperspectral data may not perform as well as needed. In this paper, schemes for statistics enhancement are investigated for alleviating this problem. Previous works including the EM algorithm and the Leave-One-Out covariance estimator are discussed. The HALF covariance estimator is proposed for two-class problems by using the symmetry property of the normal distribution. A spectral-spatial labeling scheme is proposed to increase the training sample sizes automatically. We also seek to combine previous works with the proposed methods so as to take full advantage of statistics enhancement. Using these techniques, improvement in classification accuracy has been observed.

Commonly used reconstruction algorithm such as Filtered BackProjection (FBP) has been adopted due to its rapid computation but may compromise the resulting image quantitatively with inherent noise amplification. Expectation Maximization (EM), the algorithm [1] that includes the stochastic nature of count data, has been proposed and proved to generate better images [2] remains hard to use because of the high complexity of the algorithm. EM reconstruction algorithm is becoming more feasible with parallel computers which are widely available in research organizations. Different schemes and high-cost hardware platforms have been introduced [3, 4] to speed up the reconstruction process but often incur high cost with their ad-hoc approaches. We will introduce in this paper the hardware-independent parallel PET image reconstruction system with portable software implementation To reduce the cost that comes with most of the parallel platforms, commercial off-the-shelf hardware and software components can be used to build the system with low cost/performance ratio. The system architecture is also shown to be scalable with increasing image size to meet the future needs.

The hybrid smoothers exactly cross-couple one or both of two optimal smoothers, the Hidden Markov Model smoother and the Kalman smoother, according to the signal model requirements. We consider two broad classes of signal models for which these hybrid smoothers are applicable, those of Jump Markov linear systems, and Bilinear systems, both of which are used to model a wide range of physical processes in all areas of science, engineering and economics. Unlike other state estimation algorithms, our hybrid smoothers do not attempt to approximate the infinite dimensional conditional mean estimator. Rather they obtain MAP state sequence estimates, via the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The two cross-coupled optimal smoothers achieve the E and M steps of the algorithm, resulting in structurally simple hybrid smoothers.

The RSI, which is also another random field, has been adopted to distinguish real texture images with small window size. In this paper, the probability density function of RSI is assumed to be the Gaussian, MRF, making the extraction of the texture features easy. The proposed textured image segmentation consists of two stages: texture feature extraction and clustering the feature parameters. In the extraction stage, toe use the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, which is widely used for incomplete data problem. Then, the extracted texture parameters are clustered by using the k-means algorithm. The experiment shows good segmentation results for both synthetic and various real images.

The schemes designed for Gaussian noise typically perform very poorly hen the noise is non-Gaussian. An approach for non-Gaussian signal processing is presented in this paper that is based on modeling the probability density function (pdf) of the additive noise with a finite mixture of Gaussian pdfs. Model parameters are estimated using iterative procedures derived from the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Explicit algorithms are presented for several signal processing problems using this framework, including linear regression, array processing, and sequence estimation for intersymbol interference communication channels. The resulting algorithms are data-adaptive, in that they characterize the non-Gaussian noise and then modify the signal processing accordingly.

The Monte Carlo method was used to generate nearly noise-free projection data modeling the effects of attenuation, detector response, and scatter from the MCAT phantom. One thousand noise realizations were generated with an average count level approximating a typical Tl-201 cardiac study. Each noise realization was reconstructed using the RBI and OS algorithms for cases with and without detector response modeling. For each iteration up to twenty, we generated mean and variance images, as well as covariance images for six specific locations. Both OS and RBI converged in the mean to results that were not significantly different from the noise-free ML-EM result using the same projection model. When detector response was not modeled in the reconstruction, RBI exhibited considerably lower noise variance than OS for the same resolution. When 3D detector response was modeled, the two algorithms provided the same noise variance to resolution recovery tradeoff, while OS required about half the number of iterations of RBI to reach the same point. We conclude that OS is faster than RBI, but may be sensitive to errors in the projection model. Both OS-EM and RBI-EM are effective alternatives to the ML-EM algorithm, but noise level and speed of convergence depend on the projection model used.

The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is a good iterative approach in maximum likelihood parameter estimation for the ME learning. Recently, a new criteria on selecting the correct number of experts for both the original and alternative model for ME are proposed by one of the present author, based on the so-called Bayesian Ying-Yang (BW) Learning Theory. In this paper, the new criteria is experimental studied and compared with the well known Cross Validation criteria. Simulation results show that the expert number obtained by the BW criteria is highly consistence with the minimum generalization error and outperforms Cross Validation approach.

We introduce a novel geometry for a dual-head SPECT imaging system (Park Medical Systems Inc, Lachine, Quebec) to improve the count sensitivity. The imaging system is equipped with a coded aperture and a parallel hole collimators. The camera head equipped with the coded aperture collimator is used to acquire count-rich projection images, and the other head with the parallel hole collimator is used to acquire high resolution projection images. To further improve the image resolution of the projections, two expectation-maximization-type blind deconvolution (EMBD) algorithms were derived. The algorithms were evaluated using elliptical cylindrical rod phantom and human hand data. The coded aperture and parallel hole projections were acquired simultaneously using the dual-head SPECT imaging system. The acquired coded aperture projections were decoded using the standard uniformly redundant array (URA) decoding technique to yield decoded projections. The projections acquired from the parallel hole collimator head were incorporated into the decoded images in the EMBD restoration process. Using the coded aperture collimator, the count sensitivity was markedly increased, 8-fold for the phantom data and approximately 20-fold for the hand data, as compared to the parallel hole collimator. Also, image quality of the SPECT projections was significantly improved when the EMBD algorithms were implemented on the projections. Thus, the dual-head SPECT imaging system associated with the EM-type blind deconvolution algorithms may be a preferred system for low-count SPECT imaging.

The maximum likelihood estimator can handle this kind of random variation in the reconstruction of a PET image. However, the reconstruction is ill-posed and needs regularization. The boundary information, either from an expert or from the other medical modality of the same object, like the X-ray CT scan, MRI, and so forth, can be used to regularize the reconstruction. We have investigated new, efficient and robust approaches to extract the related but incomplete boundary information. Fast algorithms adapted from the expectation/conditional maximization (ECM) and space alternating generalized expectation maximization (SAGE) algorithms are proposed to accelerate the computation. The method of generalized approximate cross validation (GACV) is adjusted to select the penalty parameter from observed data quickly. The Monte Carlo studies demonstrate the improvement.

The procedure requires specification of unobservable complete data which augment the measured or incomplete data. This specification defines a conditional expectation of the complete data log-likelihood function which is computed in the E-step. The EM algorithm is most effective when maximizing the function Q(theta) defined in the E-step is easier than maximizing the likelihood function. The Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) algorithm of Wei & Tanner (1990) was introduced for problems where computation of Q is difficult or intractable. However Monte Carlo can be computationally expensive, e.g. in signal processing applications involving large numbers of parameters. We provide another approach: a modification of the standard EM algorithm avoiding computation of conditional expectations. The new algorithm utilizes the score function of the incomplete data. The role of augmented data is retained in our algorithm, named augmented data scoring (ADS). ADS determines step sizes of a gradient type algorithm through use of the complete data information matrix. An algorithm of Titterington (1984) for sequentially acquired data provides a similar use of augmented data and Fisher information, but in a sequential, context. We establish a close connection between ADS and EM algorithms. By substituting a Fisher's scoring iteration for M-step optimization, ADS also circumvents difficulties in the M-step, another common problem in applying an EM algorithm.

In this work, we explore this idea by building sub-sentence discourse language models for conversational speech recognition. The internal sentence structure is captured in statistical language modeling by training multiple n-gram models using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm on the Switchboard corpus. The resulting model contributes to a 30% reduction in language model perplexity and a small gain in word error rate.

This algorithm seeks to minimize an objective function of weighted least squares (WLS) type. However, unlike conventional WLS methods, the weights do not need to be estimated from the data, but are incorporated in the objective function and relies heavily on the Poisson nature of the data. As a result, the objective function is not quadratic, but is convex. The iterative algorithm is obtained in a manner similar to an analytic derivation of the ML-EM (maximum likelihood - expectation maximization) algorithm which employs an alternating minimization procedure between two convex sets of matrices. However, the distance metric is quite different in our case, and much more difficult to analyze. This algorithm is similar in form to, and shares many properties in common with, the ML-EM algorithm. The mathematical proof of the global convergence of the algorithm remains an open problem.

But, the Cramer-Rao bound can be proved to be the same for all alpha. On the learning speed, however, the alpha-EM algorithm has a range of alpha that outperforms the traditional EM algorithm. There is a hierarchy in a class of unsupervised learning emanated from the alpha-EM algorithm to deterministic vector quantization. Vector quantization is a special case of competitive learning which can be interpreted as a hard-max version of the EM algorithm. This paper gives a unified theory starting from the alpha-EM algorithm terminated by vector quantization. Performance comparison on various subclasses are given. Relationships to harmonic competition, multiple descent cost competition and self-organization are also discussed.

These extended EM algorithms (WEM's, alpha-EM's) have been anticipated to outperform the traditional (logarithmic) EM algorithm on the speed. The traditional approach falls into a special case of the new WEM. In this paper, general theoretical discussions are given first. Then, clear-cut evidences that show faster convergence than the ordinary EM approach are given on the case of mixture-of-expert neural networks. This process takes three steps. The first step is to show concrete algorithms. Then, the convergence is theoretically checked. Thirdly, experiments on the mixture-of-expert learning are tried to show the superiority of the WEM. Besides the supervised learning, unsupervised case on a Gaussian mixture is also examined. Faster convergence of the WEM is observed again.

Such a likelihood ratio is based on an ct-logarithm which contains the usual logarithm as a special case. This generalized logarithm is defined through a discussion of the a-divergence which includes the Kullback-Leibler number as a special case. It is found that the usage of such a generalized logarithm on the likelihood ratio is equivalent to a prior probability weight. Then, this prior weighting is derived for learning on:neural networks of expert mixtures. Both of gradient ascent maximization and EM learning are discussed. The prior weighting is understood as speed-up and stabilization on the learning.

The network's structure is characterised by a set of continuous structure parameters. The solution models the distribution of each node variable, conditioned on the set of its candidate parents, as a mixture of the distributions conditioned on the each of the subsets of its candidate parents. The algorithm determines the mixing weights according to the maximum a posteriori probability criterion and therefore interpolates between a rich selection of models of varying complexity. The acyclicity condition is incorporated within the prior distribution of the structure parameters. The resulting models are sets of node conditional distributions that cart be implemented using standard Bayesian network inference packages.

Gaussian mixtures are the most widely used distributions in mixture modeling and the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is commonly used for Gaussian mixture decomposition. Gaussian mixtures are not suitable for certain problems. Moreover, the EM algorithm suffers from the disadvantage that the number of components in the mixture needs to be specified. In this paper we introduce Pearson Type II mixtures, and present an agglomerative technique for Pearson Type II mixture decomposition which automatically determines the number of components required to model the data efficiently. We apply the proposed algorithm to detect lines and planes, and to classify 5 benchmark data sets. The results obtained are compared with results from a well known fuzzy clustering technique (Gustafson Kessel algorithm) and with agglomerative Gaussian mixture decomposition.

Blind Channel equalization is a method of recovering the original symbols by compensating for channel distortion at the receiver's end without any known training sequence for the startup period. If the non-linear channel distortion is too severe to ignore, the conventional blind equalizers suffer from severe performance degradation because they are based on linear transversal filters. The proposed equalizer overcomes this difficulty via the bottleneck network implemented by evolvable hardware. Using a genetic algorithm, the network on the hardware is trained to minimize an energy function based on the maximum likelihood estimation. Simulation results show that the proposed equalizers have superior performance to popular CMA blind equalizers.

Key considerations are priors, sample size and sampling strategy, labels, statistical dependencies, and dimensionality. The small-sample bias and variance of ML, MAP and Bayes estimators are compared in a small concrete case. Iterative expectation maximization for estimating the sufficient statistics of mixtures is illustrated in a simple setting. It is shown that correlation among features is sometimes unjustly maligned. A counterintuitive increase in the Error rate after adding a second feature is traced to the curse of dimensionality. Adaptive classification is presented in the context of both parametric and non-parametric (nearest neighbors and neural nets) estimation. Some recent theoretical results and older experimental observations on hybrid classification are summarized.

We have already investigated a mapping method based on the Viterbi decoding algorithm which converts an input speech to a lip movement sequence through the most likely HMM state sequence conducted by audio HMMs. However, the method contains a substantial problem of producing errors along incorrectly decoded HMM states. This paper newly proposes a method to re-estimate visual parameters using HMMs of audio-visual joint probability under the Expectation-Maximization(EM) algorithm. In experiments, the proposed mapping method using the EM algorithm shows reduction of error by 26% compared to the method using Viterbi algorithm at incorrectly decoded bilabial consonants.

In this paper the solution is extended to the case of two-dimensional signals, where spatial stationarity enforces a Toeplitz-block-Toeplitz structure on the covariance matrix. A further generalisation which is presented involves the estimation of the covariance when the observations are subject to subspace interference. It is shown that this situation is amenable to a missing data interpretation, and can be incorporated into the EM iteration with moderate ease. The solution shares all the characteristics of the I-D Toeplitz estimate. The need to solve this problem arises in many invariance applications, where it is required to fit a stationary multivariate normal model to data which is subject to a certain type of interference. The case of unknown DC offset is included in this class.

This paper shows that the accuracy of text classifiers trained with a small number of labeled documents can be improved by augmenting this small training set with a large pool of unlabeled documents. We present a theoretical argument showing that, under common assumptions, unlabeled data contain information about the target function. We then introduce an algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeled text based on the combination of Expectation-Maximization with a naive Bayes classifier. The algorithm first trains a classifier using the available labeled documents, and probabilistically labels the unlabeled documents; it then trains a new classifier using the labels for all the documents, and iterates to convergence. Experimental results, obtained using text from three different real-world tasks, show that the use of unlabeled data reduces classification error by up to 33%.

The framework itself is founded on a carefully designed multiscale prior probability distribution placed on the "splits" in the multiscale partition of the underlying intensity, and it admits a remarkably simple MAP estimation procedure using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Unlike many other approaches to this problem, the EM update equations for our algorithm have simple, closed-form expressions. Additionally, our class of priors has the interesting feature that the "non-informative" member yields the traditional maximum likelihood solution; other choices are made to reflect prior belief as to the smoothness of the unknown intensity.

Although Monte Carlo studies have been used to compare some of the simpler techniques, such as listwise and pairwise deletion, this proposed study will compare the techniques of mean substitution, imputation by regression, expectation maximization (EM), full information maximum likelihood estimation (FIML), and multiple imputation.

We use unsupervised techniques to estimate the parameters of a model describing the conditional distribution of the sense group given the known contextual features. Both the EM. algorithm and Gibbs Sampling are evaluated to determine which is most appropriate for our data. We compare their disambiguation accuracy in an experiment with thirteen different words and three feature sets.

We show how the maximum likelihood expectation maximization algorithm, transformed to its additive form, can be extended by several further additive terms to improve lesion contrast and smoothness of the reconstructed image. Based upon locally correlated Markov random field priors in the form of Gibbs functions, Bayesian reconstruction for maximum a posteriori estimation is applied to include prior models of isotope concentration. For simultaneous image reconstruction and segmentation, a mixture model for clustering of the data is applied in which mixture parameters are recalculated for each iteration. Additional filtering of the data during the expectation maximization process can be done using well-known models from filter theory. We describe the application of a nonlinear inhibition filter which is used by the human visual system. The method is illustrated by applications to data from SPECT scans.

Recordings were made over a 2 x 2 mm area at bath superficial and deep locations in one hemisphere. Signals were analyzed using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm for spike separation based on spike peak height or the first two principle components of spike shape. 27 sites were selected for analysis based on task response and clarity of separation, yielding 85 total neurons with a mode of 3 cells per site. The response criteria and stereotaxic location used were consistent with identifying neurons within the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). For cells within the set of selected sites, responses to the task were further categorized based upon spatial characteristics (preferred direction) and temporal characteristics (time of maximal response). Neighboring cells were found to be very likely to have similar tuned direction (75% within one octant), but not comparatively likely to have similar temporal characteristics. We take this as evidence that area LIP is heterogeneous at the local level.

We adopt the context of Bayesian unsupervised classification, so that our problem amounts to estimating a mixture of k components on R-m, where k is the number of classes and m is the number of sensors. When these components are Gaussian, one can use some general methods like Expectation-Maximization (EM) or Iterative Conditional Estimation (TCE). When the components are not Gaussian but the components of each of them are independent, one can still estimate such a mixture by the use of ICE or some stochastic variant of EM. We attack in this paper the more general problem of possibly correlated and non Gaussian sensors. A new method, called ICE-COR, of estimation of the corresponding mixture is presented and we provide some simulation results. The method proposed is inspired from a recent "generalized" mixture estimates, which means that we do not know, a priori, what the exact forms of the components are.

This technique used a spatially variant quadratic Gibbs penalty which enforced smoothness everywhere in the ECT image except across the MRI-extracted boundary of the ROI. When high quality estimates of the anatomical boundary are available and MRI and ECT images are perfectly registered, the performance of this Gibbs penalty method is very close to that attainable using perfect side information, i.e. an errorless anatomical boundary estimate. However when the variance of the MRI-extracted boundary estimate becomes significant this method performs poorly. Here we present a modified Gibbs penalty function which accounts for errors in side information based on an asymptotic min-max robustness approach. The resulting penalty is implemented with a set of averaged Gibbs weights where the averaging is performed with respect to a limiting form of the min-max induced posterior distribution of the MRI boundary parameters. Examples will be presented for tracer uptake estimation using the SAGE version of the EM algorithm and various parameterizations of the anatomical boundaries.

To accomplish this, EM iteratively reweights the elements of the dataset until a locally optimal normal mixture is obtained. This paper explores the intriguing question of whether such an EM-style algorithm exists for the related and apparently more difficult problem of finding a normal mixture that maximizes the a posteriori class probabilities of a labeled dataset. We expose a fundamental degeneracy in the relationship between a normal mixture and the a posteriori class probability functions that it induces, and use this degeneracy to prove that reweighting a dataset can almost always give rise to a normal mixture exhibiting any desired class function behavior. This establishes that EM-style approaches are sufficiently expressive for a posteriori optimization problems and opens the way to the design of new algorithms for them.

The proposed method extends and improves the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) paradigm by incorporating a multiscale correlation model of pixel dependence into the standard approach. In particular, the standard GMM is modified by introducing a multiscale neighborhood clique that incorporates the correlation between pixels in space and scale. We modify the log likelihood function of the image field by a penalization term that is derived from a multiscale neighborhood clique. Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation via the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate the parameters of the new model. Then, utilizing the parameter estimates, the image field is segmented with a MAP classifier. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm provides superior segmentations of synthetic images, yet is computationally efficient.

In order to manage dynamic environments, where the input-output distribution of data changes with time, unit manipulation mechanisms are also introduced. Experimental results show that our approach is suitable for function approximation problems in dynamical environments.

This Bayesian approach is applied to SPECT projection data acquired from a realistic torso phantom with spherical defects in the lungs simulating perfusion deficits. Both the scatter subtraction constant (k) and the smoothing parameter beta (beta) characterizing the prior are varied to study their affect on image quality and quantification. Region of interest (ROI) analysis is used to compare MAP-EM radionuclide concentration estimates with those derived from a "clinical" implementation of filtered backprojection (CFBP), and a quantitative implementation of FBP (QFBP) utilizing nonuniform attenuation and scatter compensation. Qualitatively, the MAP-FM images contain reduced artifacts near the lung boundaries relative to the FBP implementations. Overall MAP-EM image visual quality and the ability to discern the areas of reduced radionuclide concentration in the lungs depend on the value of beta and the total number of iterations. For certain choices of beta and total iterations, MAP-EM lung images are visually comparable to FBP. Based on profile and ROI analysis, SPECT QFBP and MAP-EM images have the potential to provide quantitatively accurate reconstructions when compared to CFBP; computational burden, however, is greater for the MAP-EM approach. To demonstrate the potential clinical efficacy of the methods, we present pulmonary perfusion images of a patient with lung cancer.

This modeling process is begun by clustering the known DNA sequences from the virus population into groups such that the individual clusters represent biological strains of the modeled virus. Next, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is associated with each cluster, and its parameters computed using Baum-Welch's Expectation Maximization procedure. In this manner, the sequences within a cluster represent a maximally likely random sample drawn from the learned HMM. After the HMM for each strain cluster has thus been learned, it can further be used to generate additional samples of viral DNA sequences that are expected from the same underlying HMM. These newly predicted sequences would represent a maximally likely set of sequences belonging to a given viral strain modeled by the underlying HMM.

MXE is formulated with two terms: a maximum likelihood expectation maximization term and a penalty term for regularization within morphologically defined boundaries. The relative emphasis put on the two competing terms is controlled by the regularization constant beta. Edge resolution and noise were compared for reconstructions with and without corresponding prior. The prior leads to significant edge enhancement with edge resolution converging to a theoretical limit independent of beta. Normalised standard deviation (NSD) and resolution both illustrate that regularization within boundaries behaves predictably with more smoothing for larger beta. Application of ordered subsets (OS) was also investigated. For OS, edge enhancement is fully preserved but NSD increases for low subset size. Results demonstrate that OS is applicable to MXE provided subset size is greater than 4. OS-MXE has appealing properties for regularized reconstruction.

Using the conventional statistical model introduced by Shepp and Verdi (1982), many authors have adopted a Bayesian approach to address this problem and to estimate the different numbers of Gamma rays emitted lambda = (lambda(s))(s is an element of T) at each pixel s. As prior on lambda to regularize the picture, one uses a Gauss Markov random Field. However, this approach has one major drawnback: the choice of the regularization parameter beta. If beta is too high, the discontinuities are oversmoothed, and if beta is too low, the picture is not regularized enough. In this paper, we introduce a new hierarchical prior model for lambda, in which beta is not constant over the picture. This hierarchical prior model uses a Markov random field to describe spatial variation of the logarithm of the smoothing parameter log beta = (log beta(s))(s is an element of T) in a second random field which describes the spatial variation in lambda. The coupled Markov random fields are used as prior distributions. Similar ideas have occurred in Aykroyd (1996), but our prior model is quite different. Our new hierarchical prior model is applied for the problem of deconvolution of radioactive sources in Gamma imaging. The estimation of lambda and beta is based on their joint posterior density, following a Bayesian framework. This estimation is performed using a new SAGE EM algorithm (Hero and Fessler, 1995), where the parameters lambda and beta are updated sequentially. Our new prior model is tested on synthetic and real data and compared to the conventional Gauss Markov random field prior model : our algorithm increases significantly the results obtained by using a classical prior model.

One of these collimator designs is a half-cone beam collimator. However, the sensitivity is reduced as objects are removed from the focal line and it does not satisfy Tuy's sufficiency condition. A potential solution to this problem is to use one parallel hole collimator in conjunction with two half-cone beam collimators on a triple camera single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) system. We acquired projection data with a Defrise disk phantom filled with Tc-99m. A half-cone beam collimator with a focal length of 50 cm was placed on one head of a triple camel-a SPECT system. A low energy super high resolution (LESR) parallel hole collimator was placed on a second head. Different projection data sets were combined to model acquisition in the three headed gamma camera with three half-cone beam collimators, two half-cone beam and one parallel beam collimators and three parallel beam collimators. Image reconstruction used a modified maximum likelihood maximization-expectation (ML-EM) algorithm. For me reconstruction with three half-cone beam collimators, we observe axial blurring. This is eliminated with two half-cone beam and one parallel beam collimators. There is a lack of a sharp boundary along the axial direction of the three half-cone beam collimator configuration as opposed to other collimation configurations that had a well defined boundary.

When the ratio of the number of training samples to the dimensionality is small, parameter estimates become highly variable, causing the deterioration of classification performance. This problem has become more prevalent in remote sensing with the emergence of a new generation of sensors. While the new sensor technology provides higher spectral and spatial resolution, enabling a greater number of spectrally separable classes to be identified, the needed labeled samples for designing the classifier remain difficult and expensive to acquire. Better parameter estimates can be obtained by exploiting a large number of unlabeled samples in addition to training samples using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm under the mixture model. However, the estimation method is sensitive to the presence of statistical outliers. In remote sensing data, classes with few samples are difficult to identify and may constitute statistical outliers. Therefore, we propose a robust parameter estimation method for the mixture model. The proposed method assigns full weight to the sample from the main body of the data, but automatically gives reduced weight to statistical outliers. Experimental results show that the robust method prevents performance deterioration due to statistical outliers in the data as compared to the estimates obtained from EM approach.

The aim of the study is to analyze the relationship between the quality of images and the selection of subsets or the access order of calculation among the subsets. The image quality was assessed with the mean square error, chi-square error and newly proposed error measures defined in the frequency domain. The results showed the recovery speed of the low to middle frequency components of an image is increased by the access order in calculation, in which the total number of subsets is divided by two or three, and subsets are accessed with the order separating neighboring subsets as much as possible.

This novel approach can track the temporal changes in the images by utilizing the temporal contextual information and adjust the neural network to adapt to such changes. The maximum likelihood (ML) criterion is adopted in bath the training and updating schemes, and the well-known Expectation-Maximization (EM) approach is employed to achieve this goal. The proposed scheme is examined on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) 8 satellite cloud imagery and the results are promising. The proposed temporal updating scheme can also be applied to a number of other important applications where spatial-temporal classification of a sequence of images is needed.

The methods incorporate information about the non-uniform attenuation in the patient's chest region, and 3D models of the spatially variant collimator-detector and scatter responses in the iterative algorithm. Increasingly accurate 3D reconstructed images are obtained as the degrading factors are progressively compensated through increasing number of iterations. The final image estimate is obtained when an optimum trade-off between accuracy and noise is achieved. Recent advances include accurate determination of the attenuation distribution in the chest region using transmission CT methods and optimization of the implementation of the complex collimator-detector and scatter response functions in the iteration process. Taking advantage of the recently available fast iterative OS-EM algorithm and computer hardware, the 3D image reconstruction methods can be implemented in clinically acceptable processing time.

In this paper we introduced the OS algorithm to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) - EM method and named this method OS- Bayesian reconstruction (BR). The performance of OS-BR was compared with ML-EM, MAP-EM and OS-EM on reconstructed images. The results showed that OS-BR with suitable parameters yielded higher quality images than the other methods at earlier iterations.

The rate of convergence of two accelerated methods, It-W (JNM 1993;34:1793) and ordered-subset expectation-maximization (OS-EM, IEEE-TMI 1994;13:601) were compared using a resolution phantom containing objects of sizes ranging from 1.0 to 2.5 cm. Object contrast was used as a measure of convergence. Attenuation and depth-dependent blur were modeled in the 90-angle projections and during reconstruction. For both methods, convergence was most rapid at the periphery and slowest in the center, with larger (lower frequency) objects converging most rapidly. When assessed under noise-free conditions, It-W converged 8-fold faster than 6-subset OS-EM, and 4-fold faster than 15-subset OS-EM. In an ensemble of 25 noisy images both methods gave essentially identical reconstructions when compared at equivalent noise levels using kernel-sieve regularization, but It-W converged 5 times faster than 15-subset OS-FM. Thus, the It-W method has a significant speed advantage for clinical application of iterative algorithms in SPECT, while retaining the favorable noise properties of the slower OS-FM and ML-EM reconstructions.

The Expectation Maximization algorithm is developed for estimating the carrier phases, amplitudes and propagation delays of the uplink channel based on training sequence which is transmitted with the subcarriers used for data transmission. The performance of the resulting estimator is evaluated via simulation. The results indicate that the estimator a's well suited for coherent data detection at the receiver associated with maximal ratio combining.

To obtain better classification accuracy with limited training data a hybrid Hebbian / backpropagation learning algorithm is adopted, which successfully reduces the sensitivity of the output values over the input values for robust classification and good generalization performance. To handle with incomplete training data, a TEST (Training-EStimation-Training) algorithm is developed. Based on the complete portion of the data, the TEST algorithm first estimates the missing attributes and latter utilizes the estimated values to fine-tune the neural networks. No assumption on the data distribution functions is required. Theoretical analyses on these 2 algorithms are newly presented, and the accuracy is proved for several benchmark databases.

Many scatter correction techniques, such as multiple-window subtraction and intrinsic modeling with iterative algorithms, have been under study for many years. Previously, we developed an efficient slice-to-slice blurring technique to model attenuation and system geometric response in a projector/backprojector pair, which was used in an ML-EM algorithm to reconstruct SPECT data. Th is paper gropes es a projector/backprojector that models the 3D first-order scatter in SPECT, also using an efficient slice-to-slice blurring technique. The scatter response is estimated from a known, non-uniform, attenuation distribution map. It is assumed that the probability of a scatter event at a pixel is proportional to the attenuation coefficient value at that pixel. Monte Carlo simulations of point-sources and a MCAT torso phantom were used to verify the accuracy of the proposed projector/backprojector model. For a 64 x 64 x 64 image volume, it took 8.7 seconds to perform each iteration per slice, when modeling 3D scatter, attenuation, and system point response functions. The main advantage of the proposed method is its ease to implement and efficiency in computer calculation.

An adaptive receiver which uses multiple antennas for diversity against fading is developed for operation in an impulsive noise environment. The noise components at each sensor are assumed to be correlated A mixture of Gaussian distributions is used to model the noise. Model parameters are estimated using iterative procedures derived from the expectation-maximization algorithm. These estimated parameters are then used in a likelihood ratio test to recover the transmitted signals. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to study the receiver performance. Results show that the performance of the proposed adaptive receiver is very close to that of the optimum receiver with known noise distribution when enough training data is available.

The ''unsupervised'' segmentation means that all the model parameters, including the number of image classes, are unknown and have to be estimated from the observed image. In addition, the ''adaptive'' segmentation means that both the region distribution and the image feature within a region are all location-dependent and their corresponding parameters must be estimated from location to location. We estimated local parameters independently from multiple small windows under the assumption that an observed image consists of objects with smooth surfaces, no texture. Due to this assumption, the intensity of each region is a slowly varying function plus noise, and the conventional homogeneous hidden MRF (HMRF) models are appropriate for these windows. In each window, we employed the EM algorithm for maximum-likelihood (ML) parameter estimation, and then, the estimated parameters were used for ''maximizer of the posterior marginals'' (MPM) segmentation. To keep continuous segments between windows, a scheme for combining window Fragments was proposed. The scheme comprises two parts: the programming of windows and the Bayesian merging of window Fragments. Finally, a remerging procedure is used as post processing to remove the over-segmented small regions that possibly exist after the Bayesian merging. Since the final segments are obtained From merging, the number of image classes is automatically determined. The use of multiple parallel windows makes our algorithm to be suitable for parallel implementation. The experimental results of real-world images showed that the surfaces (objects) consistent with our reasonable model assumptions were all correctly segmented as connected regions.

A neural network architecture is developed here that can perform unsupervised joint segmentation and labeling of objects in images. We propose the semi-parametric hierarchical mixture density (HMD) model as a tool for capturing the diversity of real world images and pose the object recognition problem as a maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the HMD parameters. We apply the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for this purpose and utilize ideas and techniques from statistical physics to cast the problem as the minimization of a free energy function. We then proceed to regularize the solution thus obtained by adding smoothing terms to the objective function. The resulting recursive scheme for estimating the posterior probabilities of an object's presence in an image corresponds to an unsupervised feedback neural network architecture. We present here the results of experiments involving recognition of traffic signs in natural scenes using this technique.

J	Oskrochi, GR; Davies, RB				Oskrochi, GR; Davies, RB			Stayers in mixed Markov renewal models	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						generalized linear models; Markov model; EM algorithm; random effect models; Monte Carlo simulation	VARIABLES	In modelling the succession of states occupied by individuals over time, it is important to include state dependence, duration-of-stay effects, and variation between individuals over and above that explained by covariates. It has been long recognized that omission of any one of these characteristics can result in seriously misleading inference about the other two and the effects of covariates. Mixed Markov renewal models are the most parsimonious general class of model which incorporate all three characteristics. However, problems over the detailed specification and the complex computational requirements of such models have inhibited their use in social science research. This paper is concerned with one specific problem: ensuring sufficient flexibility for the multivariate mixing distribution by correcting the tendency to under predict the number who remain in the same state throughout. It is shown how an efficient EM-type algorithm based on weighted GLMs is readily extended to include stayers within a mixed Markov renewal formulation. Ln contrast to the direct maximization of the log-likelihood using a Newton-Raphson (or similar) algorithm, stayers may improve significantly the convergence performance of the EM-GLM approach.

The optimization procedure involved is complex and problems are encountered with using an EM type algorithm, and instead the use of simulated annealing is investigated. The results of fitting the model to real data are then briefly discussed. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This approach is a multivariate generalization of the method for univariate mixtures presented by Hinde (1982). Its accuracy and efficiency are compared with direct maximization of the log-likelihood. Using a simulation study, we also compare the efficiency of Monte Carlo and Gaussian quadrature methods for approximating the mixture distribution. The new approach with Gaussian quadrature outperforms the alternative methods considered. The work is motivated by the multivariate mixture models which have been proposed for modelling changes of employment states at an individual level. Similar formulations are of interest for modelling movement between other social and economic states and multivariate mixture models also occur in biostatistics and epidemiology.

It is supposed that trees can be ranked according to some criterion (e.g., diameter) and that the selection of trees to be thinned is based on their local rank (i.e., rank in a plot). The stand is considered to be divided into plots containing a constant number of trees and a plot is described by the vector of numbers of trees In each class, For a randomly sampled plot, the probability law of this vector is modeled by a mixture of multinomial distributions, which reflects the spatial structure at the plot scale. The parameters of the mixture are estimated by maximum Likelihood with the EM algorithm, using a sample of plots. Then, for each component of the mixture, the probability laws of the order statistics are computed, from which the expected number of thinned trees by class and by component is deduced Summing over the components gives the expected number of thinned trees by class for the whole stand. The model is applied and validated on a real oak stand, In conclusion, other possible applications are described, in particular to local and selective thinning strategy in mixed stands.

The Zubal phantom was made from segmented MRI slices of the brain, so that neuro-anatomical structures are well defined and indexed. Small regions-of-interest (ROIs) from the white matter, grey matter in the center of the brain and grey matter from the peripheral area of the brain were selected for the evaluation. Photon attenuation and distance-dependent collimator blurring were modeled. Multiple independent noise realizations were generated for two different count levels. The simulation study showed that the ROI bias measured for the EM-based algorithms decreased as the iteration number increased, and that the OS-EM and RBI-EM algorithms (16 and 64 subsets were used) achieved the equivalent accuracy of the ML-EM algorithm at about the same noise variance, with much fewer number of iterations. The Bellini-FDP restoration algorithm converged fast and required less computation per iteration. The ML-EM algorithm had a slightly better ROI bias vs. variance trade-off than the other algorithms.

The sources are modeled as independent autoregressive (AR) processes. Based on a Markovian switching policy, we assume that the different sources transmit signals on the same single channel, The receiver records the 1-bit quantized version of the transmitted signal and aims to identify the sequence of active sources. Once the source sequence has been identified, the characteristics (parameters) of each source are estimated. We formulate the parametric pulse train de-interleaving problem as a 1-bit quantized Markov modulated AR series, The algorithm proposed in this paper combines Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Binary Time Series (BTS) estimation techniques. Our estimation scheme generalizes Kedem's (1980) binary time series algorithm for linear time series to Markov modulated time series. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

The algorithm uses the State Space Model with the state transition matrix being estimated by a relaxation technique. This lightly increases its complexity, as compared to a similar algorithm proposed in the literature, but renders the Robust SPA a better performance. The algorithm is also compared with the Expectation-Maximization technique and, in general, the Robust SPA yields a slightly poorer performance as far as the mean square error between projected and observed data is concerned. On the other hand, it is more robust and requires far less computational effort. Moreover, due to its simplicity, an automated version of the algorithm can be easily implemented for applications in which a great deal of data is to be forecasted.

These are filtered backprojection and iterative reconstruction; Filtered backprojection is fast and produces acceptable images. Iterative. reconstruction is slow, but produces images of greater accuracy than backprojcction. The authors sought to develop a method of SPECT reconstruction that would have the advantages of both established methods: close in speed to backprojection and with the accuracy of iterative reconstruction. This was accomplished by computing a direct solution to the set of linear equations governing SPECT reconstruction. We tested this method of SPECT reconstruction using a set of projections from a cold rod and sphere phantom. Direct reconstruction produced images having equivalent resolution to backprojected images, but with double the contrast ratio. The direct method required 10 seconds of computation per slice on a Macintosh Quadra 950 (Apple Computer; Cupertin, CA), significantly faster than most iterative methods. Copyright (C) 1997 by W.B.

The constructive technique is based on an EM algorithm to estimate the parameters and the number of nodes is iteratively increased by means of discriminant placement. The growth control is imposed by an information theoretic criterion that prevents the network from becoming extremely complex and loosing generalization capabilities. After the growing phase is finished, another EM algorithm is used with labeled and unlabeled data in order to fine-tune network parameters. This solution improves the test-performance for the applications where labeled data is insufficient and the classes are not highly overlapped. We report results on some artificially generated examples and on terrain classification over a Landsat-TM image.

The growing process consist of iterative addition of a new Gaussian mixture. Every iteration is divided into two sequential phases: first, the likelihood of the data under the current configuration is maximized by means of the EM algorithm and then a new Gaussian mixture is added in the class that need it most in terms of a discriminative rule. Growth control is imposed by a complexity penalizing term and by a discriminative condition. After the growing process is finished a combined re-estimation using labeled and unlabeled data is performed. We report results on some artificially generated examples and on terrain classification over a Landsat-TM image using different restrictions for the covariance matrix of the mixtures.

In the last years many algorithms have been developed for reconstructing tomography images. The oftenly used maximum likelihood expectation maximization algorithm (ML-EM) seems to be a stable method and was developed by Shepp and Vardi [1] in 1982. However, the ML-EM algorithm causes some serious problems in the context of the application considered. It is an iterative procedure and converges to a stationary point, however, the reconstructed image seems to be distored by superposed high frequency noise. In this paper it is shown, that the ML-EM-Algorithm is not based on significant statistical properties in our problem, which has been verified by respective investigations. As a consequence of these results the algorithm has been modified in two ways. First, the expectation step has been replaced by a deterministic algorithm with accelerated convergence behaviour. Second, prior information is used to improve the statistical performance of the algorithm. Consequently, the algorithm has been changed to a maximum a posteriori estimator.

As the signal to noise ratio decreases the hidden Markov model method is shown to perform significantly better than a conventional histogram method for characterising the amplitude distribution. The HMM estimation is performed within a Expectation Maximisation method in order to improve the estimates of the transition probabilities used in the HMM and the resulting estimated amplitude distribution.

We discuss the rescaled block-iterative (RBI) approach to both algorithms. When a nonnegative solution exists, these RBI algorithms converge to a solution for any configuration of subsets. The RBI-EMML reduces to the ''ordered subset'' method when ''subset balance'' holds. When there is no nonnegative solution block-iterative methods produce limit cycles, from which an approximate solution can be obtained using a ''feedback'' approach.

It is of uttermost importance to quickly detect a change in the echo path while not confusing it with double talk, since the echo canceller should react differently whether an echo path change or double talk has occurred. In this paper, novel algorithms of low complexity are proposed. The system is described with a Markov modulated finite impulse response (FIR) filter. Depending on whether double talk or an echo path change occurs different parameters in the channel model change abruptly. Based on model assumptions, maximum likelihood (ML) parameter estimates of the communication channel are obtained via recursive (off-line) or iterative (on-line) methods using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. This enables us to use a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) state estimator to yield the minimum probability of error in identifying the state of the communication channel, i.e. the possible presence of double talk and/or echo path change. The proposed algorithms are experimentally verified using a real speech signal and impulse responses created from measured impulse responses from real hybrids.

Each such piece of information is typically associated with a user-defined parameter. The values of these parameters can have. a significant effect on the results generated using these models. Despite the popularity of deformable models for various applications, not much attention has been paid to the estimation of these parameters. In this paper we describe systematic methods for the automatic estimation of these deformable model parameters. These methods are derived by posing the deformable models as a Bayesian inference problem. Our parameter estimation methods use Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for generating samples from highly complex probability distributions.

The research developed in this paper is concerned with the reduction of chemical herbicides which will be only sprayed where there are weeds. We take into account the texture and the color during the image processing in order to classify the pixels into 2 classes : the soil and the vegetation. An EM algorithm is performed for doing this. Then, the recognition phase consists in recognizing the weed leaves from the cereal leaves using a local feature. Finally, the weed density is very easily computed. The proposed method also works on complex images where the leaves are overlapping each other.

Unlike the standard mixtures of experts architecture, a gate-bank consisting of multiple gating networks is introduced to the proposed architecture, and those gating networks in the gate-bank receive different input vectors while expert networks may be receiving different input vectors. As a result, a classification task with diverse features can be learned by the modular neural architecture through the use of different features simultaneously. In, the proposed architecture, learning is treated as a maximum likelihood problem and an EM algorithm is presented for adjusting the parameters of the architecture. Comparative simulation results are presented for a real world problem called text-dependent speaker identification.

While sophisticated statistical reconstruction methods can be devised to correct for these artifacts, their computational implementation is excessive for routine operational use. This work describes a technique for rapid computation of approximate constrained least squares regularization estimates. The unique feature of the approach is that it involves no iterative projection or backprojection steps. This contrasts with the familiar computationally intensive algorithms based on algebraic reconstruction (ART) or expectation-maximization (EM) methods. Experimentation with the new approach for deconvolution and mixture analysis shows that the root mean square error quality of estimators based on the proposed algorithm matches and usually dominates that of more elaborate maximum likelihood, at a fraction of the computational effort.

Markov modulated channels arise in city environments when a direct line of sight is blocked intermittently, and for large area coverage mobile cells where the channel has large variations in fading statistics. The channel is modelled as a time varying AR process, with coefficients which depend on a Markov chain. An optimal batch algorithm is presented which provides estimates of the channel and the digital signal. This is achieved by optimally coupling a Viterbi algorithm and a Kalman filter. The optimality is demonstrated via the Expectation Maximization algorithm. In addition, a sub-optimal on-line algorithm has been derived. By considering the channel to be Markov modulated, benefits can be gained over standard techniques which assume fixed fading statistics.

Recently, a natural extension of the EM algorithm was proposed(2) in order to handle regularization terms containing 'a priori' information far emission computed tomography (ECT) problems. This new idea was further applied to other regularized maximum likelihood problems(3-5) in transmision and emission tomography. We present in this article a unified approach to more general regularized ML problems. Our convergence proofs also extend those given in the previous papers allowing more general regularizations. We report on numerical simulations.

Therefore, a well-defined modeling of the backscattered echo leading to a high resolution parameter estimation of the echo amplitude, arrival time, echo skewness, center frequency and bandwidth is highly desirable for nondestructive evaluation of materials, target detection, object classification, velocity measurement and/or the ranging system. In this paper, a maximum likelihood (ML) model of the backscattered echoes is developed, assuming that all parameters describing the shape of the echo are unknown. The unknown parameters can be estimated by minimizing the mean square error using iterative techniques. Iterative parameter estimation has suffered has suffered from the problem of convergence and/or inaccurate results due to the local minima of the error function. In this investigation, a two-stage iterative estimation process known as the "Expectation/Maximization algorithm" is developed for the optimal parameter estimation of the echoes with low signal-to-noise ratio. In the first stage of the algorithm, we estimate the expected signal, and in the second stage the maximum likelihood criterion is used to estimate parameters. It has been observed that the EM algorithm is less dependent on the initial guess, is computationally efficient and performs well in resolving interfering multiple echoes.

Apart from being of significant mathematical interest, these new filters can be used with the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to yield maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters.

Independent line sites delimit piecewise stationary Gaussian autoregressives AR(1) corrupted with Gaussian white noise. Thanks to the Bayesian interpretation, we define the joint probability which in turn yields the likelihood. We demonstrate how to make its computation possible in cubic time. This calculation allows the set of parameters to be tested but not estimated due to the complex form of the criterion. Yet the computations done so far provide the materials for an iterative maximization. Indeed, the Expectation Maximization algorithm happens to match the features of this model and is also easily calculable. When the likelihood is known, the cost of one step of the latter algorithm is negligible in comparison with the previous calculations.

The matching process is realised as a two-step iterative process. Firstly, updated symbolic matches are located so as to minimise a Kullback-Leibler divergence between the model and data graphs. Secondly, with the updated matches to hand probabilities describing the affinity between nodes in the model and data graphs may be computed. The probability distributions underpinning this study are computed using a simple model of uniform matching errors. As a result the Kullback-Leibler divergence is defined over a family of exponential distributions of Hamming distance. We evaluate the noise sensitivity of our matching method on synthetically generated graphs. Finally, we offer comparison with both mean-field annealing and quadratic assignment.

MDPSM parameters can be trained in one of three different ways : (1) segment clustering, (2) expectation maximization (EM) training of mean trajectories, or (3) EM training of mean and variance trajectories. These parameter estimation methods were evaluated in TIMIT vowel classification experiments. The experimental results showed that modeling both the mean and variance trajectories are consistently superior to modeling only the mean trajectory. We also found that modeling both trajectories results in significant improvements over the conventional HMM.

Based on this spatially-variant mixture model we derive an expectation maximization algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of the pixel labels. While most algorithms using mixture models entail the subsequent use of a Bayes classifier for pixel labeling, the proposed algorithm yields maximum likelihood estimates of the labels themselves and results in unambiguous pixel labels. The proposed algorithm is fast, robust, easy to implement, flexible in that it can be applied to any arbitrary image data where the number of classes is known and, most importantly, obviates the need for an explicit labeling rule. The algorithm is evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively on simulated data and on clinical magnetic resonance images of the human brain.

The motion parameter is modeled as a nonrandom but unknown quantity and the problem is posed as one of Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation. The MRF potentials which characterize the underlying segmentation field are defined in a way that the spatio-temporal segmentation is constrained by the static image segmentation of the current frame. To compute the motion parameter vector and the segmentation simultaneously we use the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The E-step of the EM algorithm, which computes the conditional expectation of the segmentation field, now reflects interdependencies more accurately because of neighborhood interactions. We take recourse to Mean Field theory to compute the expected value of the conditional MRF. Robust M-estimation methods are used in the M-step. To allow for motions of large magnitudes image frames are represented at various scales and the EM procedure is embedded in a hierarchical coarse-to-fine framework. Our formulation results in a highly parallel algorithm that computes robust and accurate segmentations as well as motion vectors for use in low bit rate video coding.

For these experiments, the ETCT system was outfitted with a single channel of low-noise electronics which permitted acquisition of SPECT data with 3 keV FWHM energy resolution for good scatter rejection. Reference images were reconstructed with object-specific attenuation correction and accurate collimator response compensation. These images were then compared to images which were reconstructed without attenuation correction, without collimator response, or with data that had been blurred to simulate 13 keV FWHM energy resolution. The results show that although scatter represents a measurable error, its effect is small compared to the effect of attenuation and collimator blur. As part of this study, we have also compared scatter rejection to the well-known dual energy window scatter correction method and to a technique which incorporates an estimate of the scatter distribution directly in the back-projector of the ML-EM algorithm. It is shown that scatter correction may be preferable to scatter rejection due to noise considerations.

This places particular constraints on the design of image segmentation algorithms. This paper examines the trade-offs in segmenting images based on fitting a density function to the pixel intensities using curve-fitting versus the maximum likelihood method. A quantized data representation is proposed and the EM algorithm for fitting a finite mixture density function to the quantized representation for an image is derived. A Monte Carlo evaluation of mean estimation error and classification error showed that the resulting quantized EM algorithm dramatically reduces the required computation time without loss of accuracy.

If it is available, the likelihood does provide a basis for benchmarking of alternative approaches but not more than that. The challenge is to see whether everything that can be done via likelihoods has a corresponding quasi-likelihood approach from which the likelihood based results can be recovered, if they are available. It is conjectured that this is the case. In this paper, various illustrations are sketched of avoiding the likelihood in contexts where alternative approaches have not been obvious.

Like a traditional multihypothesis tracker (MHT), track estimation is deferred until more conclusive data is gathered. However, unlike a traditional algorithm, PMHT does not attempt to enumerate all possible combinations of feasible data association links, but uses a probabilistic structure derived using expectation-maximization. This study is focusing on two issues: the behavior of the PMHT algorithm in clutter and algorithm initialization in clutter. We also compare performance between this algorithm and other algorithms, including a nearest neighbor tracker, a probabilistic data association filter (PDAF), and a traditional measurement-oriented MHT algorithm.

Because of the low sensitivity of the system even in 3D mode and the need to produce images with high resolution, it was postulated that a 3D expectation maximization (EM) reconstruction algorithm might be well suited for this application. We investigated four reconstruction algorithms for the 3D SC PET camera: 2D filtered back-projection (FBP), 2D ordered subset EM (OSEM), 3D reprojection (3DRP), and 3D OSEM. Noise was assessed for all slices by the coefficient of variation in a simulated uniform cylinder. Resolution was assessed from a simulation of 15 point sources in the warm background of the uniform cylinder. At comparable noise levels, the resolution achieved with OSEM (0.9-mm to 1.2-mm) is significantly better than that obtained with FBP or 3DRP (1.5-mm to 2.0-mm.) Images of a rat skull labeled with F-18-fluoride suggest that 3D OSEM can improve image quality of a small animal PET camera.

We assume that the channel input sequence is a finite-state Markov chain and the channel output sequence is obtained from the continuous-time channel output by oversampling it at a rate higher than the channel input symbol rate, which leads to a fractionally-spaced channel equalisation problem. The objective of blind channel equalisation is to estimate the channel input symbols without explicit knowledge of the channel characteristics and the requirement of training data. The availability of multichannel outputs for the same channel input improves the reliability of the estimates. A reduced-cost blind equalisation algorithm which draws on aggregation by stochastic complementation is also proposed. A simulation example is presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.

The hierarchical multiresolution wavelet information in conjunction with the contextual information of the images extracted from GMRF provides a highly efficient technique for microcalcification detection. A Bayesian learning paradigm realized via the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm was also introduced for edge detection or segmentation of larger lesions recorded on the mammograms. The effectiveness of the approach has been extensively tested with a number of mammographic images provided by a local hospital.

The underlying computational representation is based on fine spline coverings. According to our EM approach the adjustment of spline parameters draws on an iterative weighted least-squares fitting process. The expectation step of our EM procedure computes the likelihood of the data using a mixture model defined over the set of spline coverings. These splines are limited in their spatial extent using Gaussian windowing functions. The maximisation of the likelihood leads to a set of linear equations in the spline parameters which solve the weighted least squares problem. We evaluate the technique on the localisation of road structures in aerial infra-red images.		Leite, JAF (reprint author), UNIV YORK,DEPT COMP SCI,YORK YO1 5DD,N YORKSHIRE,ENGLAND.

An expectation maximization type blind deconvolution algorithm (EMBD) based on maximum likelihood estimation is derived for restoration of SPECT planar projections acquired by the dual imaging system. The uniformly redundant array (URA) technique is used for decoding the shadowgram acquired by the coded aperture camera head. Results of real phantom data are presented. The new configuration of the dual SPECT imaging system considerably improves the: count sensitivity while still maintaining (or slightly improving) the conventional resolutions of high resolution collimation. The results also demonstrate the feasibility of the EMBD algorithm in improving image resolution and reducing background noise and non-uniformity artifacts of the decoded images. Thus, the new imaging system associated with the image restoration algorithm may be an advance of low-count nuclear imaging.

By using the filter bank implementation of the wavelet transform, this algorithm has the flexibility to incorporate a priori information, while maintaining the same computational complexity as the standard ML-EM algorithm. Thus, it has a significant computational advantage over usual Bayesian methods. It differs from recent wavelet-based Bayesian methods as it achieves ''regularization'' by an adaptive, wavelet-based method of thresholding which minimizes Stein's Unbiased Estimate of Risk. The basic method consists of applying Donoho and Johnstone's SureShrink wavelet denoising of the Poisson data, and then applying the standard ML-EM algorithm to the denoised data. A more elaborate method is discussed in which a wavelet denoising step is inserted after each EM iteration. This technique differs from previous smoothing techniques applied to the ML-EM algorithm since it is able to recover edges in discontinuous images.

Such a reconstruction is needed for the enhancement of depth perception in stereoscopic systems, e.g., "continuous look around" or adjustment of virtual camera baseline. The algorithm proposed here addresses the issue of blur; unlike typical reconstruction algorithms that perform averaging between disparity-compensated left and right images the new algorithm uses non-linear filtering via a winner-takes-all strategy. The image under reconstruction is assumed to be a tiling by fixed-size blocks that come from various positions of either the left or right images using disparity compensation. The tiling map is modeled by a binary decision field while the disparity model, is based an a smoothness constraint. The models are combined through a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) criterion. The intermediate intensities, disparities and the binary decision field are estimated jointly using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed algorithm is compared experimentally with a reference block-based algorithm employing linear filtering. Although the improvements are localized and often subtle, they demonstrate that a high-quality intermediate view reconstruction for complex scenes is feasible if camera convergence angle is small.

Using the posterior probabilities from the mixture, a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimator can be produced which smooths the segmentation. This in turn can be used to improve the original mixture estimates via the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for mixture models. This has the dual benefit of incorporating spatial information into the estimation of the mixture parameters, as well as producing improved segmentation, The algorithm is described, and applied to synthetic and real images. The results on the synthetic images show both improved segmentation and improved estimation of the mixture parameters.

It is further found that this learning structure can work systolically. It is also possible to add monitors to interact with lower systolic subsystems. This is made possible by attaching building blocks of the weighted (or plain) EM learning. Derivation of the whole algorithm is based on generalized divergences. In addition to the discussions on the learning, extensions of basic statistical properties such as Fisher's efficient score, his measure of information and Cramer-Rao's inequality are given. These appear in update equations of the generalized expectation learning. Experiments show that the presented generalized version contains cases that outperform traditional learning methods.

We have developed and investigated a method which simultaneously estimates motion and sequence parameters and provides image segmentation from noisy image sequences. The method segments an image frame in an image sequence into regions of moving, stationary, covered-background, and uncovered-background pixels relative to a reference frame. The basis of our method is the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for maximum-likelihood estimation. We previously presented our method under assumptions which imposed severe restrictions on the image composition and the object motion and did not consider covered-background pixels. These cases, though unrealistic, were illustrative of the mathematical formulation of our method. In this paper we remove the limiting restrictions on the image composition, and we introduce a region for covered-background pixels.

In methods based on probability theory one of the techniques used to estimate probability densities is mixture decomposition. This method assumes that a given data set comes from a distribution that is a convex combination of parametrized components (density functions) such as Gaussians. A similar method can be used to estimate membership functions. In other words, a membership function can be modeled as a convex combination of parametrized models. Therefore, the task of estimating the membership function can be viewed as a mixture decomposition problem. Mixture decomposition involves estimation of the parameters of each component in the mixture. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm has been traditionally used for Gaussian mixture decomposition. However, this algorithm is not robust, and gives poor results in the presence of noise. In this paper, we present a robust algorithm for Gaussian mixture decomposition. The algorithm uses robust statistical methods to construct a weight function. Since the weight function is based on the idea of typicality, it gives low weights to noise points and outliers. Thus, the algorithm gives robust estimates of the parameters. The weight function we propose uses the distribution of the distances of good points to component prototypes. We present results of the algorithm for both synthetic and real data sets.

Emission projections (primary, scatter and scatter plus primary) were simulated for Tc-99m and Tl-201 for numerical chest phantoms. Data were reconstructed with ordered-subset ML-EM algorithm including attenuation correction using the transmission data. In the chest phantom simulation, TDCS provided better S/N than TEW, and better accuracy, i.e., 1.0% vs -7.2% in myocardium, and -3.7% vs -30.1% in the ventricular chamber for Tc-99m with TDCS and TEW, respectively. For Tl-201, TDCS provided good visual and quantitative agreement with simulated true primary image without noticeably increasing the noise after scatter correction. Overall TDCS proved to be more accurate and less noisy than TEW, facilitating quantitative assessment of physiological functions with SPECT.

The mathematical cardiac torso (MCAT) phantom was modified to simulate the uptake of Ga-67 in the human body. Foil:. spherical hot tumors were placed in locations which challenged attenuation correction. An analytical 3D projector with attenuation and detector response included was used to generate projection sets. Data were reconstructed using filtered backprojection (FBP) reconstruction with Butterworth filtering in conjunction with one iteration of Chang attenuation correction, and with 5 and 10 iterations of ordered-subset maximum-likelihood expectation maximization (ML-OS) reconstruction. To serve as a standard for comparison, the projection sets obtained from the two energies were first reconstructed separately using their own attenuation maps. The emission data obtained from both energies were added and reconstructed using the following attenuation strategies: 1) the 93 keV attenuation map for attenuation correction, 2) the 185 keV attenuation map for attenuation correction, 3) using a weighted mean obtained from combining the 93 keV and 185 keV maps, and 4) an ordered subset approach which combines both energies. The central count ratio (CCR) and total count ratio (TCR) were used to compare the performance of the different strategies. Compared to the standard method, results indicate an overestimation with strategy 1, an under-estimation with strategy 2 and comparable results with strategies 3 and 4. In all strategies, the CCR's of sphere 4 (in proximity to the liver, spleen and backbone) were under-estimated, although TCR's were comparable to that of the other locations. The weighted mean and ordered subset strategies for attenuation correction were of comparable accuracy to reconstruction of the windows separately. They are recommended for multi-energy photon SPECT imaging quantitation when there is a need to combine the acquisitions of multiple windows. This work can also be extended to include other multi-energy photon emitters such as In-111.

An accurate genetic map is extremely valuable for locating genes or more generally either qualitative or quantitative trait loci (QTL). This paper presents a new approach to two important problems in genetic mapping: automatically ordering markers to obtain a multipoint maximum likelihood map and building a multipoint maximum likelihood map using pooled data from several crosses. The approach is embodied in an hybrid algorithm that mixes the statistical optimization algorithm EM with local search techniques which have been developed in the artificial intelligence and operations research communities. An efficient implementation of the EM algorithm provides maximum likelihood recombination fractions, while the local search techniques look for orders that maximize this maximum likelihood. The specificity of the approach lies in the neighborhood structure used in the local search algorithms which has been inspired by an analogy between the marker ordering problem and the famous traveling salesman problem. The approach has been used to build joined maps for the wasp Trichogramma brassicae and on random pooled data sets. In both cases, it compares quite favorably with existing softwares as far as maximum likelihood is considered as a significant criteria.

The method uses a 6 mCi point transmission source of Cs-137 at the axial center and 37 cm off transaxial center of die camera field of view. Singles transmission scans of 1.8 minutes per bed axial position provide similar scan count densities to 15 Ininute coincidence transmission scans with a 0.5 mCi Ge-68 rod transmission source. Scatter and emission contamination suppression are achieved by applying a narrow 662 keV transmission photopeak energy window. The residual 511 keV emission contamination constitutes a background of uniform spatial distribution. Accurate and low noise attenuation correction is achieved by segmenting the singles transmission images into lung and soft tissue volumes. Established 511 keV gamma ray attenuation coefficients are then applied and these images are forward projected for attenuation correction. Expectation maximisation or OS-ER? reconstruction of the transmission and emission images is used to improve image quality. Both the segmentation and OS-EM reconstruction maintain quantitative accuracy in the fully corrected emission images compared to measured coincidence transmission correction. Thus, a clinical protocol involving 40 minutes of emission scans followed by 20 minutes of singles transmission scans allow the 60 cm of the human torso to be fully scanned within 60 minutes. These quantitative whole body FDG PET images may then be used for tumor grading and assessment of tumor response to treatment.

The approximate population mean images and approximate population covariance matrices were calculated at various iteration numbers far the two reconstruction methods. The theoretical formulations were verified by calculating the sample mean images and sample covariance matrices for the two reconstruction methods, at the same iteration numbers, using over 8000 noisy images per method. Subsequently, we compared the approximate population and sample mean images, the approximate population and sample variance images, as well as the approximate population and sample local covariance images for a pixel near the center of a uniformly emitting disk object, for each iteration number and reconstruction method, respectively. The results demonstrated that for each method iteration number, the image produced by reconstructing from noise-free data would be equal to the population mean image to a very close approximation. in addition, the theoretically-calculated variance and local covariance images closely matched their respective sample counterparts. Thus the theoretical formulation is an accurate way to predict the population first- and second-order statistics of both OS-EM and RBI-EM reconstructed images, for high SNR.

The proposed network has recurrent connections from the output layer to the context layer as the Jordan network. The context layer is expanded to a number of sublayers so that the necessary information for time series processing can be held for longer time. Most of the learning algorithm for the conventional recurrent networks are based on the Back-Propagation (BP) algorithm so that the number of epochs required for convergence tends to increase. The Mixture of Experts used in the proposed network employs a modular approach. Trained with the Expectation-Maximization (ERI) algorithm, the Mixture of Experts performs very fast convergence especially in the initial steps. The proposed network can also employ the EM algorithm so that faster convergence is expected. We have examined the ability of the proposed network by some computer simulations. It is shown that the proposed network is faster than the conventional ones in point of the number of epochs required for convergence.

While global nonlinear variants of PCA have been proposed, an alternative paradigm is to capture data nonlinearity by a mixture of local PCA models. However, existing techniques are limited by the absence of a probabilistic formalism with an appropriate likelihood measure and so require an arbitrary choice of implementation strategy. This paper shows how PCA can be derived from a maximum-likelihood procedure, based on a specialisation of factor analysis. This is then extended to develop a well defined mixture model of principal component analyzers, and an expectation-maximisation algorithm for estimating an the model parameters is given.

Most visualization algorithms aim to find a projection from the data space down to a two-dimensional visualization space. However, for complex data sets living in a high-dimensional space it is unlikely that a single two-dimensional projection can reveal all of the interesting structure. We therefore introduce a hierarchical visualization algorithm which allows the complete data set to be visualized at the top level, with clusters and sub-clusters of data points visualized at deeper levels. The algorithm is based on a hierarchical mixture of latent variable models, whose parameters are estimated using the expectation-maximisation algorithm. We demonstrate the principle of the approach first on a toy data set, and then apply the algorithm to the visualisation of a synthetic data set in 12 dimensions obtained from a simulation of multi-phase flows in oil pipelines.

The subclass of such processes considered is restricted to those whose driving noise samples are statistically independent and identically distributed according to a Gaussian-mixture probability density function (pdf). Because the likelihood function for this problem is typically unbounded in the vicinity of undesirable, degenerate parameter estimates, a global maximum likelihood approach is not appropriate. Hence, an alternative approach is taken whereby a finite local maximum of the likelihood surface is sought. This approach, which is termed the quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) approach, is used to obtain estimates of the AR parameters as well as the means, variances, and weighting coefficients that define the Gaussian-mixture pdf. A technique for generating solutions to the QML problem is derived using a generalized version of the expectation-maximization principle.

Here, we show the theoretical expressions for the propagation of Poisson noise through tomographic SPECT reconstructions using regularized EM algorithms with independent Gamma and multivariate Gaussian priors. Our analysis extends the work in [1], in which judicious linearizations were used to enable the propagation of a mean image and covariance matrix from one iteration to the next for the (unregularized) EM algorithm. To validate our theoretical analyses, we use a methodology in [2] to compare the results of theoretical calculations to Monte Carlo simulations. We also demonstrate an application of the theory to the calculation of an optimal smoothing parameter for a regularized reconstruction. The smoothing parameter is optimal in the context of a quantitation task, defined as the minimization of the expected mean-square error of an estimated number of counts in a hot lesion region. Our results thus demonstrate how the theory can be applied to a problem of potential practical use.

The model is very general and includes the Tobit model and the binary choice model as special cases. We show that, by using additional binary choice observations, our method is more efficient than the traditional Tobit model. Two iterative procedures are proposed to compute the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the model based on the EM algorithm (Dempster et al, 1977) and the Newton-Raphson method. The uniqueness of the MLE is proved. The simulation results show that the inconsistency and inefficiency call he significant when the Tobit method is applied to the present mixed model. The experiment results also suggest that the EM algorithm is much faster than the Newton-Raphson method for the present mixed model. The method also allows one to combine two data sets, the smaller data set with more detailed observations and the larger data set with less detailed binary choice observations in order to improve the efficiency of estimation.

We studied image statistics to justify the correct use of the standard finite normal mixture model and formulated image quantification as a distribution learning problem. From information theory, we used relative entropy as the information distance measure and developed an adaptive structure probabilistic self-organizing mixture to estimate the parameter values. New learning scheme has the capability of achieving flexible classifier shapes in terms of winner-takes-in probability splits of data, allowing data to contribute simultaneously to multiple regions. The result is unbiased and holds the asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood estimation. To achieve a fully automatic function and incorporate the correlation between slices, we utilized a newly developed information theoretic criterion (minimum conditional bias/variance) to determine the suitable number of mixture components such that the network can adjust its structure to the characteristics of each image in the sequence. By compared with the results of the algorithms based on expectation-maximization, K-means, and Kohonen's self-organizing map, new method yields a very efficient and accurate performance.

The three schemes are all based on a previously developed scatter model. Reconstruction is achieved using the iterative Expectation-Maximization Maximum-Likelihood algorithm, The schemes consist of: a) including the model in both the forward and backprojector, b) just including the model in the forward projector, and c) implementing the model in a subtraction scheme. Monte-Carlo simulated projection data are used to test the accuracy, convergence properties, and noise properties of the three scatter compensation schemes. The results show that all three correction schemes yield images which are similar in terms of accuracy to that obtained from reconstructing scatter free data. The subtraction scheme is shown to converge Easter than the other compensation schemes, both in terms of iterations and actual time required for reconstruction. The scheme in which the model is only used in the forward projector does not, in general, perform significantly better than the subtraction scheme, but requires longer for reconstruction. The correction scheme in which the scatter model is included in both the forward and backprojectors is shown to produce accurate images with signal to noise ratios higher than even a perfect scatter rejection scheme. While the scatter correction scheme, with the model in both forward and backprojectors has superior noise properties to the other algorithms, the results suggest that the subtraction scheme, with its faster convergence properties, will probably prove most useful for routine clinical scatter compensation.

The Zubal phantom was made from segmented MRI slices of the brain, so that neuro-anatomical structures are well defined and indexed. Small regions-of-interest (ROIs) from the white matter, grey matter in the center of the brain and grey matter from the peripheral area of the brain were selected for the evaluation. Photon attenuation and distance-dependent collimator blurring were modeled. Multiple independent noise realizations were generated for two different count levels. The simulation study showed that the ROI bias measured for the EM-based algorithms decreased as the iteration number increased, and that the OS-EM and RBI-EM algorithms (16 and 64 subsets were used) achieved the equivalent accuracy of the ML-EM algorithm at about the same noise variance, with much fewer number of iterations. The Bellini-FDP restoration algorithm converged fast and required less computation per iteration. The ML-EM algorithm had a slightly better ROI bias vs. variance trade-off than the other algorithms.

This paper discusses an innovation representation that links the structure form with the state space model. For the state space model, the recursive Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate the parameters of a structure form. This research successfully applied the Kalman filter method to the estimation of the coefficients of simultaneous equations with overidentifying rank restrictions.

The impulse response of a linear transmission channel is modeled in different ways; unknown deterministic vector/process and Gaussian vector/process with unknown stochastic characteristics. In association with these channel impulse response (CIR) models, different types of recursive least squares (RLS) and Kalman filtering and smoothing algorithms are derived directly from the on-line EM algorithm. The EM algorithm as a powerful tool unifies the derivations of some adaptive estimation methods which include RLS and Kalman whose original criterion is minimum mean square error (MMSE), but under linear and Gaussian conditions can achieve ML or maximum a posterior (MAP) criterion.

The integrated model we developed in this study generalizes the conventional, currently widely used delta-parameter technique, which has been confined strictly to the preprocessing domain only, in mio significant ways. First, the new model contains state-dependent weighting functions responsible for transforming static speech features into the dynamic ones in a slowly time-varying manner. Second, a novel maximum-likelihood based learning algorithm is developed for the model that allows joint optimization of the state-dependent weighting functions and the remaining conventional HMM parameters. The experimental results obtained from a standard TIMIT phonetic classification task provide preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of our new, general approach to the use of the dynamic characteristics of speech spectra. The results demonstrate that the new approach is most effective for discrimination of stop consonants exhibiting the fastest and most conspicuous dynamic patterns.

J	Liski, EP; Nummi, T				Liski, EP; Nummi, T			The marking for bucking under uncertain in automatic harvesting of forests	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Working Seminar on Production Economics	FEB 21-25, 1994	INNSBRUCK, AUSTRIA			EM algorithm; maximum likelihood; parsimonious covariance structures; root mean square error	GROWTH-CURVES; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; INCOMPLETE DATA; EM-ALGORITHM; MODELS; PREDICTION	The marking for bucking is the problem of converting a single tree stem into logs in such a way that the total stem value according to a given price list for logs is maximized. Proper marking for bucking is of crucial importance in harvesting of forests. The annual production of saw timber in Scandinavia is tens of millions m(3). Since, furthermore, sawn timber is by far the most valuable forest product in Scandinavia, any improvement in the marking for bucking procedure Will yield a large profit. To solve the marking for bucking problem optimally one has to know the whole tree stem. However, it is not economically feasible to run the whole stem through the measuring device before cutting. Therefore, it is a normal situation under computer-based marking for bucking that the first cutting decisions are made before the whole stem is known. In this paper the forest harvesting process will be considered under a general growth curve model useful especially for repeated-measures data. The main objective is to predict the unknown portion y(n(2)) of the current stem, which will be estimated from the stem data y(1), y(2), ... , y(n-1) on the previously processed n - 1 stems and from the known diameter values y(n(1)) on the current stem. Then a predictor of y(n(2)), say (y) over cap(n(2)), jointly with the known party y(n(1)) is used in marking for bucking.

J	Tsuchiya, T				Tsuchiya, T			A probabilistic multidimensional scaling with unique axes	JAPANESE PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						probabilistic multidimensional scaling; polar coordinates; EM algorithm; simulated annealing	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; INCOMPLETE DATA; EM ALGORITHM	A probabilistic multidimensional scaling model is proposed. The model assumes that the coordinates of each stimulus are normally distributed with variance Sigma = diag(sigma(1)(2), ,... sigma(2)2(R,)). The advantage of this model is that axes are determined uniquely. The distribution of the distance between two stimuli is obtained by polar coordinates transformation, The method oi maximum likelihood estimation for means and variances using the EM algorithm is discussed. Further simulated annealing is suggested as a means of obtaining initial values in order to avoid local maxima. A simulation study shows that the estimates are accurate, and a numerical example concerning the location of Japanese cities shows that natural axes can be obtained without introducing individual parameters.

J	Lee, BG; Lee, KY; Ann, S				Lee, BG; Lee, KY; Ann, S			An adaptive filtering method for speech parameter enhancement	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article						ML estimation; finite mixture distribution; EM algorithm; Kalman filter; speech enhancement	EM ALGORITHM; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD	This paper considers the estimation of speech parameters and their enhancement using an approach based on the estimation-maximization (EM) algorithm, when only noisy speech data is available. The distribution of the excitation source for the speech signal is assumed as a mixture of two Gaussian probability distribution functions with differing variances. This mixture assumption is experimentally valid for removing the residual excitation signal. The assumption also is found to be effective in enhancing noise-corrupted speech. We adaptively estimate the speech parameters and analyze the characteristics of its. excitation source in a sequential manner. In the maximum likelihood estimation scheme we utilize the EM algorithm, and employ a detection and an estimation step for the parameters. For speech enhancement we use Kalman filtering for the parameters obtained from the above estimation procedure. The estimation and maximization procedures are closely coupled. Simulation results using synthetic and real speech vindicate the improved performance of our algorithm in noisy situations, with an increase of about 3 dB in terms of output SNR compared to conventional Gaussian assumption. The proposed algorithm also may be noteworthy in that it needs no voiced/unvoiced decision logic, due to the use of the residual approach.

J	Segre, AM; Gordon, GJ; Elkan, CP				Segre, AM; Gordon, GJ; Elkan, CP			Exploratory analysis of speedup learning data using expectation maximization	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							ALGORITHM	Experimental evaluations of speedup learning methods have in the past used nonparametric hypothesis testing to determine whether or not learning is beneficial. We show here how to obtain deeper insight into the comparative performance of learning methods through a complementary parametric approach to data analysis. In this approach experimental data is used to estimate values for the parameters of a statistical model of the performance of a problem solver. To model problem solvers that use speedup learning methods, we propose a two-component linear model that captures how learned knowledge may accelerate the solution of some problems while leaving the solution of others relatively unchanged. We show how to apply expectation maximization (EM), a statistical technique, to fit this kind of multi-component model. EM allows us to fit the model in the presence of censored data, a methodological difficulty common to experiments involving speedup learning.

In the special test case where the underlying positive linear system has a unique solution, we describe two iterations, based on adaptively choosing the smoothing in the EMS (estimate, maximize, smooth) algorithm, which accelerate the convergence of the EM algorithm. The resulting algorithms, called adaptive EMS (A-EMS) algorithms, thus overcome the inaccuracy of EMS while retaining its more rapid convergence and reduced overall computational cost.

Our problem is to estimate the amplitudes and delay times of individual signals. Several methods have been devoted to solution of these unknown parameters. The maximum-likelihood estimation and the Estimate Maximize algorithm are commonly used, but they are computationally intensive. We consider the multipath signal as a changing linear model and use a change-point technique to obtain a quick and accurate estimate of the amplitudes and arrival (delay) times. We detect the pulse in a multipath signal which first arrives, and then finish one by one in a sequence until no pulse appears. Therefore, by using the change-point procedure, the number of individual pulses need not be known. The results of a Monte Carlo simulation study with trapezoidal and sinusoidal pulses are presented to demonstrate a quick and accurate estimate of arrival times and amplitudes.

J	Granville, V				Granville, V			Discriminant analysis and density estimation on the finite d-dimensional grid	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						kernel density estimates; adaptive bandwidth; nearest neighbours; leaving-one-out; Markov random held; Gibbs potential; penalized likelihood; EM algorithm; sparse consistency	SPARSE CONTINGENCY-TABLES; STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; CLASSIFICATION; LIKELIHOOD	A new theoretical point of view is discussed here in the framework of density estimation. The discrete multivariate true density is viewed as a finite dimensional continuous random vector governed by a Markov random field structure. Estimating the density is then a problem of maximizing a conditional likelihood under a Bayesian framework. This maximization problem is expressed as a constrained optimization problem and is solved by an iterative fixed point algorithm. However, for time efficiency reasons, we have been interested in an approximate estimate (f) over cap = B pi of the true density f, where B is a stochastic matrix and pi is the raw histogram. This estimate is obtained by developing (f) over cap as a function of pi around the uniform histogram pi(0), using multivariate Taylor expansions for implicit functions ((f) over cap is actually an implicit function of pi). The discrete setting of the problem allows us to get a simple analytical form for B. Although the approach is original, our density estimator is actually nothing else than a penalized maximum likelihood estimator. However, it appears to be more general than those proposed in the literature (Scott et al., 1980; Simonoff, 1983; Thompson and Tapia, 1990). In a second step, we investigate the discrimination problem on the same space, using the theory previously developed for density estimation. We also introduce an adaptive bandwidth depending on the k-nearest neighbours and we have chosen to optimize the leaving-one-out criterion. We have always kept in mind the practical implementation on a computer. Our final classification algorithm compares favourably in terms of error rate and time efficiency with other algorithms tested, including multinormal IMSL, nearest-neighbour, and convex hull classifiers. Comparisons were performed on satellite images.	UNIV CAMBRIDGE,STAT LAB,CAMBRIDGE,ENGLAND							Baddeley A.

The effect was larger for closer linkage. If a locus is dominant and linked with the misclassfied trait locus in the repulsion phase, then the effect on the recombination value between the two loci is largest. A method for estimating the unbiased recombination value and the misclassification rate using maximum likelihood associated with an EM algorithm is also presented. This method was applied to a numerical example from rice genome data. It was concluded that the present method combined with the metric multi-dimensional scaling method is useful for the detection of misclassified markers and for the estimation of unbiased recombination values.

It produces a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) of a track, but resorts to a sampling technique within the tracking process to handle nonlinearity. GMMs are recovered from samples using the expectation-maximisation method. The approach has been implemented in PV-WANE software and tested against a Kalman-filter tracker in a simulator with air-defence scenarios. Sample results are presented for a scenario with a single surveillance-radar and a single target following a weaving path. These show that the tracker produces significantly better position estimates and comparable heading and speed estimates. Computation times are about 30 times greater than for the Kalman-filter tracker, but there is scope for reducing that substantially by tolerating fewer samples.

EM algorithm has received considerable attention due to their computation feasibility in tomographic image reconstruction[2 similar to 4], and parameter estimation[6]. However, it is less recognized that EM algorithm can be equally applicable to image enhancement applications encountered in scanning, reproduction and rendering processes. No past techniques surveyed can incorporate the potentially complex nature of various image formation processes into a simple probability density array as EM procedure does. In this paper, an image enhancement technique utilizing EM procedure to model the image formation process is proposed. By dynamically giving a priori probability distribution suited for a specific application environment currently considered, the proposed method provides a general framework for rendering good image quality at the designated resolution for a large class of image formation process.

We distinguish two types of speech variability, long term (speaker identity stationary noise, channel distortion) and short term (phoneme class). Currently, most recognizers model the two variabilities without considering their specificities, which may result in flat distributions with limited discriminability. In our system, the long term variability (environment) is modeled by a mixture model, where each mixture is modeled by a Mixture Stochastic Trajectory Model (MSTM). We propose the Environment Dependent Mixture Stochastic Trajectory Model (ED-MSTM) to model a set of environments. The parameters of ED-MSTM are estimated using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation criterion by the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm. Our model has been tested on a 1011 word vocabulary, multi-speaker continuous French recognition task with noisy speech. in the experiments, we assume that speakers can be grouped into a pre-determined number of classes and that class label of a speaker is missing. The use of environmental modeling cut down the error rate produced by the multi-speaker system by about 15%, which is a statistically significant improvement. The idea of environment modeling is applicable to other acoustic modeling techniques such as Hidden Markov Models.

By passing the usual EM based self-consistency algorithm (Turnbull, 1976), our methods directly generate data points which are distributed according to a self-consistent estimate of the distribution function. The idea can be viewed as a generalization of re-distribution to the right for right censored data of Efron (1967) and is particularly convenient when a sample from the estimate rather than the original estimate is needed. Two examples with our approach are presented, the first one is an interval censored breast cancer data of Finkelstein and Wolfe (1985) and the second one on an AIDS data set originally analysed by Gruttola and Lagakos (1989).

MSTM is a segment-based model using phonemes as speech units. In MSTM, the observations of a phoneme are modeled by a set of stochastic trajectories. The trajectories are modeled by a mixture of probability density functions (pdf) of state sequences. Each state is associated with a multivariate Gaussian density function. in this paper, we propose to replace the state single Gaussian pdf by a mixture of Gaussian pdfs (MSTM with State-Mixture, SM-MSTM). The parameters of the model are estimated under the ML criterion,using the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm. The tests of the system on a speaker-dependent continuous speech recognition task show a reduction in the word error rate by about 15% over the baseline MSTM, even for an equal number of parameters. Experiments based on a multi-speaker continuous speech recognition task do not lead to significant improvement over the baseline system.

The authors propose a stochastic model to deal with exposures that are time-dependent and exhibit susceptibility and latency effects. The model is applied to a retrospective cohort data on lung cancer mortality in the blackfoot disease endemic area in Taiwan. The authors compare the proposed model with the multistage model, the back-calculation model, the catalytic model, and the age-period-cohort models.

The EM algorithm is directly applicable to multivariate data in which all the features are always present, and there are no missing values. Unfortunately, missing values are common: caused either by random or systematic effects. This study presents a novel algorithm for estimating the parameters of GMMs when there are random missing values. The approach is Bayesian in the missing values and ML in the GMM parameters. The same model can be applied to heteroscedastic data, and to indirectly observable mixed Gaussian observations.

By introducing a relative augmentation function, we reveal a minimax property of the MIR. We also provide a large-sample empirical study which suggests that the MIR attempts to select the model which results in the most salient separation of the observed data and is thus prone to underestimating the true number of components. Our primary interest in the MIR is the novelty in its suggestion that data augmentation, which has played a key role in constructing popular statistical algorithms (e.g., the EM algorithm), may also have a direct role in statistical inference.

A constrained SGD algorithm is proposed to adaptively adjust the filter parameter by minimizing a properly chosen cost function while satisfying a set of constraints. The algorithm incorporates some a priori knowledge of the desired signal for filter adaptation instead of a training sequence. The algorithm improves the steady state performance by jointly estimating the reference parameter as well as the filter parameters. An iterative maximum likelihood absolute mean estimation algorithm is devised to estimate the reference parameter. The sequential EM algorithm is used to monotonically decrease the cost function. For each input, the algorithm updates the parameters by iterating between estimating the cost function (E step), and minimizing the cost function with respect to each unknown parameter (M step). In the M step of the filter update algorithm, a set of constraints is applied to guarantee convergence. Thus, the algorithm asymptotically converges to the constrained optimum solution. The proposed algorithm is tested by computer simulations and is shown to significantly improve the steady state performance compared to the existing adaptive algorithm.
