A Computationally Efficient Approach to Warp Factor Estimation in VTLN Using EM Algorithm and Sufficient Statistics	INTERSPEECH 2008: 9TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPEECH COMMUNICATION ASSOCIATION 2008, VOLS 1-5			English	Proceedings Paper	9th Annual Conference of the International-Speech-Communication-Association (INTERSPEECH 2008)	SEP 22-26, 2008	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA			VTLN; Linear Transformation; EM; Sufficient Statistics		In this paper, we develop a computationally efficient approach for warp factor estimation in Vocal Tract Length Normalization (VTLN). Recently we have shown that warped features can be obtained by a linear transformation of the unwarped features. Using the warp matrices we show that warp factor estimation can be efficiently performed in an EM framework. This can be done by collecting Sufficient Statistics by aligning the un-warped utterances only once. The likelihood of warped features, which are necessary for warp factor estimation, are computed by appropriately modifying the sufficient statistics using the warp matrices. We show using OGI, TIDIGITS and RM task that this approach has recognition performance that is comparable to conventional VTLN and yet is computationally more efficient.	[Akhil, P. T.; Rath, S.

Traffic estimation and power saving mechanism optimization of IEEE 802.16e networks	2008 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1-13	IEEE International Conference on Communications		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC 2008)	MAY 19-23, 2008	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE, Chinese Inst Elect, Chinese Inst Commun, Tsinghu Univ, Beijing Univ, Posts & Telecommun		IEEE 802.16e; power saving; EM algorithm; heavy-tailed distributions		In order to save power to prolong battery life of subscriber stations (SSs) in IEEE 802.16e networks, the standard defines a sleep mode for SS. When there is no traffic for an SS to transmit or to receive, the SS switches to sleep mode periodically. The sleep interval is doubled each time until a maximum sleep interval threshold is reached. Obviously, the performance of this power saving mechanism depends on the idle period distribution, which is user-specific. In network traffic modeling, it is commonly accepted that frame interarrival times have heavy-tailed distributions. Since heavy-tailed distributions make analysis and design challenging, in this paper we propose to use mixtures of exponentials to approximate heavy-tailed idle times. With a mixture of exponentials approximating the idle times, performance can be explicitly derived and optimized. An online EM algorithm is proposed to fit the mixture of exponential distributions to the idle times. Numerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed procedures.

The method is conservative in the sense that it selects the minimal subset of features that renders the rest of the features independent of the target (the class variable) without making any assumption about the missing data mechanism. This is achieved in the context of determining the Markov blanket of the target that reflects the worst-case assumption about the missing data mechanism, including the case when data is not missing at random. An application of the method on synthetic incomplete data is carried out to illustrate its practical relevance. The method is compared against state-of-the-art approaches such as the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and the available case technique.

The proposed framework performs the alignment in both time and measurement spaces of the LC-MS spectra. The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate the joint parameters of spline-based mixture regression models and prior transformation densities. The latter are incorporated to account for variability in time and measurement spaces of the data. As a proof of concept, the proposed method is applied to align a single-class replicate LC-MS spectra generated from proteins of lysed E.coli cells. Its performance is compared with the dynamic time warping (DTW) and continuous profile model (CPM) approaches.

Unfortunately, relevant data are often disseminated into different files obtained through different sampling designs. Data fusion is a set of methods used to combine information from different sources into a single dataset. In this article, we are interested in a specific problem: the fusion of two data files, one of which being quite small. We propose a model-based procedure combining a logistic regression with an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Results show that despite the lack of data, this procedure can perform better than standard matching procedures.

A key issue in the design of MCMC algorithms is to improve the proposal mechanism and the mixing behavior. To overcome these difficulties, it is common either to run a population of chains or incorporate the evolutionary computing techniques into the MCMC framework. This paper combines a simple evolutionary (genetic) algorithm (GA) with the Metropolis sampler and proposes the new motif algorithm GAMS to carry out motif heuristic search throughout the multiple alignment space. GAMS first initializes a population of multiple local alignments (initial MCMC chains) each of which is encoded on a chromosome that represents a potential solution. GAMS then conducts a genetic algorithm-based search in the sequence alignment space using a motif scoring function as the fitness measure. The genetic algorithm gradually moves this population towards the best alignment from which the motif model is derived. Experimental results show that the new algorithm compares favorably to the simple multiple-run MCMC in some difficult cases, and it also exhibits higher precision than some popular motif-finding algorithms while testing on the annotated prokaryotic and eukaryotic binding sites data sets.

The hybrid model combines a hidden Markov chain with a perceptron which is assumed to constitute a match network. Genetic algorithms are applied here instead of the traditional methods such as the EM algorithm and the Viterbi algorithm. The paper demonstrates performance of an HMM and a hybrid model in modeling the annual number of months, in which some seismic events are recorded. Parameters of the discrete-time two-state models are estimated using the maximum likelihood method, on the basis of data on seismic events that were recorded in Romania in years 1901-1990. Then, on the basis of the estimation results, the most likely sequences of states of the hidden Markov chains are found.

The proposed model uses unobserved variables to describe the data in terms of the process that generates them. It is thus able to capture and exploit the statistical structure of the IR and the visible data separately, as well as their mutual dependencies. Model parameters are learned form data using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Automatic calibration is performed as part of this procedure. Tracking is done by Bayesian inference of the object location from the observed data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by the experimental results on the video clips captured in real world scenarios.

The modeling rigorously explains all model assumptions and parameters, improving the physical interpretation of all parameters and the intuition behind the model choices. With respect to the state of the art model [1], this paper proposes: (i) a different functional form for the probability of range measurements caused by unexpected objects, (ii) an intuitive explanation for the discontinuity encountered in the cited paper, and (iii) a reduction in the number of model parameters, while maintaining the same representational power for experimentally obtained data. The proposed beam model is called RBBM, short for Rigorously Bayesian Beam Model. A maximum-likelihood estimation and a variational Bayesian estimation algorithm (both based on expectation-maximization) are proposed to learn the model parameters.

Specifically, we suppose that the useful signal Is affected by a dispersive channel and that the receiver collects also multiple access interference (MAI), while experiencing frequency drifts due to clock mis-alignments. Building upon a Gaussian mixture (GM) model for MAI, the receiver uses a space alternating generalized expectation maximization (SAGE) estimation approach for all unknowns quantities: channel, frequency offsets, and data. Iterative and adaptive algorithms are formulated. The latter enables a low-complexity implementation of the whole estimation procedure with small performance loss. The provided simulations are a first step in evaluating the performance of a receiver coping with all the most critical uncertainties at the same time.

Using the AIC, we can Improve the goodness of fit of the model by the number of free parameters In comparison with the maximum likelihood. Moreover, the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is introduced into the proposed algorithm to estimate the transmitted signals and the interference signals simultaneously. By computer simulations, we show that the proposed algorithm provides valid detection techniques.

AN EM ALGORITHM FOR ROBUST BAYESIAN PCA WITH STUDENT'S T-DISTRIBUTION	2008 15TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON IMAGE PROCESSING, VOLS 1-5	IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP)		English	Proceedings Paper	15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP 2008)	OCT 12-15, 2008	San Diego, CA	IEEE Signal Proc Soc		Robust Bayesian principal component analysis; Student's t-distribution; image modelling; subspace representation; EM algorithm; evidence approximation		Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique that is widely used for applications such as dimensionality reduction, image compression, feature extraction and data visualization. One of the key issues in the use of PCA for modelling is that it is very sensitive to outliers since its formulation is based on Gaussian density model. Lately, more heavy-tailed distribution (i.e., Student's t-distribution) is introduced to increase the robustness of traditional PCA. But the robust version of PCA is expressed as the maximum likelihood solution of a probabilistic latent variable model. This reformulation raises the question of how to determine the optimal number of principal components to be retained. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian model selection approach to estimate the true dimensionality of the data. The proposed algorithm is based on a new Bayesian treatment of robust Student's t-distribution PCA. A simple Expectation-Maximization (EM) solver is introduced to find approximate solutions for the model. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves simultaneous optimal dimensionality selection and accurate principal components recovery.

The maximum-likelihood (ML) solution derived in this paper closes this gap. However, the latter provides a set of two nonlinear vector equations, which might be simplified only for modulation schemes with constant envelope like M-ary PSK. For signals with nonconstant envelope, like 16-QAM as most prominent example in this respect, a much less complex approach based on the expectation-maximization (EM) principle is developed in this paper. In the medium SNR range, this bridges part of the performance gap mentioned previously. Over the full SNR range, we propose a hybrid algorithm, where the EM estimate is replaced by a moment-based method as soon as the true SNR drops below a predefined threshold.

The performance of speaker independent (SI) model is very sensitive to environments such as microphones, speakers, and noises. Speaker adaptation techniques try to obtain near speaker dependent (SD) performance with only small amounts of specific data and are often based on initial SI model. One of the most important purposes for adaptation algorithms is to modify a large number of parameters with only a small amount of adaptation data. The number of free parameters to be estimated from adaptation data can be reduced by using aspect model. In this paper, we introduce an aspect model into an acoustic model for rapid speaker adaptation. A formulation of probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) is extended to continuous density HMM. We carried out an isolated word recognition experiment on Korean database, and the results are compared to those of conventional expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, maximum a posteriori (MAP) and maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR).

However minimization of zero-norM is generally regarded as a combinatorially difficult optimization problem. hi contrast to previous methods that usually optimize a surrogate of zero-norm, we propose a direct optimization method to achieve zero-norm for feature selection in this paper Based on Expectation Maximization (EM), this method boils down to solving a sequence of Quadratic Programming problems and hence can be practically optimized in polynomial time. We show that the proposed optimization technique has a nice Bayesian interpretation and converges to the true zero norm asymptotically, provided that a good starting point is given. Following the scheme of our proposed zero-norm, we even show that an arbitrary-norm based Support Vector Machine can be achieved in polynomial time. A series of experiments demonstrate that our proposed EM based zero-norm outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for feature selection on biological microarray data and UCl data, in terms of both the accuracy and the learning efficiency.

A fundamental problem when computing statistical shape models is the determination of correspondences between the observations of the associated data set. Often, homologies between points that represent the surfaces are assumed. When working merely with point clouds, this might lead to imprecise mean shape and variability results. To overcome this problem, we propose an approach where exact correspondences are replaced by evolving correspondence probabilities. These are the basis for a novel algorithm that computes a generative statistical shape model. We developed a unified Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) framework to compute the model parameters ('mean shape' and 'modes of variation') and the nuisance parameters which leads to an optimal adaption of the model to the set of observations. The registration of the model on the observations is solved using the Expectation Maximization - Iterative Closest Point algorithm which is based on probabilistic correspondences and proved to be robust and fast. The alternated optimization of the MAP explanation with respect to the observation and the generative model parameters leads to very efficient and closed-form solutions for nearly all parameters. A comparison with a statistical shape model which is built using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration algorithm and a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) shows that our approach leads to better SSM quality measures.

Assuming that some genetic mutations take part in the etiology of some diseases, it could be of great interest to compare sets of genetic variations among different unrelated individuals, inherited in block from their parents, in order to conclude if there is some association between variations and a disease. The main problem is that, in the absence of family data, obtaining haplotypic information is not straightforward: individuals having more than one polymorphic heterozygous locus have uncertain haplotypes. We have developed a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to estimate simultaneously the sample frequency of each possible haplotype and the association between haplotypes and a disease.

The full Bayesian significance test for mixture models: results in gene expression clustering	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference of the Brazilian-Association-for-Bioinformatics-and-Computational-Biology	NOV 01-03, 2007	Sao Paulo, BRAZIL	Brazilian Assoc Bioinformat & Computat Biol		Gene clustering; Mixture models; Significance test; Expression data analysis	EM ALGORITHM	Gene clustering is a useful exploratory technique to group together genes with similar expression levels under distinct cell cycle phases or distinct conditions. It helps the biologist to identify potentially meaningful relationships between genes. In this study, we propose a clustering method based on multivariate normal mixture models, where the number of clusters is predicted via sequential hypothesis tests: at each step, the method considers a mixture model of m components (m = 2 in the first step) and tests if in fact it should be m - 1. If the hypothesis is rejected, m is increased and a new test is carried out. The method continues (increasing m) until the hypothesis is accepted. The theoretical core of the method is the full Bayesian significance test, an intuitive Bayesian approach, which needs no model complexity penalization nor positive probabilities for sharp hypotheses. Numerical experiments were based on a cDNA microarray dataset consisting of expression levels of 205 genes belonging to four functional categories, for 10 distinct strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To analyze the method's sensitivity to data dimension, we performed principal components analysis on the original dataset and predicted the number of classes using 2 to 10 principal components. Compared to Mclust (model-based clustering), our method shows more consistent results.	[Lauretto, M. S.; Pereira, C. A. B.; Stern, J.

The particularity of this model comes from the fact that the effect of each lag upon the present is considered separately and additively, so that the number of parameters required is drastically reduced. However, the efficiency for the MTD parameter estimations proposed up to date still remains problematic on account of the large number of constraints on the parameters. In this article, an iterative procedure, commonly known as expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, is developed cooperating with the principle of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to estimate the MTD parameters. Some applications of modeling MTD show the proposed EM algorithm is easier to be used than the algorithm developed by Berchtold. Moreover, the EM estimations of parameters for high-order MTD models led on DNA sequences outperform the corresponding fully parametrized Markov chain in terms of Bayesian information criterion.

The system partitions the CT head images into four regions which are skull, calcifications, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain matter. The method consists of two phases. The first phase is to partition the skull, CSF and brain matter in which we applied the Expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for the segmentation. The second phase is to identify the calcifications where we used thresholding. The system has been tested with a number of real CT head images and has achieved promising results.

Improvement of the two-line element accuracy assessment based on a mixture of Gaussian laws	ASTRODYNAMICS 2007, PTS I-III	Advances in the Astronautical Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	AIAA/AAS Astrodynamics Specialist Conference	AUG 19-23, 2007	Mackinac Isl, MI	Amer Inst Aeronaut & Astronaut, Amer Astronaut Soc			EM ALGORITHM	The experimental assessment of on-orbit collision risks led by the French space agency (CNES) relies on both USSTRATCOM two line element (TLE) database and CNES close approach determination software. The validity of such results is obviously strongly dependent on the accuracy of satellite and space debris ephemeris used in the process. But no a priori accuracy information is available with the TLE, and besides the extrapolation models to be used with are also an additional source of inaccuracy. A method was previously developed to characterize these errors using the Expectation Maximization algorithm applied on the marginal laws. This study aims at improving this algorithm in three different ways. First the EM algorithm has been improved to handle the three dimensional problem which allowed to get one mixture of Gaussian law per object for the whole TLE catalogue, for a given extrapolation duration. An additional Uniform law has also been considered to deal with the so-called "extreme measurements" that may perturb the solution. The criterion to determine the best Gaussian mixture has also been adapted for the 3-D problem, considering the maximum expectation gain, the number of samples and the number of parameters to estimate. We then apply this method to a 9451 objects catalogue, which results are presented here. Finally we addressed the problem of objects with a too small number of TLE to be handled by the EM algorithm, by presenting the on-going work on a group approach.

The aim of this study is to design and develop a wireless infrared sensor system which can track multiple humans with better data-to-object association, lower power consumption/cost/detectability, and less privacy infringement than its infrared video-based counterpart. The concept of a geometric sensor is discussed and utilized in local/global visibility modulation for the node-centric sensor system, to implement the process of data-object-association, performed by a Bayesian joint probabilistic data association scheme with validation gates. An Expectation-Maximization-Bayesian tracking scheme, consisting of detection. localization, filtering, and prediction, is proposed and implemented among slave, master, and host modules of a prototype sensor system. Experimentally the prototype system was able to simultaneously track two individuals in both follow-up and crossover scenarios with average tracking errors less than 0.5 m. The proposed wireless distributed infrared sensor system can not only run as a stand alone inmate/patient monitoring system under all illumination conditions, but also serve as a complement for conventional video and audio human tracking systems.

The variable and factor nodes of FGs represent image patches and their clustering relationship respectively. Unlike previous probabilistic graphical models, we model the structure of FGs by a latent variable, which gives the name "stochastic factor graphs"(SFGs). A sparsity-based prior is enforced to the local distribution functions at factor nodes, which leads to a class of variational expectation-maximization (VEM) algorithms on SFGs. VEM algorithms allow us to infer graph structure along with the target of inference from the observation data. This new framework can systematically exploit nonlocal dependency in natural images as justified by the experimental results in image denoising and inpainting applications.

In the case of colonography, CAD has not been designed to cope with the presence of stool, although labeling the stool with high contrast agents replaces the use of laxatives and reduces the patient discomfort. This procedure introduces additional challenges for the diagnosis, such as poorly tagged stool, stool sticking to colonic walls, and heterogeneous stool (tagged stool mixed with air or untagged stool). Our study proposes a robust algorithm for heterogeneous stool removal to be employed as a preprocessing module for CAD systems in colonic cancer detection. Colonoscopy data are automatically cleansed of residual stool to enhance the polyp appearance for improved diagnosis. The algorithm uses expectation-maximization, quadratic regression, level sets and minimum variance. Results show stool removal accuracy on polyps which are partially or fully covered by stool. The results are robust on stool lining and large pools of heterogeneous and weakly-tagged stool. The automatic detection of colon polyps using our CAD system on cathartic-free data improves considerably with the addition of the automatic stool removal module from 74% to 86% true positive (TP) rate at 6.4 false positives (FP)/case.

Concerning that EM algorithm is easily affected by initial parameter values, we proposed a mixture splitting algorithm based on decision boundary confusion(DBC) to describe more about boundary distribution. The algorithm mainly includes three aspects: firstly the number of incremented mixtures for every decision boundary could be determined according to decision boundary confusion; secondly the mixtures which are the closest to the decision boundary are chosen to split, thirdly the split mean of mixture is in the direction of decision boundary. Our experiments show that our proposed algorithm is more effective for classification using HMM.

The registered images are first decomposed using steerable pyramid. The EM algorithm is used to fuse the image components in the low frequency band. The selection method involving the informative importance measure is applied to those in the high frequency band. The final fused image is then computed by taking the inverse steerable filter bank transform on the composite coefficient representations. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms conventional image fusion methods and the proposed method have the ability to resist noise corruption.

These qualitative behavior descriptions can e used in scenario parsing and have further applications in vehicle surveillance and frontal collision warning systems. In current approaches, the number of behavior categories is supposed to be known, or need to be manually explored every time the training data is changed. In this paper, the authors use Hidden Markov model to symbolize the vehicle behaviors and adopt the cross-validated likelihood with penalty for complexity to select the number of hidden states. Appropriate number of behavior categories is selected automatically, and those behaviors are decided at the same time. Real data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.

Recently, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by cDNA microarray hybridization (ChIP-chip array) has been used to identify potential regulatory sequences, but the procedure can only map the probable protein-DNA interaction loci within 1-2 kb resolution. To find out the exact binding motifs, it is necessary to build a computational method to examine the ChIP-chip array binding sequences and search for possible motifs representing the transcription factor binding sites. Results: We developed a program to find out accurate motif sites from a set of unaligned DNA sequences in the yeast genome. Compared with MDscan, the prediction results suggest that, overall, our algorithm outperforms MDscan since the predicted motifs are more consistent with previously known specificities reported in the literature and have better prediction ranks. Our program also outperforms the constraint-less Cosmo program, especially in the elimination of false positives. Conclusion: In this study, an improved sampling algorithm is proposed to incorporate the binomial probability model to build significant initial candidate motif sets. By investigating the statistical dependence between base positions in TFBSs, the method of dependency graphs and their expanded Bayesian networks is combined. The results show that our program satisfactorily extract transcription factor binding sites from unaligned gene sequences.

A preliminary image, used to initialize CASMIM reconstruction, was obtained using pixel-domain OSEM. The mesh-domain representation of the image was produced by a 2D wavelet transform followed by Delaunay triangulation to obtain joint estimation of nodal locations and their activity values. A system matrix with attenuation compensation was investigated. Digital chest phantom SPECT was simulated and reconstructed. The quality of images reconstructed with OSEM-CASMIM is comparable to that from pixel-domain OSEM, but images are obtained five times faster by the CASMIM method.

Furthermore we introduce heterogeneity by various parameterizations of dwell time densities by means of proportional hazards models. According to these assumptions the observed data stem from a mixture of Weibull densities. Estimation is based on EM-algorithm and model selection may be guided by BIC. Identification of mixture components corresponds to a segmentation of users/sessions. A real life data set stemming from the analysis of a world wide operating eCommerce application is provided.

Each acoustic event is modeled by a harmonic structure and a smooth envelope both represented by Gaussian mixtures. Based on the similarity between these spectro-temporal structures, timbres are clustered to form timbre categories. The entire process is mathematically formulated as a minimization problem for the I-divergence between the HTTC parametric model and the observed spectrogram. of the music audio signal to simultaneously update harmonic, temporal and timbral model parameters through the EM algorithm. Some experimental results are presented to discuss the performance of the algorithm.

UNSUPERVISED LEARNING OF MOTION PATTERNS USING GENERATIVE MODELS	2008 15TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON IMAGE PROCESSING, VOLS 1-5	IEEE International Conference on Image Processing ICIP		English	Proceedings Paper	15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP 2008)	OCT 12-15, 2008	San Diego, CA	IEEE Signal Proc Soc		hidden Markov models; EM algorithm; unsupervised learning; minimum message length; surveillance	RECOGNITION	This work introduces a non-supervised algorithm for learning generative models for classification/recognition of human activities (specifically, pedestrian trajectories) with application to video surveillance. The proposed algorithm comprises two main features: (i) a set of low level dynamical models of the trajectories, estimated in unsupervised manner using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and automatic model selection using the minimum message length (MML) criterion; (ii) a switching dynamical model described by an hidden Markov model (HMM) used to characterize the higher level activities. The hierarchical model with these two levels is herein denoted as switched dynamical hidden Markov model (SD-HMM). We illustrate the performance of the proposed technique for human activity recognition in a university campus.

Evaluation of Surrogate Data Quality in Sinogram-Based CT Metal-Artifact Reduction	IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION FROM INCOMPLETE DATA V	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE)		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Image Reconstruction from Incomplete Data V	AUG 11-12, 2008	San Diego, CA	SPIE		Metal artifact reduction; MLEM reconstruction; image inpainting; non-equispaced fast Fourier transformation; computed tomography; surrogate data strategy	IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION; PROJECTION DATA; TOMOGRAPHY; EMISSION	In this work different surrogate data strategies to reduce metal artifacts in reconstructed CT images are tested. Inconsistent sinogram projection data caused by e.g. beam hardening are the origin of metal artifacts in the reconstructed images. The goal of this work is to replace this inconsistent projection data by artificially generated data. Therefore, here, two I D interpolation strategies, a directional interpolation based upon the sinogram 'flow' and a I D interpolation by means of the non-equispaced fast Fourier transform are compared to a fully 2D method based upon the idea of image inpainting. Due to the fact that the artificially generated data never perfectly fit the gap inside the projection data caused by the inconsistencies, those repaired sinogram data are reconstructed using a weighted Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization algorithm called lambda-MLEM algorithm. In this way, the artificially generated data, still contaminated with residual inconsistencies, are weighted less during reconstruction.

It was originally formulated as a constrained mixture of distributions, for which the adaptive parameters were determined by Maximum Likelihood (ML), using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. In this formulation, GTM is prone to data overfitting unless a regularization mechanism is included. The theoretical principles of Variational GTM, an approximate method that provides a full Bayesian treatment to a Gaussian Process (GP)-based variation of the GTM, were recently introduced as alternative way to control data overfitting. In this paper we assess in some detail the generalization capabilities of Variational GTM and compare them with those of alternative regularization approaches in terms of test log-likelihood, using several artificial and real datasets.

However, when the number of attributes of the data is large, the parameters cannot be estimated correctly. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for estimating the parameters of the Gaussian mixture model by utilizing the sample data located on the boundary of regions defined by the component density functions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is confirmed by some experiments.

A good edge preserving filter is given by NL-means filter than any other linear model based approaches. Since the Weight function in NL-rneans filter is closely related to the error norm and influence function in robust estimation framework, this paper explores a refined approach of NI-means filter by using robust estimation function rather than the usual exponential function for its weight calculation. Here the filter output at each pixel is the weighted average of pixels in the surrounding neighborhoods using the chosen robust; M-estimator function. Validations using various test images have been analyzed and the results were compared with the other known recent methods. There is a reason to believe that this refined algorithm has some interesting and notable points.	[Peter, J. Dinesh; Govindan, V.

The detection process is completed by Block Iterative generalized decision feed back equalizer (BI GDFE) method. The BI GDFE method provides the soft information of the transmitted signals to the Expectation Maximization (EM) based channel estimation. The Cramer Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) is also derived to evaluate the quality of estimated parameters. Simulations show that the proposed iterative structure has the bir error rate (BER) performance close to the that of the BI GDFE method with perfect channel state information (CSI).

The convergence of the maximum likelihood estimator to a set with characteristics of interest is shown.

Firstly, the active speakers must be identified and their locations estimated, requiring the use of multi-dimensional likelihoods, and then each speaker must be correctly associated with his corresponding location. In this paper we propose a multi-speaker tracking algorithm in which the number of active speakers is determined by estimating the profile of the noise-plus-reverberation covariance matrix eigen-values. The multi-dimensional likelihoods are then decoupled using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The tracking accuracy is improved by the inclusion of a pause detection step and estimation of the noise-plus-interference covariance matrix. The results show the benefits of the proposed methods under difficult tracking situations.

Eigenvalue decomposition is the standard algorithm for solving PCA, but a number of other algorithms have been proposed. For instance, the EM algorithm is much more efficient in case of high dimensionality and a small number of principal components. We study a case where the data are high-dimensional and a majority of the values are missing. In this case, both of these algorithms turn out to be inadequate. We propose using a gradient descent algorithm inspired by Oja's rule, and speeding it up by an approximate Newton's method. The computational complexity of the proposed method is linear with respect to the number of observed values in the data and to the number of principal components. In the experiments with Netflix data, the proposed algorithm is about ten times faster than any of the four comparison methods.

The NSA model provides a framework for understanding the relationships between sparse subspace and mixture model based approaches, and encompasses a range of models, including Sparse Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SNMF) [1] and mixture-model based analysis as special cases. We present a convenient instantiation of the NSA model, and an efficient variational approximate learning and inference algorithm that combines the advantages of SNMF and mixture model-based approaches. Preliminary recognition results on the Pascal Speech Separation Challenge 2006 test set [2], based on NSA separation results, are presented. The results fall short of those achieved by Algonquin [3], a state-of-the-art mixture-model based method, but considering that NSA runs an order of magnitude faster, the results are impressive. NSA outperform SNMF in terms of word error rate (WER) on the task by a significant margin of over 9% absolute.

The method is based on a lower bound approximation of the logistic function [Jaakkola, J.S. and Jordan, M.I., 2000, Bayesian parameter estimation via variational methods. Statistics Computing, 10, 25-37.]. Based on the approximation, an EM algorithm can be derived that results in a considerable simplification of the maximization problem in that it does not require the numerical evaluation of integrals over the random effects. We assess the performance of the variational method for the mixed logistic regression model in a simulation study and an empirical data example, and compare it to Laplace's method. The results indicate that the variational method is a viable choice for estimating the fixed effects of the mixed logistic regression model under the condition that the number of outcomes within each cluster is sufficiently high.

IMC'08: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2008 ACM SIGCOMM INTERNET MEASUREMENT CONFERENCE			English	Proceedings Paper	8th ACM SIGCOMM Internet Measurement Conference	OCT 20-22, 2008	Vouliagmeni, GREECE	ACM SIGCOMM, Assoc Comp Machinery, USENIX & ACM SIGMET		Topology Inference	RECAPTURE	Study of the Internet's high-level structure has for some time intrigued scientists. The AS-graph (showing interconnections between Autonomous Systems) has been measured, studied, modelled and discussed in many papers over the last decade. However, the quality of the measurement data has always been in question. It is by now well known that most measurements of the AS-graph are missing some set of links. Many efforts have been undertaken to correct this, primarily by increasing the set of measurements, but the issue remains: how much is enough? When will we know that we have enough measurements to be sure we can see all (or almost all) of the links. This paper aims to address the problem of estimating how many links are missing from our measurements. We use techniques pioneered in biostatistics and epidemiology for estimating the size of populations (for instance of fish or disease carriers). It is rarely possible to observe entire populations, and so sampling techniques are used. We extend those techniques to the domain of the AS-graph. The key difference between our work and the biological literature is that all links are not the same, and so we build a stratified model and specify an EM algorithm for estimating its parameters. Our estimates suggest that a very significant number of links (many of thousands) are missing from standard route monitor measurements of the AS-graph. Finally, we use the model to derive the number of monitors that would be needed to see a complete AS-graph with high-probability. We estimate that 700 route monitors would see 99.9% of links.

To improve spatial resolution of SPECT it is possible to use a pinhole collimator; however, this further reduces the system sensitivity. A potential solution to this problem is to use coded apertures, which offers increased sensitivity by using multiple pinholes, at the cost of increased image reconstruction time. A generic reconstruction algorithm has been developed which allows for arbitrary acquisition geometry via affine transforms (translation and rotation). The reconstruction process uses a (Siddon) ray projector, the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and a 1 to n pinhole position matrix. Iteration times scale as a function of the number of pinholes in the collimator. Resolution recovery has also been incorporated into the reconstruction algorithm. The algorithm developed allows for the investigation of optimal imaging settings for small animal imaging. Simulated acquisitions of an ex-vivo rat heart with 1, 5 and 8 pinholes, over 360 degree acquisition, showing that multi-pinhole imaging can be successfully applied to rat cardiac imaging. Further refinement of the acquisition parameters, such as image overlap, collimator pinhole configuration and geometrical imaging configuration, will predict the theoretical settings for quantitative cardiac multi-pinhole SPECT imaging.

The idea to see the Web as a platform for services instead of a one-way source of information has come along with a number of new applications, such as photo and video sharing portals and Wikis. In this paper, we study how these changes affect the nature of the data distributed over the World Wide Web. To do so, we compare two data traces collected at the web proxy server of the RWTH Aachen. The first trace was recorded in 2000, the other more than seven years later in 2007. We show the major differences, and the similarities, between the two traces and compare our observations with other work. The results indicate that traditional proxy caching is no longer effective in typical university networks.

Jonathan; Buxton, Hilary; Argyros, Antonis			Learning temporal structure for task based control	IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING			English	Article						variable length Markov models; temporal learning; 3-d tracking; data association; task-based control	REPRESENTATION; BEHAVIOR; MODELS	We present an extension for variable length Markov models (VLMMs) to allow for modelling of continuous input data and show that the generative properties of these VLMMs are a powerful tool for dealing with real world tracking issues. We explore methods for addressing the temporal correspondence problem in the context of a practical hand tracker, which is essential to support expectation in task-based control using these behavioural models. The hand tracker forms a part of a larger multi-component distributed system, providing 3-D hand position data to a gesture recogniser client. We show how the performance of such a hand tracker can be improved by using feedback from the gesture recogniser client. In particular, feedback based on the generative extrapolation of the recogniser's internal models is shown to help the tracker deal with mid-term occlusion. We also show that VLMMs can be used as a means to inform the prior in an expectation maximisation (EM) process used for joint spatial and temporal learning of image features. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

It uses a shot-noise model to capture extreme spikes typically arising in electricity markets. Moreover, the model easily accounts for seasonality and mean reversion. We compute futures prices in closed form and show that the resulting shapes capture a large variety of typically observed term structures. For statistical purposes we show how to use the EM-algorithm. An estimation on spot price data from the European Energy Exchange illustrate the applicability of the model.

These models are typically tuned manually, a brittle and laborious process. Autonomous model learning is a promising alternative to manual calibration, but previous work has assumed the presence of an accurate action or sensor model in order to train the other model. This paper presents an adaptation of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to enable a mobile robot to learn both its action and sensor model functions, starting without an accurate version of either. The resulting algorithm is validated experimentally both on a Sony Aibo ERS-7 robot and in simulation.

This work develops a novel hierarchal algorithm for document clustering. We are particularly interested in studying and making use of cluster overlapping phenomenon to design cluster merging criteria. In our previous papers, the theoretical results on the overlap rate between clusters based on the Gaussian mixture model were reported. In this paper, we propose a new way to compute the overlap rate in order to improve time efficiency and "the veracity". The way is that we use a line passed through the two cluster center instead of the Ridge Curve. Based on the Hierarchical Clustering Method, we use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm in the Gaussian Mixture Model to count the parameters and make the two sub-cluslers combined when their overlap is the largest. Experiments in both public data and document clustering data show that this approach can improve the efficiency of clustering and save computing time.

Typical motion paths are learnt and then used for motion prediction using this model. The principal novel aspect of this approach is the modelling of paths using gaussian processes. It allows the representation of smooth trajectories and avoids discretization problems found in most existing methods. Gaussian processes not only provides a comprehensive and formal theoretical framework to work with, it also lends itself naturally to path clustering using gaussian mixture models. Learning is performed using expectation maximization where the E-Step uses variational methods to maximize its lower bound before optimization over parameters are performed in the M-Step.

The detected target locations are obtained by an anomaly detector, such as the RX, using constant target rate (CTR) or constant false alarm rate (CFAR) thresholding. Specific shape and spectral features at the detection locations are used to assign "mineness" or "non-mineness" measures to the detections, which are further used for false alarm mitigation (FM). The remaining detections after FM are used to assign a minefield metric based on a spatial point process (SPP) formulation. This paper investigates how this "mineness" attribute of the detected targets can be exploited to improve the performance of scatterable minefield detection over and above that which is possible by FM. The distribution of the detections in the segment is formulated as a marked point process (MPP), and the minefield decision is based on the log-likelihood ratio test of a binary hypothesis problem. An elegant, linear complexity algorithm is developed to maximize this log-likelihood ratio. An iterative expectation maximization algorithm is used to estimate the unknown probability of the detection of mines. The minefield detection performance, based on SPP with false alarm mitigation and MPP formulation under both CTR and CFAR thresholding methods, is compared using thousands of simulated minefields and background segments.

The way the TACF and FCF are estimated depends on whether the measured channel is autocorrelation-ergodic with respect to time and/or frequency. In either case, it is shown that double averaging, i.e., averaging of measurement snapshots over time and frequency, improves the estimates of the TACF and FCE. We provide two examples of applying the iterative nonlinear least squares approximation (INLSA) algorithm to determine the parameters of measurement-based channel simulators from the estimated TACF and FCE The presented examples correspond to real-world outdoor and indoor propagation environments. The distinctive Nature (W the designed channel simulators is that their temporal and frequency, correlation characteristics are sufficiently close it) those that have been estimated from the measurement data. For comparison reasons, we also show the corresponding results obtained by applying the well-known subspace-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm.

This adaptive version was based on a representative sample (N=1934) of respondents who answered 30 items from a German translation of the ICQ. A random half of the sample was used to evaluate test dimensionality, calibrate the items, and model the relation between person parameters and raw total scores. The other random half of the sample was employed to assess the comparability of person parameters and raw scores. After these tests and item calibration, 28 items remained in the item pool. A high correlation was found between raw scores and estimated scores using all items. Raw scores could be predicted accurately from estimated person parameters. These results indicate that our approach is an effective technique for transforming an existing questionnaire into a computer-adaptive version.

First, the multisensor images are decomposed into multiple subimages which form a multiresolution pyramid via wavelet transform. Second, the obtained multiple subimages are modeled by block-stack modeling method. then the E-M algorithm is used to get the model parameters. Third, in each level the block fusion estimates of subimages can be obtained according to maximum a posterior method along with the above model and constructed to form subimages. Finally, the image that fused all images is achieved by taking the inverse wavelet transform of all subimages in each level. Experimental results illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm.

In this paper, we focus on investigating the use of a bilingual lexicon for cross language text categorization. To this end, we propose a novel refinement framework for cross language text categorization. The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, a cross language model transfer is proposed to generate initial labels of documents in target language. In the second stage, expectation maximization algorithm based on naive Bayes model is introduced to yield resulting labels of documents. Preliminary experimental results on collected corpora show that the proposed framework is effective.

Energy-based Sensor Network Multiple-Source Localization via a new EM algorithm	2008 CHINESE CONTROL AND DECISION CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-11			English	Proceedings Paper	20th Chinese Control and Decision Conference	JUL 02-04, 2008	Yantai, PEOPLES R CHINA			Wireless sensor network; Expectation-Maximization; maximum likelihood estimation	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD	A new efficient Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for ML estimation is presented for multiple sources localization using a wireless sensor network (WSN). It uses acoustic signal energy measurements taken at individual sensors to estimate the locations of multiple acoustic sources. Instead of already existent Multi-resolution (MR) search of projection solution and existing EM algorithms for ML estimation, the basic idea of our method is to decompose the observed sensor data (signal energy), which is a superimposition of multiple sources, into individual components and then estimate the corresponding location parameters separately. Our proposed EM algorithm involves two steps, namely Expectation (E-step) and Maximization (M-step). In the E-step, signal energy of sensors received from individual source is estimated. Then, in the M-step, the maximum likelihood estimates of the source location parameters are obtained through a global grid search. The two steps are iteratively repeated until the pre-defined convergence is reached. Simulation results show that our proposed EM algorithm have a good performance and is a better solution for ML estimation which approach a good trade-off between estimation error and computation complexity.

The proposed technique does not need oversampling at the receiver. The key idea is to minimize the energy leakage from the first channel path due to mis-sampling. We use realistic channel models and assume that no channel statistical information is known at the receiver. In our approach, the multi-band signals are coherently combined in order to improve the resolution of the TOA estimation. We compare the performance of the proposed scheme with the well-known maximum-likelihood based algorithm, namely, space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE). Simulations based on the ECMA-368 standard parameters in both IEEE 802.15.3a and IEEE 802.15.4a standard channel models show that our approach outperforms the SAGE algorithm by avoiding the local maxima. Furthermore, we have also shown that our approach can achieve a root mean square error of TOA estimation much smaller than the receiver sampling interval and it is robust to the narrowband interference.

Materials and methods: Both brain and heart/thorax phantoms were used to evaluate the effects of collimator selection and correction methods on brain and cardiac I-123 imaging. Experiments were performed to measure the target-to-background ratio for calculation of object contrast. The projection data were corrected using X-ray-based attenuation maps for attenuation correction (AC) and dual-energy window method for scatter correction (SC). Reconstructed images using different methods were compared, which included FBP (filtered backprojection), and OSEM (ordered subsets expectation maximization) without any correction, with AC, with SC, and with AC and SC. Results: In both phantom studies, the image contrasts provided by the ME collimator were better than that of the LE collimator. The OSEM with simple dual-energy window SC method improved image contrast and visual image quality as compared to the FBP method. The use of AC improved the visual image quality but did not improve image contrast, if SC method was not implemented at the same time. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the importance of SC and ME collimator in I-123 SPECT imaging. If image contrast is the figure of merit, then SC should be performed and the use of the ME collimator appears to be preferable in semi-quantitative I-123 SEPCT studies. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The restricted Boltzmann machine is the main component used in building up the deep belief network and has been studied by many researchers. However, the learning algorithm for the restricted Boltzmann machine is a NP-hard problem in general. In this paper we propose a new approximate learning algorithm for the restricted Boltzmann machines using the EM algorithm and the loopy belief propagation.

In the proposed work, the source signals are nonstationary and temporally correlated. A generative model based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is derived to track the nonstationarity of the source signal while the source signal itself is modeled by temporally correlated Generalized Gaussian Distribution (GGD) Model. The Maximum Likelihood (ML) approach is developed to estimate the parameters of the proposed model by using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm and the source signals are estimated by Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) approach. The strength of the proposed approach Res in the tracking of the nonstationarity of the source signal by HMM and the temporal correlation by the autoregressive (AR) source model. This has resulted in high performance accuracy, fast convergence and efficient implementation of the estimation algorithm. Simulations have been investigated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the results have shown significant improvement has been obtained when compared with nonlinear algorithm without using HMM.

An expectation maximization approach to estimate malaria haplotype frequencies in multiply infected children	STATISTICAL APPLICATIONS IN GENETICS AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						expectation maximization; clones; haplotypes; malaria parasite	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; EM ALGORITHM; POPULATION; INFERENCE; SAMPLES	Characterizing genetic variability in the human pathogenic Plasmodium species, the group of parasites that cause Malaria, may have broad global health implications. Specifically, discerning the combinations of mutations that lead to viable parasites and the population level frequencies of these clonal sequences will allow for targeted vaccine development and individualized treatment choices. This presents an analytical challenge, however, since haplotypic phase (i.e. the alignment of bases on a single DNA strand) is generally unobservable in multiply infected individuals. This manuscript describes an expectation maximization (EM) approach to maximum likelihood estimation of haplotype frequencies in this missing data setting. The approach is applied to a cohort of N=341 malaria infected children in Uganda, Cameroon and Sudan to characterize regional differences. A simulation study is also presented to characterize method performance and assess sensitivity to distributional assumptions.

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the short arm of human chromosome 6 has been thoroughly studied as a susceptibility locus. However, one of the strongest MHC associations found, that of HLA-DR3 with UC protection, has not been observed in all populations. Our aim in the present study was to evaluate this negative association in a large cohort of Spanish UC patients and controls, and to try to elucidate which, if any, of the diverse DR3 haplotypes (identified by TNFa and b microsatellites, located in the MHC class III region) is most tightly associated (negatively) with the disease. METHODS: A total of 537 UC patients and 748 healthy controls from Spain were included in the present study. Low-resolution DR genotyping was performed by PCR and hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes. TNFa and b microsatellites were studied in a subset of samples (279 UC patients and 503 healthy controls) by PCR followed by capillary electrophoresis. DR-TNFa-TNFb haplotypes were estimated by the expectation-maximization algorithm and comparisons were performed by a chi(2) test. RESULTS: After a stepwise procedure, the only DR alleles significantly associated with the disease were DR3 (very strongly, protection) and DR4 (weakly, protection). The strong protective effect of DR3 was evenly distributed among the haplotypes DR3-TNFa1b5, DR3-TNFa2b3, and DR3-TNFother. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the strong protective effect of DR3 in our population, and suggest that the relevant protective gene is located centromeric to TNFa and TNFb markers in the MHC region.

Phantom experiments to improve parathyroid lesion detection	MEDICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						iterative reconstruction; parathyroid disease; SPECT imaging; phantom simulations	EMISSION COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; PRIMARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM; RADIOGUIDED SURGERY; TC-99M-SESTAMIBI; SPECT/CT	This investigation tested the hypothesis that visual analysis of iteratively reconstructed tomograms by ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) provides the highest accuracy for localizing parathyroid lesions using Tc-99m-sestamibi SPECT data. From an Institutional Review Board approved retrospective review of 531 patients evaluated for parathyroid localization, image characteristics were determined for 85 Tc-99m-sestamibi SPECT studies originally read as equivocal (EQ). Seventy-two plexiglas phantoms using cylindrical simulated lesions were acquired for a clinically realistic range of counts (mean simulated lesion counts of 75 +/- 50 counts/pixel) and target-to-background (T:B) ratios (range=2.0 to 8.0) to determine an optimal filter for OSEM. Two experienced nuclear physicians graded simulated lesions, blinded to whether chambers contained radioactivity or plain water, and two observers used the same scale to read all phantom and clinical SPECT studies, blinded to pathology findings and clinical information. For phantom data and all clinical data, T:B analyses were not statistically different for OSEM versus FB, but visual readings were significantly more accurate than T:B (88 +/- 6% versus 68 +/- 6%, p=0.001) for OSEM processing, and OSEM was significantly more accurate than FB for visual readings (88 +/- 6% versus 58 +/- 6%, p < 0.0001). These data suggest that visual analysis of iteratively reconstructed MIBI tomograms should be incorporated into imaging protocols performed to localize parathyroid lesions.

As MIMO-OFDM is considered for future cellular systems, the iterative receiver is investigated when the co-channel interference (CCI) exists. It is assumed that the CCI's are also OFDM signals. Since a joint detection of the desired signal and CCI is difficult, we only detect the desired signal, while the CCI is assumed to be a (colored) noise. This approach can avoid the channel estimation and detection of the CCI and keep the complexity of the receiver low. The proposed iterative receiver estimates the channel impulse response of the desired signal and the covariance matrix of the CCI for the detection based on a generalized expectation maximization (GEM) algorithm. Through GEM iterations, we can observe the performance is improved.

The classification process was based on an "optimal" subset of compositional variables, which were identified by means of a variable reduction method that maintained a multivariate data structure. The EM algorithm was then applied on this variable subset to determine the Gaussian model parameters that best described the data. Initially, an evaluation of the methodology was carried out on published GC-MS data of 88 Canadian gasoline samples, and the results from our study were compared to the results that were already presented in past literature. The methodology was subsequently tested on GC data from 74 Greek gasoline samples analyzed in our laboratory. The conjunction of variable reduction with the EM algorithm has proven to be a successful and reliable classification tool for gasoline samples belonging to different commercial grades (premium, regular, winter, and summer) in both data sets.

We construct a model with several latent state variables, where the model parameters are partitioned into disjoint groups, each one of which is independently determined by a corresponding state variable. Such a model is called an extended switching regression (ESR) model. We develop an EM algorithm to estimate the model parameters, and discuss the consistency and asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimates. Finally, we use the ESR model to combine volatility forecasts of foreign exchange rates. The resulting forecast combination using the ESR model tends to dominate those generated by traditional procedures. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Rajashekhara; Chaudhuri, S				Rajashekhara; Chaudhuri, Subhasis			Segmentation and region of interest based image retrieval in low depth of field observations	IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING			English	Article						contrast; EM algorithm; low depth of field; ROI; color histogram; precision; recall		In this paper we address the problem of extracting the focused region and its use in retrieving similar images from a low depth of field image database. We compute the histogram of the local contrast at each pixel and model it as a mixture of two exponential distributions - one for the focused and the other for the defocused region. Unlike the mixture of Gaussian distributions, a mixture of exponential distributions overlaps with same monotonicity over the entire range in [0, infinity) and it is difficult to separate into components. We estimate the parameters of these distributions using the EM algorithm. This is followed by a hypothesis testing which segments the focused region in the low depth of field image. A content-based retrieval scheme is now confined to the detected region for a proper retrieval. Experimental results for both segmentation and image retrieval using a database consisting of 4986 images are presented to show the efficacy of the suggested scheme. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

An efficient MCEM algorithm for fitting generalized linear mixed models for correlated binary data	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION			English	Article						correlated binary data; data augmentation; generalized linear mixed models; Gibbs sampler; inverse Bayes formula; Monte Carlo EM algorithm; MCMC	NORMALIZING CONSTANTS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; EM ALGORITHM; ESTIMATING RATIOS; DATA AUGMENTATION; BIAS CORRECTION; DISTRIBUTIONS; COMPONENTS; DISPERSION; INFERENCE	Generalized linear mixed models have been widely used in the analysis of correlated binary data arisen in many research areas. Maximum likelihood fitting of these models remains to be a challenge because of the complexity of the likelihood function. Current approaches are primarily to either approximate the likelihood or use a sampling method to find the exact likelihood solution. The former results in biased estimates, and the latter uses Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) methods with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm in each E-step, leading to problems of convergence and slow convergence. This paper develops a new MCEM algorithm to maximize the likelihood for generalized linear mixed probit-normal models for correlated binary data. At each E-step, utilizing the inverse Bayes formula, we propose a direct importance sampling approach (i.e. weighted Monte Carlo integration) to numerically evaluate the first- and the second-order moments of a truncated multivariate normal distribution, thus eliminating problems of convergence and slow convergence. To monitor the convergence of the proposed MCEM, we again employ importance sampling to directly calculate the log-likelihood values and then to plot the difference of the consecutive log-likelihood values against the MCEM iteration. Two real data sets from the children's wheeze study and a three-period crossover trial are analyzed to illustrate the proposed method and for comparison with existing methods. The results show that the new MCEM algorithm outperformed that of McCulloch [McCulloch, C.E., 1994, Maximum likelihood variance components estimation for binary data.

J	Yamada, R; Matsuda, F				Yamada, Ryo; Matsuda, Fumihiko			A novel method to express SNP-based genetic heterogeneity, Psi, and its use to measure linkage disequilibrium for multiple SNPs, D-g, and to estimate absolute maximum of haplotype frequency	GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							CHROMOSOMAL SPECIATION	Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are important markers to investigate genetic heterogeneity of population and to perform linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping. We propose a new method, Psi, to express frequency of 2(Ns) haplotypes for N-s di-allelic SNPs. Using the new expression of haplotype frequency, we propose a novel measure of LD, D-g, not only for SNP pairs but also for multiple markers. The values of D-g for SNP pairs were revealed to be similar to values of conventional pairwise LD indices, D' and r(2), and it was revealed that D-g quantitated components of LD that were not measured by conventional LD indices for SNP pairs. Also we propose a distinct method, D-g-based absolute estimation, to infer the absolute maximum estimates of haplotype frequency. The result of the D-g-based absolute estimation of haplotype frequency for SNP pairs were compared with the conventional expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and reported that the new method gave better inference than the EM algorithm which converged infrequently to a local extreme.

Recently, we demonstrated that three-dimensional (3D) images with uniform spatial resolution and no blurring can be obtained by complete data acquired using two-circular orbit, combined with the 3D ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction method. However, a long computation time is required to obtain the reconstruction image, because of the fact that 3D-OSEM is an iterative method and two-orbit acquisition doubles the size of the projection data. To reduce the long reconstruction time, we parallelized the two-orbit pinhole 3D-OSEM reconstruction process by using a Beowulf personal computer (PC) cluster. Methods The Beowulf PC cluster consists of seven PCs connected to Gbit Ethernet switches. Message passing interface protocol was utilized for parallelizing the reconstruction process. The projection data in a subset are distributed to each PC. The partial image forward- and back-projected in each PC is transferred to all PCs. The current image estimate on each PC is updated after summing the partial images. The performance of parallelization on the PC cluster was evaluated using two independent projection data sets acquired by a pinhole SPECT system with two different circular orbits. Results Parallelization using the PC cluster improved the reconstruction time with increasing number of PCs. The reconstruction time of 54 min by the single PC was decreased to 10 min when six or seven PCs were used. The speed-up factor was 5.4. The reconstruction image by the PC cluster was virtually identical with that by the single PC. Conclusions Parallelization of 3D-OSEM reconstruction for pinhole SPECT using the PC cluster can significantly reduce the computation time, whereas its implementation is simple and inexpensive.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has devised an instrument World Health Organization Quality of Life Survey- Abbreviated Version (WHOQOL-BREF) to assess quality of life, but the psychometric property of each individual item has not been studied yet. Using item response theory, we examine the properties of the WHOQOL-BRIEF Taiwan version. Samejima's graded response model was fitted, and item parameters were calculated. The items were ranked base on their discrimination power, and the best items are identified. Several data with subset of items (22, 20, 18, 16 and 14 items) were created by omitting items with lower discrimination power. The test information function of the full questionnaire and the subsets were compared. The results showed there were significant positive correlations between the full questionnaire and the subsets of items and the distributions are similar. The test information function showed the maximum amount of test information spaced over two ends of the theta continuum, and this suggested that the WHOQOL-BREF provided more information for groups with either lower or higher satisfaction of quality of life, while it is less discriminating for individuals in the middle range.

A repairable system may end up in (, ne of the three possible states after a repair: 'as good as new', 'as bad as old' and 'better than old but worse than new'. Current probabilistic models used in repairable system analysis account for the first two states, but they do not properly apply to the last one, which is, more common in practice. In this paper a robust solution to a probabilistic model that is applicable to all of the three after repair states, called generalized renewal process (GRP), is presented. This research demonstrates that the GRP based on an m-fold Weibull mixture offers a general approach to modeling complex repairable systems and discusses application of the EM algorithm to estimation of the GRP parameters. This paper also presents a review of the standard GRP based on two-parameter Weibull distribution. The GRP with m mixture components distributions is compared to the standard GRP by calculating the expected cumulative number of failure, and the error function. It is shown that the proposed GRP solution with a Weibull mixture accurately describes the failure data and it is suitable for predicting failures based on the past performance of the system, oven when a small amount of failure data is available.

J	Biernacki, C				Biernacki, Christophe			Degeneracy in the maximum likelihood estimation of univariate gaussian mixtures for grouped data and behaviour of the EM algorithm	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS			English	Article						degeneracy; EM algorithm; Gaussian mixtures; grouped data; maximum like-lihood; speed of convergence	PARAMETERS; DENSITIES	In the context of the univariate Gaussian mixture with grouped data, it is shown that the global maximum of the likelihood may correspond to a situation where a Dirac lies in any non-empty interval. Existence of a domain of attraction near such a maximizer is discussed and we establish that the expectation-maximization (EM) iterates move extremely slowly inside this domain. These theoretical results are illustrated both by some Monte-Carlo experiments and by a real data set. To help practitioners identify and discard these potentially dangerous degenerate maximizers, a specific stopping rule for EM is proposed.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate parameters in ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) and to compare systematically with filtered back-projection (FBP) for reconstruction of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) SPECT, incorporating attenuation and scatter correction. Methods The evaluation was based on the trade-off between contrast recovery and statistical noise using different sizes of subsets, number of iterations and filter parameters. Monte Carlo simulated SPECT studies of a digital human brain phantom were used. The contrast recovery was calculated as measured contrast divided by true contrast. Statistical noise in the reconstructed images was calculated as the coefficient of variation in pixel values. Results A constant contrast level was reached above 195 equivalent maximum likelihood expectation maximization iterations. The choice of subset size was not crucial as long as there were >= 2 projections per subset. The OSEM reconstruction was found to give 5-14% higher contrast recovery than FBP for all clinically relevant noise levels in rCBF SPECT. The Butterworth filter, power 6, achieved the highest stable contrast recovery level at all clinically relevant noise levels. The cut-off frequency should be chosen according to the noise level accepted in the image. Conclusion Trade-off plots are shown to be a practical way of deciding the number of iterations and subset size for the OSEM reconstruction and can be used for other examination types in nuclear medicine.

The main contribution is to employ the expectation-maximisation (EM) method as a means for computation of the maximum-likelihood (ML) parameter estimation of the system. Closed form of the expectation of the studied system subjected to Gaussian distribution noise is derived and parameter choice that maximizes the expectation is also proposed. This results in an iterative algorithm for parameter estimation and the robust algorithm implementation based on technique of QR-factorization and Cholesky factorization is also discussed. Moreover, algorithmic properties such as non-decreasing likelihood value, necessary and sufficient conditions for the algorithm to arrive at a local stationary parameter, the convergence rate and the factors affecting the convergence rate are analyzed. Simulation study shows that the proposed algorithm has attractive properties such as numerical. stability, and avoidance of difficult initial conditions.

J	Zhou, J; Zhu, HQ; Shu, HZ; Luo, LM				Zhou, Jian; Zhu, Hongqing; Shu, Huazhong; Luo, Limin			A generalized diffusion based inter-iteration nonlinear bilateral filtering scheme for PET image reconstruction	COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS			English	Article						image reconstruction; inter-iteration; filtering; MAP; OSL; diffusion; bilateral; range filter; domain filter	EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; ANISOTROPIC DIFFUSION; EM ALGORITHM; REGULARIZATION; SPECT; RESTORATION; FRAMEWORK	In this paper, a new inter-iteration filtering scheme based on diffusion Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation for Positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction is proposed. This is achieved by gaining the insights into the classical MAP iteration (e.g. the 'one-step-late' algorithm, OSL) and the several well-established approximations to the diffusion process. We show that such a new technique allows additional insight and sufficient flexibility for further investigations on some nonlinear filters based reconstruction algorithms. In particular, we suggest the bilateral filter as a nice application in which image smoothing while edge preserving can be readily obtained by the combination of the range and domain filters. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method are verified in the substantiating experiments conducted on both the computer simulated and real clinical data. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Eilers, PHC				Eilers, Paul H. C.			Data exploration in meta-analysis with smooth latent distributions	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						EM algorithm; penalty; non-parametric	CLINICAL-TRIALS	Meta-analysis with discrete outcomes is interpreted as the estimation (in one or two dimensions) of a non-parametric smooth latent distribution of event probabilities (or rates). A simple but efficient EM algorithm is presented. A fine grid is used and fast smoothing is done by penalized least squares. Data exploration is the primary goal, but the estimated distribution can also be used to compute useful statistics of treatment effects. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

On reconstructing photon statistics by on/off detectors: Toward the multi-partite case	OPTICS AND SPECTROSCOPY			English	Article							OPTICAL HOMODYNE TOMOGRAPHY; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; QUANTUM STATES; DENSITY-MATRIX; EM ALGORITHM; RADIATION	Reconstruction of photon statistics of optical states provides fundamental information on the nature of any optical field and finds various relevant applications. Nevertheless, no detector that can accurately discriminate the number of incident photons is available, whereas reconstruction by quantum tomography is not an easily implementable technique suited for a diffuse use. Even if on/off detectors, as usual avalanche photodiodes operating in Geiger mode, seem useless as photocounters, recently it was shown that reconstruction of photon statistics is possible by considering variable quantum efficiency. We have experimentally demonstrated the potential of this technique by reconstructing photon statistics for various optical fields both in the cw and pulsed regime ranging from heralded photon states to multi-thermal and coherent ones. In this paper, after having introduced the method, a review of the results obtained for the mono-partite case is given and the extension to bi-partite case is presented in detail.

Long correlation Gaussian random fields: Parameter estimation and noise reduction	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm; Gaussian random fields (GRF); maximum likelihood estimation (MLE); noise reduction; Wiener filter	STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; SPATIAL-INTERACTION; IMAGES; MODELS	In this paper, a parametric model for Gaussian random fields (GRFs) with long-correlation feature, namely the long correlation GRF (LC-GRF), is studied. Important properties of the model are derived and used for developing new parameter estimation algorithms and for constructing an optimum noise reduction filter. In particular, a novel iterative maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) algorithm is proposed for estimating the parameters of the model from a sample image, and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed for estimating the signal and noise variances given a noisy image. The optimal Wiener filter is derived making use of the parametric form of the model for the noise reduction under additive white Gaussian noise (WGN). Also the theoretic performance of the filter is obtained and its behavior is analyzed in terms of the long-correlation feature of the model. The effectiveness of the presented algorithms is demonstrated through experimental results on synthetic generated GRFs. An application to the restoration of cosmic microwave background (CMB) images in the presence of additive WGN is also presented. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Tomographic reconstruction using heuristic Monte Carlo methods	JOURNAL OF HEURISTICS			English	Article						tomography; image reconstruction; Monte Carlo methods; stochastic heuristics; multigrid	IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION; EM ALGORITHM; RESTORATION; PROJECTIONS	A tomographic reconstruction method based on Monte Carlo random searching guided by the information contained in the projections of radiographed objects is presented. In order to solve the optimization problem, a multiscale algorithm is proposed to reduce computation. The reconstruction is performed in a coarse-to-fine multigrid scale that initializes each resolution level with the reconstruction of the previous coarser level, which substantially improves the performance. The method was applied to a real case reconstructing the internal structure of a small metallic object with internal components, showing excellent results.

J	Li, CJ; Andersen, SV				Li, Chunjian; Andersen, Soren Vang			Efficient blind system identification of non-Gaussian autoregressive models with HMM modeling of the excitation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						identification; modeling; nonlinear estimation; signal analysis	SPEECH ENHANCEMENT; ALGORITHMS	We have previously proposed a blind system identification method that exploits the underlying dynamics of non-Gaussian signals in [Li and Andersen, "Blind identification of Non-Gaussian Autoregressive Models for Efficient Analysis of Speech Signals," Proceedings of the International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), May 2006, vol. 1, pp. I-1205-1-1208]. The signal model being identified is an autoregressive (AR) model driven by a discrete-state hidden Markov process. An exact expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm was derived for the joint estimation of the AR parameters and the hidden Markov model (HMM) parameters. In this paper, we extend the system model by introducing an additive measurement noise. The identification of the extended system model becomes much more complicated since the system output is now hidden. We propose an exact EM algorithm that incorporates a novel switching Kalman smoother, which obtains nonlinear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimates of the system output based on the state information given by the HMM filter. The exact EM algorithms for both models are obtainable only by appropriate constraints in the model design and have better convergence properties than algorithms employing generalized EM algorithm or empirical iterative schemes. The proposed methods also enjoy good data efficiency since only second-order statistics are involved in the computation. The signal models are general and suitable to numerous signals, such as speech and baseband communication signals. This paper describes the two system identification algorithms in an integrated form and provides supplementary results to the noise-free model and new results to the extended model with applications in speech analysis and channel equalization.

Stationary conditions axe derived. A simple Expectation Maximization(EM) algorithm is used and shown to work well for estimation. The shape-changing feature of conditional distributions of the MARMA model makes the model capable of modeling time series with multimodal conditional distributions and with heteroscedasticity. The model is applied to two real and simulated data sets with satisfactory results. The MARMA model can capture the features of the real data set better than other competing models do.

Modelling effectiveness of internally heterogeneous organizations in the presence of survey non-response: An application to the ULTRA study	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th Biennial Symposium on Statistical Methods	2007	Washington, DC	CDC, ATSDR, Washington Statist Soc, Rutgers Univ, Ctr Discrete Math& Comp Sci, SAG, Statist Advisory Grp		EM algorithm; Gibbs sampler; missing data; incomplete covariates; measurement error	GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; EM ALGORITHM	Levels of turbulence and uncertainty in family medicine practices participating in the ULTRA study are measured via a survey from heterogeneous viewpoints within each practice, including clinicians, nursing staff and office staff. In order to examine the effect of the average practice 'chaos' score on screening provided to patients, the analysis needed to account for large amounts of missing survey responses. Patterns of missing data included portions of missing responses within a job group (e.g. one out of three clinicians) to missing responses from whole subgroups within a practice (e.g. all three clinicians) to a whole practice of missing survey responses (e.g. all clinicians, nursing staff and office staff). The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, using a hierarchical model for covariate information, is used to handle the missing data. It was found that the varied patterns of missingness of survey responses among the heterogeneous subgroups within the practices had large effects on estimated effects of practice chaos on patient care.

We consider a study design in which the data consist of noisy observations of multiple copies of a DNA molecule marked with colors at recognition sites. The primary goal is to estimate a physical map. A secondary goal is to estimate error rates associated with the experiment, which are potentially useful for analysis and refinement of the biochemical steps in the mapping procedure. We propose statistical models for various sources of error and use maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to construct a physical map and estimate error rates. To overcome difficulties arising in the maximization process, a latent-variable Markov chain version of the model is proposed, and the EM algorithm is used for maximization. In addition, a simulated annealing procedure is applied to maximize the profile likelihood over the discrete space of sequences of colors. We apply the methods to simulated data on the bacteriophage lambda genome.

In particular, we prove that these blind estimators asymptotically (in the number of observed bits) achieve the accuracy obtained with perfect knowledge of the transmitted bits. We propose a maximum-likelihood solution which follows from the standard expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, considered to be a reference algorithm. Finally, the optimal fusion rule is revisited and our theoretical results are compared to Monte Carlo simulations.

J	Flachaire, E; Nunez, O				Flachaire, Emmanuel; Nunez, Olivier			Estimation of the income distribution and detection of subpopulations: An explanatory model	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						income distribution; mixture models	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; EM ALGORITHM	Empirical evidence, obtained from non-parametric estimation of the income distribution, exhibits strong heterogeneity in most populations of interest. It is common, therefore, to suspect that the population is composed of several homogeneous subpopulations. Such an assumption leads us to consider mixed income distributions whose components feature the distributions of the incomes of a particular homogeneous subpopulation. A model with mixing probabilities that are allowed to vary with exogenous individual variables that characterize each subpopulation is developed.

J	Hu, CC; De Gruttola, V				Hu, Chengcheng; De Gruttola, Victor			Joint Modeling of progression of HIV resistance mutations measured with uncertainty and failure time data	BIOMETRICS			English	Article						Cox regression; failure time data; Markov models; model checking; sequencing error; survival data	ASYMPTOTIC THEORY; FRAILTY MODEL; EM-ALGORITHM; REGRESSION; LIKELIHOOD	Development of HIV resistance mutations is a major cause for failure of antiretroviral treatment. This article proposes a method for jointly modeling the processes of viral genetic changes and treatment failure. Because the viral genome is measured with uncertainty, a hidden Markov model is used to fit the viral genetic process. The uncertain viral genotype is included as a time-dependent covariate in a Cox model for failure time, and an expectation-maximization algorithm is used to estimate the model parameters. This model allows simultaneous evaluation of the sequencing uncertainty and the effect of resistance mutation on the risk of virological and immunological failures. Various model checking tests are provided to assess the appropriateness of the model. Simulation studies are performed to investigate the finite-sample properties of the proposed methods, which are then applied to data collected in three phase II clinical trials testing antiretroviral treatments containing the drug efavirenz.

In the proposed detection procedure, first initial values for the bits of all users are estimated from received signal. Then, the proposed MPEM based algorithm uses outputs of carries' demodulators to improve the accuracy of the initial estimates of the bits. In this paper, the expectation and maximization steps' functions of the MPEM algorithm for MC-CDMA multiuser detection are derived and the performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed. Our presented numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed detection algorithm both in bit error rate performance and computational complexity points of view.

J	Salim, A; Pawitan, Y				Salim, Agus; Pawitan, Yudi			Model-based maximum covariance analysis for irregularly observed climatological data	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS			English	Article						climate change; EM algorithm; Kalman filter; North Atlantic Oscillation; singular value decomposition; Southern Oscillation.	NORTH-ATLANTIC; PRECIPITATION; ENSO; VARIABILITY; LIKELIHOOD; PACIFIC; EUROPE; TRENDS	In climatology, maximum covariance analysis (MCA) is one of the most popular tools for investigating association between two multivariate variables across time and space. These association studies are important because many climate phenomena such as the El Nifio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation are results of interaction between these variables. Despite its popularity, maximum covariance analysis does not provide straightforward statistical inference on its estimates and furthermore it does not provide an objective way to handle irregularly observed data, frequently encountered in climatology. The aim of this article is to describe a model-based maximum covariance analysis that can accommodate irregularly observed data. The methodology combines maximum covariance analysis's relationship with Tucker inter-battery factor analysis and the state-space methodology for missing data. The methodology is illustrated with an application to investigate association between Irish winter precipitation and global sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies.

In the scatter plots, the distribution is constructed from a mixture of normal two-dimensional distributions, which represent fluctuations in gene expression values due to noise. An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is used for estimating the modeling parameters. The probability that duplicated data is shifted by noise is calculated using Bayesian estimation. Six data sets of rice cDNA microarray assays were used to test the proposed technique. Genes in the data sets were subjected to clustering based on probability of true value. Clustering successfully identified candidate genes regulated by circadian rhythms in rice.

[Lee, C.F., Lee, J.C., Ni, H.F., Wu, C.C., 2004. On a simple econometric approach for utility-based asset pricing model. Review of Quantitative Finance and Accounting 22, 331-344] developed the theory and the distribution of unconditional relative risk aversion (RRA) estimates in utility-based asset pricing model by assuming normality for the log excess returns. While the normality assumption is not always appropriate for some security returns, Brown and Gibbons [Brown, D.P., Gibbons, M.R., 1985. A simple econometric approach for utility-based asset pricing model. Journal of Finance 40, 359-381] proposed generalized method of moments (GMM) to estimate unconditional RRA. However, RRA estimated by GMM is not statistically efficient with finite samples. The main purpose of this paper is to derive the process of estimating dynamic RRA with the maximum likelihood and a Bayesian method having a weakly informative prior density while assuming that the log excess returns on the market are distributed as normal mixture GARCH(1,1). This methodology will capture the variations of RRA across different periods. Empirical results are presented using market rates of returns and risk-free rates over the period 1941 to 2001.

For exploiting the space, time, and frequency diversity, the low-density parity-check code (LDPC) is used as a channel coding with a built-in interleaver. The receiver employs the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm so as to perform the MAP symbol detection with reasonable computational complexity. The minimum mean square error (MMSE), recursive least squares (RLS), and least mean square (LMS) algorithms are theoretically derived for the channel estimation within this framework. Furthermore, the proposed receiver performs a new scheme called backward symbol detection (BSD), in which the signal detection uses the channel impulse response that is estimated one OFDM symbol later. The advantage of BSD, which is explained from the viewpoint of the message passing algorithm, is that BSD can exploit information on the both precedent and subsequent OFDM symbols, similarly to RLS with smoothing and removing (SR-RLS) [25]. In comparison with SR-RLS, BSD reduces the complexity at the cost of packet error rate (PER) performance. Computer simulations show that the receiver employing RLS for the channel estimation outperforms the ones employing MMSE or LMS, and that BSD can improve the PER performance of the ones employing RLS or LMS.

It is known that jitter noise is one of the principal sources of the media noise and depends on recording signal patterns. For such a jitter-noise dominant recording channel with continuous erasures, maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding is hard to minimize the error rate performance of signal processing systems. To improve MAP decoding performance, sequence estimation using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is introduced to identify each distribution of the jitter noise in the normal mixture model and estimates the missing sequences which are caused by continuous erasures.

J	Wu, L				Wu, Lang			A computationally efficient method for nonlinear mixed-effects models with nonignorable missing data in time-varying covariates	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						EM algorithm; linearization; longitudinal data; random effects model	EM ALGORITHM	Nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) models are widely used for longitudinal data analyses. Time-dependent covariates are often introduced to partially explain inter-individual variation. These covariates often have missing data, and the missingness may be nonignorable. Likelihood inference for NLME models with nonignorable missing data in time-varying covariates can be computationally very intensive and may even offer computational difficulties such as nonconvergence. We propose a computationally very efficient method for approximate likelihood inference. The method is illustrated using a real data example. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Capacity analysis of MIMO system over identically independent distributed weibull fading channels	2007 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS, VOLS 1-14	IEEE International Conference on Communications		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC 2007)	JUN 24-28, 2007	Glasgow, SCOTLAND	IEEE				The capacity of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system over wireless channels has been investigated analytically and by simulation over different types of wireless fading channels, such as Rayleigh and Nakagami-m fading channels. The capacity of MIMO system over Weibull fading channels has not been considered in the literature before because of the complexity in obtaining closed form expressions for either the probability of outage capacity or the average capacity. In this paper, Finite Mixture (FM) with Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is utilized to derive simple approximate expression for the probability density function (pdf) of the capacity distribution over identically independent distributed (iid) Weibull fading channels. This approximation converts the complicated capacity distribution to a simple weighted sum of univariate normal distributions with appropriate weighting coefficients, means, and variances for a predefined system model and channel statistics. The resultant approximation simplifies the mathematical analysis of the average capacity and the outage capacity in terms of well known Q-functions.

End-to-end performance analysis of cooperative relay-based wireless system over generalized Gaussian-Finite-Mixture fading channels	GLOBECOM 2007: 2007 IEEE GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-11	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (Globecom)		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM 07)	NOV 26-30, 2007	Washington, DC	IEEE			CAPACITY THEOREMS	The end-to-end performance of cooperative relay-based wireless communication system with non regenerative relay over generalized Gaussian-Finite-Mixture fading channels is presented. The received signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) is maximized by optimizing the relay gain given that the fading statistics of the links in a cooperative system are known by the relay. The statistics of the received SNR at optimum gain are derived in closed forms. More specifically the probability density function (pdf), the cumulative distribution function (CDF), the moment generating function (MGF), and the amount of fading (AoF) for noise-limited cooperative relay-based system are derived. In this paper, Finite Mixture (FM) with Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is utilized to derive simple approximate expression for the pdfs of Rayleigh, Nakagami-m and Weibull fading channels. Numerical results using Monte Carlo simulation are used to validate the derived closed-form expressions. The resultant expressions of the statistics of the received SNR simplify the analysis of the end-to-end performance of cooperative relay-based wireless communication system.

Presence of additional modified characters, which get plugged in as extensions and remain as disjointed protrusions of a main character is really challenging in estimating inclination in skewed documents made up of texts in south Indian languages (Kannada, Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam). In this paper, we present a novel script independent (for south Indian) skew estimation technique based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to learn the mixture of Gaussians. Subsequently the cluster means are subjected to moments to estimate the skew angle.

We propose an approach which is able to properly estimate orientation and extent of blur. A fine estimation of the blur parameters is a key point for restoration of blurred documents in photographic images. In this method we estimate the orientation of the blurred image using the main smear lines in the Fourier spectrum of the image. A fine segmentation of the main smear lines is performed using EM algorithm. In order to estimate the blur extent we first de-correlate the blurred image along the direction perpendicular to the blur orientation. A differential filter is proposed for this stage. The blur extent is then estimated from the process of minimizing the autocorrelation of image profiles along the blur orientation. The estimation of the extent is refined by statistical analysing the extracted extents along a number of image profiles. The experimental results shows the superiority of the proposed method to the existing methods for the estimation of blur parameters.

Tumor contrast, background noise strength and background noise correlation length properties were jointly used to compare bias, variance and covariance tradeoffs within uniform organs in PL and post-smoothed OSEM images. Contrast was measured as the ratio of mean tumor and mean background activities. Noise variance was measured as the average ensemble standard deviation of the background voxels. Noise correlation lengths were measured indirectly via a non-uniformity metric as the standard deviation of the means inside 15 background spheres. Short noise correlation lengths gave small non-uniformity values while those comparable to sphere dimensions resulted in larger values. Simulated 2D and 3D datasets with less than 3 counts per sinogram bin were reconstructed using post-smoothed OSEM and PL with quadratic, logcosh, Huber and generalized Gaussian penalties. The generalized Gaussian penalty with proper parameter selection, was able to provide images with both higher contrast and shorter noise correlation lengths at matched noise strength. Other penalties resulted in images with shorter noise correlation lengths at approximately matched contrast and noise strengths. Overall, PL reconstructions resulted in fewer background regions to be confused with tumors compared to OSEM, without compromising contrast and noise strength properties.

In contrast with Expectation Maximization (EM), the proposed technique does not rely on any space discretization. Namely, the activity distribution - normalized emission intensity of the spatial Poisson process - is considered as a spatial probability density and observations are the projections of random emissions whose distribution has to be estimated. This approach is nonparametric in the sense that the quantity of interest belongs to the set of probability measures on R-k (for reconstruction in k-dimensions) and it is Bayesian in the sense that we define a prior directly on this spatial measure and infer on the posterior distribution of the activity distribution. In this context, we propose to model the nonparametric probability density as an infinite mixture of multivariate normal distributions. As a prior for this mixture we consider a Dirichlet Process Mixture (DPM) with a Normal-Inverse Wishart (NIW) model as base distribution of the Dirichlet Process. As in EM-family reconstruction, we use a data augmentation scheme where the set of hidden variables are the emission locations in the continuous object space for each observed coincidence. Thanks to the data augmentation, we propose a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm (Gibbs sampler) which is able to generate draws from the posterior distribution of the spatial intensity. A difference with EM is that hidden variables involved in the Gibbs sampler correspond to generated emission locations while the number of emissions per pixel detected on a projection line is used for complete data in EM. Another key difference is that the estimated spatial intensity is a continuous function - such that there is no need to compute a projection matrix - while parameters in EM are given by the mean intensity per pixel. Finally, draws from the intensity posterior distribution allow the estimation of posterior functionals like the mean and variance or confidence intervals. The nonparametric behavior is characterized by an increase of DPM components (clusters) and consequently a resolution improvement with the number of recorded events. Results are presented for simulated data based on a 2D brain phantom and compared to ML-EM and Bayesian MAP-EM.

However, the EM algorithm largely depends on its initialization and can be easily trapped in local optima. This paper implements a Monte Carlo version of the EM algorithm that performs multiple sequence local alignment to overcome the drawbacks inherent in conventional EM motif-finding algorithms. The newly implemented algorithm is named as Monte Carlo EM Motif Discovery Algorithm (MCEMDA). MCEMDA starts from an initial model, and then it iteratively performs Monte Carlo simulation and parameter update steps until convergence. MCEMDA is compared with other popular motif-finding algorithms using simulated, prokaryotic and eukaryotic motif sequences. Results show that MCEMDA outperforms other algorithms. MCEMDA successfully discovers a helix-turn-helix motif in protein sequences as well. It provides a general framework for motif-finding algorithm development.

Such kind of data contains both spatial and temporal patterns that we desire to capture. The proposed methodology is based on regression and Gaussian mixture modeling and the novelty of the herein work is the incorporation of spatial smoothness constraints in the form of a prior for the data labels. This enables the proposed model to take into account the underlying property of spatiotemporal data that spatially adjacent data points most likely should belong to the same cluster. A maximum a posteriori Expectation Maximization (MAP-EM) algorithm is used for learning this model. We present numerical experiments with simulated data where the ground truth is known in order to assess the value of the introduced smoothness constraint, and also with real cardiac perfusion MRI data. The results are very promising and demonstrate the value of the proposed constraint for analysis of such data.

In particular, a classical approach and iterative techniques are compared in terms of estimation performance. The iterative techniques are based on the Expectation-Maximization approach and they exploit the soft a-posteriori data information delivered by the iterative decoder in order to aid the synchronization process.

We use joint angle and delay measurements of the emitted signals, impinging on an antenna array at different base stations (BSs). Contrary to previously reported work, our technique takes into account not only the measurement noise, but also multipath propagation and possible BSs reporting only non line of sight (NLOS) measurements. Data are processed using the maximum likelihood (ML) approach based on an implementation of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. We illustrate the proposed approach using simulated data.

During the last decade, the theory of hidden Markov models (HMMs) has been used successfully in the field of gait recognition. However the potentials of some new HMM extensions still need to be exploited. In this paper, a novel alternative gait modeling approach based on Factorial Hidden Markov Models (FHMMs) is proposed. FHNlMs are of a multiple layer structure and provide an interesting alternative to combining several features without the need of collapse them into a single augmented feature. We extracted irrelated features for different layers and iteratively trained its parameters through the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm and Viterbi algorithm. The exact Forward-Backward alaorithm is used in the E-step of EM algorithm. The performances of the proposed FHMM-based gait recognition method are evaluated using the CMU MoBo database and compared with that of HMMs based methods.

For some applications, further constraints may exist on the maximum lag at which the correlation function is non-zero and thereby giving rise to a band-Toeplitz covariance matrix. In this paper, an existing EM-algorithm for Toeplitz estimation is generalized to the case of band-Toeplitz estimation. In addition, the Cramer-Rao lower-bound for unbiased band-Toeplitz covariance matrix estimation is derived and through simulations it is shown that the proposed estimator achieves the bound for medium and large sample-sizes.

Recent results have shown that this novel approach provides an interesting way of introducing prior information in the position estimation and that the estimator is consistent for large sample sizes. However, one of the main drawbacks of this approach is the lack of a computationally efficient optimization algorithm due to the high dimensionality and nonlinearity of the resulting cost function, since there is not a closed form solution for this estimator. The aim of this paper is to investigate the application of the Space-Alternating Generalized Expectation Maximization (SAGE) algorithm to the estimation of position. The SAGE algorithm is a low-complexity generalization of the EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm, which iteratively approximates the MLE. Computer simulation results are provided, comparing the performance obtained by the algorithm with the Cramer-Rao Bound.

The proposed approach(1) dithers the transmit power of periodic ranging bursts by a known amount and then estimates the received difference in Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and uses this metric to indicate whether the operating point of the Power Amplifier is in the linear range or not. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm is used to achieve the ML estimate of the received SNR and is compared to the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB). Application of this algorithm to a commercial satellite broadband system as well as simplifications to the algorithm to make it easier for implementation on FPGAs, are also discussed.

The EM algorithm derived estimates the complex channel parameters of each subcarriers iteratively and generates the soft information representing the data a posterior probabilities. The soft information is then employed in a PIC module to detect the symbols efficiently. Moreover, the MAP-EM approach considers the channel variations as random processes and applies the Karhunen-Loeve (KL) orthogonal series expansion. The performance of the proposed approach are studied in terms of bit-error rate (BER) and mean square error (MSE). Throughout the simulations, extensive comparisons with previous works in literature are performed, showing that the new scheme can offer superior performance.

Competing risks for reliability analysis using Cox's model	ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS			English	Article						modelling; algorithmic languages; exponential distribution; reliability management	INCOMPLETE DATA; EM ALGORITHM; CARCINOGENESIS; LIKELIHOOD	Purpose - Cox's model with Weibull distribution and Cox's with exponential distribution are the most important models in reliability analysis. This paper seeks to show that, with a large sample size based on expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, both models give similar results. Design/methodology/approach - The parameters of the models have been estimated by method of maximum likelihood based on EM algorithm. The objective of this analysis is to fit the modification of Cox's model with Weibull distribution and Cox's with exponential distribution, examine its performance and compare their results with Crowder et al. Findings - A simulation study indicates that the parametric Cox's model with Weibull distribution gives similar results to Cox's with exponential distribution, especially for a large sample size. Also, the modification of the two models showed better results compared with Crowder et al., especially for the second causes of failure. Originality/value - A modification of the two competing risk models has mostly been applied in failure time data and simulation data. The results of the simulation study indicate that the Weibull and exponential are suitable for Cox's model as they are easy to use and it can achieve even higher accuracy compared with other distribution models.

There are two versions. 1. Single Group: Given a group of n sequences, find a length-l motif that appears in each of the given sequences and those occurrences of the motif are similar. 2. Two Groups: Given two groups of sequences B and G, find a length-1 (distinguishing) motif that appears in every sequence in B and does not appear in anywhere of the sequences in G. Here the occurrences of the motif in the given sequences have errors. Currently, most of existing programs can only handle the case of single group. Moreover, it is very difficult to use edit distance (allowing indels and replacements) for motif detection. Results: (1) We propose a randomized algorithm for the one group problem that can handle indels in the occurrences of the motif. (2) We give an algorithm for the two groups problem. (3) Extensive simulations have been done to evaluate the algorithms.

In this paper a novel algorithm has been introduced for multiple-instance learning. This method was inspired by both diverse density (DD) and its expectation maximization version (EM-DD). It converts MIL problem to a single-instance setting. This improved method has better accuracy and time complexity than DD and EM-DD. We apply it to drug activity prediction and image retrieval. The experiments show it has competitive accuracy values compared with other previous approaches.

BNs allow fast and efficient probabilistic reasoning. One of the key issues that researchers have faced in using a BN is determining its parameters and structure for a given problem. Many techniques have been developed for learning BN parameters from a given dataset pertaining to a particular problem. Most of the methods developed for learning BN parameters from partially observed data have evolved around the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. In its original form, EM algorithm is a deterministic iterative two-step procedure that converges towards the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates. The EM algorithm mainly focuses on learning BN parameters from imperfect data where some of the values are missing. However in many practical applications, partial observability results in a wider range of imperfections, e.g., uncertainties arising from incomplete, ambiguous, probabilistic, and belief theoretic data. Moreover, while convergence is to their ML estimates, the EM algorithm does not guarantee convergence to the underlying true parameters. In this paper, we propose an approach that enables one to learn BN parameters from a dataset containing a wider variety of imperfections. In addition, by introducing an early stopping criterion together with a new initialization method to the EM-algorithm, we show how the BN parameters could be learnt so that they are closer to the underlying true parameters than the converged ML estimated parameters.

We use the proposed algorithm for density estimation. The maximum-entropy constraint is imposed in order to ensure smoothness of the estimated density function. The exact derivation of the maximum-entropy expectation-maximization algorithm requires determination of the covariance matrix combined with the maximum entropy likelihood function, which is difficult to solve directly. We therefore introduce a new lower-bound for the EM algorithm derived by using the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality to obtain a suboptimal solution. We use the proposed algorithm for function interpolation and image segmentation. We propose the use of the EM algorithm for image recovery from randomly sampled data and signal reconstruction from randomly scattered sensors. We further propose to use our approach to maximum-entropy expectation-maximization (MEEM) in all of these applications. Computer simulation experiments are used to demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in comparison to existing methods.

Pixel intensity within a modality image is represented by a univariate Gaussian distribution mixture in which the components correspond to different segments. The proposed Multi-Modality Expectation-Maximization (MMEM) algorithm then estimates the probability of each segment along with parameters of the Gaussian distributions for each modality by maximum likelihood using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Multimodal images are simultaneously involved in the iterative parameter estimation step. Pixel classes are determined by maximising a posteriori probability contributed from all multimodal images. Experimental results show that the method exploits and fuses complementary information of multimodal images. Segmentation can thus be more precise than when using single-modality images.

Some applications may require the clustering of multiple related heterogeneous datasets where it may not be easy to compute a useful and effective integrated feature space. In this paper, we present an algorithm called CEMENT (Cluster Ensemble using Mutual ENTropy) to address the problem of clustering two related datasets where the datasets represent the same or overlapping sets of objects but use different feature sets. The algorithm takes the partitional clusters generated from two datasets as input and uses a constraint-based approach to generate a single set of clusters. CEMENT is an EM (expectation maximization) approach where the objective function is the mutual entropy between the two sets of clusters. The algorithm was applied to the problem of clustering a document collection consisting of journal abstracts from ten different Library of Congress categories. These documents were pre-processed using several NLP (natural language processing) steps to extract syntactic and semantic feature sets. We present empirical results and statistical tests showing that CEMENT yields higher quality clusters with this dataset than several baseline clustering approaches.

A Bayesian framework for iterative channel estimation and multiuser decoding in coded DS-CDMA	GLOBECOM 2007: 2007 IEEE GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-11	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (Globecom)		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM 07)	NOV 26-30, 2007	Washington, DC	IEEE				This paper deals with a novel design approach for a converging iterative receiver for coded CDMA that estimates both the channel coefficients and the transmitted symbols. The receiver design is based on the variational Bayesian space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (VB-SAGE) method. Conceptually, the probability distribution of each user's code sequence and the probability distribution of all channel coefficients are updated in an iterative fashion. The obtained receiver, which we refer to as VB-SAGE receiver, performs iterative channel estimation, interference cancellation and single-user decoding. Even though the design is based on code sequence probabilities, only the soft decisions (mean values) and the variances of the code symbols are required for channel estimation and interference cancellation; moreover, the variances are functions of the soft decisions. These soft decisions are computed by the single-user decoders based on the outputs of the interference cancellation device. The iterative process of the VB-SAGE receiver is guaranteed to converge in the free energy. The VB-SAGE method proposed in this paper may also be used for other applications.

Defending against Internet worms using a phase space method from chaos theory	DATA MINING, INTRUSION DETECTION, INFORMATION ASSURANCE, AND DATA NETWORKS SECURITY 2007	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Data Mining, Intrusion Detection, Information Assurance and Data Networks Security 2007	APR 10, 2007	Orlando, FL	SPIE		intrusion detection; internet worms; network security; phase space reconstruction; time delay embedding	DIRECT DYNAMICAL TEST; TIME-SERIES; DETERMINISTIC CHAOS	Enterprise networks are facing ever-increasing security threats from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, worms, viruses, intrusions, Trojans, port scans, and network misuses, and thus effective monitoring approaches to quickly detect these activities are greatly needed. In this paper, we employ chaos theory and propose an interesting phase space method to detect Internet worms. An Internet worm is a self-propagating program that automatically replicates itself to vulnerable systems and spreads across the Internet. Most deployed worm-detection systems are signature-based. They look for specific byte sequences (called attack signatures) that are known to appear in the attack traffic. Conventionally, the signatures are manually identified by human experts through careful analysis of the byte sequence from captured attack traffic. We propose to embed the traffic sequence to a high-dimensional phase space using chaos theory. We have observed that the signature sequence of a specific worm will occupy specific regions in the phase space, which may be appropriately called the invariant subspace of the worm. The invariant subspace of the worm separates itself widely from the subspace of the normal traffic. This separation allows us to construct three simple metrics, each of which completely separates 100 normal traffic streams from 200 worm traffic streams, without training in the conventional sense. Therefore, the method is at least as accurate as any existing methods. More importantly, our method is much faster than existing methods, such as based on expectation maximization and hidden Markov models.

We describe how a completely decentralized version of RML and EM can be implemented in dynamic graphical models through the propagation of suitable messages that are exchanged between neighboring nodes of the graph. The resulting algorithm can be interpreted as an extension of the celebrated Belief Propagation algorithm to compute likelihood gradients. This algorithm is applied to solve the sensor localization problem for sensor networks. An exact implementation is given for dynamic linear Gaussian models without loops.

This paper presents techniques that enable a talker tracking for effective human-robot interaction. We propose new way of integrating an EM algorithm and a particle filter to select an appropriate path for tracking the talker. It can easily adapt to new kinds of information for tracking the talker with our system. This is because our system estimates the position of the desired talker through means, variances, and weights calculated from EM training regardless of the numbers or kinds of information. In addition, to enhance a robot's ability to track a talker in real-world environments, we applied the particle filter to talker tracking after executing the EM algorithm. We also integrated a variety of auditory and visual information regarding sound localization, face localization, and the detection of lip movement. Moreover, we applied a sound classification function that allows our system to distinguish between voice, music, or noise. We also developed a vision module that can locate moving objects.

Due to computational limitations, however, it has been of a difficult problem to develop reconstruction algorithms with good. In this study, we propose efficient methods for implementing the OSEM (ordered-subsets expectation-maximization) algorithm for Compton camera reconstruction, and investigate three different schemes for grouping Compton scattered data into ordered subsets. The first is to group the data according to a pre-set order of scattering angles, the second is to group the possible combinations of detected position pairs in the scatterer and the absorber, and the third is to combine the first and second methods. According to our experimental results, all of the three grouping schemes exhibit similar performance in terms of the quantitative accuracy and computational efficiency. Our results show that the OSEM algorithm applied to the Compton camera provides an order improvement in speed of execution while retaining overall quality of the image reconstructed by the standard EM algorithm.

In our previous works, we have designed a dialog act recognition system for reservation applications in the Czech language. In this work, we propose to retrain this system on another corpus, for another task (broadcast news speech), in a different language (French) and with another set of dialog acts. This is realized using a semi-supervised approach based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We show that, in the proposed experimental setup, the use of confidence measures to filter out incorrectly recognized dialog acts is required to improve the results. Two confidence measures are thus proposed and evaluated on the French broadcast news corpus. Experimental results confirm the interest of this approach for the task of training automatic dialog act classifiers.

The classification rule is based on the comparison of the observed data logarithm probability density functions. To reduce the computational burden, the analysis is conducted in the context of a confirmatory factor analysis model with independent error measurements. Identification of the dichotomous and ordered categorical variables is discussed. Results are obtained by implementations of a Monte Carlo expectation maximization (MCEM) algorithm and a path sampling procedure. Probabilities of misclassification are estimated via the idea of the "jack-knife" method. A real example is given to illustrate the proposed method.

This paper proposes a model that represents person's daily behavior habit pattern. Firstly, a coordinate frame is defined on a map built by mobile service robot, and two key variables are calculated using consecutive data collected by the robot. Then, based on two key variables and the states that are defined in advance, the probability model is built. In order to learn the model efficiently, EM algorithm is applied. Experiment results demonstrate that the model is feasible to learn human behavior habit and can afford a judging gist to detect persons' unwonted behavior.

Collimator-detector response compensation in quantitative SPECT reconstruction	2007 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD, VOLS 1-11	IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM - CONFERENCE RECORD		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium/Medical Imaging Conference	OCT 26-NOV 03, 2007	Honolulu, HI	IEEE			IMAGES	The purpose of this study was to investigate the importance of collimator-detector response compensation in single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The compensation methods included in this study addressed there important degrading factors, which are attenuation, scatter and collimator-detector response (CDR). Geometric response (GR) and septal penetration (SP) are two most important component of collimator-detector response. The compensation work has been divided into two general categories: one is GR compensation based reconstruction (GR-RECON), which includes attenuation scatter and geometric response compensations, and the other one is GR-SP compensation based reconstruction (GR-SP-RECON which consists of attenuation, scatter geometric response and septal penetration compensations. Ordered-subset expectation maximization (OS-EM) method is applied as the reconstruction framework. SIMIND Monte Carlo (MC) code is incorporated in the forward projection. Multiple projection sampling convolution-based forced detection (MP-CFD) is used here to accelerate the MC code. The convolution kernels in CFD are generated by the ray-tracing (RT) method. In order to further increase the convergence speed, the mod of attenuation and collimator-detector response are included in the backprojection step. In order to assess the quantitative accuracy of the collimator-detector response compensation, the reconstruction images of cylinder, four different size spheres in various medium, and NURBS-based Cardiac-Torso (NCAT) phantom are evaluated using I-131 and high energy general resolution (HEGR) colli-mators. The reconstruction images including GR compensation appear very obvious collimator dependent Gibbs ringing artifact The quantitative estimation of the spheres and NURBS-based cardiac-torso (NCAT) phantom has denoted the high accuracy of GR-SP-RECON, whereas, a lot of quantitative activity will be mistakenly estimated in the background using GR-RECON.

Increasingly passive traffic measurement employs sampling at the packet level. Packet sampling has become an attractive and scalable means to measure flow data on high-speed links. However, knowing the number and length of the original flows is necessary for some applications. This paper provides a novel algorithm, Least Square Method(LSM), that uses flow statistics formed from sampled packet stream to infer the absolute frequencies of lengths of flows in the unsampled stream. The theoretical analysis shows that the computational complexity of this method is well under control, and the experiment results demonstrate the inferred distributions are as accurate as EM algorithm.

The implementation of the SAGE algorithm relies on the serial interference cancellation (SIC) technique which outperforms the conventional parallel interference cancellation (PIC) scheme when used in the frequency domain, especially in the common case of unequal power levels. The main purpose of our investigation has been twofold. Firstly, a synthetic environment was generated to testify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in a severe multipath indoor scenario. Secondly, a measurement campaign was conducted and the obtained data were post-processed in order to assess the whole double-directional domain. The results revealed that the proposed algorithm demonstrates a stable performance and robustness as well as rapid convergence which are the principal criteria an estimation technique must fulfill.

The basic procedure is to combine data-driven knowledge in the likelihood terms with clinical knowledge in the prior terms to classify an image into a pre-determined number of classes. In many applications, it is difficult to construct meaningful priors and, hence, homogeneous priors are assumed. In this paper, we show how expectation-maximization weights and neighboring posterior probabilities may be combined to make intuitive use of the Bayesian priors. Drawing upon insights from computer vision tracking algorithms, we cast the problem in a tissue tracking framework. We show results of our algorithm on the classification of gray and white matter along with surrounding cerebral spinal fluid in brain MRI scans. We show results of our algorithm on 20 brain MRI datasets along with validation against expert manual segmentations.

An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is utilized to find the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the channel and spatial noise covariance matrices, and to compute soft information of coded symbols which is sent to an error-control decoder. The extrinsic information produced by the decoder is then used to refine channel estimation. Several iterations are performed between the above channel estimation and decoding steps. We derive modified Cramer-Rao Bound (MCRB) for the unknown channel and noise parameters, and show that the proposed EM-based channel estimation scheme achieves the MCRB at medium and high SNRs. For a bit error rate of 10(-6) and long frame length, there is negligible performance difference between the proposed scheme and the ideal coherent detector that utilizes the true channel and noise covariance matrices.

This model encompasses the distance between different displays in seconds for different ways and/or different travel modes. It also shows how many people travel between displays in each direction. Thus, the model can be used to predict where and when people will appear next after showing up in front of one display. This can be used for example to create continuous 'shows' spanning multiple displays while people pass them. To create the model, we use Bluetooth connection data of mobile phones people carry, and employ the EM algorithm to estimate mean travel times for different paths people take.

This paper introduces a new unmixing method termed dependent component analysis (DECA). This method is blind and fully automatic and it overcomes the limitations of unmixing methods based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and on geometrical based approaches. DECA is based on the linear mixture model, i.e., each pixel is a linear mixture of the endmembers signatures weighted by the correspondent abundance fractions. These abundances are modeled as mixtures of Dirichlet densities, thus enforcing the non-negativity and constant sum constraints, imposed by the acquisition process. The endmembers signatures are inferred by a generalized expectation-maximization (GEM) type algorithm. The paper illustrates the effectiveness of DECA on synthetic and real hyperspectral images.

Generative models represent homogeneously all relevant variables in a specific domain by a joint probability distribution. The proposed model explicitly represents the image formation process (including possible brightness transforms between images or registration errors) and is invariant to affine changes in pixel intensities or small georegistration errors. There are several benefits from such theoretical formulation: all the modeling assumptions are explicit and the method to solve the change detection problem is not intrinsic to the formulation. The use of probabilistic models also leads to sound and well-known statistical techniques for problems like parameter estimation or regularization. The experimental results confirm the validity of the approach.

Specifically, the localization problem is to determine the location of a client device accurately given the radio signal strength values received at the client device from multiple beacon sensors or access points. Conventional data mining and machine learning methods can be applied to solve this problem. However, all of them require large amounts of labeled training data, which can be quite expensive. In this paper. we propose a probabilistic semi-supervised learning approach to reduce the calibration effort and increase the tracking accuracy. Our method is based on semi-supervised conditional random fields which can enhance the learned model from a small set of training data with abundant unlabeled data effectively. To make our method more efficient, we exploit a Generalized EM algorithm coupled with domain constraints. We validate our method through extensive experiments in a real sensor network using Crossbow MICA2 sensors. The results demonstrate the advantages of methods compared to other state-of-the-art object-tracking algorithms.

Segmentation methods used so far include 'Adaptive Image Thresholding', 'Hysteresis Thresholding', 'Edge Detection' (see [1] and references therein) and entropy methods like the 'Maximum Descriptive Length' technique [2]. This paper extends and generalizes a previously proposed Bayesian semi-supervised segmentation algorithm [3] oriented to oil spill detection using SAR images. In the base algorithm on which we build on, the data term is modeled by a finite mixture of Gamma distributions, with a given predefined number of components, for modeling each one of two classes (oil and water). To estimate the parameters of the class conditional densities, an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm was developed. The prior is an M-level logistic (MLL) Markov Random Field enforcing local continuity in a statistical sense. The methodology proposed in [3] assumes two classes and known smoothness parameter. The present work removes these restrictions. The smoothness parameter controlling the degree of homogeneity imposed on the scene is automatically estimated and the number of used classes is optional. To extend the algorithm to an optional number of classes, the so-called a-expansion algorithm [4] has been implemented. This algorithm is a graph-cut based technique that finds efficiently (polynomial complexity) the local minimum of the energy, (i.e, a labeling) within a known factor of the global minimum. In order to estimate the smoothness parameter of the MLL prior, two different techniques have been tested, namely the Least Squares (LS) Fit and the Coding Method (CD) [5]. Semi-automatic estimation of the class parameters is also implemented. This represents an improvement over the base algorithm [3], where parameter estimation is performed on a supervised way by requesting user defined regions of interest representing the water and the oil. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated with simulated SAR images and real ERS and ENVISAT images.

We address the problem of analysis of transient time-course data of expression profiles. We accept the assumption that co-expression of genes can be related to their belonging to the same Gaussian component. We assume that parameters of Gaussian components, means and variances, can differ between time instants. However, the gene composition of components is unchanged between time instants. For such problem formulations we derive the appropriate version of expectation-maximization algorithm recursions for the estimation of model parameters. We apply the derived method to the data on gene expression profiles of human K562 erythroleukemic cells and we discuss the obtained gene clustering.

The problem of text separation takes a different dimension when the input image is a color image. In the present study, a new statistical mixture model, namely, a mixture of multivariate Beta distributions is proposed to approximate the distributions of the spectral features of pixels in a color document image. An unsupervised algorithm, based on Expectation Maximization framework, for learning the parameters of a multivariate Beta mixture distribution is presented. Individual components of the mixture correspond to different colors present in the image. Color clustering is performed on the basis of maximum a posterior probabilities. After color clustering, a geometric analysis for elongatedness is done on each connected component of each cluster. Based on the degree of elongatedness of a connected. component, the text portion is identified and extracted. A comparison is made between results obtained with Beta, and Gaussian mixture models.

First, we apply a median filter to each CT image and align four-phase CT images by performing non-rigid volumetric image registration. Then, a three-dimensional joint histogram of CT values is computed from three-phase (early-, portal-, and late-) CT images. We assume that this histogram is a mixture of normal distributions corresponding to the liver, spleen, kidney, vein, artery, muscle, and bone regions. The EM algorithm is employed to estimate each normal distribution. Organ labels are assigned to each voxel using the mahalanobis distance measure. Connected component analysis is applied to correct the shape of each organ region. After that, the pancreas region is extracted from non-contrasted CT images in which other extracted organs and vessel regions are excluded. The EM algorithm is also employed for estimating the distribution of CT values inside the pancreas. We applied this method to seven cases of four-phase CT images. Extraction results show that the proposed method extracted multi-organs satisfactorily.

J	Seltzer, ML; Acero, A				Seltzer, Michael L.; Acero, Alex			Training wideband acoustic models using mixed-bandwidth training data for speech recognition	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING			English	Article						acoustic modeling; bandwidth extension; hidden Markov models (HMMs); speech recognition; telephone speech		One serious difficulty in the deployment of wideband speech recognition systems for new tasks is the expense in both time and cost of obtaining sufficient training data. A more economical approach is to collect telephone speech and then restrict the application to operate at the telephone bandwidth. However, this generally results in suboptimal performance compared to a wideband recognition system. In this paper, we propose a novel expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm in which wideband acoustic models are trained using a small amount of wideband speech and a larger amount of narrowband speech. We show how this algorithm can be incorporated into the existing training schemes of hidden Markov model (HMM) speech recognizers. Experiments performed using wideband speech and telephone speech demonstrate that the proposed mixed-bandwidth training algorithm results in significant improvements in recognition accuracy over conventional training strategies when the amount of wideband data is limited.

By using a set of sufficient statistics associated with a partitioning of the training data, as in parallel EM, the algorithm has the same order of computational requirements as the original EM algorithm. Analyses using a GMM with artificial data show the proposed algorithm is more robust for overtraining than the conventional EM algorithm. Large vocabulary recognition experiments on Mandarin broadcast news data show that the method makes better use of more parameters and gives lower recognition error rates than EM training.

The proposed method is based on a multi layer stochastic framework whose parameters are learned in an offline training procedure using the well known expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The color correction algorithm functions by first making soft assignments of images into defect classes and then processing images in each defect class with an optimized algorithm, which we refer to as resolution synthesis-based color correction (RSCC). The parameters of the color correction algorithm are trained using pairs of low quality images, obtained from real cell phone cameras, and high quality spatially registered reference images, captured with a high quality digital still camera. We present experimental results comparing the performance of our method to some existing commercial color correction algorithms.

To change the situation and improve the learning behavior of ANFIS, in this paper we propose a new self-adaptive learning algorithm for ANFIS differently from conventional training methods. The method firstly adopts the EM algorithm to learning fuzzy parameters of the ANFIS, and then applies emotion learning to learn the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) parameters of the linear TSK functions of the ANFIS. The relevant researches indicate that the proposed learning method possesses faster training speed and better adaptability, and is more ubiquitous. In the end, a simulation example shows the availability of the proposed method.

When using the tree edit distance, we need to determine the cost of each operation, but this is a labor-intensive and highly skilled task. This paper proposes an algorithm for learning the costs of tree edit operations from training data consisting of pairs of similar trees. To formalize the cost learning problem, we define a probabilistic model for tree alignment that is a variant of tree edit distance. Then, the parameters Of the model are estimated using the expectation maximization (EM) technique. In. this paper, we develop an algorithm for parameter learning that is polynomial in time (O (mn(2)d(6))) and space (O(n(2)d(4))) where n, d, and m represent the size of the trees, the maximum degree of trees, and the number of training pairs of trees, respectively.

They are of low efficiency because EM algorithm has to perform iterative process of probability reasoning to complete the incomplete data. In this paper we present an efficient BN learning algorithm, which use the combination of EMI method and a scoring function based on mutual information theory. The algorithm first uses EMI method to estimate, from incomplete data, probability distributions over local structures of BNs, then evaluates BN structures with the scoring function and searches for the best one. The detailed procedure of the algorithm is depicted in the paper. The experimental results on Asia and Alarm networks show that when achieving high accuracy, the algorithm is much more efficient than two EM based algorithms, SEM and EM-EA algorithms.

Contourlet transform is a new "true" two-dimension presentation for images which provided a flexible multiresolution, anisotropy and directional expansion. The coefficients of contourlets can be accurately modeled by Gaussian mixture model. This approach is based on an image formation model which the contourlet coefficients of multi-band SAR images are described as the true scene corrupted by Gaussian mixture distortion. A set of iterative equations are developed using the Expectation Maximization(EM) algorithm to estimate the model parameters and produce the fused images. The efficiency of this approach is verified by fusing the Ku, X bands and L, Ku bands SAR images. Also, some statistical factors are employed for evaluating the objective quality of the fused result.

The fluorescent spectrum is typically stationary with respect to the excitation frequency induced by the instrument, while the Raman spectrum is subject to a nonlinear shift which depends explicitly and in a known manner upon the excitation frequency. This phenomenon has been exploited to reconstruct Raman spectra indirectly by subtracting spectra observed at two closely spaced excitation frequencies. The technique, known as Shifted Excitation Raman Difference Spectroscopy (SERDS), is of limited utility, however, in that observations with low photon counts are difficult to process accurately, and that one must still reconstruct the spectrum from the estimate of the derivative. This paper presents an innovative alternative approach to Raman spectrum reconstruction based on an expectation-maximization algorithm and multiresolution photon-limited signal analysis. Using this method, it is shown that using multiple excitation frequencies (while keeping the total excitation laser power and total expected photon counts constant) can result in dramatic improvements in reconstruction accuracy.

In this paper a method of image segmentation for human gesture analysis in multi-camera networks is presented. Aiming to employ manifold sources of visual information provided by the network, an opportunistic fusion framework is described and incorporated in the proposed method for gesture analysis. A 3D human body model is employed as the converging point of spatiotemporal and feature fusion. It maintains both geometric parameters of the human posture and the adaptively learned appearance attributes, all of which are updated from the three dimensions of space, time and features of the opportunistic fusion. In sufficient confidence levels parameters of the 3D human body model are again used as feedback to aid subsequent vision analysis. The 3D human body model also serves as an intermediate level for gesture interpretation in different applications. The image segmentation method described in this paper is part of the gesture analysis problem. It aims to reduce raw visual data in a single camera to concise descriptions for more efficient communication between cameras. Color distribution registered in the model is used to initialize segmentation. Perceptually Organized Expectation Maximization (POEM) is then applied to refine color segments with observations from a single camera. Finally ellipse fitting is used to parameterize segments. Experimental results for segmentation are illustrated. Some examples for skeleton fitting based on the elliptical segments will also be shown to demonstrate motivation and capability of the model-based segmentation approach for multi-view human gesture analysis.

The design is based on the insertion of known pilots into the time-frequency OFDM grid in a controlled cyclic fashion to exploit time diversity in the pilot tones without consuming additional bandwidth resource. Semi-blind iterative detection based on Me expectation-maximization algorithm along with optimum combining is employed at the receiver. Despite moderately increased transceiver complexity, simulations show that the proposed design has superior error rate performance compared to conventional PSACE methods for the same pilot overhead.

A Combined PMHT and IMM Approach to Multiple-Point Target Tracking in Infrared Image Sequence	EURASIP JOURNAL ON IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING			English	Article							MANEUVERING TARGETS; MULTITARGET TRACKING; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; INCOMPLETE DATA; RADAR TRACKING; KALMAN FILTER; ALGORITHM; SENSORS	Data association and model selection are important factors for tracking multiple targets in a dense clutter environment. In this paper, we provide an effective solution to the tracking of multiple single-pixel maneuvering targets in a sequence of infrared images by developing an algorithm that combines a sequential probabilistic multiple hypothesis tracking (PMHT) and interacting multiple model (IMM). We explicitly model maneuver as a change in the target's motion model and demonstrate its effectiveness in our tracking application discussed in this paper. We show that inclusion of IMM enables tracking of any arbitrary trajectory in a sequence of infrared images without any a priori special information about the target dynamics. IMM allows us to incorporate different dynamic models for the targets and PMHT helps to avoid the uncertainty about the observation origin. It operates in an iterative mode using expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed algorithm uses observation association as missing data. Copyright (C) 2007 Mukesh A. Zaveri et al.

In this paper, spectrum estimation is posed as an image reconstruction problem and the classical expectation maximization method (EM) for emission computed tomography is used to reconstruct the spectrum from transmission data. And we propose to compute the initial value for the EM iteration using Monte Carlo calculations. Numerical simulations were carried out to test the accuracy and robustness of the method. Experiments were conducted on an experimental CT system to evaluate the practicability of the algorithm. Both the simulations and experiments show that the proposed method can always produce a spectrum which fits the transmission data accurately and exhibits a rational shape.

We are developing a computer-aided detection (CAD) system to assist radiologist in PE detection in CTPA images. 3D multiscale filters in combination with a newly designed response function derived from the eigenvalues of Hessian matrices is used to enhance vascular structures including the vessel bifurcations and suppress non-vessel structures such as the lymphoid tissues surrounding the vessels. A hierarchical EM estimation is then used to segment the vessels by extracting the high response voxels at each scale. The segmented vessels are pre-screened for suspicious PE areas using a second adaptive multiscale EM estimation. A rule-based false positive (FP) reduction method was designed to identify the true PEs based on the features of PE and vessels. 43 CTPA scans were used as an independent test set to evaluate the performance of PE detection. Experienced chest radiologists identified the PE locations which were used as "gold standard". 435 PEs were identified in the artery branches, of which 172 and 263 were subsegmental and proximal to the subsegmental, respectively. The computer-detected volume was considered true positive (TP) when it overlapped with 10% or more of the gold standard PE volume. Our preliminary test results show that, at an average of 33 and 24 FPs/case, the sensitivities of our PE detection method were 81% and 78%, respectively, for proximal PEs, and 79% and 73%, respectively, for subsegmental PEs. The study demonstrates the feasibility that the automated method can identify PE accurately on CTPA images. Further study is underway to improve the sensitivity and reduce the FPs.

In this paper, we propose a novel statistical approach based on expectation-maximization ( EM) method to learn the parameters of a classifier for EEG-based cursor control. To train a classifier for continuous prediction, trials in training data-set are first divided into segments. The difficulty is that the actual intention ( label) at each time interval ( segment) is unknown. To handle the uncertainty of the segment label, we treat the unknown labels as the hidden variables in the lower bound on the log posterior and maximize this lower bound via an EM-like algorithm. Experimental results have shown that the averaged accuracy of the proposed method is among the best. Copyright (C) 2007 Hindawi Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved.

If the heterogeneous susceptibility is ignored or inappropriately handled, we may either fail to detect the responsible genetic factors or find spuriously significant locations. In this article, an interval mapping method based on parametric mixture cure models is proposed, which takes into consideration of nonsusceptible subjects. The proposed model can be used to detect the QTL that are responsible for differential susceptibility and/or time-to-event trait distribution. In particular, we propose a likelihood-based testing procedure with genome-wide significance levels calculated using a resampling method.

Identification, segmentation, and image property study of acute infarcts in diffusion-weighted images by using a probabilistic neural network and adaptive Gaussian mixture model	ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY			English	Article						infarct; diffusion; segmentation; Gaussian mixture model; artifact; stroke	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; EM ALGORITHM; MR-IMAGES; CLASSIFICATION; VOLUME	Rationale and Objectives. Accurate identification of infarcted regions of the brain is critical in management of stroke patients. An efficient and fast method for identification and segmentation of infarcts in the diffusion-weighted images (DWI) is proposed. Materials and Methods. Thirteen stroke patients were studied. DWI scans were acquired with a slice thickness of 5 mm. We have used a probabilistic neural network for selecting infarct slices and an adaptive (two-level) Gaussian mixture model for segmentation of the infarcts. Statistical analysis, such as identification of distribution, first-order statistics calculation, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, was performed. Results. The average dice index is about 0.6, and average sensitivity and specificity are about 81% and 99%, respectively. The value of sensitivity and dice index are influenced by the number of false positives and false negatives. Because artifacts and infarcts have similar imaging characteristics, it is difficult to completely eliminate the artifacts. The accuracy of localization is nearly 100% as there were only two false-positive and three false-negative slices of all 381 slices. The algorithm takes about 1 minute in the Matlab computing environment to process a volume. Conclusion. A method to localize and segment the acute brain infarcts is proposed. The method aids the clinician in reducing the time needed to localize and segment the infarcts. The speed of localization and segmentation can be enhanced further by implementing the algorithm in VC++ and using fast algorithms for selection of Gaussian mixture model parameters.

Diffusion driven reconstruction for positron emission tomography	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							EM ALGORITHM	Reconstruction map of the radionucleus distribution in positron emission tomography imaging is an ill-posed inverse problem. Existing reconstruction methodologies based on maximum a posteriori principle reconstruct images that suffer from artifacts. A method is proposed for generating better map of radionucleus distribution primarily based on surface diffusion model. The mean curvature diffusion has resulted in efficient noise suppression when applied to an isolated edge embedded in noise. Experimental results show that the proposed approach has better image resolution and edge-preservation capability. The reconstruction methodology will therefore find applications in biomedical imaging and bioengineering.

J	Kim, NK; Xie, J				Kim, Nak-Kyeong; Xie, Jun			Protein multiple alignment incorporating primary and secondary structure information	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Gibbs sampling; likelihood function; protein sequence motifs; secondary structures; segment overlap	SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; BAYESIAN MODELS; EM ALGORITHM; PREDICTION; ACCURACY; PROGRAMS; DATABASE; IDENTIFICATION; MATRICES; MOTIFS	Identifying common local segments, also called motifs, in multiple protein sequences plays an important role for establishing homology between proteins. Homology is easy to establish when sequences are similar (sharing an identity > 25%). However, for distant proteins, it is much more difficult to align motifs that are not similar in sequences but still share common structures or functions. This paper is a first attempt to align multiple protein sequences using both primary and secondary structure information. A new sequence model is proposed so that the model assigns high probabilities not only to motifs that contain conserved amino acids but also to motifs that present common secondary structures. The proposed method is tested in a structural alignment database BAliBASE. We show that information brought by the predicted secondary structures greatly improves motif identification.

J	Caudill, SB				Caudill, Steven B.			A logit model with missing information illustrated by testing for hidden unemployment in transition economies	OXFORD BULLETIN OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS			English	Article								In an important paper, Dempster, Laird and Rubin (1977) showed how the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm could be used to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of parameters in a multinomial probability model with missing information. This article extends Dempster, Laird and Rubin's work on the EM algorithm to the estimation of a multinomial logit model with missing information on category membership. We call this new model the latent multinomial logit (LMNL) model. A constrained version of the LMNL model is used to examine the issue of hidden unemployment in transition economies following the approach of Earle and Sakova (2000). We found an additional 0.5% hidden unemployment among workers describing themselves as self-employed in the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe.

J	Ghosh, D				Ghosh, Debashis			Finding cancer subtypes in microarray data using random projections	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						expectation-maximization algorithm; gene expression data; high-dimensional data; mixture models	GENE-EXPRESSION PROFILES; MODEL; NORMALIZATION; CLUSTERS; PATTERNS; NUMBER	One of the benefits of profiling cancer samples using microarrays is the generation of molecular fingerprints that will define subtypes of disease. Such subgroups have typically been found in microarray data using hierarchical clustering. A major problem in the interpretation of the output is determining the number of clusters. We approach the problem of determining disease subtypes using mixture models. A novel estimation procedure for the parameters in the mixture model is developed based on a combination of random projections and the expectation-maximization algorithm. Because the approach is probabilistic, our method provides a measure for the number of true clusters in a given dataset. We illustrate our proposal with applications to both simulated and real microarray data. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Panel count data commonly arise in clinical trials and demographical studies where the response variable is the number of multiple recurrences of the event of interest and observation times are not fixed, varying from subject to subject. It is assumed that two processes exist in this data: the first is for a recurrent event and the second is for observation time. Many studies have been done to estimate mean function and regression parameters under the independency between recurrent event process and observation time process. In this article, the same statistical inference is studied, but the situation where these two processes may be related is also considered. The mixed Poisson process is applied for the recurrent event processes, and a frailty intensity function for the observation time is also used, respectively. Simulation studies are conducted to study the performance of the suggested methods. The bladder tumor data are applied to compare previous studie' results.

To prevent this, new biological therapies, such as infliximab, have been successfully developed. The present analysis is based on an expanded access program in which 511 RA patients with chronic refractory disease were treated with infliximab. They received a standard dose of 3 mg/kg on weeks 0, 2, 6, 14 and every 8 weeks thereafter. On week 22, the treating rheumatologist evaluated the situation of every patient and decided whether the current dose should be increased or not. This decision can be considered as a measure of insufficient response. In the present analysis, 3 machine-learning classification techniques-the self-organizing map (SOM), multilayered perceptron (MLP) and support vector machine (SVM)-are implemented to model the decision to give a dose increase. Their performance on increasingly multivariate real-life data will be studied and compared to classical statistics-linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and logistic regression (LR). Results show that the SOM is an excellent tool for data visualization but not for classification. All the remaining methods show good classification performance, if configured well. However, as the number of features increases, the performance decreases. The SVM suffers to a lesser degree from this curse of dimensionality. Expectation maximization (EM) comes out as a good method to cope with missing values in such real-life data. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper will therefore explore such a design, and through which a heuristic extended Expectation-Maximization (X-EM) algorithm is presented accordingly. Unlike the EM algorithm [1], the X-EM algorithm is able to perform model selection by fading the redundant components out from a density mixture, meanwhile estimating the model parameters appropriately. The numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm.

J	Chen, YH				Chen, YH			Computationally efficient Monte Carlo EM algorithms for generalized linear mixed models	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION			English	Article						Gauss-Hermite quadrature; Monte Carlo integration; random effects model; Salamander data	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; BIAS CORRECTION; COMPONENTS; DISPERSION	Maximum likelihood estimation in generalized linear mixed models usually involves intractable integrals that may be of high dimension. To reduce the dimensions of the integrals involved in computation, a reduced form of the score equation obtained by exploiting conditional independence and random effects structures can be used. Two Monte Carlo methods, one based on direct Monte Carlo integration and the other based on a stochastic version of the Gauss - Hermite quadrature, are proposed for approximating the integrals involved in the reduced score equation. The proposed Monte Carlo EM algorithms need to simulate random effects only in the first iteration; hence, the computation burden can be reduced and the likelihood that the increasing property of the original EM algorithm can be preserved. A reduced form of the information matrix is proposed for standard error estimation. We illustrate the proposed methods with an application to the salamander data and examine their performance via simulation studies.

J	Hu, ZQ; Wang, XF; Xu, CW				Hu, Zhiqiu; Wang, Xuefeng; Xu, Chenwu			A method for identification of the expression mode and mapping of QTL underlying embryo-specific characters	JOURNAL OF HEREDITY			English	Article							QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; TRIPLOID ENDOSPERM TRAITS; BRASSICA-NAPUS L; SEED DEVELOPMENT; HIGH-RESOLUTION; RICE; SIZE; ARABIDOPSIS; LIKELIHOOD; PROTEIN	Embryos of crop seeds are one of the major sources of the plant protein and lipid for human nutrition. The genetic expression for embryo-specific characters in crop seeds can be controlled exclusively by the embryo or the maternal genotypes and sometimes by both simultaneously. However, current methods for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) underlying characters of maternal plants have not been effective in dealing with the QTL analysis of embryo characters. On the basis of the expression feature of embryo, a statistical method was proposed for the identification of expression mode and mapping of QTL controlling embryo traits. The maximum likelihood method implemented via the expectation maximization algorithm was used to estimate parameters of a putative embryo-specific QTL. The QTL expression mode was identified by the likelihood ratio test statistic. Statistical power and other properties of the proposed method were investigated under a variety of scenarios through simulation studies. The results showed that the mapping method neglecting the effects of embryo genotype or maternal effects could neither identify the expression mode of QTL nor estimate its genetic effects accurately, whereas the proposed method could effectively map the embryo-specific QTL of various expression modes.

Spatial prediction with left-censored observations	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS			English	Article						geostatistics; minimum detection limits; Robbins-Monro algorithm; sulfate	WATER-QUALITY DATA; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; REGRESSION-MODELS; EM ALGORITHM; LIFE-TABLES; COVARIANCE; EXISTENCE; PROGRAM	Environmental monitoring of contaminants often involves left-censored observations falling below the minimum detection limits (MDLs) of the instruments used to assay their concentrations. Statistical procedures for handling left-censored observations generally assume that the observations are independently distributed. However, data collected over a spatial network of sample sites are likely to be spatially correlated. This correlation structure can be exploited to obtain improved imputations of left-censored observations, and hence improved estimates of environmental parameters. This article applies a Robbins-Monro algorithm for estimating the parameters of a spatial regression model. This algorithm uses importance sampling to obtain conditional simulations of left-censored observations. A predictor for data at unsampled sites is obtained by taking the weighted mean of kriging predictors computed from independent importance samples. The proposed methods are illustrated using data from the South Florida Ecosystem Assessment Project.

Multicast based inference of link-loss rates is the first paradigm for the approach. Existing algorithms generally require numerical solution of polynomial equations for a maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE), or iteration when applying the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The purpose of this note is to demonstrate a new estimator for link-loss rates that is computationally simple, being an explicit function of the measurements, and that has the same asymptotic variance as the MLE, to first order in the link-loss rates.

The approach combines the GMM-based feature compensation and the HMM-based feature compensation together and employs the multiple recognition passes to achieve the best performance. In the initial recognition procedure, the GMM-based feature compensation approach is employed to give better clean model and noise model. Then we further refine these models by employing the HMM-based feature compensation approach. The statistical model of the clean speech and the noise is combined by using vector Taylor series(VTS) approximation. The experimental results show that the novel approach makes a significant improvement compared to the GMM-based feature compensation and the HMM-based feature compensation without any compensation in the initial pass.

When data are missing completely at random in a multivariate setup, it is shown that information in a single observation is well-defined and it plays the same role as in the complete-data model in characterizing the first-order asymptotic optimality properties of associated maximum likelihood estimators; computational aspects are also thoroughly appraised. As an illustration, the logistic regression model with incomplete binary responses and an incomplete categorical covariate is worked out. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	El-Mahdy, AE; Namazi, NM				El-Mahdy, AE; Namazi, NM			Turbo equalisation of time varying multipath channel under class-A impulsive noise	IEE PROCEEDINGS-COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							FADING CHANNELS	The paper explores the problem of turbo equalisation and channel estimation under class-A impulsive noise. The channel is a frequency selective fading channel in which its time varying coefficients are expanded into a finite number of basis sequences and time invariant (TI) expansion parameters. Instead of the application of a maximum likelihood (ML) approach in its standard form, the proposed channel estimator is performed by an iterative approach based on the expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm and the steepest descent algorithm. The proposed estimator reduces the complexity of computations resulting from direct application of the ML approach and provides significant performance gain over the algorithms which are efficient in white Gaussian noise. Also, the proposed estimator is suitable for class-A impulsive noise and utilises the soft information obtained from the soft output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA) which is derived under class-A impulsive noise.

We show that the response variable conditional on the error-prone covariate follows a complex transition mixed effects model. The naive model obtained by ignoring the measurement error correctly specifies the transition part of the model, but misspecifies the covariate effect structure and ignores the random effects. We next study the asymptotic bias in naive estimator obtained by ignoring the measurement error for both continuous and discrete outcomes. We show that the naive estimator of the regression coefficient of the error-prone covariate is attenuated, while the naive estimators of the regression coefficients of the past responses are generally inflated. We then develop a structural modeling approach for parameter estimation using the maximum likelihood estimation method. In view of the multidimensional integration required by full maximum likelihood estimation, an EM algorithm is developed to calculate maximum likelihood estimators, in which Monte Carlo simulations are used to evaluate the conditional expectations in the E-step. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method through a simulation study and apply it to a longitudinal social support study for elderly women with heart disease. An additional simulation study shows that the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) performs well in choosing the correct transition orders of the models.

J	Selivanov, VV; Lepage, MD; Lecomte, R				Selivanov, Vitali V.; Lepage, Martin D.; Lecomte, Roger			List-mode image reconstruction for real-time PET imaging	JOURNAL OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION AND IMAGE REPRESENTATION			English	Article						positron emission tomography; tomographic reconstruction; list mode; iterative algorithms; regularized pseudo-inverse matrix; truncated singular value decomposition	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; EM ALGORITHM; 3-DIMENSIONAL RECONSTRUCTION; LIKELIHOOD; DECOMPOSITION; QUALITY; SYSTEM; TOFPET	The problem of tomographic image reconstruction from measured projection data can be reduced to solving a set of linear equations represented in matrix form. In this paper, we show how image reconstruction in positron emission tomography (PET) can be achieved potentially in real-time using a regularized pseudo-inverse of the system matrix. An update of the current image estimate accounting for the next registered event can be obtained using a single column of the regularized pseudo-inverse matrix, thus allowing for instant visualization of the radioactivity distribution while the subject is still being scanned. The computed image estimate is the minimum-norm least-squares solution of the regularized inverse problem. The speed and performance of the algorithm were characterized and compared to those of a well-known statistical iterative algorithm. The proposed algorithm was validated with experimental list-mode PET data. (C) 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Then the parameters of each component can be estimated by the sequential importance sampling and Kalman filtering. In comparison with other similar receivers, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves the desirable performance with a significantly reduced computational complexity.

The model quantifies the effect of the lagging sound over the angular position and the width of the perceived auditory event, and incorporates some well-known aspects of the precedence effect in a single framework. Two sound source localisation experiments were carried out in order to show the utility of the proposed model. In the first experiment, the localisation accuracy for single sound sources was measured. In the second experiment, the subjects localised spectrally coherent lead-lag stimulus pairs with different angular separations. The responses were analysed using the proposed model. It is shown that the model can be used for assessing the fusion, localisation dominance, and the lag discrimination suppression aspects of the precedence effect as well as the associated widening of the auditory event.

For example, in mixtures of exponentials, the methods usually proposed fail. Based on a discretization which is adapted to the data points, a method for maximizing the gradient is suggested. The method is implemented in different gradient-based algorithms; a comparison shows that on mixtures of exponentials, the ISDM algorithm introduced by Lesperance and Kalbfleisch is much faster than its competitors.

We create the colour-based texture features by applying Complex Wavelet Transform over a L*u*v* representation of the colour image. In order to determine the number of regions on the image, a Silhouette algorithm is used. Once the number of regions are known, the method selects the more discriminative features for the classification. A Gaussian Mixture Model GMM is performed as a classification process.

This approach builds a model fitting some dynamical features deduced from the learning sample. These features are discrete phase-type (PH) distributions. They model the first passage times (FPT) between occurrences of pairs of substrings. The PHit algorithm, an adapted version of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, is proposed to estimate PH distributions. The most informative pairs of substrings are selected according to the Jensen-Shannon divergence between their class conditional empirical FPT distributions. The selected features are then used in two classification schemes: a maximum a posteriori (MAP) classifier and support vector machines (SVM) with marginalized kernels. Experiments on DNA splicing region detection and on protein sublocalization illustrate that the proposed techniques offer competitive results with smoothed Markov chains or SVM with a spectrum string kernel.

The main characteristic of our approach is to use a stochastic approximation algorithm to approximate the conditional expectation of the complete-data sufficient statistic rather than the unknown parameter itself. Compared to existing approaches, the new algorithm requires no analytical gradient or Hessian computation, it deals with parameter constraints straightforwardly and the resulting estimate can be shown to be Fisher-efficient in general settings. This approach is illustrated on the classic direction of arrival (DOA) model.

This paper mainly discusses semi-supervised classification based on CPN (Counter-propagation Network). CPN and its revised models have merits such as simple structure, fast training and high accuracy. Especially, its training scheme combines supervised learning and unsupervised learning, which makes it very conformable to be extended to semi-supervised classification problem. According to the characteristics of CPN, we propose a semi-supervised dynamic CPN, and compare it with other two semi-supervised CPN models using Expectation Maximization and Co-Training/Self-Training techniques respectively. The experimental results show the effectiveness of CPN based semi-supervised classification methods.

Explicit solutions are given for MIMO channel estimation with Gaussian prior and noise covariance estimation with inverse-Wishart prior. Simulation of a GSM-like system provides empirical proof that the VBEM-algorithm is able to provide better performance than the EM-algorithm. However, if the posterior distribution is highly peaked, the VBEM-algorithm approaches the EM-algorithm and the gain disappears. The potential gain is therefore greatest in systems with a small amount of observations compared to the number of parameters to be estimated.

It is a special case of the RBF network, and constitutes a generalization of the Gaussian mixture model. We propose an incremental method for semi-supervised learning based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Then we present an active learning method that iteratively applies the semi-supervised method for learning the labeled and unlabeled observations concurrently, and then employs a suitable criterion to select an unlabeled observation and query its label. The proposed criterion selects points near the decision boundary, and facilitates the incremental semi-supervised learning that also exploits the decision boundary. The performance of the algorithm in experiments using well-known data sets is promising.

Wald type statistics are considered which are asymptotically distributed according to the chi-square distribution. The statistics are based on maximum likelihood, corrected score approach, and method of moment estimators of the model parameters, which are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. Results of analytical and simulation studies seem to indicate that the Wald statistics based on the method of moment estimators and the corrected score estimators are, as expected, less efficient than the Wald type statistic based on the maximum likelihood estimators for small n. Wald statistic based on moment estimators are simpler to compute than the other Wald statistics tests and their performance improves significantly as n increases. Comparisons with an alternative F statistics proposed in the literature are also reported.

MLEM, however, is computationally intensive. Single-processor image reconstruction times for each breast were on the order of several hours. In order for DBT to be clinically useful, faster reconstruction times using cost-effective software/hardware solutions are needed. We have implemented the MLEM reconstruction algorithm for use with DBT on a graphics processing unit (GPU). Compared to a single optimized 2.8GHz Pentium system this enabled a 113-fold speedup in processing time, while maintaining high image quality. Subsequently, we added various additional processing steps to the reconstruction algorithm in order to improve image quality and diagnostic properties. Since the performance of commercial GPUs increases rapidly, with little change in cost, the increased sophistication in processing does not entail an increase in system cost. The use of GPUs for reconstruction represents a technical breakthrough in the cost-effective application of MLEM to Digital Breast Tomosynthesis.

An elegant solution to this problem is the multibody factorization approach in which the measurement matrix is factored into lower rank matrices. Despite progress in factorization algorithms, the performance is still far from satisfactory and in scenes with missing data and noise, most existing algorithms fail. In this paper we propose a method for incorporating 2D non-motion cues (such as spatial coherence) into multibody factorization. We formulate the problem in terms of constrained factor analysis and use the EM algorithm to find the segmentation. We show that adding these cues improves performance in real and synthetic sequences.

In this work we focus on the problem of "structure from motion" in which one wishes to recover the camera motion and the 3D coordinates of certain points given their 2D locations. This problem may be reduced to a low rank factorization problem. When all the 2D locations are known, singular value decomposition yields a least squares factorization of the measurements matrix. In realistic scenarios this assumption does not hold: some of the data is missing, the measurements have correlated noise, and the scene may contain multiple objects. Under these conditions, most existing factorization algorithms fail while human perception is relatively unchanged. In this work we present an EM algorithm for matrix factorization that takes advantage of prior information and imposes strict constraints on the resulting matrix factors. We present results on challenging sequences.

The relationship between observed pixel intensities and distance between pixels are introduced to the traditional neighbourhood potential function, which described the probability of pixels being classified into one class. To perform an unsupervised segmentation, the Bayes Information Criterion (BIC) is used to determine the class number. The K-means is employed to initialise the classification and calculate the mean values and variances of the classes. The segmentation is transformed to maximize a posteriori (MAP) procedure. Then, the Iterative Conditional Model (ICM) is employed to solve the MAP problem. In the experiments, the proposed method is adopted with K-means, traditional Expectation-Maximization (EM) and MRF image segmentation techniques, for noisy image segmentation applying on synthetic and real images. The experiment results and the histogram of signal to noise ratio (SNR)-miss classification ratio (MCR) showed that the proposed algorithm is the better choice.

The EM algorithm is sensitive to initial values of HMM parameters and is likely to terminate at a local maximum of likelihood function resulting in non-optimized estimation for HMM and lower recognition accuracy. In this paper, to obtain better estimation for HMM and higher recognition accuracy, several candidate HMMs are created by applying EM on multiple initial models. The best HMM is chosen from the candidate HMMs which has highest value for likelihood function. Initial models are created by varying maximum frame number in the segmentation step of HMM initialization process. A binary search is applied while creating the initial models. The proposed method has been tested on TIMIT database. Experimental results show that our approach obtains improved values for likelihood function and improved recognition accuracy.

Blood detection in Wireless Capsule Endoscopy using expectation maximization clustering - art. no. 61441P	Medical Imaging 2006: Image Processing, Pts 1-3	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE)		English	Proceedings Paper	Medical Imaging 2006 Conference	FEB 12-14, 2006	San Diego, CA	SPIE		Wireless Capsule Endoscopy; blood detection; expectation maximization (EM) clustering	SMALL-BOWEL; VIDEO CAPSULE; PUSH ENTEROSCOPY; DIAGNOSIS; VARICES; TRIAL	Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) is a relatively new technology (FDA approved 2002) allowing doctors to view most of the small intestine. Previous endoscopy such as colonoscopy, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, push enteroscopy and intraoperative enteroscopy could be used to visualize up to the stomach, duodenum, colon and terminal ileum, but there existed no method to view most of the small intestine without surgery. With the miniaturization of wireless and camera technologies the ability comes to view the entire gestational track with little effort. A tiny disposable video capsule is swallowed, and transmitting two images per second to a small data receiver worn by the patient on a belt. During an approximately 8-hour course, over than 55,000 images are recorded to a worn device, and then they are downloaded to a computer for the later examination. Typically, a medical clinician spends more than two hours to analyze a WCE video. Research has been attempted to automatically find abnormal regions (especially bleeding) to reduce the time needed to analyze the videos. The manufacturers also provide the software tool to detect the bleeding called Suspected Blood Indicator (SBI), but its accuracy is not high enough to replace human examination. It was reported that the sensitivity and the specificity of SBI were about 72% and 85%, respectively. To address this problem, we propose a technique to detect the bleeding regions automatically utilizing Expectation Maximization (EM) clustering algorithm. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed bleeding detection method achieves 92% and 98% of sensitivity and specificity, respectively.

Helical-Path, Half-Cone-Beam Acquisition for SPECT Brain Imaging	2006 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD, VOL 1-6	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X- and Gamma-Ray Detectors/ 2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium	OCT 29-NOV 04, 2006	San Diego, CA	IEEE			EMISSION-COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; COLLIMATION; RECONSTRUCTION; HEAD; SYSTEM	Convergent beam collimation can provide improved sensitivity and/or spatial resolution for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) brain imaging. A half-cone-beam (HCB) collimator is particularly useful because shoulder interference is mitigated and the base of the brain is within the collimator's field of view. However, HCB SPECT acquisitions using a single circular orbit (SCO) result in insufficiently sampled projection data and consequently axial distortion. To reduce axial-distortion artifacts, we investigated HCB acquisitions using helical paths (HPs). A single HCB collimator with the focal point shifted towards the base of the brain was mounted on a Triad-XLT SPECT system. HP-HCB SPECT was evaluated with a Hoffman 3D brain phantom and a Defrise-type disk phantom. While the camera revolved in a 360 deg. circular orbit, the bed and phantom were translated at a slow speed. This combined motion resulted in a helical path of the focal point relative to the phantom. Two HP acquisitions, each with 360 deg. rotation, were combined to provide a single 720 deg. HP acquisition. An Ordered-Subset, Expectation-Maximization reconstruction algorithm was used. The HCB-HP SPECT images were compared with full-cone-beam (FCB) SCO, HCB-SCO SPECT, and parallel beam (PB) images. The FCB-SCO and HCB-SCO images of the disk phantom demonstrated strong axial artifacts. These artifacts were eliminated in HCB-HP images. HCB-HP SPECT provides markedly improved sampling of SPECT data than is possible with FCB-SCO and HCB-SCO SPECT, and offers the potential for improved SPECT imaging of the human brain.

Fast dynamic image reconstruction for gated cardiac SPECT	2006 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD, VOL 1-6	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X- and Gamma-Ray Detectors/ 2006 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium	OCT 29-NOV 04, 2006	San Diego, CA	IEEE				In this paper we propose a fast image reconstruction procedure for dynamic images from gated SPECT acquisition. We divide the cardiac cycle into a number of gate intervals as in gated SPECT, but treat the tracer distribution for each gate as a time-varying signal. To speed up the reconstruction procedure, we derive an ordered-subset version of the dynamic expectation-maximization (dEM) algorithm, and apply motion-compensated temporal filtering to enforce the correlation among the different gates. We simulated gated cardiac perfusion imaging using the gated mathematical cardiac-torso(gMCAT) phantom with Tc99m-Teboroxime dynamics. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can reconstruct gated dynamic images faster than the regular dEM algorithm, and that temporal smoothing is more effective than spatial smoothing for noise reduction.

While the popular training method of HMMs, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, only achieves local optima in the parameter space, the proposed algorithm performs global search and thus obtains solutions giving improved recognition performance.

However, researchers face a number of challenges when trying to combine expression profiles from these patients. Unlike studies that rely on lab animals or cell lines, individuals vary in their baseline expression and in their response rate. In this paper we present a generative model for such data. Our model represents patient expression data using two levels, a gene level which corresponds to a common response pattern and a patient level which accounts for the patient specific expression patterns and response rate. Using an EM algorithm we infer the parameters of the model. We used our algorithm to analyze multiple sclerosis patient response to Interferon-beta. As we show, our algorithm was able to improve upon prior methods for combining patients data. In addition, our algorithm was able to correctly identify patient specific response patterns.

In this paper, we present an expectation maximization approach for clustering multi-instance objects. We therefore present a statistical process that models multi-instance objects. Furthermore, we present M-steps and E-steps for EM clustering and a method for finding a good initial model. In our experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that the new EM algorithm is capable to increase the cluster quality for three real world data sets compared to a k-medoid clustering.

But it also has some disadvantage as costing long time and bad reconstruction quality. Filtered Back Projection (FBP) that has many advantages such as simple structure and short reconstruction time is firstly introduced to the initialization stage to accelerate reconstruction. Then, the smoothness method is introduced to improve the reconstruction quality after OS-EM algorithm. The results show that this method has the advantages of fast reconstruction speed and good quality.

Alternatively, statistical methods may be used to estimate a most likely color for each pixel for photorealistic rendering from multiple views of the same scene. Such statistical methods normally require a relatively large number of input images to achieve reasonable quality for the synthesized image, if the estimation is purely nonparametric. In this paper, based on some reasonable assumptions on the configuration of the multiple views, we propose to use a two-component Gaussian mixture model for the appearance of a given pixel in all the views so that both the problem of occlusion and the problem of noise can be considered simultaneously. Then we use the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to estimate the model parameters. The virtual pixel is given as a maximum likelihood estimate for one of the mixture components. Experiments shows that reasonable performance can be obtained even with only a few input images.

However, as most algorithms are not optimized for long-term prediction, it may be hard to achieve good prediction results. In this paper, we investigate Gaussian linear regression filters for parameter estimation in state-space models and we propose new long-term prediction strategies. Experiments using the EM-algorithm for training of nonlinear state-space models show that significant improvements are possible with no additional computational cost.

The idea of this method is that individual image region classes are modeled as mixtures of fuzzy subclasses of mixture distributions, and classification is performed based on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. To overcome the difficulty of classical mixture model method for noisy image segmentation, spatial contextual information should be taken into account. In particular, the proposed approach based on Markov Random Field was shown to provide more accurate classification of images than traditional Expectation-Maximization algorithm and traditional Markov Random Field image segmentation techniques. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated with synthetic and real images data. The experiments results have shown that the proposed method can achieve more robust segmentation for noisy images.

For the purpose of dynamical bandwidth provisioning, we need a model that can capture online the traffic characteristics and facilitate mathematical analysis. A mixture of Gamma distributions can approximate any distribution with nonnegative support as closely as desired. It can not only characterize field data well, but also facilitate analytically tractable results for performance evaluation. This paper uses a Gamma mixture to model Internet traffic and proposes an online algorithm to fit the model to actual Internet traffic. The fitted model is applied to provision bandwidth dynamically, and many simulation and experimental results are also provided.

This paper proposes a novel routing inference method that only needs the knowledge of the. network topplogy and the link counts, both of which can be obtained from MTG (Multi-Router Traffic Grahper) data. The insight is that the traffic observed on each link arises from the superposition of the traffic demands between the origin-destination (OD) pairs and each traffic demand corresponds to a unique path. The method employs expectation maximization (EM) algorithm cooperating with a hypothetic pseudo routing scheme, which is expected to embrace the real routing, to compute a pseudo traffic matrix. The real routing then can be conjecturedfrom thispseudo traffic matrix. This method is applied to a real IP network, and the results show that it correctly infers the routingsfor 87% OD pairs.

The proposed technique consists of a multi-grid version of the 3D ordered subsets expectation-maximization (3D-OSEM) algorithm. The associated system matrix is precalculated for the fine grid resolution with Monte Carlo methods. Coarse grid system matrices and subset subdivision are derived at a post-process step. Only the system matrix elements associated to the fourth part of central transverse planes are stored in sparse mode format, using axial and in-plane transaxial symmetries during the reconstruction. The multi-grid proposed technique has been evaluated on 3D sinograms obtained from GATE simulations, reporting better resolution-noise trade-off than SSRB+2D-OSEM and FORE+2D-OSEM algorithms, specially in the axial direction and far from the center of the FOV. The proposed algorithm shows significantly faster convergence rate than single-grid 3D-OSEM when is applied to images with local smoothness property.

The reason of the dramatic improvement in performance is that the techniques make use of certain properties of the data. These properties are: the data is sparse and there are many repeating records. We claim that particular sources of data consistently satisfy these properties. Excellent examples are Click-stream and retail data which are very sparse and consist of many repititions. Using simple techniques huge speed-ups and compression rates, on real life clickstream data sets, are observed compared to the standard implementation of the EM.

Although the EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm yields the maximum likelihood solution it has many problems: (i) it requires a careful initialization of the parameters; (ii) the optimal number of kernels in the mixture may be unknown beforehand. We propose a criterion based on the entropy of the pdf (probability density function) associated to each kernel to measure the quality of a given mixture model, and a modification of the classical EM algorithm to find the optimal number of kernels in the mixture. We apply our algorithm to the unsupervised color image segmentation problem.

EM based extended kalman filter for estimation of rotor time-constant of induction motor	2006 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics, Vols 1-7			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics	JUL 09-13, 2006	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE Ind Elect Soc, ABB Canada, Ecol Technol Superieure			ALGORITHM	This paper deals with the recursive optimum estimation of rotor resistance and inductance of induction motor. The estimation of parameter and states in the presence of system noise is achieved using EKF, which takes in to account measurement and modelling inaccuracies. A major limitation in the parameter estimation using EKF is that its optimality is dependent on the choice of the right covariance matrices. In this paper the EM(Expectation Maximization) algorithm along with the Kalman smoothing is used to obtain the initial values of process and measurement covariance matrices. The Vas model of the induction motor is used for simulation and the rotor inductance and rotor resistance are considered as parameters as well as states. For the estimation of these parameters, the state vector is augmented with these parameters to be estimated. The parameters used for simulation is that of a three phase, 400V, 50 Hz cage induction motor. Matlab is used to simulate the system and from the results it is observed that the parameter estimates converges to true values with a reasonable degree of accuracy.

S	Restif, C		Leonardis, A; Bischof, H; Pinz, A		Restif, C			Towards safer, faster prenatal genetic tests: Novel unsupervised, automatic and robust methods of segmentation of nuclei and probes	COMPUTER VISION - ECCV 2006, PT 4, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV 2006)	MAY 07-13, 2006	Graz, AUSTRIA	Adv Comp Vis, Graz Univ Technol, Univ Ljubljana			IMAGE SEGMENTATION; CELL-NUCLEI	In this paper we present two new methods of segmentation that we developed for nuclei and chromosomic probes - core objects for cytometry medical imaging. Our nucleic segmentation method is mathematically grounded on a novel parametric model of an image histogram, which accounts at the same time for the background noise, the nucleic textures and the nuclei's alterations to the background. We adapted an Expectation-Maximisation algorithm to adjust this model to the histograms of each image and subregion, in a coarse-to-fine approach. The probe segmentation uses a new dome-detection algorithm, insensitive to background and foreground noise, which detects probes of any intensity. We detail our two segmentation methods and our EM algorithm, and discuss the strengths of our techniques compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Both our segmentation methods are unsupervised, automatic, and require no training nor tuning: as a result, they are directly applicable to a wide range of medical images. We have used them as part of a large-scale project for the improvement of prenatal diagnostic of genetic diseases, and tested them on more than 2,100 images with nearly 14,000 nuclei. We report 99.3% accuracy for each of our segmentation methods, with a robustness to different laboratory conditions unreported before.

In particular, with the rising popularity of imaging techniques in physis, the development and application of cutting edge computer vision techniques has become vital. Here we present novel image analysis methods which can be used to extract the position of features in diffraction patterns (reciprocal space) with unprecedented accuracy. The first contribution we have developed is a method for calculating the nonlinear response of photographic film by using the noise in the image enabling the extraction of accurate intensity information. This allows high-resolution (but non-linear) film to be used in place of low-resolution (but linear) CCD cameras. The second contribution is a method for accurately localising very faint features in diffraction patterns by modelling the features and using the expectation maximization algorithm directly on the image to fit them. The accuracy of this technique has been verified by testing it on synthetic data. These methods have been applied to transmission electron microscopy data, and have already enabled discoveries which would have been impossible using previously available techniques.

Then the segmentation is done by the Iterated Conditional Modes (ICM) algorithm. For testing the segmentation performance, we use both artificial images and real images.

Our central claim is that the structure of the taxonomy encapsulates background knowledge that can be exploited to improve classification accuracy. Under our hierarchical Dirichlet generative model for the document corpus, we show that the unsupervised classification algorithm provides robust estimates of the classification parameters by performing regularization, and that our algorithm can be interpreted as a regularized EM algorithm. We also propose a technique for the automatic choice of the regularization parameter. In addition we propose a regularization scheme for K-means for hierarchies. We experimentally demonstrate that both our regularized clustering algorithms achieve a higher classification accuracy over simple models like minimum distance, Naive Bayes, EM and K-means.

S	Tu, JL; Tao, H; Huang, T		Narayanan, PJ; Nayar, SK; Shum, HY		Tu, JL; Tao, H; Huang, T			Online updating appearance generative mixture model for meanshift tracking	COMPUTER VISION - ACCV 2006, PT I	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th Asian Conference on Computer Vision	JAN 13-15, 2006	Hyderabad, INDIA					This paper proposes an appearance generative mixture model based on key frames for meanshift tracking. Meanshift tracking algorithm tracks object by maximizing the similarity between the histogram in tracking window and a static histogram acquired at the beginning of tracking. The tracking therefore may fail if the appearance of the object varies substantially. Assume the key appearances of the object can be acquired before tracking, the manifold of the object appearance can be approximated by some piece-wise linear combination of these key appearances in histogram space. The generative process can be described by a bayesian graphical model. Online EM algorithm is then derived to estimate the model parameters and to update the appearance histogram. The updating histogram would improve meanshift tracking accuracy and reliability, and the model parameters infer the state of the object with respect to the key appearances. We applied this approach to track human head motion and to infer the head pose simultaneously in videos. Experiments verify that, our online histogram generative updating algorithm constrained by key appearance histograms avoids the drifting problem often encountered in tracking with online updating, that the enhanced meanshift algorithm is capable of tracking object of varying appearances more robustly and accurately, and that our tracking algorithm can infer the state of the object(e.g. pose) simultaneously as a bonus.

Further, by using the probabilistic perspective of P2DPCA, we extend P2DPCA to a mixture of local P2DPCA models (MP2DPCA). MP2DPCA offers us a method of being able to model faces in unconstrained (complex) environment with possibly large variation. The model parameters could be fitted on the basis of maximum likelihood (ML) estimation via the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The experimental recognition results on UMIST face database confirm the effectivity of the proposed methods.

The paper points out problems in some existed path prediction schemes, especially the state space expansion problem in Order-k Markov predictor. And it firstly proposes a Step-k Markov model and validates its feasibility. Secondly, a hybrid Markov predictor model and its improved models are put forward based on the Step-k Markov model. Because of the Order-2 Markov model's best performance in Order-k Markov models, the Hybrid Markov model takes the Order-2 Markov model as its target. The state space's complexity of the Hybrid Markov Model is O(N) while the Order-2 Markov model is O(N 2). And the memory demand of the hybrid Markov model is O(N 2) while Order-2 Markov model is O(N). Finally, it is proved that the hybrid Markov predictor can get close performance with Order-2 Markov Predictor at much lower expense by conditional entropy analysis and user mobility data analysis. Also it can alleviate the zero probability problem in Order-k Markov model to some extent. The hybrid Markov predictor is more practical than Order-k Markov predictors under WLAN.

In recent years, Bayesian network has become a popular method to reconstruct the gene regulatory network due to the statistical nature. However, it is not suitable for analyzing the time-series data and cannot deal with cycles in the gene regulatory network. In this paper we apply the dynamic Bayesian network to model the gene relationship in order to overcome these difficulties. By incorporating the structural expectation maximization algorithm into the dynamic Bayesian network model, we develop a new method to learn the regulatory network from the S.

The signal analysis step plays a crucial part in the data interpretation process. A number of signal processing methods have been proposed to classify ultrasonic flaw signals. One of the popular methods involves the extraction of an appropriate set of features followed by the use of a neural network for the classification of the signals in the feature space. This paper describes an alternative approach which uses the least mean square (LMS) method and expectation maximization (EM) algorithm with the model based deconvolution which is employed for classifying nondestructive evaluation (NDE) signals from steam generator tubes in a nuclear power plant.

J	Garcia-Varea, I; Casacuberta, F				Garcia-Varea, I; Casacuberta, F			Maximum entropy modeling: A suitable framework to learn context-dependent lexicon models for statistical machine translation	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						statistical machine translation; maximum entropy modeling; context-dependent lexicon models	LANGUAGE	Current statistical machine translation systems are mainly based on statistical word lexicons. However, these models are usually context-independent, therefore, the disambiguation of the translation of a source word must be carried out using other probabilistic distributions (distortion distributions and statistical language models). One efficient way to add contextual information to the statistical lexicons is based on maximum entropy modeling. In that framework, the context is introduced through feature functions that allow us to automatically learn context-dependent lexicon models. In a first approach, maximum entropy modeling is carried out after a process of learning standard statistical models (alignment and lexicon). In a second approach, the maximum entropy modeling is integrated in the expectation-maximization process of learning standard statistical models. Experimental results were obtained for two well-known tasks, the French-English Canadian Parliament HANSARDS task and the German-English VERMOBIL task.

An Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is implemented. Inflated models allow for modelling both over-dispersion (or under-dispersion) and negative correlation and thus they are appropriate for a wide range of applications. Extensions of the algorithms for several other models are also discussed. Detailed guidance and implementation on simulated and real data sets using bivpois package is provided.

Application to fMRI imaging	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						blind source separation; EM algorithm; fMRI imaging; maximum likelihood; short-time Fourier transform	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; ALGORITHM; MIXTURES; SIGNALS	The main contribution of this paper is to present a Bayesian approach for solving the noisy instantaneous blind source separation problem based on second-order statistics of the time-varying spectrum. The success of the blind estimation relies on the nonstationarity of the second-order statistics and their inter-source diversity. Choosing the time-frequency domain as the signal representation space and transforming the data by a short-time Fourier transform (STFT), our method presents a simple EM algorithm that can efficiently deal with the time-varying spectrum diversity of the sources. The estimation variance of the STFT is reduced by averaging across time-frequency subdomains. The algorithm is demonstrated on a standard functional resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment involving visual stimuli in a block design. Explicitly taking into account the noise in the model, the proposed algorithm has the advantage of extracting only relevant task-related components and considers the remaining components (artifacts) to be noise.

The registered images are first decomposed using the DWF transform, which is both aliasing-free and translation-invariant. The DWF decomposes the image signal into a multiresolution representation with both low-frequency coarse information and high-frequency detail information. The EM algorithm is used to fuse the low-frequency coarse information of the registered images. The informative importance measure is applied to fuse the high-frequency detail information of the registered images. The final fused image is obtained by taking the inverse transform of the composite multiresolution representations. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional image fusion methods. (c) 2005 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

J	Schurle, J				Schurle, J			A method for consideration of conditional dependencies in the Fellegi and Sunter model of record linkage	STATISTICAL PAPERS			English	Article						exact matching; probabilistic matching; mixture model; incomplete data; maximum-likelihood estimation; EM algorithm; simulation study		An objective of Record Linkage is to link two data files by identifying common elements. A popular model for doing the separation is the probabilistic one from Fellegi and Sunter. To estimate the parameters needed for the model usually a mixture model is constructed and the EM algorithm is applied. For simplification, the assumption of conditional independence is often made. This assumption says that if several attributes of elements in the data are compared, then the results of the comparisons regarding the several attributes are independent within the mixture classes. A mixture model constructed with this assumption has been often used. Within this article a straightforward extension of the model is introduced which allows for conditional dependencies but is heavily dependent on the choice of the starting value. Therefore also an estimation procedure for the EM algorithm starting value is proposed. The two models are compared empirically in a simulation study based on telephone book entries. Particularly the effect of different starting values and conditional dependencies on the matching results is investigated.

On the basis of fuzzy set concept and fuzzy classification maximum likelihood (FCML) procedures we create an FCML algorithm for fuzzy class Poisson regression models. Traditionally, the EM algorithm had been used for latent class regression models. Thus, the accuracy and effectiveness of EM and FCML algorithms for estimating the parameters are compared. The results show that the proposed FCML algorithm presents better accuracy and effectiveness and can be used as another good tool to regression analysis for heterogeneous count data.

We present an approach on the basis of the universal approximation property of phase-type (PH) distribution in order to address the intractable numerical issue caused by HDT. We first obtain the steady state probability under the general HDT. The performance metrics from the perspective of base station (BS) as well as from the point view of call are developed. The PH-type HDT is then assumed to derive the numerically tractable expressions for the performance metrics. Finally, the truncated Gaussian HDT is approximately fitted by the PH distribution via expectation maximization algorithm to reuse the closed form analytical expression. The comparison shows that, in terms of the BS performance, the handoff blocking probability exhibits a significant discrepancy whenever one uses the exponential or truncated Gaussian HDT distribution, while the new call blocking probability is less sensitive to different HDT. In addition, HDT has little impact on the call performance with respect to the call completion probability and total waiting time. Both the analytical model and the approximation approach are verified by simulation.

J	Dong, L; Foo, SW; Lian, Y				Dong, L; Foo, SW; Lian, Y			A two-channel training algorithm for hidden Markov model and its application to lip reading	EURASIP JOURNAL ON APPLIED SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						viseme recognition; two-channel hidden Markov model; discriminative training; separable-distance function	SPEECH RECOGNITION; PROBABILISTIC FUNCTIONS; HEARING; CHAINS; NETWORKS	Hidden Markov model (HMM) has been a popular mathematical approach for sequence classification such as speech recognition since 1980s. In this paper, a novel two-channel training strategy is proposed for discriminative training of HMM. For the proposed training strategy, a novel separable-distance function that measures the difference between a pair of training samples is adopted as the criterion function. The symbol emission matrix of an HMM is split into two channels: a static channel to maintain the validity of the HMM and a dynamic channel that is modified to maximize the separable distance. The parameters of the two-channel HMM are estimated by iterative application of expectation-maximization (EM) operations. As an example of the application of the novel approach, a hierarchical speaker-dependent visual speech recognition system is trained using the two-channel HMMs. Results of experiments on identifying a group of confusable visemes indicate that the proposed approach is able to increase the recognition accuracy by an average of 20% compared with the conventional HMMs that are trained with the Baum-Welch estimation.

J	Jorgensen, M				Jorgensen, M			Minimum message length estimation using EM methods: a case study	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						comparative calibration; minimum message length; functional relationship; structural relationship; EM algorithm; maximum penalized likelihood	COMPARATIVE CALIBRATION; ALGORITHM; LIKELIHOOD; COMPLEXITY; INFERENCE	The minimum message length approach to inference has been expounded at length (J. Roy. Statist. Soc. B 49 (1987) 240; 54 (1992) 195) but it has yet to be adopted with any great enthusiasm by the statistical community. A possible reason may be the complexity of the symbolic determinant calculations required to implement the method. Another reason may be the unusual approach taken to nuisance parameters by MML authors. In this paper, we consider a modified MML approach based on the EM algorithm and using only 'complete data' quantities which considerably simplify the computation of the determinant. In the context of the 'single factor analysis' or 'comparative calibration' example of Wallace and Freeman we study our modified estimator and compare it with that of Wallace and Freeman and other alternatives.

A novel software sensor is proposed to make more effective use of those measurements that are already available, which has great importance both to slab quality and energy saving. The proposed method is based on the mixtures of Gaussian processes (GP) with the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm employed for parameter estimation of the mixture of models. The mixture model can alleviate the computational complexity of GP and also accords with the changes of operating condition in practical processes. It is demonstrated by on-line estimation of the furnace gas temperature in 1580 reheating furnace in Baosteel Corporation (Group).

Earlier literature suggested that when the relationship between a continuous and a categorical variable is of interest, a cost-efficient strategy may be to measure the categorical variable only in the tails of the continuous distribution. Such samples occur in population epidemiology and gene mapping. Because central observations are not classified, the mixture component to which each observation belongs is not known. Three cases of censoring, which correspond to differing amounts of available information, are compared. Closed form solutions are not available and so Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques are employed to estimate posterior densities. Evidence for a mixture of two populations is assessed via Bayes factors calculated using a Laplace-Metropolis estimator. Although parameter estimates appear to be satisfactory in most situations, evidence of two populations is only found when the component populations are well separated, tail sizes are not too small, or typing information is available. Extension of these methods to incorporate fixed effects is illustrated by application to a cattle breeding experiment.

J	Zhu, J; Yue, W				Zhu, J; Yue, W			A multiresolution tree-structured spatial linear model	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS			English	Article						change-of-resolution Kalman filter; random field model; spatial prediction		Multiresolution spatial models are able to capture complex dependence correlation in spatial data and are excellent alternatives to the traditional random field models for mapping spatial processes. Because of the multiresolution structures, spatial process prediction can be obtained by direct and fast computation algorithms. However, the existing multiresolution models usually assume a simple constant mean structure, which may not be suitable in practice. In this article, we focus on a multiresolution tree-structured spatial model and extend the model to incorporate a linear regression mean. We explore the properties of the multiresolution tree-structured spatial linear model in depth and estimate the parameters in the linear regression mean and the spatial-dependence structure simultaneously. An expectation-maximization algorithm is adopted to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters and the corresponding information matrix. Given the estimated parameters, a one-pass change-of-resolution Kalman filter algorithm is implemented to obtain the best linear unbiased predictor of the true underlying spatial process. For illustration, the methodology is applied to optimally map crop yield in a Wisconsin field, after accounting for the field conditions by a linear regression.

Many reconstruction algorithms have been studied and applied to this geometry to deal with every kind of degradation factor. This paper presents a new reconstruction approach for SPECT with circular orbit, which demonstrated good performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. The new approach compensates for degradation factors including noise, scatter, attenuation, and spatially variant detector response. Its uniform attenuation approximation strategy avoids the additional transmission scan for the brain attenuation map, hence reducing the patient radiation dose and furthermore simplifying the imaging procedure. We evaluate and compare this new approach with the well-established ordered-subset expectation-maximization iterative method, using Monte Carlo simulations. We perform quantitative analysis with regional bias-variance, receiver operating characteristics, and Hotelling trace studies for both methods. The results demonstrate that our reconstruction strategy has comparable performance with a significant reduction of computing time.

In the context of automated lung nodule detection in thoracic CT scans, segmented blood vessels call be used to resolve local ambiguities based on global considerations and so improve the performance of lung nodule detection algorithms. Segmenting, the data correctly is a difficult problem with direct consequences for subsequent processing steps. Voxels belonging to vessels and nodules in thoracic CT scans are both characterized by high contrast with respect to a local neighborhood. Thus in order to enhance vessels while suppressing nodules, additional characteristics should be used. In this paper we propose a novel vessel enhancement filter that is capable of enhancing vessels and junctions in thoracic CT seal-is while suppressing nodules. The proposed filters are based oil a Gaussian mixture model which is optimized through expectation maximization. The proposed filters are based on first order differential quantities and so are less sensitive to noise compared with known Hessian-based vessel enhancement filters. Moreover, the proposed filters utilize an adaptive window and so avoid the common need for multiple scale analysis. The proposed filters are evaluated and compared to known techniques qualitatively and quantitatively on both synthetic and actual clinical data and it is shown that the proposed filters perform better.

The GMMs were obtained for a wide range of ground surveillance radar targets such as: walking person(s), tracked or wheeled vehicles, animals and clutter. Maximum-likelihood (ML) and "majority voting" decision schemes were applied to these models for target classification. The corresponding classifiers were trained and tested using distinct databases of target echoes, recorded by ground surveillance radar. ML and "majority voting" classifiers obtained classification rates of 88% and 96%, correspondingly. Both classifiers outperform trained human operators.

S	Figueiredo, MAT		Schmid, C; Soatto, S; Tomasi, C		Figueiredo, MAT			Bayesian image segmentation using wavelet-based priors	2005 IEEE COMPUTER SOCIETY CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION, VOL 1, PROCEEDINGS	IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition	JUN 20-25, 2005	San Diego, CA	IEEE Comp Soc			TEXTURE CLASSIFICATION; MODELS	This paper introduces a formulation which allows using wavelet-based priors for image segmentation. This formulation can be used in supervised, unsupervised, or semisupervised modes, and with any probabilistic observation model (intensity, multispectral, texture). Our main goal is to exploit the well-known ability of wavelet-based priors to model piece-wise smoothness (which underlies state-of-theart methods for denoising, coding, and restoration) and the availability of fast algorithms for wavelet-basedprocessing. The main obstacle to using wavelet-based priors for segmentation is that they're aimed at representing real values, rather than discrete labels, as needed for segmentation. This difficulty is sidestepped by the introduction of realvalued hidden fields, to which the labels are probabilistically related. These hidden fields, being unconstrained and real-valued, can be given any type of spatial prior, such as one based on wavelets. Under this model, Bayesian MAP segmentation is carried out by a (generalized) EM algorithm. Experiments on synthetic and real data testify for the adequacy of the approach.

In contrast to previous approaches, the proposed method uses information about structures that are not desired and consequently is very useful in an exploratory datamining setting. Specifically, the problem is formulated as constrained model-based clustering where the constraints are placed at a model-level. Two variants of an EM algorithm, for this constrained model, are derived. The performance of both variants is compared against a state-of-the-art information bottleneck algorithm on both synthetic and real datasets.

Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm was used for training the ME so that the learning process is decoupled in a manner that fits well with the modular structure. The EEG signals were decomposed into time-frequency representations using discrete wavelet transform and statistical features were calculated to depict their distribution. The ME network structure was implemented for classification of the EEG signals using the statistical features as inputs. Three types of EEG signals (EEG signals recorded from healthy volunteers with eyes open, epilepsy patients in the epileptogenic zone during a seizure-free interval, and epilepsy patients during epileptic seizures) were classified with the accuracy of 93.17% by the ME network structure. The ME network structure achieved accuracy rates which were higher than that of the stand-alone neural network models.

Drawing ideas from its stochastic descendant, the Monte Carlo EM algorithm, the method uses only a sub-sample of the entire database per iteration. Starting with smaller samples in the earlier iterations for computational efficiency, the algorithm increase the sample size intelligently towards the end of the algorithm to assure maximum accuracy of the results. The intelligent sample size updating rule is centered around EM's highly-appraised likelihood-ascent property and only increases the sample when no further improvements are possible based on the current sample. In several simulation studies we show the superiority of Ascent-EM over regular EM implementations. We apply the method to an example of clustering online auctions.

For frequency-selective fading channels, the estimator also incorporates channel response estimation. The estimator operates in the frequency domain, after the Fourier transformation. Convergence analysis shows that the CFO estimator converges to the actual value in the almost sure sense if the initial CFO is less than approximately one half of the subcarrier spacing. The complexity of the proposed algorithm can be made manageable by using proper windowing prior to the Fourier transformation and decision feedback techniques. A simulation study is also conducted to show the bit error rate as well as the mean squared error performances of the proposed algorithms.

The idea of the PDDP algorithm is to recursively split data samples into two sub-clusters using the hyperplane normal to the principal direction derived from the covariance matrix. However, the PDDP algorithm can yield poor results, especially when clusters are not well-separated from one another. To improve the quality of the clustering results, we deal with this problem by re-allocating new cluster membership using the sGEM algorithm with different settings. Furthermore, based on the theoretical background of the sGEM algorithm, we can naturally extend the framework to cover the problem of estimating the number of clusters using the Bayesian Information Criterion. Experimental results on two different corpora are given to show the effectiveness of our algorithm.

Based on S.A.I. and E.C.C., the MR image has been proved to be embedded in an MRF with respect to a proper neighborhood system. Further, the MR image is proved to be modeled by a Finite Normal Mixture (FNM) with an MRF as its prior. A unified Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is presented for performing image segmentation. S.A.I., E.C.C. and Markovianity provide means for selecting the order of neighborhood systems and the values of clique potentials. The use of the 3rd-order neighborhood system and the correlation coefficient-based assignments of clique potentials strike an optimal trade-off between good accuracy and sufficient simplicity in image segmentation.

Class Based Weight Fair Queuing (CBWFQ) is deployed as the congestion resolution mechanism. Markov Modulate Poisson Process (MMPP) is encompassed to model network traffic. Expectation Maximization is used to estimate MMPP parameters. Fuzzy is also invoked to calculate the bandwidth reserved for a channel. Reserving bandwidth guarantees the least network traffic, while declaring threshold of queue limit defines the priority of a class. A packet with higher priority will be delivered with higher probability. Moreover, FDBA can automatically tune its QoS parameters to adapt various network traffic, thus decreasing managerial load and providing user a higher network service quality.

At the receiver, to estimate multipath delays and amplitudes, the soft information output from a soft-input soft-output (SISO) decoder is used to assist the estimation. The SISO decoder and the channel estimator work in an iterative way and no training sequence is used in the estimation. Compared with the non data-aided channel estimation without using the soft information output from the SISO decoder, the performance of this iterative channel estimation is better. We also explain this iterative method by using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, which can be used to prove the convergence of this iterative method.

Under this generalized framework, we readily arrive at many popular multiuser detection schemes. In addition to its systematic appeal, there are several other advantages of this viewpoint. First of all, by condensing the design of multiuser detectors into the selection of a few key probability distributions, namely p(b), p(r vertical bar b) and Q(b), we provide rigorous justifications for numerous detectors that were proposed on heuristic grounds and recommend new and improved designs. Furthermore, the free energy formulation facilitates convenient joint detection and decoding (utilizing the turbo principle) when error-control codes are incorporated, as well as efficient parameter estimation via the variational expectation maximization (EM) algorithm.

BNs not only provide a natural and compact way to represent the domain knowledge and encode joint probability distributions, but also provide a basis for efficient probabilistic inference. We apply BNs to wide area airborne minefield detection (WAAMD) due to their powerful representation ability of encoding the domain knowledge and their flexible structural extendibility for multi-look and multi-sensor data fusion. We first design BN models for both single-look detection and multi-look and multi-sensor data fusion and then refine them via learning from data using a structural expectation-maximization (SEM) algorithm. We evaluate the performance of our landmine detection scheme using data sets collected by three airborne ground penetrating synthetic aperture radars (GPSARs) (Lynx Ku-band, Mirage stepped-frequency (0.3 - 2.8 GHz), and Veridian X-band GPSARs) from various testing sites that have different terrain and vegetation conditions. Experimental results indicate that BNs can help improve the landmine detection performance significantly. The use of BNs for multi-look and multi-sensor data fusion is also shown to provide significant false alarm reductions.

The system model, which is used in the expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm, accounts for the 3D nature of the emission process in which the geometric sensitivity to a point source varies along and across the tube of each line of response (LOR). Therefore the system model cannot be based just on line or tube integrals as it is for the model of transmission scanning. By accounting for the varying sensitivity within each LOR in the reconstruction process unbiased and quantitatively exact images can be achieved without using calibration or scaling factors after the reconstruction process. Two approaches to the model are investigated, i.e., LOR- and voxel-driven which are validated using high statistics Monte Carlo simulation (SimSET).

Analysis and simulations show that convergence becomes extraordinary slow for almost all cases, compared to other optimization techniques. The two alternatives considered are "Adaptive Overrelaxed EM" and Ucminf (a BFGS with soft line search), which both improves the convergence dramatically with little or no extra analytical work. We discuss the generality and perspectives of the findings.

This algorithm is designed to achieve computationally efficient pre-selection of lesion candidate locations in the reconstructed breast volume. First, the breast volume is filtered with a radial gradient filter to enhance spherical structures. The filter is designed such that the convolution can be carried out in the spatial frequency domain. Variation of mass lesion size is accounted for by varying the scale of the radial gradient filter. For the subsequent analysis, the dimensionality of the feature volume is reduced through maximum intensity projection, without loss of information for the present database. The database consisted of 36 breast volumes, 21 of which had mass lesions. DBT volumes were reconstructed from 11 projections using a ML-EM algorithm. For this database, we found a sensitivity of 100% at 23 false positives and 90% sensitivity at 13 false positives. False positives can be reduced through subsequent feature analysis.

All of the noisy features used in the recognition system are effectively compensated. The speech corruption in the log domain such as the 24 log-filterbank coefficients and the log-energy feature can be modeled as a nonlinear model. For efficient estimating noise parameter using the subsequent sequential Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, the nonlinear environment model is linearized by the truncated first-order vector Taylor series (VTS) approximation. Due to the cepstral features are nearly independence, we train the clean speech using cepstral features and the log-energy feature, and then obtain a diagonal Gaussian mixture model in the log domain by taking inverse discrete cosine transform (IDCT). The experiments are conducted on the large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) system. Results demonstrate that it achieves attractive improvements when compared with CMN (cepstral mean normalization) and the batch-EM based compensation approach.

In MIMO systems, the channel estimation is important to distinguish transmit signals from multiple transmit antennas. While the Space-Alternating Generalized Expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm is known to offer good channel estimation and data detection. We proposed earlier the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE)-based SAGE algorithm for MIMO systems where the MMSE estimation is used for channel estimation. We showed that the proposed MMSE-based SAGE algorithm can achieve the better bit error rate (BER) than the maximum likelihood (ML) detection with training symbols. The MMSE channel estimation needs the knowledge of the maximum Doppler frequency F-d for deriving the covariance matrix of the channel and the variance sigma(2) of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Additionally, the computation of the MMSE channel estimation requires O(L-3) operations where L is the transmitted frame length. Thus, its computational complexity is high. In this paper, we propose a Zero-Forcing (ZF)-based SAGE algorithm for channel estimation and data detection in MIMO systems that does not need the knowledge of Fd and sigma(2). Since the computation of the proposed ZF-based SAGE algorithm requires O(N-3) operations where N is the number of transmit antennas, its computational complexity is low. We show that the proposed ZF-based tracking SAGE algorithm with less computational complexity can achieve almost the same BER as that of the MMSE-based tracking SAGE algorithm.

Our main idea is that while computer have the power to search huge amounts of data, an expert has the domain knowledge to efficiently lead this search. Our system builds upon two main components: a probabilistic model able to scale to large datasets and a set of modules to interact with the scientist. Here; we focus on the probabilistic model used to represent the joint uncertainty among the attributes of the objects registered in a sky survey catalog. This model consists of a combination of a Bayesian network and a set of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) trained with an accelerated version of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The model is currently being tested using data from the release 1 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The results indicate that the system is able to accurately detect a set of simulated rare objects, but it also provides a large number of false positives.

However, EM can be rather slow to converge. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm for parameter estimation problems with missing data, which we call Equalization-Maximization (EqM) (for reasons to be explained later). We derive the EqM algorithm in a general context and illustrate its use in the specific case of Gaussian autoregressive time series with a varying amount of missing observations. In the presented examples, EqM outperforms EM in terms of computational speed, at a comparable estimation performance.

This estimation is based on a depth-variant imaging model in three-dimensional optical sectioning microscopy. As a result of the refractive index mismatch between the immersion medium and the mounting medium of the specimen, the imaging model in three-dimensional optical-sectioning microscopy incorporates spherical aberration that worsens with increasing depth under the coverslip and changes in the point spread function (PSF). Two-dimension images restoration and three-dimension serial images restoration are to be used to analyze the capability of the EM-ML algorithm, and the performance shows that the EM-NIL algorithm can restore the blurred of image by the depth variant image model.

One way of helping people in their decisions is the classical query search and filters plugged into various available software in use. Still, the last decision is left to humans where the search for the best alternative is not provided by these queries. The need for a sort of an electronic learner has emerged. Such a type of learner has the main task of deciding for the user which preference (decision) he/she is likely to possess on the basis of other users' preferences (decisions). This field of analysis is called collaborative filtering. Learners have varied in performance and thus in acquiring results on the basis of the different algorithms involved. This article introduces the collaborative filter methods, also called recommender systems. Few publications and research have been elaborated on this topic, but the available studies are encouraging.

The model permits a simultaneous model-based clustering of lower- and higher-level units. Lower-level observations within higher-level units are assumed to be mutually independent given cluster membership of the higher-level units. The proposed model can be seen as a finite mixture model in which the prior class membership probabilities are assumed to be random, which makes it very similar to the grade-of-membership (GoM) model. The new model is illustrated with an example from organizational psychology.

In this work, we apply the Wiener filter in place of the EM algorithm to improve the timing performance. The algorithm works well in patient studies. After fully automatic blind deblurring, the conspicuity of the submillimeter features of the cochlea image is substantially improved. The new ENR-Wiener blind deblurring approach significantly improves the computation speed with comparable image quality in previous studies.

The technique relies on the combination of one and a half-worth of Chirp transform of the signal and an Expectation Maximization-driven blind identification algorithm, in such a way that it carries out the chirplet estimation in-segment. The mechanism resembles stereo processing while keeping an interesting biological parallel with auditory cortex artificial models. This technique applied on a short-time processing basis is shown to be accurate at identifying the TT composition of a bat echolocation chirp. The proposed technique represents the initial basis for the development of a parallel hierarchic processing for more ambitious objectives.

The MIMIC-LCA model includes features of a typical LCA model and also introduces a new relation between the latent class and covariates. In other words, a logistic regression type of analysis between participants' categorical latent status and their background information is added. Detailed statistical setups of the MIMIC-LCA model and algorithmic procedures are derived. The model features, parameter estimations, and model selections for MIMIC-LCA models are also presented. Specifically, the MIMIC-LCA model is estimated by a generalized expectation-maximization algorithm under the maximum likelihood frameworks. A substantive application of the MIMIC-LCA model in diagnosing alcoholics and, in particular, examining potential risk factors for alcoholism is demonstrated.

While many previous image fusion approaches perform the fusion on a frame-by-frame basis, this method considers optimum use of neighboring frames to incorporate temporal as well as sensor fusion. This fusion scheme is based on a statistical image formation model. The multiple sensor image frames are described as the true scene corrupted by additive non-Gaussian distortion. ne expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate the parameters in the model and to produce the final fused result. The experimental results showed that the EM-based multi-frame image fusion scheme has significant advantage in terms of sensor noise reduction.

Many clustering methods have been proposed in the last few decades with different backgrounds. An open problem in clustering field is the lack of a benchmark for contrasting all these algorithms as well as other available ones. In this paper, we use the well-known Log Marginal Likelihood (LML) score and classification accuracy as two criteria of comparison. Experiment results on K-Means, Expectation Maximization (EM) and Farthest-First in the t-test show that EM outperforms other two algorithms on most of the benchmark data sets with respect to both criteria. Considering the performance and comprehensibility of EM, it is an ideal model that could be used in many real world applications.

The estimation of parameters is an important step for mixture distributions. The latent class model is generally used as the analysis of mixture distributions for discrete data. In this paper, we consider the parameter estimation for a mixture of logistic regression models. We know that the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm was most used for estimating the parameters of logistic regression mixture models. In this paper, we propose a new type of fuzzy class model and then derive an algorithm for the parameter estimation of a fuzzy class logistic regression model. The effects of the explanatory variables on the response variables are described. The focus is on binary responses for the logistic regression mixture analysis with a fuzzy class model. An algorithm, called a fuzzy classification maximum likelihood (FCML), is then created. The mean squared error (MSE) based accuracy criterion for the FCML and EM algorithms to the parameter estimation of logistic regression mixture models are compared using the samples drawn from logistic regression mixtures of two classes.

The two 3-D image reconstruction algorithms were ordered-subsets expectation-maximization (3D-OSEM) and 3-D reprojection (3DRP) algorithms. The two rebinning algorithms were Fourier rebinning (FORE) and single slice rebinning (SSRB). The 3-D projection data used for this work were acquired with a high-resolution PET scanner (MDAPET) with an intrinsic transaxial resolution of 2.8 mm. The scanner has 14 detector rings covering an axial field-of-view of 38.5 mm. We scanned three phantoms: 1) a uniform cylindrical phantom with inner diameter of 21.5 cm; 2) a uniform 11.5-cm cylindrical phantom with four embedded small hot lesions with diameters of 3, 4, 5, and 6 mm; and 3) the 3-D Hoffman brain phantom with three embedded small hot lesion phantoms with diameters of 3, 5, and 8.6 mm in a warm background. Lesions were placed at different radial and axial distances. We evaluated the different reconstruction methods for MDAPET camera by comparing the noise level of images, contrast recovery, and hot lesion detection, and visually compared images. We found that overall the 3D-OSEM algorithm, especially when images post filtered with the Metz filter, produced the best results in terms of contrast-noise tradeoff, and detection of hot spots, and reproduction of brain phantom structures. Even though the MDAPET camera has a relatively small maximum axial acceptance (+/- 5 deg), images produced with the 3DRP algorithm had slightly better contrast recovery and reproduced the structures of the brain phantom slightly better than the faster 2-D rebinning methods.

Previous studies by other groups have shown that there are stereochemical constraints that confine local protein structures to a limited range of conformations. Furthermore, the results of many groups have demonstrated that the sequence-to-structure relationship remains detectable to some extent on a local level. By studying the conformational space of local Protein structures, we may obtain More information concerning the constraints on local structural space and the sequence-to-structure mapping, hence facilitate ab initio structure prediction. In this study, we propose a novel algorithm that automatically discovers recurrent pentamer structures in proteins. The algorithm starts by applying Expectation-Maximization (EM) clustering to the distances between non-adjacent backbone Calpha atoms in a large set of pentamer fragments. A rough partition of the conformation space can thus be derived. In the second stage, by applying a split-and-merge algorithm, we can obtain a finite number of clusters and guarantee the homogeneity and distinctiveness of each one. Each cluster of protein structures is represented by a centroid structure. The results show that, with 40 major representative structures, we can approximate most of the protein fragments with an error of 0.378 Angstrom. With only 20 types of structures, the fragment structures can still be modeled at 0.44 Angstrom, which is comparable to or better than the performance of previous methods. We term the representatives "building blocks." On the global level, we demonstrate that by concatenating different combinations of building blocks, we can model whole protein structures at high resolution: a resolution of 2.54 Angstrom can be achieved simply by using 10 types of building blocks. This finding suggests that the study of molecular structures can be hugely simplified using this reduced representation.

Contrary to the classical approach to linear dynamic systems analysis, in which high-dimensional exact solutions are sought, the model presented here is developed from a social science framework where low-dimensional approximate solutions are preferred. Borrowing concepts from the theory on mixture distributions, the linear dynamic model can be viewed as a multi-layered regression model, in which the output variables are imprecise manifestations of an unobserved continuous process. An additional layer of mixing makes it possible to incorporate non-normal as well as ordinal variables. Using the EM-algorithm, we find estimates of the unknown model parameters, simultaneously providing stability estimates. The model is very general and cannot be well estimated by other estimation methods. We illustrate the applicability of the obtained procedure through an example with generated data.

J	Fearnhead, P				Fearnhead, P			A second-order approximation to the log-likelihood surface for mixture models, with application to the EM algorithm	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS			English	Article						CEMM; Gauss-Newton; observed information; SAGE	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; ECM	This article considers a new approximation to the log-likelihood surface in mixture models. This approximation is based on both the mean and variance of the full-data log-likelihood over imputations of assignments of observations to components. This approximation is accurate to second order, and holds for general missing data problems. The approximation provides a new method for calculating the observed information using the EM algorithm, and motivates a Gauss-Newton method for finding the MLE. This Gauss-Newton method is implemented together with the ideas behind the SAGE algorithm. The resulting algorithm outperforms the EM, CEMM, and a further Gauss-Newton algorithm when analyzing data from three-component Gaussian mixtures.

In addition to being easy to implement, the algorithms increase the log-likelihood with each iteration. The paper also compares various estimators with Monte Carlo experiments. Contrary to Maddala and Mount's (J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 68 (1973) 324) Monte Carlo results for estimators of an error-components model with uncorrelated remainder terms, when the remainder terms are autocorrelated, maximum-likelihood is found to be superior to two-step feasible generalized least-squares estimation.

This now enables optimal estimation for the triefficiency criterion used to appraise robust estimators. The effect of improved estimation for the one-wild case is investigated. Simulations are conducted, both to illustrate the operation of the algorithm, and to reinvestigate the properties of three common location estimates. In particular, the scaling constant c = 6 in the one-step biweight M-estimator used in procedures such as loess, is shown to be too small under the triefficiency criterion. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

LME is different from Jaynes' maximum entropy principle, standard maximum likelihood, and maximum a posteriori probability estimation. We demonstrate the LME principle by deriving new algorithms for mixture model estimation, and show how robust new variants of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm can be developed. We show that a regularized version of LME (RLME), is effective at estimating mixture models. It generally yields better results than plain LME, which in turn is often better than maximum likelihood and maximum a posterior estimation, particularly when inferring latent variable models from small amounts of data.

The analysis of the complications from which a randomized experiment can suffer is attractive, because it is not only limited to a randomized trial analysis. The template of a randomized experiment with imperfect compliance can be adopted in fact to identify and estimate causal effects also in observational studies. More, some complications like the presence of non-responses in the treatment and/or in the assignment to treatment are more plausible in the context of an observational Study than in a randomized trial. From the theoretical point of view the complications in expliciting the likelihood function when the inference is based on ignorability conditions for the missing data mechanism are discussed. Then the inputs for implementing the EM algorithm and examples based on artificial data are presented. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Traffic is assumed to be generated or absorbed only in the zones and nowhere else in the network. Traffic volumes between zones over a fixed period of time are modeled as independent random variables with unknown means which it is desired to estimate. For each zone, the volume of all incoming and outgoing traffic is counted on a regular basis but no information about the origin or destination of the observed traffic is used. Procedures are suggested for a regular update of estimates of the N(N - 1) mean traffic demands between the zones on the basis of an incoming stream of the 2N traffic counts. The procedures are based on an exponential smoothing scheme and are reminiscent of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm if smoothing is removed. Fast and reliable numerical algorithms, based on the conjugate gradient method, are presented for normal as well as for Poisson traffic demands. The Poisson case is linked with entropy maximization. Computational tests based on simulated data demonstrate both the numerical and statistical efficiency of the procedures.

To mitigate this problem, several learning methods have been proposed to effectively use unlabeled data that can be inexpensively collected. In these methods, however, only static data have been considered; time series unlabeled data cannot be dealt with by these methods. Focusing on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), in this paper we first present an extension of HMMs, named Extended Tied-Mixture HMMs (ETM-HMMs), in which both labeled and unlabeled time series data can be utilized simultaneously. We also formally derive a learning algorithm for the ETM-HMMs based on the maximum likelihood framework. Experimental results using synthetic and real time series data show that we can obtain a certainly better classification accuracy when unlabeled time series data are added to labeled training data than the case only labeled data are used.

A new model for the identification Of 3' splice sites ( acceptors) using Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM) was introduced. This model is proved to be particularly suitable for modeling the biological structure of acceptors. When tested in Burset/Guigo dataset, this new method demonstrated an improved accuracy compared with existing method. The success of this model gives a deep understanding of the structure of acceptors and the biological process Of splicing.

J	Lin, N; Bailey, BA; He, XM; Buttlar, WG				Lin, N; Bailey, BA; He, XM; Buttlar, WG			Adjustment of measuring devices with linear models	TECHNOMETRICS			English	Article						adjustment; EM algorithm; linear regression; multivariate normal; pavement; prediction		We consider the problem of linear calibration or adjustment of two measuring devices based on a sample of replicated measurements. Linear adjustments are routinely used in the pavement industry. A simple solution based on linear regression of the average measurements of one device on the other has been used by field engineers. To address the statistical concern that the regression parameter estimates are biased due to attenuation, we consider a more sophisticated multivariate model to obtain asymptotically unbiased estimates of the calibration parameters. The maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of the multivariate model are computed with the EM algorithm. Simulation studies and asymptotic calculations are used to compare properties of the MLE with the simple regression method. Data from two measuring devices used for determining asphalt pavement density, coring and nuclear gauge, are used in an example. We find that the superiority in parameter estimation of the MLE does not always result in better adjustments. In typical applications, such as determining pavement density, the simple regression method is highly competitive and often performs better than the multivariate MLE in adjusting the measurements from a cruder device despite its bias problem.

The algorithm springs from a simplification of the well-known EM algorithm, in which the expectation step of the EM is substituted by a modal step. This avoids awkward integrations when the error distribution is assumed to be general. The sequences generated by the estimating procedure proposed here define our objective system, which is piecewise linear. The study tackles the system's asymptotic stability as well as its speed of convergence to the equilibrium point. In this sense, to reduce the speed of convergence, we propose an alternative estimating procedure. Numerical examples illustrate the theoretical results, compare the proposed procedures and analyze the precision of the estimate. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For each of a number of past releases, weekly data are present on the number of such reports. Based on the type of data that is present, we construct a stochastic model for the weekly number of problems to be reported. The (non-parametric) maximum likelihood estimator for the crucial model parameter, the intensity of an inhomogeneous Poisson process, is defined. Moreover, the expectation maximization algorithm is described, which can be used to compute this estimate. The method is illustrated using simulated data. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

Unfortunately, conventional learning algorithms do not easily incorporate prior information, if this information is too vague to be encoded as properties that are local to families of variables. For instance, conventional algorithms do not exploit prior information about repetitive structures, which are often found in object oriented domains such as computer networks, large pedigrees and genetic analysis. In this paper we propose a method for doing structural learning in object oriented domains. It is demonstrated that this method is more efficient than conventional algorithms in such domains, and it is argued that the method supports a natural approach for expressing and incorporating prior information provided by domain experts.

Throughout, we assume that missingness is restricted to the outcome variable and that the covariates are fully observed. Although maximum likelihood estimation of the regression parameters is possible once joint models for the outcome variable and the nonignorable missing data mechanism have been specified, these models are fundamentally nonidentifiable unless unverifiable modeling assumptions are imposed. In this paper, rather than explicitly modeling the nonignorable missingness mechanism, we consider the use of a 'protective' estimator of the regression parameters (Brown, 1990). To implement the proposed method, it is necessary to assume that the outcome variable and one of the covariates have an approximate bivariate normal distribution, conditional on the remaining covariates. In addition, it is assumed that the missing data mechanism is conditionally independent of this covariate, given the outcome variable and the remaining covariates; the latter is referred to as the 'protective' assumption. A method of moments approach is used to obtain the protective estimator of the regression parameters; the jackknife (Quenouille, 1956) is used to estimate the variance. The method is illustrated using data on the persistence of maternal smoking from the Six Cities Study of the health effects of air pollution (Ware et al., 1984). The results of a simulation study are presented that examine the magnitude of any finite sample bias.

J	Pouloukas, S				Pouloukas, S			Estimation and comparison of lognormal parameters in the presence of censored data	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION			English	Article						EM algorithm; equality of medians; ML estimates; skewness parameter	LIMITS	It is assumed that k(k > 2) independent samples of sizes n(i)(i = 1,..., k) are available from k lognormal distributions. Four hypothesis cases (H-1-H-4) are defined. Under H-1, all k median parameters as well as all k skewness parameters are equal; under H-2, all k skewness parameters are equal but not all k median parameters are equal; under H-3, all k median parameters are equal but not all k skewness parameters are equal; under H-4, neither the k median parameters nor the k skewness parameters are equal. The Expectation Maximization ( EM) algorithm is used to obtain the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the lognormal parameters in each of these four hypothesis cases. A (2k-1) degree polynomial is solved at each step of the EM algorithm for the H3 case. A two-stage procedure for testing the equality of the medians either under skewness homogeneity or under skewness heterogeneity is also proposed and discussed. A simulation study was performed for the case k = 3.	Intercollege, Dept Comp Sci & Math, Nicosia, Cyprus	Pouloukas, S (reprint author), Intercollege, Dept Comp Sci & Math, Nicosia, Cyprus.

The receiver employs the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for joint channel and data recovery. It makes collective use of the data and channel constraints that characterize the communication problem. The data constraints include pilots, the finite alphabet constraint, and space-time block coding. The channel constraints include the finite delay spread and frequency and time correlation. The receiver employs an EM-based Kalman filter for channel estimation. The receiver is able to recover the channel (which varies from one space-time block to the next) and the data with no latency and to reduce the number of pilots needed. Simulations show that the receiver outperforms other least-squares based iterative receivers.

The shapes are represented using both geometrical and a symbolic primitives, that are encapsulated in a two layer hierarchical architecture. Each primitive is modelled so as to allow a degree of articulated freedom using a polar point distribution model that captures how the primitive movement varies over a training set. Each segment is assigned a symbolic label to distinguish its identity, and the overall shape is represented by a configuration of labels. We demonstrate how both the point-distribution model and the symbolic labels can be combined to perform recognition using a probabilistic hierarchical algorithm. This involves recovering the parameters of the point distribution model that minimise an alignment error, and recovering symbol configurations that minimise a structural error. We apply the recognition method to human moving skeleton.	Univ York, York YO1 5DD, N Yorkshire, England	Al-Shaher, AA (reprint author), Univ York, York YO1 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.

J	Arslan, O				Arslan, O			Convergence behavior of an iterative reweighting algorithm to compute multivariate M-estimates for location and scatter	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE			English	Article						iterative reweighting algorithm; M estimates; robustness; EM algorithm	EM ALGORITHM; ROBUST ESTIMATION; T-DISTRIBUTION; LIKELIHOOD	The iteratively reweighting algorithm is one of the widely used algorithm to compute the M-estimates for the location and scatter parameters of a multivariate dataset. If the M estimating equations are the maximum likelihood estimating equations from some scale mixture of normal distributions (e.g. from a multivariate t-distribution), the iteratively reweighting algorithm is identified as an EM algorithm and the convergence behavior of which is well established. However, as Tyler (J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 59 (1997) 550) pointed out, little is known about the theoretical convergence properties of the iteratively reweighting algorithms if it cannot be identified as an EM algorithm. In this paper, we consider the convergence behavior of the iteratively reweighting algorithm induced from the M estimating equations which cannot be identified as an EM algorithm. We give some general results on the convergence properties and, we show that convergence behavior of a general iteratively reweighting algorithm induced from the M estimating equations is similar to the convergence behavior of an EM algorithm even if it cannot be identified as an EM algorithm.

Such an approach is based on a closed-loop process composed of three main steps: 1) pre-processing based on a controlled adaptive iterative filtering-, 2) comparison between multitemporal images according to a standard log-ratio operator; 3) automatic analysis of the log-ratio image for generating the change-detection map. The first step aims at reducing the speckle noise in a controlled way in order to maximize the separability between changed and unchanged classes. The second step is devoted to compare the two filtered images in order to generate a log-ratio image. Finally, the third step deals with the automatic selection of the decision threshold to be applied to the log-ratio image. This selection is carried out according to a novel formulation of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm under the assumption that changed and unchanged classes follow Generalized Gaussian (GG) distributions. Experimental results on real ERS-2 SAR images confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The goal was to devise a system with superb resolution and sensitivity that could be used for the imaging of murine organs. METHODS: In the center of a triple detector SPECT system, a cylindrical collimator is placed containing 75 gold micro-pinhole apertures. The detectors are divided into sub-cameras, by taking care of that each pinhole projects on a limited area. Radiation shielding prevents overlapping of the projections. The resulting mini pinhole cameras focus to the center of the field-of-view (FOV). The pinholes are arranged in _5 rings of 44 mm diameter. The high number of focusing cameras result in an excellent sensitivity for a small field-of-view that contains a mouse heart, brain, part of the spine or a tumor. SPECT images are reconstructed using Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (ML-EM) Resolution recovery is performed during reconstruction using measured and interpolated point spread function tables. RESULTS: The peak absolute sensitivity measured with a point source is 0.22 % and remains higher than 0.12 % in the central 12 mm of the central plane. Images of a resolution phantom clearly show 0.5 mm capillaries separated by 0.5 mm. A sufficient number of different projection angles for reconstructing images of mouse organs can be readily acquired without any detector or collimator movement. Images of a mouse spine show Tc-99m-hydroxy-methylene diphosfate uptake down to the level of parts of vertebral processes. Bone uptake of the tracer is clearly separated from tiny structures like the (inter-)vertebral foramen. Myocardial perfusion in the left and right ventricular wall, and in structures as small as papillary muscles can be observed in Tc-99m tetrofosmin images. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first SPECT scanner to use a highly focused multiple gold micro-pinhole collimation, dedicated to the imaging of mouse organs, at a higher resolution than can be reached with state-of-the-art small animal PET. The combination of imaging characteristics of this prototype system (resolution and sensitivity) opens up new possibilities for the study of animal models. It allows differentiation between the uptake of various structures of about one micro-liter. The system can be transformed from clinical triple detector SPECT system to the U-SPECT-1 setup within ten minutes. This means that our new animal imaging set-up is both flexible and cost-effective.

In general, cross talk between adjacent detector pixels and scintillation short-term afterglow can cause resolution degradation and artifacts. Crosstalk effect becomes significant while using detector arrays with small pixels. Short-term afterglow becomes significant with high rotation speed, especially while using focal spot modulation between successive frames. In these cases of small pixels and high rotation speed, the signals of detector pixels are relatively noisy. Thus, attempt to correct cross talk and afterglow by using techniques based on inverse filters or on subtraction of constant fraction of the adjacent pixel signals, may give poor results. We developed cross talk and afterglow deconvolution correction algorithm, applied on the scanner raw data. The algorithm is based on the Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization method (MLEM) and is similar to the Lucy-Richardson deconvolution in image restoration. We show that the results significantly improve the image resolution of fine bone structures.

The small size of these satellites makes them unresolvable by ground-based imaging systems. The core concept of using Non-Imaging Measurements (NIM) to gather information about these objects comes from the fact that after reflection on a satellite surface, the reflected light contains information about the surface materials of the satellite. This approach of using NIM for satellite evaluation is relatively new. In this paper, we discuss the accuracy of using these spectral measurements to match an unknown spectrum to a database containing known spectra. Several approaches have been developed and are presented in this paper. The first method is an artificial neural network designed to process central moments of real measured spectra. This spectrum database is the Spica database provided by the Maui Surveillance Site (MSSS), Hawaii USA and consists in spectra from more than 100 different satellites. The average rate of correct identification is 84%. The second approach is based on the ability of spectral signal processing to estimate relative abundances of materials from the measurement of a single spectrum; this method is called spectral unmixing. Material spectra were provided by the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) to create synthetic spectra. An approach based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm was used to estimate relative abundances and presence of materials in a synthetic spectrum. The results for material identification and abundance estimation are presented as a function of signal-to-noise ratio. For the EM method, the overall correct estimation rate is 95.1% and the average error on the fractional composition estimation is 19.7%.

In [16] it has been demonstrated that an unlabeled set improves classification accuracy significantly with only a small labeled training set. However, the Bayesian method used in [16] assumes that text documents are generated from a mixture model and there is a one-to-one correspondence between the mixture components and the classes. This may not be the case in many applications. In many real-life applications, a class may cover documents from many different topics, which violates the one-to-one correspondence assumption. In such cases, the resulting classifiers can be quite poor. In this paper, we propose a clustering based partitioning technique to solve the problem. This method first partitions the training documents in a hierarchical fashion using hard clustering. After running the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm in each partition, it prunes the tree using the labeled data. The remaining tree nodes or partitions are likely to satisfy the one-to-one correspondence condition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method is able to achieve a dramatic gain in classification performance.

The measurements of myocardial wall thickness and myocardial infarct size were used to estimate the accuracy of the absolute and relative quantitative accuracy, respectively. A series of phantom studies were performed and additional information was gathered from a group of 37 normal patients. Each set of data was reconstructed with (1) filtered-back projection (FBP), (2) ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM), (3) OSEM plus attenuation correction (AC), (4) OSEM plus detector response compensation (DRC), (5) OSEM plus AC and DRC, and (6) OSEM plus AC, DRC and scatter correction (SC). The image analysis toolbox iQuant was used to perform the analysis. Both patient and phantom data showed SPECT image corrections to have a significant effect on myocardial wall thickness, with reconstructions involving SC providing the most accurate results. Phantom data showed that good estimates of anterior and lateral wall infarct sizes are provided by all reconstruction techniques, whereas good estimates of inferior and septal wall infarct sizes are only provided by reconstructions including AC. Accurate measurement of infarcts in any location and of any size is only possible with SC. This analysis suggests that in order to achieve perfect quantitative accuracy of myocardial perfusion studies, corrections for photon attenuation, distance-dependent resolution loss and photon scatter should be applied. However, for routine clinical analysis involving visual interpretation and an estimate of infarct size, the application of attenuation correction and detector resolution compensation might be considered sufficient.

We propose to test a more flexible model that allows for the variation of the magnitude of the HRF with time. Under this model, the magnitude of the HRF evoked by a single event may vary with other occurrences of the same kind of event. This model is tested against a simpler model with a fixed magnitude. We develop a stochastic version of the EM algorithm to identify the magnitudes and the HRF. We also address the problem of model specification. It is usually assumed that every event type evokes a response. Our scheme uses a model selection approach which provides the best subset of event types maximizing the likelihood of the fMRI signal. Our methodology is exemplified by simulated and fMRI data.	Univ Paris 11, Math Lab, F-91405 Orsay, France	Donnet, S (reprint author), Univ Paris 11, Math Lab, Bat 425, F-91405 Orsay, France.

The proposed technique is compared to various other techniques in several experiments, where it performs robustly. Several comparison methods are outperformed. In addition to robust template tracking it has wider applications to advanced techniques such as AAMs and deformable templates.

Standard methods use least squares or maximum likelihood estimates. Theoretically, maximum likelihood is known to result in more efficient estimates than least squares. In the interval mapping literature, some authors state that both methods yield equivalent results, whereas other authors emphasize the higher efficiency of maximum likelihood. The present paper investigates differences of both methods more closely. We show by example the occurrence of multiple LOD-Score profiles when applying maximum likelihood estimation methods for a basic interval mapping and composite interval mapping model. This analysis results in some peaks of the LOD-Score profile that distinctly differ from F-statistic profiles without being spurious. A spurious profile for IM and CIM was found as well. It is concluded that users of IM and CIM mapping software must be prepared for the rare occurrence of spurious solutions in LOD profiles. The example indicates that especially in sparse marker maps maximum likelihood estimation has a potential to result in non-spurious profiles that are not similar to the F-statistic profiles. However, the discrimination of spurious and non-spurious further profiles is not straightforward in applications. Until the mathematical background of this phenomenon is investigated more thoroughly and rules to ascertain the information content of these additional solutions have been developed, the simultaneous use of the least squares and ML methods may caution against the rare occurrence of spurious results.

EM ALGORITHM; RETRIEVAL	As large collections of videos become one key component of digital libraries, there is an urgent need of semantic video classification and feature subset selection to enable more effective video database organization and retrieval. However, most existing techniques for classifier training require a large number of labeled samples to learn correctly and suffer from the problems of context and concept uncertainty when only a limited number of labeled samples are available. To address the problems of context and concept uncertainty, we have proposed a novel framework to achieve incremental classifier training by integrating a limited number of labeled samples with a large number of unlabeled samples. Specifically, the contributions of this paper include: (a) Using the salient objects to achieve a middle-level understanding of video contents and enhance the quality of features on discriminating among different semantic video concepts; (b) Modeling the semantic video concepts by using the finite mixture models to approximate the class distributions of the relevant salient objects; (c) Developing an adaptive EM algorithm to integrate the unlabeled samples to enable incremental classifier training and address the problem of context uncertainty; (d) Proposing a cost-sensitive video classification technique to address the problem of concept uncertainty over time; (e) Supporting automatic video annotation via semantic classification. Our experimental results in a certain domain of medical education videos have also been provided a convincing proof of our conclusions.

The proposed approach is based on modifying Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to approximate an empirical probability density function of scalar data with a linear combination of Gaussians (LCG). We also propose a novel EM-bascd sequential technique to get a close initial LCG approximation the modi ed EM algorithm should start with. Due to both positive and negative components, the LCG approximates inter class transitions more accurately than a conventional mixture of only positive Gaussians. Experiments on simulated images demonstrate the accuracy of our approach.

Finite mixture models can be applied to image segmentation. which can be considered a sort of blind classification, which is useful when there is no a priori information available about the materials in the scene. However. the GMM approach can be insufficient for many HSI data sets since the Gaussian has fixed narrow tails. uncharacteristic of operational HSI data. Elliptically contoured distribution,; (ECDs). specifically the multivariate t, have been shown to better fit HSI data. In this paper we develop mixtures of ECDs for the task of robustly modeling hyperspectral image data. An approach based on the EM algorithm is developed for concurrently estimating all parameters in a t mixture. assuming nothing but that the number of components are known. Results from the automatic segmentation of AVIRIS data illustrate the utility of t mixture models using this EM approach for parameter estimation.

In this work, we implemented a method for iterative image reconstruction using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, but using a factorization of the system matrix, in order to include resolution modeling. The system matrix is thus the product of a simple geometric matrix and a convolution matrix, modeling finite resolution effects. The multiplication of the latter by an image is equivalent to performing a convolution in image-space by a shift-invariant symmetric kernel. This method is compared with the standard Filtered Backprojection (FBP) algorithm and with the EM algorithm without resolution modeling (''standard EM"). Tests were performed with point source data measured in the RPC-PET prototype and with synthesized data. Results indicate that the EM algorithm with resolution modeling performs better than its analytical counterpart and the standard EM algorithm, with an improvement of more than 25% in image spatial resolution for two point sources, achieving under 0.4 mm FWHM. In simulations with other object geometries, the images obtained with resolution modeling had the lowest noise levels.

We demonstrate that after applying a polynomial embedding to the correspondences they become related by the so-called multibody trilinear constraint and its associated multibody trifocal tensor We show how to linearly estimate the multibody trifocal tensor from point-point-point correspondences. We then show that one can estimate the epipolar lines associated with each image point from the common root of a set of univariate polynomials and the epipoles by solving a plane clustering problem in R-3 using GPCA. The individual trifocal tensors are then obtained from the second order derivatives of the multibody trilinear constraint. Given epipolar lines and epipoles, or trifocal tensors, we obtain an initial clustering of the correspondences, which we use to initialize an iterative algorithm that finds an optimal estimate for the trifocal tensors and the clustering of the correspondences using Expectation Maximization. We test our algorithm on real and synthetic dynamic scenes.

The model is a partially observable Markov decision process, or POMDR A POMDP is a stochastic planner used by an agent to relate its actions and utility function to its observations and to other context. Video observations are integrated into the POMDP using a dynamic Bayesian network that creates spatial and temporal abstractions of the input sequences. The parameters of the model are learned from training data using an a-posteriori constrained optimization technique based on the expectation-maximization algorithm. The training does not require facial display labels on the training data. The learning process discovers clusters of facial display sequences and their relationship to the context automatically. This avoids the need for human intervention in training data collection, and allows the models to be used without modification for facial display learning in any context without prior knowledge of the type of behaviors to be used. We present an experimental paradigm in which we record two humans playing a game, and learn the POMDP model of their behaviours. The learned model correctly predicts human actions during a simple cooperative card game based, in part, on their facial displays.

Its implementation is essentially based on the standard Kalman filter techniques. However, the estimation accuracy is degraded if unknown parameters present in the system model or the model changes with the environment as in the case of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In this paper, we propose an expectation-maximization (EM) based interacting multiple model (IMM) method, namely, EM-IMM algorithm, to jointly identify the unknown parameters and to estimate the position information. The IMM is capable of identifying states in jumping dynamic models corresponding to various vehicle driving status, while the EM algorithm is employed to give the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the unknown parameters. Compared to the conventional single model Kalman filter based navigation, the proposed algorithm gives improved estimation performance when the land-vehicle drives with changing conditions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Two strategies for doing motion-corrected image reconstruction are compared. In the first strategy, separate images are reconstructed from the measurements at each time frame. They are then consolidated by post-registration and averaging procedures. In the second strategy, we incorporate parameters to describe the effects of motion into the statistical model of the projections. Joint maximum likelihood estimation of image and motion parameters is then carried out. Each of these strategies involves the minimization of non-convex cost functions. Accordingly, we also propose some relevant optimization algorithm design options.

In the proposed system, hand gestures are represented by the 3D trajectories of blobs. Blobs are obtained by tracking colored body parts in real-time using the EM algorithm. In most of the studies on hand gestures, only small vocabularies have been used In this paper, we study the results obtained on a more complex database of mono- and bi-manual gestures. These results are obtained by using a state-of-the-art sequence processing algorithm, namely Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), implemented within the framework of an open source machine learning library.

Because of low contrast to noise ratio we utilize information about dynamics of tracer uptake present in PET studies. We compare three methods: expectation-maximization algorithm (EM), fuzzy C-means algorithm (FCM) and independent component analysis (ICA). Particularly, our interest was in segmentation of the striatum and cerebellum structures. The methods were applied to a Monte Carlo simulated phantom image and to five different human PET studies. We were able to extract striatum with the EM algorithm and ICA satisfactorily from all PET studies. With the FCM algorithm striatum could not be differentiated to its own class. The cerebellum was found only with ICA from the simulated image. ICA seemed to be less sensitive to noise of all the studied methods. The EM algorithm was most sensitive to patient movement in the human PET studies. The EM algorithm and ICA seemed promising for the segmentation task when taking low contrast to noise ratios of the PET images into account.

Methods: We chose 30 patients with a history of prostate cancer who had undergone CT/MR and simultaneous Tc-99m RBC/In-111 ProstaScint SPECT scans due to rising PSA. To estimate the impact of reconstruction methods on anatomic definition and artifacts, SPECT volume data sets were reconstructed using ordered set-expectation maximization (OS-EM) with varying numbers of iterations and subsets, and these were compared against each other and against standard filtered back projection (FBP) reconstruction. Non-blood pool bladder activity in the Tc-99m scans was suppressed prior to subtraction from the In-111 scans by using an averaging algorithm within an ellipsoid volume encompassing the bladder. Outside the ellipsoid volume, Tc-99m voxel values were subtracted from the corresponding In-111 voxels after normalization of the data sets based on peak activity within the descending aorta. Results: OS-EM reconstruction using 3 iterations and 45 subsets showed improved representation of anatomy compared with FBP. Bladder suppression reduced artifacts in the prostate bed. The subtraction method reduced the blood pool signal, confirmed visually by superimposition with matched CT/MR scans. Conclusions: OS-EM reconstruction together with bladder suppression and subtraction of the blood pool may help improve the specificity of ProstaScint SPECT interpretation and increase its utility in radiation therapy treatment planning.

Difficulties in making such assessments often occur when the ground truth or gold standard is either unknown or inaccurate. Motivated by commonly used image restoration approaches, we developed an image analysis technique, which, instead of assessing the obtained results, directly assesses the technique itself by testing its validity it with the fundamental imaging principles which are well defined. We conducted a statistical investigation into MR imaging, starting from the data domain and proceeding to the image domain, and derived several intrinsic statistical properties of MR images. Based on them, we further proved a Finite Normal Mixture (FNM) model (in terms of pixel intensities and their independence) and a Markov random field (MRF) model (in terms of pixel intensities and their correlation) for MR images, and developed Expectation-Maximization (EM) and Iterated Conditional Modes (ICM) algorithms for FNM and MRF model-based image analysis. The results obtained by applying these algorithms to real MR images demonstrated that this image analysis technique can generate results which accurately fit the true objects.

Several nonparametric algorithms have recently been developed to deal with the missing-data problem. They include, for example, GAPES for gapped data and PG-APES, PG-CAPON for periodically gapped data. However, they are not really suitable for the general missing-data problem where the missing data samples occur in arbitrary patterns. In this paper, we deal with a general missing-data spectral estimation problem for which we develop two nonparametric missing-data amplitude and phase estimation (MAPES) algorithms, both of which make use of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

The term 'coarsened' is used here to refer to the case where the exact value of the covariate of interest is not fully observed. Instead, only some set or grouping that contains the exact value is observed. In particular, we propose a likelihood-based method for estimating regression parameters in a generalized linear model relating the mean of the outcome to covariates. We outline Newton-Raphson and EM algorithms for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of the regression parameters. We also compare and contrast this likelihood-based approach with two somewhat ad hoc procedures: a complete-case analysis in which individuals with coarsened data are excluded and estimation is based on the remaining 'complete cases', and a coarsened data regression model in which the covariate values for all the complete cases are coarsened and then included in a regression model relating the mean to the coarsened covariate. The methodology that is presented is motivated by coarsened data on the racial-ethnicity categorization of patients in the US's National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, a study to examine the medical care that is provided to a patient in a physician's office. In this study, the outcome of interest is the level of tests (none, non-invasive tests or invasive tests) ordered for the patient at the doctor's visit. One of the covariates of interest is the patient's four-level discrete covariate comprised of four racial-ethnicity categories: white-Hispanic, white-non-Hispanic, African-American-Hispanic and African-American-non-Hispanic. However, of the 19 095 patients in the sample, 14 955 (or 78%) have the exact category of race-ethnicity recorded and 4140 (or 22%) have race-ethnicity coarsened. For the latter group of 4140 individuals, the ethnicity is not recorded, but we know that 3683 are white and 457 are African-American.

In this paper, we introduce a new class of kernel functions and try to build a three-way hybrid between the EM algorithm, regression trees, and the new kernel functions. Instead of using linear output and least squares error function, we introduce nonlinear sigmoid function and cross entropy error function into radial basis function (RBF) network. The new resulting network is easy to use, and has favorable classification accuracy. Numerical experiments show that our new model has better performance than logistic regression in binary classification and has equivalent performance in multiple classification as compared with MLP and other nonparametric classification procedures.

A Gaussian classifier is trained with color samples from just one training image. Then, using a simple diagonal illumination model, the illuminants in a new scene that contains some of the same surface classes are estimated in a Maximum Likelihood framework using the Expectation Maximization algorithm. We also show how to impose priors on the illuminants, effectively computing a Maximum-A-Posteriori estimation.

GAs are adaptive search techniques designed to search for near optimal solutions of large-scale optimization problems with multiple local maxima. It has been shown that GAs are independent of initialization parameters and can efficiently optimize functions in large search spaces while the solution obtained by EM is a function of initial parameters. Hence there is a relatively high likelihood of achieving sub-optimal solution, due to trapping in local maxima. In this work, we propose a combination of Genetic Algorithm with EM (Interlaced GA-EM) to improve estimation of Gaussian mixture parameters. The method uses population of mixture models, rather than a single mixture, iteratively in both GA and EM to determine Gaussian mixture parameters. To assess the performance of the proposed methods, a series of Gaussian phantoms, based on the modified Shepp-Logan method, were created. All proposed methods were employed to estimate the tissue parameters in each phantom. The results indicate that the EM algorithm, as expected, is heavily affected by the initial values. The best result in terms of computational time and accuracy was obtained from Interlaced GA-EM. The proposed method offers an accurate and stable solution for parameter estimation on Gaussian mixture models, with higher likelihood of achieving global optimal minima. Obtaining such accurate parameter estimation is a key requirement for several image segmentation approaches, which rely on a priori knowledge of tissue distribution.

Linear generative models such as independent component analysis (ICA) have shown to capture low level features such as oriented edges in images. However ICA only captures linear dependency due to its linear model constraints and its modeling capability is limited. We propose a new method for capturing nonlinear dependencies in natural images. It is an extension of the linear ICA method and builds on a hierarchical representation. It makes use of lower level linear ICA representation and a subsequent mixture of Laplacian distribution for learning the nonlinear dependencies. The model is learned via the EM algorithm and it can capture variance correlation and high order structures in a consistent manner. We visualize the learned variance structure and demonstrate applications to image segmentation and denoising.

Parameters of these models are usually estimated via the Expectation Maximization algorithm. This algorithm is modified earlier to handle incomplete data. However, the modified algorithm is sensitive to the occurrence of outliers in the data and to the overlap among data classes in the data space. Meanwhile, it requires the number of missing values to be small in order to produce good estimations of the model parameters. Therefore, a new algorithm is proposed in this paper to overcome these problems. A comparison study shows the preference of the proposed algorithm to other algorithms commonly used in the literature including the modified Expectation Maximization algorithm.

Several studies showed that these network features may be correlated and exhibit a certain degree of memory such as bursty losses and delays. The memory and the statistical dependence between losses and temporal delays suggest that the channel may be well modelled by a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with appropriate hidden variables that capture the current state of the network. In this paper we discuss on the effectiveness of using an HMM to model jointly loss and delay behavior of real communication channel. Excellent performance in modelling typical channel behavior in a set of real packet links are observed. The system parameters are found via a modified version of the EM algorithm. Hidden state analysis shows how the state variables characterize channel dynamics. State-sequence estimation is obtained by use of the Viterbi algorithm. Real-time modelling of the channel is the first step to implement adaptive communication strategies.

Linear mixed effects models can be used, assuming a single changepoint for all cases; however, this assumption may be incorrect. The paper describes an extension of linear mixed effects modelling in which random changepoints are integrated into the model as parameters and estimated by using a stochastic EM algorithm. We find that use of this 'mixture modelling' approach improves the fit significantly.

J	Semmelrodt, S				Semmelrodt, S			Maximum likelihood based parameter estimation of stationary and non-stationary multi-component signals	FREQUENZ			English	Article							ALGORITHM	In this paper the problem of extracting signal parameters of stationary and non-stationary signals by applying a parameter estimation scheme is discussed. At first, a Maximum Likelihood based approach is introduced, which combines the most classical spectral analysis tool, the Fourier transform, with a modern parameter estimation scheme, the EM algorithm. After explaining the ideas of local polynomial approximation, an extended signal model is proposed, which considers linear parameter variations in order to extract the evolutional characteristics of a non-stationary signal. By replacing the EM algorithm with its extended derivative the SAGE algorithm, an efficient method for extracting the parameters of superimposed chirp signals is derived. The performance of the novel algorithm is illustrated on the basis of a synthetic test signal. Furthermore, an application to the problem of extracting time-varying parameters of a frequency selective radio channel is presented to show the flexibility of the proposed estimation scheme.

The analysis of the image-sequence input as a single entity, as opposed to a sequence of separate frames, is a unique feature of the proposed framework. Coherent space-time regions in a four-dimensional feature space (intensity, position (x,y), and time) and corresponding coherent segments in the video content are extracted by unsupervised clustering via Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM). The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to determine the parameters of the model according to the maximum likelihood principle. MS lesions are automatically detected, segmented and tracked in time by context-based classification mechanisms. Qualitative and quantitative results of the proposed methodology are shown for a sequence of 24 T2-weighted MR images, which was acquired from a relapsing-remitting MS patient over a period of approximately a year. The validation of the framework was performed by a comparison to an expert radiologist's manual delineation.

But under this assumption, only if a few observed data have big error, the inversion result will become instable. In this paper, we try to use Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to get more precise and robust inversion result based on another statistical distribution. Linear kernel-driven model with t-distribution error solved by EM algorithm is used to prove this new idea. The inversion methods include traditional ML estimate without prior distribution information of inversion parameters and Bayesian inversion based on prior normal distribution. The test about robustness showed that under the assumption of t-distribution error, more than or over half or observed data have big error can cause instability of inversion results.

Even if more powerful, recursive models can be used to account for more complex mappings, it has been argued that the input-output relations underlying most usual natural language pairs are essentially rational. Moreover, the relative simplicity of these mappings has recently lead to the development of techniques for learning finite-state transducers from a training set of input-output sentence pairs of the languages considered. Following these arguments, in the last few years a number of machine translation systems have been developed based on stochastic finite-state transducers. Here we review the statistical statement of Machine Translation and how the corresponding modelling, learning and search problems can be solved by using stochastic finite-state transducers. We also review the results achieved by the systems developed under this paradigm. After presenting the traditional approach, where transducer learning is mainly solved under the grammatical inference framework, we propose a new approach where learning is explicitly considered as a statistical estimation problem and the whole stochastic finite-state transducer learning problem is solved by expectation maximisation.

First, a multi-view face alignment algorithm localizes the face feature points, and then EM algorithm is applied to derive the optimal 3D shape and position parameters. Moreover, the unit quaternion based pose representation is proposed for efficient 3D pose parameter optimization. Compared with other related works, this framework has the following advantages: 1) it is fully automatic, and only one single face image in arbitrary view is required; 2) EM algorithm and unit quaternion based pose representation axe integrated for efficient shape and position parameters estimation; 3) the correspondence between 2D contour points and 3D model vertexes are dynamically determined by normal direction constraints, which facilitates the 3D reconstruction from arbitrary view image; 4) a weighted optimization strategy is applied for more robust parameter estimation. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework for 3D face reconstruction.

The vanishing-point based approach [9] is applied to the visible image to determine the 3D pose of the human head Then the corresponding pose with respect to the infra-red camera is computed through the known relationship by calibration between the visible and infra-red cameras. By doing so, the skin temperature range within the infra-red image can be superimposed over the visible face image. We use the EM strategy to first compute the 3D pose using some initially learned (PCA) model parameters, then update iteratively the parameters for individual persons and their facial expressions till convergence. The EM technique models data uncertainty using Gaussian mixtures defined over positions and orientation of facial plane. The resulting weighted parameters estimation problem is solved using the Levenberg-Marquardt method The results on the synthetic data and real images have verified the performance of the approach.

Results: (1) We design a randomized algorithm for consensus pattern problem. We can show that with high probability, our randomized algorithm finds a pattern in polynomial time with cost error at most e x l for each string, where L is the length of the motif and a can be any positive number given by the user. (2) We design an improved EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm that outperforms the original EM algorithm. (3) We develop a software MotifDetector that uses our randomized algorithm to find good seeds and uses the improved EM algorithm to do local search. We compare MotifDetector with Buhler and Tompa's PROJECTION which is considered to be the best known software for motif detection. Simulations show that MotifDetector is slower than PROJECTION when the pattern length is relatively small, and outperforms PROJECTION when the pattern length becomes large.

Thus, we have developed a method for imaging and quantifying changes in perfusion in the rat lung due to development of the bronchial circulation. A dual-modality micro-CT/SPECT system was used to detect change in perfusion in two groups of rats: controls and those with a surgically occluded left pulmonary artery. Both groups were imaged following injections on separate days i) 2mCi of Tc99m labeled macroaggregated albumin (MAA) into the left carotid artery (IA) and ii) a similar injection into the femoral vein (IV). The IA injection resulted in Tc99m accumulation in capillaries of the systemic circulation including the bronchial circulation, whereas the IV resulted in Tc99m accumulation in the pulmonary capillaries. Ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) was used to reconstruct the SPECT image volumes and a Feldkamp algorithm was used to reconstruct the micro-CT image volumes. The micro-CT and SPECT volumes were registered, the SPECT image volume was segmented using the right and left lung boundaries defined from the micro-CT volume, and the ratio of IA radioactivity accumulation in the left lung to IV radioactivity accumulation in both lungs was used as a measure of left lung flow via the bronchial circulation. This ratio was similar to0.02 for the untreated rats compared to the treated animals that had an increased flow ratio of similar to0.21 40 days after left pulmonary artery occlusion. This increase in flow to the occluded left lung via the bronchial circulation suggests this will be a useful model for further investigating antiangiogenic treatments.

We propose a neural network based tracking algorithm, incorporating interacting multiple model to track both maneuvering and non-maneuvering targets simultaneously in the presence of dense clutter. For data association, we use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and Hopfield network to evaluate assignment weights. All validated measurements are used to update the target state and hence, it avoids the uncertainty about the origin of the measurements. In the proposed approach the data association process is defined to incorporate multiple models for target dynamics and probability density, function (pdf) of an observed data given target state and measurement association, is treated as a mixture pdf. This allows to combine the likelihood of a measurement due to each model, and consequently, it is possible to track any arbitrary trajectory in the presence of dense clutter.

Expanded Bayesian network model is constructed to describe the causal relationship among traffic flows, and then the joint probability distribution between the cause and effect nodes with dimension reduced by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is approximated through Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The parameters of the GMM are learned through Competitive EM algorithm. Experiments show that the expanded Bayesian network method is appropriate and effective for short-term traffic flow forecasting with incomplete data.

In this paper we propose air adaptive skin detection framework, which allows modeling true skin distribution with significantly, higher accuracy and flexibility. First, in adaptive skin model, specific to the image under consideration and refined from the Skin-Similar space, is derived using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and standard Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Then, we develop I Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to identify the skin Gaussian from the trained GMM (with two Gaussian components) by incorporating spatial and shape information of skin pixels. Extensive experimental results performed on large image databases have demonstrated the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed approach.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive skin-detection method, which allows modeling true skin-color distribution with significantly higher accuracy and flexibility than other methods attain. In principle, the proposed method follows a two-step process. For a given image, we first perform a rough skin classification using a generic skin model which defines the Skin-Similar space. In the second step, a Gaussian Mixture, Model (GMM), specific to the image under consideration and refined from the Skin-Similar space, is derived using the standard Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Then, we use an SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier to identify the skin Gaussian from the trained GMM (which contains two Gaussian components) by incorporating spatial and shape information of the skin pixels. This adaptive method can be applied to both still images and video applications. Results of extensive experiments performed on live video sequences and large image databases have demonstrated the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed model.

For QAM-OFDM signaling, the optimal EM algorithm requires high computational complexity due to the inversion of complex matrix executed at each iteration. To avoid this problem, we propose a sub-optimal iterative sequence estimation algorithm with some approximations, which results in reduced computational complexity for QAM-OFDM signals. Moreover, we use two different approaches to obtain initial estimate for beginning iteration of proposed algorithm. One is for less time-dispersive but fast fading channel and the other is for highly time-dispersive but relatively slow fading channel. The bit error rate (BER) performances of the proposed algorithm are evaluated using computer simulations. The results show that the proposed algorithm performs nearly as well as the optimal EM algorithm.

As an alternative posterior distribution appearing in the so-called Q:function, we use the distribution that maximizes the non-extensive Tsallis entropy. The distribution we introduce has a parameter q which represents the non-extensive property of the entropy. We control the paxameter q so as to weaken the influence of the initial conditions. In order to investigate its performance, we apply our algorithm to Gaussian mixture estimation problems under some additive noises. In large data limit, we derive the averaged update equations with respect to hyper-parameters, marginal likelihood etc. analytically. Our analysis supports usefulness of our algorithm.

Methods: In 29 patients with lung cancer and phantom studies, tomograms were reconstructed using FBP and OSEM algorithms, with and without a prefilter (Butterworth filter: BW), whose cut-off frequencies were 0.10 cycles/pixel for FBP and 0.10 and 0.17 cycles/pixel for OSEM. Visual interpretation and tumor to non-tumor (T/N) count ratios were obtained and compared. Results: Without a prefilter, T/N ratios from OSEM and FBP were 1.89 +/- 0.31 (early) and 2.00 +/- 0.54 (late) for OSEM, 1.90 +/- 0.33 (early) and 2.05 +/- 0.59 (late) for FBP, respectively. The OSEM reconstruction without prefiltering showed clearer tumor contours than FBP without a prefilter. Incorporation of BW showed visually low-noised images but decreased T/N ratios in both reconstructions with BW (0.10 cycles/pixel). No greater TIN ratios were obtained by OSEM than FBP, with or without prefiltering. With BW with a cut-off frequency of 0.17 cycles/pixel, the same T/N ratios as those without BW were obtained. The tumor model sized 0.9 cm in the phantom study was invisible in both OSEM and FBP reconstructions without a prefilter, but visible with a prefilter. The influence of prefiltering on T/N ratios was also observed in phantom studies. Conclusions: Visually improved tumor delineation could be obtained in OSEM reconstruction without a prefilter as compared to FBP reconstruction without a prefilter for tumors greater than 2 cm. Prefiltering should be incorporated into OSEM reconstruction in diagnosing small tumors. However, the influence of prefilter (BW) setting on semi-quantitative interpretation needs further discussion.

We propose a novel semiblind decision feedback (DF) receiver based on the maximum likelihood principle that simultaneously exploits the transmission of training sequences and the statistical information of the unknown transmitted symbols. Both iterative and adaptive implementations of the proposed receiver, derived within the framework of the expectation maximization algorithm, are presented. Computer simulations show that the resulting multiuser detectors attain practically the same performance as the theoretical DF minimum mean square error receiver. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

J	Sheng, QZ; Moreau, Y; De Moor, B				Sheng, Qizheng; Moreau, Yves; De Moor, Bart			Biclustering microarray data by Gibbs sampling	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article								Motivation: Gibbs sampling has become a method of choice for the discovery of noisy patterns, known as motifs, in DNA and protein sequences. Because handling noise in microarray data presents similar challenges, we have adapted this strategy to the biclustering of discretized microarray data. Results: In contrast with standard clustering that reveals genes that behave similarly over all the conditions, biclustering groups genes over only a subset of conditions for which those genes have a sharp probability distribution. We have opted for a simple probabilistic model of the biclusters because it has the key advantage of providing a transparent probabilistic interpretation of the biclusters in the form of an easily interpretable fingerprint. Furthermore, Gibbs sampling does not suffer from the problem of local minima that often characterizes Expectation-Maximization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two synthetic data sets as well as a data set from leukemia patients.

The conventional AR mixture density model can be applied to modeling a quasi-stationary Gaussian AR process. However, it cannot model spectral zeros. In contrast, the proposed model is based on a frequency-warped exponential (EX) model. Accordingly, it can represent spectral poles and zeros with equal weights, and, furthermore, the model spectrum has a high resolution at low frequencies. The parameter estimation algorithm for the proposed model was also derived based on an EM algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed model has better performance than the AR mixture density model for modeling a frequency-warped EX process.

If the DF-DD feedback filter is properly optimized, a performance similar to that of a more complex scheme, recently reported by Chiavaccini and Vitetta, based on expectation maximization, can be achieved. However, it is also shown that an error floor is unavoidable for channels with phase noise. If a constraint is introduced, the DF-DD receiver can be made robust against unknown frequency offsets.

A Bayesian network (BNT) in the space of dyadic wavelet transform coefficients is introduced to model texture images. The model is similar to a Hidden Markov model (HMM), but with non-stationary transitive conditional probability distributions. It is composed of discrete hidden variables and observable Gaussian outputs for wavelet coefficients. In particular, the Gabor wavelet transform is considered. The introduced model is compared with the simplest joint Gaussian probabilistic model for Gabor wavelet coefficients for several textures from the Brodatz album [1]. The comparison is based on cross-validation and includes probabilistic model ensembles instead of single models. In addition, the robustness of the models to cope with additive Gaussian noise is investigated. We further study the feasibility of the introduced generative model for image segmentation in the novelty detection framework [2]. Two examples are considered: (i) sea surface pollution detection from intensity images and (ii) image segmentation of the still images with varying illumination across the scene.

This results in a soft-in-soft-out detection algorithm suitable for iterative detection/decoding schemes. Simulation results show that the error performance provided by the proposed solution is very close to that of a MAP detector endowed with an ideal knowledge of the channel state both in uncoded and coded transmissions.

Although easy implementation and stable convergence help to explain the popularity of the algorithm, its convergence is sometimes notoriously slow. In recent years, however, various adaptations have significantly improved the speed of EM while maintaining its stability and simplicity. One especially successful method for maximum likelihood is known as the parameter expanded EM or PXEM algorithm. Unfortunately, PXEM does not generally have a closed form M-step when computing posterior modes, even when the corresponding EM algorithm is in closed form. In this paper we confront this problem by adapting the one-step-late EM algorithm to PXEM to establish a fast closed form algorithm that improves on the one-step-late EM algorithm by insuring monotone convergence. We use this algorithm to fit a probit regression model and a variety of dynamic linear models, showing computational savings of as much as 99.9%, with the biggest savings occurring when the EM algorithm is the slowest to converge.

The time- and frequency-localization capabilities of wavelets provide better noise reduction and less signal distortion than conventional filtering methods. The noise reduction technique used in this paper is based on the hidden Markov model (HMM) structure, which can efficiently shape the statistical characteristics of practical data. As confirmed by numerical results, the HMM based approach provides a significant performance improvement over competing methods.

J	Morbiducci, M; Nardi, A; Rossi, C				Morbiducci, M; Nardi, A; Rossi, C			Classification of "cured" individuals in survival analysis: the mixture approach to the diagnostic-prognostic problem	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						survival analysis; latent variables; mixture models; cure-rate model; EM algorithm; log-odds residuals	LONG-TERM SURVIVORS; MODELS	Various mixture survival models have been presented in the literature since 1982 (Farewell, Biometrics 38 (1982) 1041). Such models have been widely applied in different frameworks due to their flexibility in mirroring complex situations, even though a general theory has not been fully developed yet. In the present contribution, a general 'coherent' setting is outlined for survival models dealing with non-homogeneous populations, with special focus on cure-rate models and some exploratory and diagnostic tools are studied. The class of cure-rate models proposed here is a generalization of the previous one presented in Schinaia and Rossi (Biometrical J. 42(5) (2000) 583) to address the diagnostic-prognostic problem, now allowing for unknown prior probability of long survivorship. The classification (diagnostic) problem is developed using the Bayesian paradigm. The parameter estimation procedure is based on the development of a class of GEM algorithms, in the framework of the MLE approach. The model diagnostic is based on the asymptotic properties of the survival and risk functions and of the censoring process and on the generalization and application of the theory of log-odds residuals (Nardi and Schemper, Biometrics 55 (1999) 523). The results of an extended experimentation by means of simulated data is also reported in order to present the main features of the model, the methods and the procedures proposed.

In addition. in some scenarios, target-originated measurements might not be present in many consecutive scans because of mispointing, target maneuvers or erroneous preprocessing That is. one might have a set of non-informative scans that could result in poor track initialization and maintenance. In this paper an algorithm based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm combined with Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation is presented for tracking slowly maneuvering targets in heavy clutter and possibly non-informative scans. The adaptive sliding-window EM-ML approach, which operates in batch mode, tries to reject or weight down non-informative scans using the Q-function in the M-step of the EM algorithm. A track validation technique is used to confirm the validity of the EM-ML estimates. It is shown that target features in the form of, for example, amplitude information. can also be used to improve the estimates. In addition, performance bounds based on the supplemented EM (SEM) technique are also presented. The effectiveness of new algorithm is first demonstrated on a 78-frame Long Wave Infrared (LWIR) data sequence consisting of an F1 Mirage fighter jet in heavy clutter. Previously. this scenario has been used as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of other track initialization algorithms. The new EM-ML estimator confirms the track by frame 20 while the ML-PDA (Maximum Likelihood estimator combined with Probabilistic Data Association) algorithm, the IMM-MHT (Interacting Multiple-Model estimator combined with Multiple Hypothesis Tracking) and the IMM-PDA estimator previously required 28, 38 and 39 frames, respectively. The benefits of the new algorithm in terms of accuracy, early detection and computational load are illustrated using simulated scenarios as well.

We consider the problem of reconstructing two haplotypes of a diploid individual from genotype data generated by mapping experiments, and present an algorithm to recover haplotypes. The problem of optimizing existing methods of SNP phasing with a population of diploid genotypes has been investigated in [7] and found to be NP-hard. In contrast, using single molecule methods, we show that although haplotypes are not known and data are further confounded by the mapping error model, reasonable assumptions on the mapping process allow us to recover the co-associations of allele types across consecutive loci and estimate the haplotypes with an efficient algorithm. The haplotype reconstruction algorithm requires two stages: Stage I is the detection of polymorphic marker types, this is done by modifying an EM-algorithm for Gaussian mixture models and an example is given for RFLP sizing. Stage II focuses on the problem of phasing and presents a method of local maximum likelihood for the inference of haplotypes in an individual. The algorithm presented is nearly linear in the number of polymorphic loci. The algorithm results, run on simulated RFLP sizing data, are encouraging, and suggest that the method will prove practical for haplotype phasing.

The application of the well-known technique, Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to multidimensional image data is to be investigated, where Gaussian mixture is assumed. The number of classes can be estimated via Neyman-Pearson detection theory-based eigen-thresholding approach, which is used as a reference value in the learning process. Since most remotely sensed images are nonstationary, adaptive EM (AEM) algorithm will also be explored by localizing the estimation process. Remote sensing data is used in the experiments for performance analysis. In particular, comparative study will be conducted to quantify the improvement from the adaptive EM algorithm.

Joint probability tables are modeled by lower dimensional probability mixtures and their mixture coefficients. The maximum likelihood parameters of the mixture models are trained by the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and quantized to one byte integers. The probability elements which mixture models do not estimate reliably are kept separately. Experimental results with on-line handwritten UNIPEN digits show that the total memory size of an N-tuple recognizer is reduced from 11.8M bytes to 0.55M bytes, while the recognition rate drops from 97.7% to 97.5%.

Most of these images have the particularity to be quantized on float numbers with large luminance range, on different wavelengths. These characteristics require to manipulate large amount of extremely accurate data on each spectral band, which is very different to the case of 8-bits-integer coded pixels. We present some results obtained on Multiwavelength images of the Small Magellanic Cloud, by using the Marginal Posterior Mode (MPM) estimator on a quadtree structure under Markovian assumption. The estimation of the model parameters is then addressed with Expectation-Maximization (EM)-type algorithms, allowing unsupervised hyperparameter estimation. The main interest of this modeling effort lies in its generality : the algorithm handles multiwavelength floating data in a single upward and downward scan on the quadtree. A new aspect in this paper concerns the noise statistics that are supposed to be lognormal for each class. Another new aspect, is the in-scale-coding of the label map.

The computed tomography imaging spectrometer (CTIS) records the projection data of different direction at the same time. The data cube of the object is acquired by reconstruction of the projection data. The instrument can record both spectral and spatial information of a dynamic scene. As only a 2-D binary phase grating is used as splitter and disperser, there are no moving parts, the system of CTIS becomes very compact, As the key component, the characteristics of grating are important to system stability and accuracy of reconstruction. In our work, the grating is designed and fabricated, and the whole system is set up. The configuration of the system is presented and the method of the spectral and spatial calibration is introduced. The mapping matrix of system is established by the results of calibration. The real object such as a colorful doll or a cluster of flower is imaged by the CTIS. The data cube of the real object is reconstructed by the EM algorithm. The size of the image of the object is about 200*200pixel, and the spectral range is from 410nm to 700nm.

This is achieved with the help of a mixture-based model and the corresponding expectation-maximization algorithm. The result is a backward search scheme, able to sort the features by order of relevance. Finally, an MDL criterion is used to prune the sorted list of features, yielding a feature selection criterion. The proposed approach can be classified as a wrapper, since it wraps the mixture estimation algorithm in an outer layer that performs feature selection. Preliminary experimental results show that the proposed method has promising performance.

Its simplicity and general convergence properties make it very attractive. However, it sometimes converges slowly. Several accelerated EM methods based on gradient-based optimization techniques have been proposed. In principle, they all employ a line search involving several NP-hard likelihood evaluations. We propose a novel acceleration called SCGEM based on scaled conjugate gradients (SCGs) well-known from learning neural networks. SCGEM avoids the line search by adopting the scaling mechanism of SCGs applied to the expected information matrix. This guarantees a single likelihood evaluation per iteration. We empirically compare SCGEM with EM and conventional conjugate gradient accelerated EM. The experiments show that SCGEM can significantly accelerate both of them and is equal in quality.

However, analytical tractability remains a problem for most alternative models. In this article, we study a class of hidden Markov models including Markov switching models and stochastic volatility models, that can incorporate leptokurtic feature, volatility clustering effects, as well as provide analytical solutions to option pricing. We show that these models can generate long memory phenomena when the transition probabilities depend on the time scale. We also provide an explicit analytic formula for the arbitrage-free price of the European options under these models. The issues of statistical estimation and errors in option pricing are also discussed in the Markov switching models.

The development of Internet increases the security risk of information systems greatly. This paper utilizes HMM (Hidden Markov Model) to realize the forecast ability of IDS (Intrusion Detection System). In this model, a command sequence or a control information sequence is regarded as a series of state transitions with a certain probability. The performance of several algorithms is compared such as F-BP (Forward-Back Propagation) algorithm, Viterbi Learning algorithm, EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm, etc. In order to provide a soft boundary to the decision-making, fuzzy math is also introduced to this model. By this means, the intelligence of the IDS is improved and some decision-making abilities and reasoning abilities are offered to IDS. As well this paper reports the results about our project.

The main problem with supervised methods is that the learning process heavily depends on the quality of the training data set. In remote sensing, the training set is useful only for simultaneous images or for images with the same classes taken under the same conditions; and, even worse, the training set is frequently not available. On the other hand, unsupervised methods are not sensitive to the number of labelled samples since they work on the whole image. Nevertheless, relationship between clusters and classes is not ensured. In this context, we propose a combined strategy of supervised and unsupervised learning methods that avoids these drawbacks and automates the classification process. The method is based on the general formulation of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. This method is applied to crop cover recognition of six hyperspectral images from the same area acquired with the HyMap spectrometer during the DAISEX-99 campaign. For classification purposes, six different classes are considered. Classification accuracy results are compared to common methods: ISODATA, Learning Vector Quantization, Gaussian Maximum Likelihood, Expectation-Maximization, and Neural Networks. The good performance confirms the validity of the proposed approach in terms of accuracy and robustness.

BATSE bursts detected with homogeneous trigger criteria and measured with a limited attribute set (duration, hardness, and fluence) are classified using four unsupervised algorithms (the concept hierarchy classifier ESX, the EM algorithm, the Kmeans algorithm, and a kohonen neural network). The classifiers prefer three-class solutions to two-class and four-class solutions. When forced to find two classes, the classifiers do not find the traditional long and short classes; many short soft events are placed in a class with the short hard bursts. When three classes are found, the classifiers clearly identify the short bursts, but place far more members in an intermediate duration soft class than have been found using statistical clustering techniques. It appears that the boundary between short faint and long bright bursts is more important to the classifiers than is the boundary between short hard and long soft bursts. We conclude that the boundary between short faint and long hard bursts is the result of data bias and poor attribute selection. We recommend that future gamma-ray burst classification avoid using extrinsic parameters such as fluence, and should instead concentrate on intrinsic properties such as spectral, temporal, and (when available) luminosity characteristics. Future classification should also be wary of correlated attributes.(such as fluence and duration), as these bias classification results.

An exact anal tic representation of the probability density functions characterizing the estimate may not be possible to obtain. Even when available, it may be too complex or not practical because, for example, recursive application is required. Hence, approximations are generally inevitable. Gaussian mixture approximations are convenient for a number of reasons. However calculating appropriate mixture parameters that minimize a global measure of deviation from the true density is a tough optimization task. Here, we propose a new approximation method that minimizes the squared integral deviation between the the true density and its mixture approximation. Rather than trying to solve the original problem, it is converted into a corresponding system of explicit ordinary first-order differential equations. This system of differential equations is then solved over a finite "time" interval, which is an efficient way of calculating the desired optimal parameter values.

The main strength of the method is that the contour model avoids explicit "feature" detection: contours are simply assumed to remove statistical dependencies on opposite sides of the contour. The contour model is utilized in particle filtering together with the EM algorithm. The method shows robustness to light changes and camera defocusing, and makes it possible to use off-the-shelf hardware for gaze-based interaction.

Specifically, we study the collections of frequent sets in clusters produced by a probabilistic clustering using mixtures of Bernoulli models. That is, we first analyze 0-1 datasets by a global technique (probabilistic clustering using the EM algorithm) and then do a local analysis (discovery of frequent sets) in each of the clusters. The results indicate that the use of clustering as a preliminary phase in finding frequent sets produces clusters that have significantly different collections of frequent sets. We also test the significance of the differences in the frequent, set collections in the different clusters by obtaining estimates of the underlying joint density. To get from the local patterns in each cluster back to distributions, we use the maximum entropy technique [17] to obtain a local model for each cluster, and then combine these local models to get a mixture model. We obtain clear improvements to the approximation quality against the use of either the mixture model or the maximum entropy model.

Based on the detailed analysis of the literatures, the paper describes the fundamental ideas. Then, We select a typical traffic network in Beijing City at first. In order to simplify the problem, we classify the links using clustering analysis and find the representative links in each group. Furthermore, we introduce the Markov chain model to predict the traffic parameter. EM algorithm is applied to estimate the parameters of mixed Gaussian distributions, i.e., means, covariances and mixing coefficients. According to the regression equations between the representative link and the other links in the same group, we can obtain all the predicted traffic parameters of all the links in the road network. The case studies using real data from UTC-SCOOT System in Beijing have proved the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method.

We first develop a model for such a system. Then, we propose the channel estimation based oil least square (LS) algorithm and linear interpolation in frequency domain. For signal detection, different detection algorithms are introduced including maximum ratio combining (MRC), minimum mean square error (MMSE), parallel interference cancellation (PIC). and interference cancellation based on expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Performances of these different algorithms are illustrated by numerical results in a system with 512 subcarriers and 5 MHz bandwidth at 2.-5 GHz over some of ITU channel models. Our simulation results demonstrate that with MMSE algorithm significant performance gain is achieved compared to that with MRC algorithm. The system performance call be further improved by PIC and EM algorithms.	Nokia, FIN-90571 Oulu, Finland	Iraji, S (reprint author), Nokia, POB 50, FIN-90571 Oulu, Finland.

In this paper, we present a two-phase scalable model-based clustering framework: First, a large data set is summed up into sub-clusters; Then, clusters are directly generated from the summary statistics of sub-clusters by a specifically designed Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Taking example for Gaussian mixture models, we establish a provably convergent EM algorithm, EMADS, which embodies cardinality, mean, and covariance information of each sub-cluster explicitly. Combining with different data summarization procedures, EMADS is used to construct two clustering systems: gEMADS and bEMADS. The experimental results demonstrate that they run several orders of magnitude faster than the classic EM algorithm with little loss of accuracy. They generate significantly better results than other model-based clustering systems using similar computational resources.

We adapt Expectation/Maximization iterative method to solve the complicated multi-parameter optimization problem appearing on the 3-D localization problem. The proposed algorithm is based on maximum likelihood criterion which employs the source signals recorded by 2-D array under near-field assumption. Expectation/Maximization algorithm decomposes the observed data into its components and then estimates the parameters of each signal component separately providing computationally efficient solution to the resulting optimization problem. Finally, the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by some numerical simulations.

The well-known eigenface method uses one set of holistic facial features obtained by PCA. However, the single set of eigenfaces is not enough to represent the complicated face images with large variations of poses and/or illuminations. To overcome this weakness, we propose the (1st-order) PCA mixture method that uses several eigenface sets obtained from the EM learning in PCA mixture model. Furthermore, we propose the 2nd-order PCA mixture method that combines the 2nd-order eigenface method and the PCA mixture model. In the 2nd-order eigenface method, each image is represented by a couple of feature vectors obtained by projecting the face image onto a selected approximate eigenface set and then by projecting the residual face image onto a selected residual eigenface set. Face retrieval is performed by finding the identity that provides the shortest distance in the feature space between the input image and the template image. Simulation results show that fare retrieval using the 2nd-order PCA mixture method is best for face images with illumination variations and face retrieval using the 1st-order PCA mixture model is best for the fare images with pose variations in terms of ANMRR (Average of the Normalized Modified Retrieval Rank) and CRR (Correct Retrieval Rate).

When the embedded model of a type of images is derived, the true scene can be recovered by seeking an image which best fits this model. Gaussian mixture and asymptotic independence of pixel intensities of x-ray CT and MR images have been proved which validate the use of independent Finite Normal Mixture (FNM) and locally dependent Markov random field (MRF) models. FNM is further shown to be a degenerate Hidden MRF (HMRF). A two-level image analysis method is developed for recovering the true scene from the given x-ray CT and MR image. At the low-level, it is a pixel-based intensity processing method and utilizes the FNM model and an Expectation-Maximization algorithm, known as FNM-EM operation. At the high-level, it is a region-based context processing method and utilizes MRF and an Iterated Conditional Mode algorithm, known as MRF-ICM operation. The results obtained by applying this method to simulated and real phantom images demonstrated considerable success: the restored true scene is the ground truth of the objects in the given image. Results also demonstrated that best fitting the given image and best fitting the embedded model may lead to two different scenes, and only in the case of high SNR, these two scenes are closer.

Conventional segmentation assigns a single label to each voxel, neglecting the partial volume (PV) effect. This work presents, an EM (Expectation Maximization) framework for segmentation of tissue mixture in each voxel. Image data and tissue mixture models, EM algorithm for mixture quantification, prior model for regularization on the mixtures, and multi-spectral MR (magnetic resonance) data characterization are described in details. Preliminary results from CT (computed tomography) and MR images are reported to demonstrate its potential for clinical use.

This algorithm can cluster a large number of samples (in the order of 50000 samples) that would be impossible to cluster with current approaches. It is characterized by a complexity that is significantly lower than the cubic complexity that characterizes the calculation of the eigenvectors of a matrix. It's based on a "clustering of clusters" technique, that combines the use of k-means and spectral clustering. Additionally, this method includes the use of Expectation Maximization (EM) clustering with Axis Smoothing that is shown to improve the separation in the spectral domain for high values of the scaling parameter sigma(2).

For granularity discrimination we investigate the use of multiresolution entropy. We illustrate the good results obtained with a number of practical cases.

Haplotype frequencies and the most likely haplotype pair for each individual are estimated from random samples of individual or small (nuclear) family genotypes via an EM algorithm. If the most likely haplotype pair configuration of the whole sample outweighs the less likely ones, we may consider the estimated haplotypes as alleles of a multi-allelic marker and carry out the conventional statistics, TDT or ANOVA for quantitative traits. If the most likely haplotype pair configuration and the less likely ones do not differ much in their weight, we sample the TDT or ANOVA statistic over all haplotype pair configurations using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Applications of our method to simulated data as well as real data are given. Copyright (C) 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel.

The use of collimators for high resolution imaging gives rise to low sensitivity at sub-mm resolutions. We propose the imager consists of a CCD with a pixel size of 44 mum, interfaced to coded apertures. A reconstruction code has been developed for 2D and 3D reconstructions from, initially, a single projection, producing longitudinal, coded aperture shadowgrams. The iterative reconstruction technique is based on the ML-EM algorithm. The code has been developed to work on cross-platforms, Linux, Windows, Solaris, with graphics implementation using the SDL library. The reconstruction program has been implemented in C++ and uses dynamic memory allocation to create a linked-list to store the probability weighting factors efficiently, allowing fast reconstruction times. The reconstruction code has a scripting language for setting the system geometry and uses either a line of response method or a cone of response approximation method. Monte Carlo simulations have been used to show that the reconstruction code works at low count densities. These simulations have shown that it possible to use a single projection (longitudinal) shadowgram to produce 2D and 3D reconstructions.

The nonhomogeneous MMPP developed in this article is a natural model for point processes whose events combine irregular bursts of activity with predictable (e.g. daily and hourly) patterns. We show how the MMPP may be viewed as a superposition of unobserved Poisson processes that are activated and deactivated by an unobserved Markov process. The MMPP is a continuous time model which may also be viewed as a discretely indexed nonstationary hidden Markov model by viewing intervals between events as a sequence of dependent random variables. The HMM representation allows one to probabilistically reconstruct the latent Markov and Poisson processes using a set of forward backward recursions. The recursions allow MMPP parameters to be estimated either by an EM algorithm or by a rapidly mixing Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm which uses the recursions for data augmentation. The Markov-Poisson cascade (MPC) is an MMPP whose underlying Markov process obeys certain restrictions which uniquely order the event rates for the observed process. The ordering avoids a possible label switching issue without slowing down the rapidly mixing algorithms we use to implement the model. We apply the MPC to a data set containing click rate data for individual computer users browsing through the World Wide Web. Because the complete data posterior distribution for the MPC is a product of exponential family distributions we are able to incorporate data from multiple users into a hierarchical model using existing methods from hierarchical Poisson regression.

With sto(ry)chastics the coarse and noisy sensor inputs are coupled to digital media outputs via a user model, which is estimated probabilistically by a Bayesian network. To illustrate sto(ry)chastics, this paper describes the museum wearable, a device which delivers an audiovisual narration interactively in time and space to the visitor as a function of the estimated visitor type. The wearable relies on a custom-designed long-range infrared location-identification sensor to gather information on where and how long the visitor stops in the museum galleries and uses this information as input to, or observations of, a (dynamic) Bayesian network. The network has been tested and validated on observed visitor tracking data by parameter learning using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, and by performance analysis of the model with the learned parameters.

In this paper, we consider to extend the mixture of AR-GARCH model (W.C. Wong, F. Yip and L. Xu, 1998) to the mixture of ARMA-GARCH model and investigate its application in stock price prediction. A generalized expectation-maximization (GEM) algorithm is proposed to learn the mixture model. Experimental simulations show that the mixture of ARMA-GARCH model yields better prediction results than either the mixture of AR, or the mixture of AR-GARCH models.

An expectation maximization algorithm is constructed to estimate parameters of a k-component Gaussian mixture based on a sample set obtained from a tracking simulator. The modeling and parameter estimation approach is applied to position error data generated by several tracking algorithms including multi-target multi-sensor joint probabilistic data association and particle filters. The Gaussian mixture model yields significantly better likelihood of position error compared to the single Gaussian distribution. It is further shown how the mixture models can be used to efficiently compare tracking algorithms in terms of the root mean squared position error.

In this chapter we discuss the use of highly structured models that not only incorporate the scientific model (e.g., for a source spectrum) but also account for stochastic components of data collection and the instrument (e.g., background contamination and pile up). Such hierarchical models when used in conjunction with Bayesian or likelihood statistical methods offer a systematic solution to many challenging data analytic problems (e.g., low count rates and pile up). Hierarchical models are becoming increasingly popular in physical and other scientific disciplines largely because of the recent development of sophisticated methods for statistical computation. Thus, we discuss such methods as the EM algorithm, data augmentation, and Markov chain Monte Carlo in the context of high energy high resolution low count data. This paper is followed by a commentary by astronomer Michael Strauss.

There are usually two major aspects associated with such a study: dependent survival times and events before study entry. Failure to properly account for events before study entry would seriously underestimate the association between complete survival times in the same family. This article intends to deal with these two aspects together in conditional shared gamma frailty models in which the hazard functions in the same cluster (family) are multiplied by the same (unobserved) random frailties and the survival times conditional on frailties are independent. We describe an algorithm based on maximum likelihood and expectation-maximization for the calculation of maximum likelihood estimates in these models and examine asymptotic and small sample statistical properties for parameter estimates, especially for the frailty variance parameter. Let theta(0) be the true value of the frailty variance theta. Then the asymptotic distribution of frailty variance estimates is normal for theta(0) > 0 while it is a 50-50 mixture between a point mass at zero and a normal random variable on the positive axis for theta(0) = 0. For small samples, simulations suggest that the frailty variance estimates are approximately distributed as an x-(100-x)% mixture, 0 less than or equal to x less than or equal to 50, between a point mass at zero and a normal random variable on the positive axis even for theta(0) > 0.

In this paper, we propose a novel model (iSearch) which predicts user's information need based on past retrieval history. Based on the prediction, we then transform the feature space based on the user's feedback and employ an Expectation Maximization (EM) approach to simulate the new space by a mixture of Gaussian distributions. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective and captures the user's information need more precisely.

The dynamics for combining the experts is a hidden Markov process, in which the states of a time series are regarded as states of a HMM and each of them associates to an expert.

First the motion vectors are emendated by our spatial confidence and correction rule so that these can represent real motions of objects. Then the initial location and a coarse segmentation from the motion vectors are obtained by applying the EM algorithm. For there are DCT coefficients only in I frames, the coarse masks are mapped into I frames through the motion parameters. These blocks in the masks can be decompressed to obtain details of a specific object in the pixel domain. The actual edges of the objects can be extracted by applying Canny Edge Detection only n the segmented regions. By using the proposed algorithm, the amount of data needed to be processed is kept the necessarily minimal, saving the computational time as well as gaining the pixel wise edges of the segmented objects.

Classification is performed with better than 99% accuracy for DNA hairpin molecules that differ only in their terminal Watson-Crick base pairs. Signal classification was initially done on synthetic data streams, where sampling on real mixtures of hairpins was modeled in order to establish performance metrics (i.e., where train and test data were of known type, via single-species data files). Signal classification was then performed on observations from real mixtures of DNA hairpins. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) were used with Expectation/Maximization for de-noising and for associating a feature vector with the ionic current blockade of the DNA molecule. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were used as discriminators, and were the focus of off-line training. A multi-class SVM architecture was designed to place less discriminatory load on weaker discriminators, and novel SVM kernels were used to boost discrimination strength. The tuning on HMMs and SVMs enabled biophysical analysis of the captured molecule states and state-transitions; structure revealed in the biophysical analysis was used for better feature selection. This analysis is presented in more detail, but with less discussion, in Winters-Hilt et al. 2003.

First we model the probability of the firing rates of the population at a particular time instant as a Gaussian mixture where the mean of each Gaussian is some linear function of the hand kinematics. This mixture contains a "hidden state", or weight, that assigns a probability to each linear, Gaussian, term in the mixture. We then model the evolution of this hidden state over time as a Markov chain. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to fit this mixture model to training data that consists of measured hand kinematics (position, velocity, acceleration) and the firing rates of 42 units recorded with a chronically implanted multi-electrode array. Decoding of neural data from a separate test set is achieved using the Switching Kalman Filter (SKF) algorithm. Quantitative results show that the SKFM outperforms the traditional linear Gaussian model in the decoding of hand movement. These results suggest that the SKFM provides a real-time decoding algorithm that may be appropriate for neural prosthesis applications.

To achieve successful de novo motif detection it is necessary to model the complex dependencies within and among motifs and incorporate biological prior knowledge. In this paper, we present LOGOS, an integrated LOcal and GlObal motif Sequence model for biopolymer sequences, which provides a principled framework for developing, modularizing, extending and computing expressive motif models for complex biopolymer sequence analysis. LOGOS consists of two interacting submodels: HMDM, a local alignment model capturing biological prior knowledge and positional dependence within the motif local structure; and HMM, a global motif distribution model modeling frequencies and dependencies of motif occurrences. Model parameters can befit using training motifs within an empirical Bayesian framework. A variational EM algorithm is developed for de novo motif detection. LOGOS improves over existing models that ignore biological priors and dependencies in motif structures and motif occurrences, and demonstrates superior performance on both semi-realistic test data and cis-regulatory sequences from yeast and Drosophila sequences with regard to sensitivity, specificity, flexibility and extensibility.

The method is based on results from information geometry; specifically, the alternating projections theorem first proved by Csiszar [2], which provides a rigorous iterative method for stochastic maximum likelihood estimation. It is demonstrated that the proposed method has similar performance compared to a recently reported method based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm [3]. In addition to having a complete analytical solution, the proposed algorithm avoids the complex multidimensional integrations usually found necessary in similar EM-type methods. The result is a much faster implementation.	McMaster Univ, Dept ECE, Hamilton, ON, Canada	Reilly, JR (reprint author), McMaster Univ, Dept ECE, Hamilton, ON, Canada.

This problem arises in fields such as Doppler imaging, where its specificity is twofold. First, only short noisy data records are available (typically four sample long), and experimental constraints may cause spectral aliasing so that measurements provide unreliable, ambiguous information. Second, the frequency sequence is smooth. Here, this information is accounted for by a Markov model, and application of the Bayes rule yields the a posteriori density. The maximum a posteriori is computed by a combination of Viterbi and descent procedures. One of the major features of the method is that it is entirely unsupervised. Adjusting the hyperparameters that balance data-based and prior-based information is done automatically by maximum likelihood (ML) using an expectation-maximization (EM)-based gradient algorithm. We compared the proposed estimate to a reference one an found that it performed better: Variance was greatly reduced, and tracking was correct, even beyond the Nyquist frequency.

We propose a new method which removes all dependence on the operator and therefore enjoys 100% repeatability. We model the a-hat versus a response using local regression and calculate confidence bounds on probability of detection and A90 threshold curves using the bootstrap method. Censored data are modeled via the expectation maximization algorithm and repeated measure correlations are fully estimated.

J	Bar-Hen, A				Bar-Hen, A			Influence of missing data on compact designs for spacing experiments	JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article								Density optimization of a plantation is a classical task with important practical consequences. In this article, we present an adaptation of criss-cross design and an alternative analysis. If a tree is missing, the spacing of neighbouring trees is altered and considerable information is lost. We derive the estimate of the missing value that minimizes the residual sum of squares and obtain the analytical solution of the EM algorithm. The relationships between the two techniques are clarified. The method is applied to data from a plantation of Eucalyptus in the Congo.

J	Bialkowski, SE; Dudley, L; Or, D				Bialkowski, SE; Dudley, L; Or, D			Using an expectation-maximization algorithm to obtain dielectric relaxation-time spectra of aqueous montmorillonite clay suspensions	APPLIED SPECTROSCOPY			English	Article						impedance spectra; deconvolution; montmorillonite	DYNAMIC MOBILITY; MAXWELL-WAGNER; DECONVOLUTION; CONDUCTANCE; DISPERSION; PARTICLES	Determination of relaxation-time distributions from dielectric spectra of complex impedance or dielectric permittivity remains a challenge. This problem is one of a wider class of ill-posed inverse problems where the measurement is a superposition or convolution of functions containing the sought-after information. An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is shown to be useful for obtaining dielectric relaxation-time distributions from impedance data. This algorithm is stable and converges to realistic relaxation-time spectra without the need for constraints or initial values. The implementation used herein updates expectations in an iterative multiplication step. The models and basic assumptions of impedance spectroscopy are outlined in the first part of this paper. Frequency-dependent impedance measurements are obtained for calibration samples and saturated montmorillonite clays. The EM algorithm is subsequently used to determine the dielectric relaxation times. The dielectric relaxation-time spectra allow facile interpretation of otherwise complicated impedance.

We fit a statistical model to the input data and use the best fit parameters to synthesize training vector sets with statistics similar to the input. By knowing the best-fit parameters, the decoder can synthesize the same training sets, while identical codebooks are obtained at both encoder and decoder based on the same codebook generation procedure. As a result, complete codebook adaptation is achieved with a very small increase in the bit rate. The implementation of the new technique in the transform domain produced competitive results when compared to other methods relying on vector quantization and transform coding. In particular, the image Lena was coded at 0.28 bits/pixel with a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 32.51 dB. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Bee, M; Flury, B				Bee, M; Flury, B			A problem of dimensionality in normal mixture analysis	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS			English	Article						discriminant function; EM algorithm; Mahalanobis distance; redundancy of variables; Wald test		Suppose the p-variate random vector W, partitioned into q variables W-1 and p - q variables W-2, follows a multivariate normal mixture distribution. If the investigator is mainly interested in estimation of the parameters of the distribution of W-1, there are two possibilities: (1) use only the data on W, for estimation, and (2) estimate the parameters of the p-variate mixture distribution, and then extract the estimates of the marginal distribution of W-1. In this article we study the choice between these two possibilities mainly for the case of two mixture components with Identical covariance matrices. We find the asymptotic distribution of the linear discriminant function coefficients using the work of Efron (1975) and O'Neill (1978), and give a Wald-test for redundancy of W-2. A simulation study gives further insights into conditions under which W-2 should be used in the analysis: in summary, the inclusion of W-2 seems justified if Delta(2.1), the Mahalanobis distance between the two component distributions based on the conditional distribution of W-2 given W-1, is at least 2.

J	Chen, JS; Jennrich, RI				Chen, JS; Jennrich, RI			Simple accurate approximation of likelihood profiles	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS			English	Article						EM applications; integration methods; likelihood ratio intervals; maximum likelihood estimation; nonlinear regression; parameter trace; signed root deviance profile	CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD	Likelihood profiles for arbitrary functions of the model parameters are useful for constructing likelihood ratio confidence intervals, diagnosing linear approximation intervals, suggesting linearizing transforms, and many other purposes. This article investigates a simple integration method for producing accurate approximations to likelihood profiles that avoid problems associated with producing exact profiles. A basic theorem guarantees that the approximation can achieve any desired precision. In many cases the method requires no more than adding a few lines of code to that required to produce the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter vector. Standard methods for computing likelihood profiles are based on solving a sequence of constrained maximum likelihood problems. Each problem generates a point on the profile. An earlier article proposed an integration method that generates the entire profile directly by solving a differential equation. That method, however, requires the Hessian of the log-likelihood which can be difficult to produce. The method considered here requires only the gradient. It may be particularly useful in conjunction with the EM algorithm which typically does not produce any type of confidence interval.

J	Lappi, S; Lazzari, S; Sarti, G; Pieri, P				Lappi, S; Lazzari, S; Sarti, G; Pieri, P			Assessment of geometrical distortion and activity distribution after attenuation correction: A SPECT phantom study	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR CARDIOLOGY			English	Article						single photon emission computed tomography attenuation correction; geometrical distortion	EMISSION COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; FINITE SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; TL-201 CARDIAC SPECT; MONTE-CARLO; LINE SOURCE; TRANSMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; NONUNIFORM ATTENUATION; IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION; DEPENDENT RESOLUTION; COLLIMATOR RESPONSE	Background. If single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images are reconstructed with filtered backprojection (FBP), not accounting for photon attenuation, artifacts can occur related to geometrical distortion and inaccurate estimation of regional distribution of radioactivity. By reconstructing the images with an iterative algorithm such as the maximum likelihood-expectation maximization (ML-EM) that incorporates the attenuation distribution information, it is possible to compensate for nonuniform attenuation. The aim of this study was to assess whether correction for nonuniform attenuation in SPECT can reduce the geometrical distortion and improve the activity quantitation. Methods and Results. Three capillary sources containing the same amount of technetium 99m were imaged by a dual-headed SPECT system provided with two gadolinium 153 scanning transmission line sources, in nonuniform attenuation conditions. The images were reconstructed (1) with the use of FBP, (2) with the iterative ML-EM algorithm, and (3) with the iterative ML-EM algorithm incorporating attenuation maps. The geometrical distortion was estimated by comparing the spread that occurred in 2 orthogonal directions in the reconstructed transverse slices, expressed by full width at half maximum related to the x-axis and y-axis line spread functions. The accuracy of activity quantitation was analyzed by comparing the counts in regions of interest placed over the transverse slices of the 3 sources, located in different attenuating areas. The FBP-reconstructed slices showed a spread of image intensity toward the direction of minor attenuation; the source shape improved in the iterative ML-EM images, as well as in the iterative attenuation-corrected ML-EM images. The sources located deep in the phantom showed an apparent decrease in image intensity in both FBP and ML-EM images, which became less evident in the iterative attenuation-corrected ML-EM images. Conclusions. Image reconstruction with the iterative ML-EM algorithm, without the use of attenuation maps, can reduce geometrical distortion and eliminate streak artifacts, leading to an improvement in the object's shape and size, but does not reduce activity underestimation and inaccurate quantitation. In the iterative attenuation-corrected ML-EM images, there was a significant improvement in the accurate quantitation of activity distribution and a further reduction in geometrical distortion. In conclusion, nonisotropic attenuation correction with iterative ML-EM reduced the geometrical distortion of images and improved the accuracy of activity quantitation.

J	Didelez, V				Didelez, V			ML- and serniparametric estimation in logistic models with incomplete covariate data	STATISTICA NEERLANDICA			English	Article						logistic regression; maximum likelihood; EM algorithm; missing covariates; missing data; semiparametric efficiency	REGRESSION-ANALYSIS; BIASED-ESTIMATION; 2-STAGE; INFERENCE	ML-estimation of regression parameters with incomplete covariate information usually requires a distributional assumption regarding the concerned covariates that implies a source of misspecification. Semiparametric procedures avoid such assumptions at the expense of efficiency. In this paper a simulation study with small sample size is carried out to get an idea of the performance of the ML-estimator under misspecification and to compare it with the semiparametric procedures when the former is based on a correct assumption. The results show that there is only a little gain by correct parametric assumptions, which does not justify the possibly large bias when the assumptions are not met. Additionally, a simple modification of the complete case estimator appears to be nearly semiparametric efficient.

J	Wu, SS; Ma, CX; Wu, RL; Casella, G				Wu, SS; Ma, CX; Wu, RL; Casella, G			A hierarchical statistical model for estimating population properties of quantitative genes	BMC GENETICS			English	Article							MIXED MAJOR GENE; POLYGENIC INHERITANCE; MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD; EM ALGORITHM; MEAT QUALITY; TRAIT LOCI	Background: Earlier methods for detecting major genes responsible for a quantitative trait rely critically upon a well-structured pedigree in which the segregation pattern of genes exactly follow Mendelian inheritance laws. However, for many outcrossing species, such pedigrees are not available and genes also display population properties. Results: In this paper, a hierarchical statistical model is proposed to monitor the existence of a major gene based on its segregation and transmission across two successive generations. The model is implemented with an EM algorithm to provide maximum likelihood estimates for genetic parameters of the major locus. This new method is successfully applied to identify an additive gene having a large effect on stem height growth of aspen trees. The estimates of population genetic parameters for this major gene can be generalized to the original breeding population from which the parents were sampled. A simulation study is presented to evaluate finite sample properties of the model. Conclusions: A hierarchical model was derived for detecting major genes affecting a quantitative trait based on progeny tests of outcrossing species. The new model takes into account the population genetic properties of genes and is expected to enhance the accuracy, precision and power of gene detection.

The proposed objective function fits both a weighted least squares (WLS) and a minimum %(2) estimation framework, and results in a convex optimization problem, Unlike conventional WLS methods, the weights do not need to be estimated from the datas, but are incorporated in the objective function. The iterative algorithm is derived from an alternating projection procedure in which "distance" is determined by the chi-squared test statistic, which is interpreted as a measure of the discrepancy between two distributions. This may be viewed as an alternative to the Kullback-Leibler divergence which corresponds to the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation. The algorithm is similar in form to, and shares many properties with, the expectation maximization algorithm for ML estimation. In particular, we show that every limit point of the algorithm is an estimator, and the sequence of projected (by the linear transformation into the data space) means converge. Despite the similarities, we show that the new estimators are quite distinct from ML estimators, and obtain conditions under which they are identical.

J	Miguez, J; Castedo, L				Miguez, J; Castedo, L			Maximum likelihood unsupervised source separation in Gaussian noise	JOURNAL OF VLSI SIGNAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS FOR SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						maximum likelihood; EM algorithm; blind source separation; Monte Carlo methods; multiple-input multiple-output channel estimation	BLIND SEPARATION; SIGNALS	This paper presents a new Maximum Likelihood (ML) based approach to the separation of convolutive mixtures of unobserved sources in the presence of Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN). The proposed method proceeds in two steps. First, the mixing system coefficients are estimated in the ML sense and, afterwards, this information is employed to attain source separation according to either the ML or the linear Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) criteria. System coefficient estimation is carried out in a block-iterative way using an extension of the Expectation Maximization (EM) method. Both deterministic and stochastic (Monte Carlo) implementations of the resulting estimation algorithm are considered. The proposed algorithms rely on the knowledge of the sources joint probability density function (p.d.f.). This is a fairly realistic assumption in applications such as digital communications but computer simulations reveal that it is not an stringent requirement. The proposed estimation algorithm can be successfully used with a tentative p.d.f. when this is not known a priori.

Item response analysis is not well-known outside its area of application, mainly because the procedures to fit the models are computer intensive and not routinely available within general statistical software packages. The linear score technique is less computer intensive, straightforward to implement and has been proposed as a good approximation to item response analysis. Both methods have been implemented in the standard statistical software package GLIM 4.0, and are compared to determine their effectiveness.

Nineteen random SNPs were discovered and tested across this region with an average spacing of 57 kb (range = 1.4-289 kb). These 19 SNPs were genotyped in a population consisting of 444 unrelated pedigrees; that were largely collected in the U.S. and U.K. Haplotypes for all pedigrees were derived from pedigree data and over 1,400 haplotypes from unrelated individuals were evaluated for linkage disequilibrium. between marker alleles. In addition, linkage disequilibrium between marker alleles was also evaluated using estimated haplotypes without genealogical information (i.e., without parental genotype information). Every marker pair combination was tested for a total of 171 tests and 2 x 2 contingency tables were constructed to measure LD strength. In general the haplotypes derived from pedigree data provided a more conservative estimate of LD strength. Using genealogical information for estimates of D', 59% (10/17) of marker pairs less than 50 kb apart had D' values > 0.30. Finally, we observed a 60 kb region with non-significant LD, which could reflect increased recombination in this region. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Furthermore, there exists censoring on observations on the occurrences of both events and truncation on observations on the occurrence of the second event and thus the survival time of interest. To obtain the maximum likelihood estimator of a survival function, an EM algorithm is developed when the survival function is completely unknown before the change point and known up to a vector of unknown parameters after the change point. The idea is a generalization of that discussed in Moeschberger and Klein. Simulations and an example are used to evaluate and illustrate the algorithm. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons.

We consider the case in which the training data follow a multivariate normal distribution. Assume a potential outlier is observed on which k features of interest are measured. Assume further that the available training set of n observations on these k features is available but that some of the observations in the training data have missing features. The approach currently used in practice is to perform the outlier testing using a generalized likelihood ratio test procedure based only on the data vectors in the training data with complete data. When there is a substantial amount of missing data within the training set, use of this strategy may lead to a loss of valuable information. An alternative procedure is to incorporate all n of the data vectors in the training data using the EM algorithm to appropriately handle the missing data in the training set. Resampling methods are used to find appropriate critical regions. We use simulation results and analysis of models fit to Pg/Lg ratios for the WMQ station in China to compare these two strategies for dealing with missing data.

Such a mixture density estimation problem is multi-target tracking. One of the new data association/tracking algorithms used for multi-target tracking is Probabilistic Multi-Hypothesis Tracker proposed by Streit and Luginbuhl. This paper considers a modification of Probabilistic Multi-Hypothesis Tracker. The implementation of Hough Transform is proposed to generate a good start point to the main PMHT algorithm.

However, for proper recovery of the input, the receiver needs accurate channel information. In this paper, we propose an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for joint channel and data recovery. The algorithm makes use of the rich structure of the underlying communication problem- a structure induced by the data and channel constraints. These constraints include pilots, the cyclic prefix (CP), and the finite alphabet constraints on the data, and sparsity, finite delay spread, and the statistical properties of the channel (time and frequency correlation). Channel identification and equalization is performed optimally and recovery is achieved within the same OFDM symbol using an EM based Kalman filter.

This approach is based on graphical models that combine audio and video variables. We demonstrate it by developing a new algorithm for tracking a moving object in a cluttered, noisy scene using two microphones and a camera. Our model uses unobserved variables to describe the data in terms of the process that generates them. It is therefore able to capture and exploit the statistical structure of the audio and video data separately, as well as their mutual dependencies. Model parameters are learned from data via an EM algorithm, and automatic calibration is performed as part of this procedure. Tracking is done by Bayesian inference of the object location from data. We demonstrate successful performance on multimedia clips captured in real world scenarios using off-the-shelf equipment.

This scheme considerably improves upon windowed and iterative schemes by merging regions on an individual pixel basis. In theory, rigorous expressions for 'false alarm rate' can be defined but they are perhaps too sensitive to the underlying assumptions of independence and homogeneity. Images can be visually improved by a restraint on the 'surface tension' of the segmented regions but, to avoid subjective judgement, performance is assessed using pixel-accuracy ground truth from a rice growing area in central Japan based on multi-temporal, 8m resolution Radarsat data. Gaussian Expectation Maximisation is used to achieve accurate, fully-unsupervised classification of the area without fixed-value thresholding. This large scale backscatter information is then used in a Bayesian merging scheme to give a significant improvement in performance.

In this paper, we propose a novel PCA/MDA scheme for hand posture recognition, Unlike other PCA/MDA schemes, the PCA layer acts as a crude classification. Since posture alone cannot provide sufficient discriminating information, each input pattern will be given a likelihood of being in the nodes of PCA layers, instead of a strict division. Based on the Expectation-Maximization (EAI) algorithm, we introduce three methods to estimate the parameters for this crude classification during training. The experiments on a 110-sign vocabulary show a significant improvement compared with the global PCA/MDA.

The only input to the algorithm is the data, a list of possible transformations, and the number of clusters to find. The main criticism of this work was that the exhaustive computation of the posterior probabilities over transformations would make scaling up to large feature vectors and large sets of transformations intractable. Here, we describe how a tremendous speed-up is acheived through the use of a variational technique for decoupling transformations, and a fast Fourier transform method for computing posterior probabilities. For N x N images, learning C clusters under N rotations, N scales, N x-translations and N y-translations takes only (C + 2 log N)N(2) scalar operations per iteration. In contrast, the original algorithm takes CN(6) operations to account for these transformations. We give results on learning a 4-component mixture model from a video sequence with frames of size 320 x 240. The model accounts for 360 rotations and 76,800 translations. Each iteration of EM takes only 10 seconds per frame in MATLAB, which is over 5 million times faster than the original algorithm.

The proposed method is based on Subband Hidden Markov Model (Subband HMM). To train the HMM, a set of wide band speech is divided into a number of subbands and features are extracted independently. These extracted features are recombined and HMMs are trained by EM algorithm. The training process makes IDAM to model the feature of signal in a single subband. In parallel, HAIM learns the corresponding feature of all other subbands. The correspondence makes it possible to estimate the unobserved frequency component using the correspondence of narrowband signal to the HAM. We further investigate the application of the proposed method to denoising. Some experimental results are shown to confirm the validity of the proposed method.

The method uses a stochastic model-based approach and consists of two steps: (1) unsupervised tissue quantification and (2) 3-D segmentation. Firstly, the MR image volume is modeled by the standard finite normal mixture (SFNM) distribution. It has been shown that the SFNM converges to the true distribution when the pixel images are asymptotically independent. Secondly, the tissue quantification is achieved through (1) model selection by minimum description length (MDL) criterion; (2) parameter initialization by optimal histogram quantization and (3) parameter estimation by a fast EM algorithm using the global 3-D histogram rather than conventionally the raw data. Finally, we develop a 3-D segmentation method using the maximum likelihood (ML) classification and contextual Bayesian relaxation labeling (CBRL). The CBRL is developed to obtain a consistent labeling solution, based on localized SFNM formulation by using neighborhood contextual regularities.

For well-separated vehicles as well as for convoy targets we focus on information fusion aspects comprising both, fusion of data from multiple dislocated sensors as well as incorporation of background information (refined models of the sensor performance, road maps, terrain screening, and simple tactical rules). Under suitably formulated modeling assumptions algorithmic solutions within the context of Gaussian sum approximations are discussed. Methods originally proposed for well-separated vehicles can be embedded into an Expectation-Maximization approach for dealing with collectively moving convoy targets. By this in particular, early detection of a stopping event is alleviated.	FGAN FKIE, Wachtberg, Germany	Koch, W (reprint author), FGAN FKIE, Wachtberg, Germany.

For a long-range ground surveillance application with airborne GMTI radar we in particular address the task of track maintenance for ground moving convoys consisting of a small number of individual vehicles. In the proposed approach the identity of the individual vehicles within the convoy is no longer stressed. Their kinematical state vectors are rather treated as internal degrees of freedom characterizing the convoy. which is considered as a collective unit. In this context, the Expectation Maximization technique (EM), originally developed for incomplete data problems in statistical inference and first applied to tracking applications by STREIT et al. [1, 2], seems to be a promising approach. We suggest to embed the EM algorithm into a more traditional Bayesian tracking framework for dealing with false or unwanted sensor returns. The proposed distinction between 'external' and 'internal' data association conflicts (i.e. those among the convoy vehicles) should also enable the application of sequential track extraction techniques introduced by VAN KEUK [3] for aircraft formations, providing estimates of the number of the individual convoy vehicles involved. Even with sophisticated signal processing methods (STAP: Space-Time Adaptive Processing). ground moving vehicles can well be masked by the sensor specific clutter notch (Doppler blinding). This physical phenomenon results in interfering fading effects, which can well last over a longer series of sensor updates and therefore will seriously affect the track quality unless properly handled. Moreover, for ground moving convoys the phenomenon of Doppler blindness often superposes the effects induced by the finite resolution capability of the sensor. In many practical cases a separate modeling of resolution phenomena for convoy targets can therefore be omitted, provided the GMTI detection model is used. As an illustration we consider the contribution of the proposed GMTI sensor model to the problem of early recognition of a stopping convoy.

J	Kolcz, A; Alspector, J				Kolcz, A; Alspector, J			Asymmetric missing-data problems: Overcoming the lack of negative data in preference ranking	INFORMATION RETRIEVAL			English	Article						incomplete data problems; imbalanced training data; user modeling; personalization; information retrieval	INFORMATION; ALGORITHM; WEB; EM	In certain classification problems there is a strong a asymmetry between the number of labeled examples available for each of the classes involved. In an extreme case, there may be a complete lack of labeled data for one of the classes while, at the same time, there are adequate labeled examples for the others, accompanied by a large body of unlabeled data. Since most classification algorithms require some information about all classes involved, label estimation for the un-represented class is desired. An important representative of this group of problems is that of user interest/preference modeling where there may be a large number of examples of what the user likes with essentially no counterexamples. Recently, there has been much interest in applying the EM algorithm to incomplete data problems in the area of text retrieval and categorization. We adapt this approach to the asymmetric case of modeling user interests in news articles, where only labeled positive training data are available, with access to a large corpus of unlabeled documents. User modeling is here equivalent to that of user-specific document ranking. EM is used in conjunction with the Naive Bayes model while its output is also utilized by a Support Vector Machine and Rocchio's technique. Our findings demonstrate that the EM algorithm can be quite effective in modeling the negative class under a number of different initialization schemes. Although primarily just the negative training examples are needed, a natural question is whether using all of the estimated labels (i.e., positive and negative) would be more (or less) beneficial. This is important considering that, in this context, the initialization of the negative class for EM is likely not to be very accurate. Experimental results suggest that EM output should be limited to negative label estimates only.

In this paper, we propose one such algorithm which uses an evolutionary strategy to iteratively adjust the class membership of the patterns in the unlabeled sample. The iterative adjustment is done so that the class conditional distribution obtained from such a labeling allows a maximum a posteriori classification with minimum classification error on the labeled patterns. We detail the algorithm and provide results obtained by the proposed algorithm on 5 different datasets.

The maximum likelihood estimate of CIR is obtained by using channel statistics (their means and covariances) via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. This algorithm can improve signal detection and the channel estimation accuracy by making use of pilot symbols to obtain an initial estimate for the iteration. Simulation results show that the bit error rate (BER) can be significantly reduced by this algorithm, and validate its good convergence and robust properties.

In most mixed pixel cases, this is assumed to be a linear mixture and signal separation routines have been developed with this mixing composition scheme in mind. One such signal separation routine incorporates the Expectation Maximization Maximum Likelihood (EMML) algorithm for the determination of signal mixtures in a pixel. This routine, however, is very inefficient in that it requires large iteration values to converge to a solution. This report is the result of the implementation of a Re-scaled Block Iterative EMML approach, commonly used in the medical field for emission tomography image processing, to perform signal separation, while greatly increasing the efficiency in computation and rate of convergence to a solution.

Due to its simplicity, image differencing represents a popular approach for change detection. It is based on the idea to generate a difference image that represents the modulus of the spectral change vector associated to each pixel in the study area. To separate the change and no-change classes in the difference image, a simple thresholding-based procedure can be applied. However, the selection of the best threshold value is not a trivial problem. In the present work, several simple thresholding methods are investigated and compared. The combination of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm with a thresholding method is also considered with the aim of achieving a better estimation of the optimal threshold value. For experimental purpose, a study area affected by a forest fire is considered. Two Landsat TM images of the area acquired before and after the event are utilized to reveal the burned zones and to assess and compare the above mentioned unsupervised change detection methods.

J	Miguez, J; Castedo, L				Miguez, J; Castedo, L			Semiblind space-time decoding in wireless communications: a maximum likelihood approach	SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						maximum likelihood; space-time processing; space-time decoding; channel estimation; sequence detection; multiuser detection; interference suppression; EM algorithm; semiblind receivers	MULTIUSER INTERFERENCE SUPPRESSION; MULTIPLE-OUTPUT CHANNELS; BLIND SIGNAL SEPARATION; CDMA SYSTEMS; FADING CHANNELS; EQUALIZATION; CODES; IDENTIFICATION; DIVERSITY; ALGORITHM	It has been recently shown that deploying multiple transmitting and receiving antennae can substantially improve the capacity of multipath wireless channels if the rich time-scattering is properly exploited. Space-time coding (STC) is a novel proposal that combines channel coding techniques suitable for multiple transmitting elements with signal processing algorithms that exploit the spatial and temporal diversity at the receiver. In this paper, we focus on the signal processing perspective and propose a novel space-time semiblind decoding scheme that performs maximum likelihood (ML) based channel estimation and data detection. The multiple input multiple output (MIMO) time-scattering channel is estimated using a block iterative expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that fully exploits the statistical features of the transmitted signal together with the knowledge of a small number of transmitted symbols, hence the term semiblind. Data detection is efficiently carried out using the Viterbi algorithm. In order to reduce the computational load of the receiver, a modification of the EM algorithm with a potentially lower complexity is also suggested. Computer simulations show that the proposed semiblind decoder clearly outperforms conventional receivers that estimate the channel parameters exclusively from the a priori known transmitted symbols.

It has been shown that GAs is independent of initialization parameters. In this work we propose combination of GAs and EM algorithms (GA-EM) for learning Gaussian mixture components to achieve accurate parameter estimation independent of initial values. To assess the performance of the proposed method, a series of Gaussian phantoms, based on modified Shepp-Logan method, were created. In this phantom, each tissue segment presents a Gaussian density function that its mean and variance can be controlled. EM, GAs and GA-EM were employed to estimate the tissue parameters in each phantom. The results indicate that EM algorithm, as expected, is heavily impacted by the initial values. Coupling GAs with EM not only improves the overall accuracy, it also provides estimates that are independent of initial seed values. The proposed method offers a solution for accurate and stable solution for parameter estimation in for Gaussian mixture models, with higher likelihood of achieving global optimal. Obtaining such accurate parameter estimation is a key requirement for several image segmentation approaches, which rely on a priori knowledge of tissue distribution.

Digital radiographs of a chest phantom were acquired, and the amount of scatter in several regions was computed using the known radiographic exposure and the known material properties. Contrast and noise were measured in a step wedge in the phantom. The phantom images were processed by the EM algorithm for up to 8 iterations, and the image intensity and noise values were measured at each iteration step. These values were used to compute the scatter reduction properties of the algorithm and its effect on the contrast-to-noise ratio. The algorithm removed over 90% of the scattered radiation in the image. Image noise values were reduced an average of 50% in the first iteration, but then increased to values equal or above unprocessed images. The contrast-to-noise ratio was initially increased substantially, but gradually decreased as further iterations caused the image noise to increase. With proper selection of processing parameters, this algorithm could provide considerable qualitative enhancement of clinical images with a single iteration as well as numerically accurate scatter reduction.

The NIG can serve as a model for data that are heavy-tailed (leptokurtic), and the model was first introduced in empirical finance by Barndorrf-Nielsen in 1995. In this paper, we present the important extension to multivariate NIG (MNIG) distributions, and we discuss some of the basic properties of the MNIG. We furthermore discuss several new and important properties of the MNIG. An important part of the paper deals with the derivation of a fast and accurate method for generating i.i.d. MNIG-distributed variates. We also present a multivariate Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for the estimation of the scalar, vector, and matrix parameters of the MNIG. Finally, we present a fit of the bivariate NIG to an actual multichannel radar data set, where we have applied our EM parameter estimation algorithm. From the insight we have gained, we conclude that the MNIG has numerous potential applications in multivariate data analysis and modeling, and that the simulation and estimation methods described in this paper may serve as important and useful tools in that respect.

The modeling framework is based on the randomization of a software fault detection rate. Our models, called the mixed SRMs in this paper can include some existing SRMs such as Littlewood NHPP model and the hyperexponential SRM. We develop an efficient parameter estimation algorithm for the mixed SRMs based on the EM (Expectation-Maximization) principle, and investigate both the effectiveness of the EM algorithm and the validity of the mixed SRMs through the numerical examples with real software failure data.

We approximate the multimodal, clean speech linear spectrum magnitude with a mixture of Gaussians pdfs using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm (EM). Subsequently, we apply the Bayesian inference framework to the degraded spectral coefficients and by employing Minimum Mean Square Error Estimation (MMSE) we derive a closed form solution for the spectral magnitude estimation task adapted to the spectral characteristics and noise variance of each band. We suggest that 2-3 minutes of phonetically balanced non-degraded gender or speaker dependent speech is adequate to tune our algorithm. We demonstrate the benefit of using an enhancement technique tailored to a specific gender or speaker and propose its use in cases where message ambiguity is of critical importance. We evaluate of our algorithm using Lynx helicopter and White Gaussian noise on the task of improving the quality of speech and in combination with a speech coder and demonstrate its robustness at very low SNRs.

We commence by placing the pairwise clustering process in the setting of the EM algorithm. We represent the clustering process using two sets of variables which need to be estimated. The first of these are cluster-membership indicators. The second are revised link-weights between pairs of nodes. We work with a model of the grouping process in which both sets of variables are drawn from a Bernoulli distribution. The main contributioin in this paper is to show how the cluster-memberships may be estimated using the leading eigenvector of the revised link-weight matrices. We also establish convergence conditions for the resulting pairwise clustering process. The method is demonstrated on the problem of multiple moving object segmentation.

The SMA consists of several specialized forward mapping functions and an inverse mapping function. Each specialized function maps certain domains of the input space (image features) onto the output space (body pose parameters). The key algorithmic problems faced are those of learning the specialized domains and mapping functions in an optimal way, as well as performing inference given inputs and knowledge of the inverse function. Solutions to these problems employ the EM algorithm and alternating choices of conditional independence assumptions. Performance of the approach is evaluated with synthetic and real video sequences of human motion.

In a previous work [1], sources have been modeled by a mixture of Gaussians leading to an hierarchical Bayesian model by considering the labels of the mixture as hidden variables. However, in that work, labels have been assumed to be i.i.d. We extend this modelization to incorporate a Markovian structure for the labels. This extension is important for practical applications which are abundant: unsupervised classification and segmentation, pattern recognition, speech signal processing In order to estimate the mixing matrix and the a priori model parameters, we consider observations as incomplete data. The missing data are sources and labels : sources are missing data for observations and labels are missing data for incomplete missing sources. This hierarchical modelization leads to specific restoration maximization type algorithms. Restoration step can be held in three different manners: (i) Complete likelihood is estimated by its conditional expectation. This leads to the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm [2], (ii) Missing data are estimated by their maximum a posteriori. This leads to JMAP (Joint maximum a posteriori) algorithm [3], (iii) Missing data are sampled from their a posteriori distributions. This leads to the SEM (stochastic EM) algorithm [4]. A Gibbs sampling scheme is implemented to generate missing data.

The hyper-rectangles are determined by appropriately quantizing the range of each variable. Optimal quantization determines a compact and efficient representation of the probability density of data by optimizing a global quintizer performance measure. The measure used here. is a weighted combination of average log likelihood, entropy and correct classification probability. In multi-dimensions, we study a grid based quantization technique. Smoothing is an important aspect of optimal quantization because it-affects the generalization ability of the quantized density estimates. We use a fast generalized k nearest neighbor smoothing algorithm. We illustrate the effectiveness of optimal quantization on a set of not very well separated Gaussian mixture models, as compared to the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Optimal quantization produces better results than the EM algorithm. The reason is that the convergence of the EM algorithm to the true parameters for not well separated mixture models can be extremely slow.

Nonlinear interpolation methods may be used to recover the deformation if the correspondence of the extracted feature points is available. However, it may be very difficult to establish such correspondence at an initial stage when confronted with large and complex deformation. In this paper, a mixture of principal axes registration (mPAR) is proposed to tackle the correspondence problem using a neural computation method. The feature is to align two point sets without needing to establish the explicit point correspondence. The mPAR aligns two point sets by minimizing the relative entropy between their probability distributions resulting in a maximum likelihood estimate of the transformation mixture. The neural computation for the mPAR is developed using a committee machine to obtain a mixture of piece-wise rigid registrations. The complete registration process consists of two steps: (1) using the mPAR to establish an improved point correspondence and (2) using a multilayer perceptron (hILP) neural network to recover the nonlinear deformation. The mPAR method has been applied to register a contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imago sequece. The experimental results show that our method not only improves the point. correspondence but also results in a desirable error-resilience property for control point selection errors.

It can be cast as an alternative of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, in which the maximization step is carried out by one-dimensional MUSIC estimation. This algorithm is computationally attractive because of the use of high-efficiency MUSIC at each iteration. Moreover, it is able to resolve coherent signals through the signal decomposition. A theoretical performance evaluation procedure is described to analyze the estimation variance of the iterative MUSIC algorithm. Both analytic and experimental results indicate that the iterative MUSIC method is effective for coherent signals.

In this paper, we proposed a novel united active contour model with the information of image region feature and image gradient feature for the purpose of tumor detection. Region-based method added in the model, however, introduces a statistical method into the segmentation of the image and hence becomes less sensitive to noise. The originality in this algorithm is that we introduce a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) into the statistical model description of "seed" region. This model can perform more accurate and optimal statistical description than a single Gaussian model. A K-means algorithm and an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm are used for optimal parameter estimation of GMM. The experimental results show the new model has more optimal performance for image segmentation and boundary finding than classical active contour model.

However most existing clustering methods can only work with fixed-dimensional representations of data patterns. In this paper we study the clustering of data patterns that are represented as sequences or time series possibly of different lengths. We propose a model-based approach to this problem using mixtures of autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models. We derive an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for learning the mixing coefficients as well as the parameters of the component models. Experiments were conducted on simulated and real datasets. Results show that our method compares favorably with another method recently proposed by others for similar time series clustering problems.

To track a slowly time-varying channel, the receiver can update the channel estimate using decision-direction based on soft symbols to mitigate error propagation. When the channel changes so quickly that decision-directed updates cannot keep up, the receiver re-estimates the channel during the decoding process using the EM algorithm based on the transmitted symbol probabilities provided by the turbo decoder. The EM algorithm is used to approximate a maximum likelihood solution given the distribution of the transmitted symbols. With this technique, the iterative process of the EM algorithm is naturally combined with the decoding iteration. Improved coded performance is observed for both static and fast time-varying channels.

The model's starting point is the linear congeneric model for item scores, but it takes into account the bounded nature of the item responses and assumes that their conditional distributions for a fixed trait level are truncated normal. This assumption leads to nonlinear item-trait regressions and considerably modifies some aspects of the linear model. The linear model is considered as an approximation to the modified version, and an interval is defined in which the approximation is satisfactory. Procedures for estimating the item and subject parameters are described. The applicability of the model is illustrated using real data.

J	Zheng, YJ; Lin, ZP; Tay, DBH				Zheng, YJ; Lin, ZP; Tay, DBH			State-dependent vector hybrid linear and nonlinear ARMA modeling: Theory	CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						state-dependent vector hybrid linear and nonlinear ARMA model; MLFF neural networks; hidden Markov chain; maximum likelihood estimation; expectation-maximization algorithm	ALGORITHM	A new model is proposed to represent a general vector nonstationary and nonlinear process by setting up a state-dependent vector hybrid linear and nonlinear autoregressive moving average (SVH-ARMA) model. The linear part of the process is represented by a vector ARMA model, the nonlinear part is represented by a vector nonlinear ARMA model employing a multilayer feedforward neural network, and the nonstationary characteristics are captured with a hidden Markov chain. Based on a unified Q-likelihood function, an expectation-maximization algorithm for model identification is derived, and the model parameters are estimated by applying a state-dependent training and nonlinear optimization technique iteratively, which finally yields maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters. This model can track the nonstationary varying of a vector linear and/or nonlinear process adaptively and represent a vector linear and/or nonlinear system with low order. Moreover, it is able to characterize and track the long-range, second-order correlation features of many time series and thus can be used for reliable multiple step ahead prediction. Some impressive applications of the SVH-ARMA model are being presented in the companion paper by Zheng et al., pp. 575-597, this issue.

J	Zhao, YX				Zhao, YX			Spectrum estimation of short-time stationary signals in additive noise and channel distortion	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						autoregressive processes; distortion; hidden Markov models; maximum likelihood estimation; noise; signal restoration	ROBUST SPEECH RECOGNITION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; EM ALGORITHM; DECONVOLUTION; MODELS; IDENTIFICATION; SPEAKER; MIXTURE	In this work, spectrum estimation of a short-time stationary signal that is degraded by both channel distortion and additive noise is addressed. A maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) algorithm is developed to jointly identify the degradation system and estimate short-time signal spectra, The source signal is assumed to be generated by a hidden Markov model (HMM) with state-dependent short-time spectral distributions described by mixtures of Gaussian densities. The distortion channel is linear time-invariant, and the noise is Gaussian. The algorithm is derived by using the principle of expectation-maximization (EM), where the unknown parameters of channel and noise are estimated iteratively, and the short-time signal power spectra are obtained from the posterior sufficient statistics of the source signal. Other spectral representation parameters, such as autoregressive model parameters or cepstral parameters, are obtained by minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation from the power spectral estimates. The estimation algorithm was evaluated on simulated signals at the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of 20 dB down to 0 dB, where it produced convergent estimation and significantly reduced spectral distortion.

J	Dewanji, A; Biswas, A				Dewanji, A; Biswas, A			An optimal design for simple illness-death model	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE			English	Article						illness-death model; information matrix; EM algorithm; optimal designs	ANIMAL CARCINOGENESIS EXPERIMENTS; SURVIVAL SACRIFICE EXPERIMENTS; SERIAL SACRIFICE; DISEASE; ONSET	Simple illness-death model arises in many medical and animal experiments. In a typical illness-death model, one is often interested in the event of occurrence of disease or illness (D) which is assumed to be unobservable. This event is followed by the event of failure or death (F) which is observable in addition to the presence of disease. Failure (F) can also be observed before the disease occurs in which case the absence of disease is also recorded. With the development of methodologies for making inference on the distribution of D, the design issue has also attracted some attention although not so greatly. In this work, we consider finding an optimal termination time of the experiment. We also consider the design with one intermediate observation time and address the problem of finding an optimal time for such an intermediate observation, We introduce two new optimality criteria and compare them with traditional A-, D- and c-optimality criteria.

This approach uses Gaussian mixture model to simulate the histogram of the highest subband's coefficients in the wavelet domain. The parameters of this model can be calculated by EM algorithm. The smallest deviation of the Gaussian mixture model is selected as the noise deviation. The authors' proposed method can provide better result than the other traditional ones.

As quantal parameters may change during the train according to the previous release events, correlation within consecutive EPSCs is expected. We tested simple hypotheses on how quantal. parameters p and N may change on the basis of correlation detection in EPSCs. The statistical significance of these tests has been evaluated. The tests showed that, although simple binomial distributions can give a good description of synaptic responses at the level of single spikes, only stochastic chains can always account for correlations observed within the train. A systematic model fitting procedure has been developed and applied to extract information on the dynamics of synaptic transmission. As an application of this novel type of analysis, a measure of transmitted information to be associated with synaptic variability, a quantity that allows an estimate of the capability of the synapse to transmit reliable information in time, is proposed. We showed that this transmitted information depends on short-term plasticity and that the change in the type of short-term plasticity from facilitating to depressing obtained by increasing the extracellular calcium concentration results in a change of the related transmitted information.

This paper presents an algorithm for the determination of retinoblastoma (RB) tumor to assist in the determination of tumor volume changes throughout treatment periods. The result of the development of a neural network approach for the analysis of three-dimensional ultrasound images shows that it is possible to identify retinoblastoma tumors and accurately determine the front and back boundary of the tumor. The algorithm used was a soft competitive learning network with two inputs. The outputs of the network identify the eye, the tumor, and the back of the eye. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Bermejo, S; Cabestany, J				Bermejo, S; Cabestany, J			Learning with nearest neighbour classifiers	NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						nearest neighbour classifiers; online gradient descent; Learning Vector Quantization; hand-written character recognition		This paper introduces a learning strategy for designing a set of prototypes for a 1-nearest-neighbour (NN) classifier. In learning phase, we transform the 1-NN classifier into a maximum classifier whose discriminant functions use the nearest models of a mixture. Then the computation of the set of prototypes is viewed as a problem of estimating the centres of a mixture model. However, instead of computing these centres using standard procedures like the EM algorithm, we derive to compute a learning algorithm based on minimising the misclassification accuracy of the 1-NN classifier on the training set. One possible implementation of the learning algorithm is presented. It is based on the online gradient descent method and the use of radial gaussian kernels for the models of the mixture. Experimental results using hand-written NIST databases show the superiority of the proposed method over Kohonen's LVQ algorithms.

J	Saul, LK; Rahim, MG; Allen, JB				Saul, LK; Rahim, MG; Allen, JB			A statistical model for robust integration of narrowband cues in speech	COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE			English	Article							RECOGNITION; FEATURES; NOISE	We investigate a statistical model for integrating narrowband cues in speech. The model is inspired by two ideas in human speech perception: (i) Fletcher's hypothesis (1953) that independent detectors, working in narrow frequency bands, account for the robustness of auditory strategies, and (ii) Miller and Nicely's analysis (1955) that perceptual confusions in noisy bandlimited speech are correlated with phonetic features. We apply the model to detecting the phonetic feature [+/-sonorant] that distinguishes vowels, approximants, and nasals (sonorants) from stops, fricatives, and affricates (obstruents). The model is represented by a multilayer probabilistic network whose binary hidden variables indicate sonorant cues from different parts of the frequency spectrum. We derive the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for estimating the model's parameters and evaluate its performance on clean and corrupted speech. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

J	Weng, TS				Weng, TS			Evaluation of diagnostic tests: Measuring degree of agreement and beyond	DRUG INFORMATION JOURNAL			English	Article						diagnosis; kappa; agreement; prevalence; accuracy	PSYCHIATRIC-DIAGNOSIS; ACCURACY; RELIABILITY; KAPPA	When evaluating a new diagnostic test against a less than perfect "gold standard, " the kappa coefficient of agreement K is often inappropriately used as a measure of "diagnostic accuracy, " which frequently leads to paradoxical findings. In this paper, K is expressed as a function of disease prevalence and diagnostic accuracy (subject to Youden's index > 0), whereby necessary and sufficient conditions, given the accuracy rates, are derived to aid in locating the maximizer of kappa Paradoxical behavior of K can thus be detected in the light of diagnostic accuracy. Attempts are made to clarify, the subtle difference between "diagnostic accuracy" and "diagnostic reliability. " The implication of this difference is then assessed from a regulatory perspective. In order to extend the idea of K beyond its originally intended use, the maximum likelihood method, coupled with the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, is proposed as a remedial option, not for measuring diagnostic agreement or reliability but, rather, for evaluating diagnostic accuracy. Some illustrative examples adapted from published data are provided.

J	Dittrich, W; Hutchinson, DA; Maheshwari, A				Dittrich, W; Hutchinson, DA; Maheshwari, A			Blocking in parallel multisearch problems	THEORY OF COMPUTING SYSTEMS			English	Article							COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY; ALGORITHMS; MEMORY; MODEL	External memory (EM) algorithms are designed for computational problems in which the size of the internal memory of the computer is only a small fraction of the problem size. Blockwise access to data is a central theme in the design of efficient EM algorithms, A similar requirement arises in the transmission of data between processors in high performance parallel computation systems, for which blockwise communication is a crucial issue. We consider multisearch problems, where a large number of queries are to be simultaneously processed and satisfied by navigating through large data structures on parallel computers, Our examples originate as algorithms for parallel machines, and we adapt them to the EM situation where the queries and data structure are considered to be much larger than the size of the available internal memory. This paper presents techniques to achieve blocking for I/O as well as for communication in multisearch on the BSP and EM-BSP models. We describe improvements to the 1-optimal BSP* multisearch algorithm of [8] which permit larger search trees to be handled. In the area of EM algorithms new algorithms for multisearch in balanced trees are described. For search trees of size O (n log n) where n is the number of queries, we obtain a work-optimal, parallel, randomized EM multisearch algorithm whose I/O and communication time are smaller, asymptotically, than the computation time. We obtain a deterministic version via a similar technique. These algorithms are obtained via the simulation techniques of [12], [17], [13], [14], and [24]. For larger trees we describe a parallel, EM algorithm which is I-optimal considering computation, communication, and I/O (for suitable parameter constellations) plus I/O-optimal. We give a lower bound to the number of I/O operations required for filtering n queries through a binary or multiway search tree of size m when m greater than or equal to n(2 + epsilon) for a constant epsilon > 0.

J	Gauderman, WJ; Navidi, W				Gauderman, WJ; Navidi, W			A Monte Carlo Newton-Raphson procedure for maximizing complex likelihoods on pedigree data	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Gibbs sampling; genetic analysis; parameter estimation	GIBBS SAMPLING APPROACH; SEGREGATION ANALYSIS; LINKAGE ANALYSIS; DENSITY-LIPOPROTEIN; GENETIC-ANALYSIS; EM ALGORITHM; IRREDUCIBILITY; DISTRIBUTIONS; APPROXIMATION; MODELS	The Monte Carlo Newton-Raphson (MCNR) method is an iterative procedure that can be used to approximate the maximum of a likelihood function in situations where direct likelihood computation is infeasible because of the existence of unmeasured variables, missing data, or measurement error. We describe the method in the context of pedigree analysis, where genotypes are unmeasured. Parameter values are set to an initial estimate of the MLE and are repeatedly updated using the following three steps: (1) A Monte Carlo Markov chain procedure such as the Gibbs sampler is used to generate multiple samples of genotypes at the current parameter values, (2) the genotype samples are used to estimate the score (gradient) and observed information matrix (Hessian), and (3) the estimated gradient and Hessian are used in a standard Newton-Raphson step to obtain updated parameter values. The resulting sequence of parameter values converges to a neighborhood of the MLE, then varies randomly around it. The parameter values that are generated after convergence are averaged to provide an approximation to the MLE, and an additional set of genotype samples can then be obtained and used to approximate standard errors of the estimates. We present simulation studies indicating that MCNR provides close approximations to the MLE in several standard genetic models. We also apply the method to an analysis of high-density lipids (HDL) in the Berkeley data set (Austin et al., 1988. Amer. J. Hum. Genet. 43, 838-846), showing evidence that the expression of HDL depends on a dominant major gene and an interaction between this gene and body mass index. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The models which exhibit nonlinear parameter dependence are stochastic, continuous-time and partially observed. The implementation of the NR algorithm requires evaluation of the log-likelihood gradient and the Fisher information matrix. Fisher information matrices are important in bounding the estimation error from below, via the Cramer-Rao bound. The derivations are based on relations between incomplete and complete data, likelihood, gradient and Hessian likelihood functions, which are derived using Girsanov's measure transformations.

One approach to region-of-interest identification involves the use of spatial scan statistics. A difficulty arises due to competing concerns: Small scan windows are required for potentially small targets, but larger scan windows are necessary to improve the accuracy of the detector. When the scan statistics are mixture-model density estimates, a borrowed strength profile likelihood approach is shown to be superior to conventional likelihood estimators. We investigate these spatial scan density estimates on example imagery from an unmanned aerial vehicle.
