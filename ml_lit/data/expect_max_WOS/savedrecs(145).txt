The first and second estimation techniques (denoted as PEA1 and PEA2 respectively) are based on a truncated discrete cosine transform (DCT) basis expansion of the phase noise and of the corresponding phasor, respectively and do not require any knowledge of the phase noise statistics. An initial pilot-based estimate is iteratively improved by means of the expectation-maximization algorithm, yielding a soft-decision-directed phase noise estimate. The performances of PEA1 and PEA2 are compared in terms of the mean-square phase error and bit-error rate. Numerical results show that PEA2 out performs PEA1 for practical values of the signal-to-noise ratio.

Iterative channel estimation and channel decoding (for instance by means of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm) is particularly important for these multiuser detection schemes in the presence of time varying channels, where a high density of pilots is necessary to track the channel. This paper designs a method to analytically derive a weighting factor a, necessary to improve the efficiency of interference cancellation in the presence of poor channel estimates. Moreover, this weighting factor effectively mitigates the presence of incorrect decisions at the output of the channel decoder. The analysis provides insight into the properties of such interference cancellation scheme and the proposed approach significantly increases the effectiveness of Successive Interference Cancellation under the presence of channel estimation errors, which leads to gains of up to 3 dB.

J	Borchani, H; Larranaga, P; Bielza, C				Borchani, Hanen; Larranaga, Pedro; Bielza, Concha			Classifying evolving data streams with partially labeled data	INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Data streams; concept drift; change detection; semi-supervised learning	CONCEPT DRIFT; CLASSIFICATION; EM	Recently, several approaches have been proposed to deal with the increasingly challenging task of mining concept-drifting data streams. However, most are based on supervised classification algorithms assuming that true labels are immediately and entirely available in the data streams. Unfortunately, such an assumption is often violated in real-world applications given that it is expensive or because it takes a long time to obtain all true labels. To deal with this problem, we propose in this paper a new semi-supervised approach for handling concept-drifting data streams containing both labeled and unlabeled instances. First, contrary to existing approaches, we monitor three possible kinds of drift: feature, conditional or dual drift. Drift detection is based on a hypothesis test comparing Kullback-Leibler divergence between old and recent data, whose distribution under the null hypothesis of coming from the same distribution is approximated via a bootstrap method. Then, if any drift occurs, a new classifier is learned from the recent data using the EM algorithm; otherwise, the current classifier is left unchanged. Our approach is so general that it can be applied to different classification models. Experimental studies, using the naive Bayes classifier and logistic regression, on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that our approach performs well.

The proposed model is based on a finite discrete mixture to which a uniform component is added to ensure robustness to outliers and noise. The consideration of a finite mixture model is justified by its flexibility, its solid grounding in the theory of statistics and its competitive results. We derive a complete maximum a posteriori learning approach that does not require a priori knowledge about the number of outliers and the number of clusters. A rigorous expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, based on the formulation of a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, is also provided. We report experimental results of applying our model to the challenging problems of visual scenes categorization and texture discrimination.

The MADEIRA PET probe is such a device and was simulated in coincidence with a clinical scanner was simulated using the Monte Carlo package GATE. The device consists of ten layers of silicon of 1 x 1 x 1 mm(3) pixels in a 80 x 52 array. Simulations were run with various activity distributions. No attenuation was included to reduce the amount of scatter in the simulated data. The simulations were conducted in air. Coincidence sorting was performed on the singles list mode data. Random coincidences were rejected and no time or energy blurring was used in order to isolate the events which determine the highest achievable spatial resolution. Sinograms where calculated from the sorted data with one sinogram containing events where both annihilation photons were detected in the PET ring and another for probe-ring events. The probe-ring sinograms identified the limited FOV of the probe. The point-spread function was calculated from the sinograms. The full-width half-maximum decreased from 5.5 mm in the ring-ring sinogram to 2.7 mm in the ring-probe sinogram. The full-width third-maximum decreased from 7 mm to 3 mm. Images were reconstructed using the Maximum Likelihood-Expectation Maximization (ML-EM) algorithm using the list-mode coincidence data. The improvement in spatial resolution seen in the sinograms is reflected in the images.	[Brzezinski, K.; Oliver, J.

We introduce a software framework for quantitative analysis of 3D/4D SPECT.CT Tc-99m bone scintigraphy data that incorporates automatic analysis and osseous tissue healthiness classification based on a patient database annotated by an experienced physician. The usage workflow of our framework starts with the input of SPECT and CT data registered on each other. Using CT information we segment osseous tissue also in the co-registered SPECT dataset. Patient weight, injected dose and system calibration factor are read out of the input datasets in order to estimate tracer activity concentration (AC) in kBq/ml and standardized uptake value (SUV). Support vector machine method is used to classify tissue based on the reference patient database that contains quantitative data for normal and abnormal tissue. Evaluation of the framework was done on patient data acquired 3 hours post injection on a SPECT/CT Symbia T6 system using protocol for quantitative estimation of tracer activity. The acquired projection data was reconstructed using Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization with 3D resolution recovery (OSEM-3D) with attenuation and scatter correction. Data analysis showed a significant correlation between AC and bone density measured in Hounsfield Units (HU) for both male and female patients. The proposed methods demonstrate the ability to automatically quantify and distinguish abnormal tissue from healthy one and to increase physicians' diagnostic confidence.

Sendur and I. W. Selesnick suggest four jointly non-Gaussian bivariate models to characterize the dependency between a coefficient and its parent, and respectively derive the corresponding MAP estimators based on noisy wavelet coefficients in detail in [6]. Among the four models, the second is a mixture model and it is quite complicated to evaluate parameters, so L. Sendur and I. W. Selesnick didn't give a concrete method. In this letter, a concrete mixture bivariate model will be described by drawing inspiration from Model 2. Expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is employed to find the parameters of new model. The simulation results show that the values of PSNR have a bit improvement compared with Model 1. The results can be viewed as a supplementary of model 2 in [6].

Recent advances suggest that measurement of brain volumes can help in defining biomarkers for neurodevelopmental outcome. These techniques rely on an accurate segmentation of the MRI data. However, due to lack of contrast, partial volume (PV) effect, the existence of both hypo- and hyper-intensities and significant natural and pathological anatomical variability, the segmentation of neonatal brain MRI is challenging. We propose a pipeline for image segmentation that uses a novel multi-model Maximum a posteriori Expectation Maximisation (MAP-EM) segmentation algorithm with a prior over both intensities and the tissue proportions, a B0 inhomogeneity correction, and a spatial homogeneity term through the use of a Markov Random Field. This robust and adaptive technique enables the segmentation of images with high anatomical disparity from a normal population. Furthermore, the proposed method implicitly models Partial Volume, mitigating the problem of neonatal white/grey matter intensity inversion. Experiments performed on a clinical cohort show expected statistically significant correlations with gestational age at birth and birthweight. Furthermore, the proposed method obtains statistically significant improvements in Dice scores when compared to the a Maximum Likelihood EM algorithm.	[Cardoso, M.

Due to the presence of noise, intensity non-uniformity, partial volume effects, the limited resolution of MRI and the highly convoluted shape of the cerebral cortex, segmenting the brain in a robust, accurate and topologically correct way still poses a challenge. In this paper we describe a topologically correct Expectation Maximisation based Maximum a Posteriori segmentation algorithm formulated within the Khalimsky cubic complex framework, where both the solution of the EM algorithm and the information derived from a geodesic distance function are used to locally modify the weighting of a Markov Random Field and drive the topology correction operations. Experiments performed on 20 Brainweb datasets show that the proposed method obtains a topologically correct segmentation without significant loss in accuracy when compared to two well established techniques.

We solve the estimation problem utilizing an algorithm based on a Monte Carlo (MC) implementation of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Our approach exploits the linear and Gaussian structure associated with the transmitted signal. We also focus on the impact that inaccurate estimation of PHN bandwidth has on the accuracy of the channel estimates. We show the benefits of the proposed algorithm via simulation studies.

To this end, we adopt the so-called JDE framework introduced in [1] and augmented in [2] with hidden Markov field models to account for spatial dependencies between voxels. This latter spatial addition is essential but also responsible for high computation costs. To face the intractability induced by Markov models, inference in [2] is based on intensive simulation methods (MCMC). In this work we propose an alternative to face this limitation by recasting the JDE framework into a missing data framework and to derive an EM algorithm for inference. We address the intractability issue by considering variational approximations. We show that the derived Variational EM algorithm outperforms the MCMC procedure on realistic artificial fMRI data.

It consists of a mixture of polynomial regressions governed by hidden Markov chains. The underlying hidden process for each cluster activates successively several polynomial regimes during time. The parameter estimation is performed by the maximum likelihood method through a dedicated Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed approach is evaluated using simulated time series and real-world time series issued from a railway diagnosis application. Comparisons with existing approaches for time series clustering, including the stand EM for Gaussian mixtures, K-means clustering, the standard mixture of regression models and mixture of Hidden Markov Models, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Dynamic data-driven approach might provide a solution to this problem. To apply the approach, a flight delay state-space model is required to represent relationship among system states, as well as relationship between system states and input/output variables. Based on the analysis of delay event sequence. a state-space model was established and the input variable was studied. A genetic EM algorithm was applied to obtain global optimal estimates of parameters used in the mode. Validation based on probability interval tests shows that: the model has reasonable goodness of fit to the historical flight data, and the search performance of traditional EM algorithm can be improved by ideals of Genetic Algorithm.

While these three issues are usually addressed separately, they actually have mutual effects on each other. For example, calibration requires correctly associated objects and measurements with calibration errors will result in wrong associations. In this paper, we present a novel joint calibration, association and fusion approach for multi-camera tracking. More specifically, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is incorporated with the extended Kalman filter (EKF) to give a simultaneous estimate of object states, calibration and association parameters. The real video data collected from two cameras are used to evaluate the tracking performance of the proposed method. Compared to the conventional methods, which perform calibration, association and fusion separately, it is shown that the proposed method can significantly improve the robustness and the accuracy of multi-object tracking.

Supervised probabilistic PCA (SPPCA) can utilize label information. However, this information is usually treated as regression targets rather than discrete nominal labels. We propose a classification probabilistic PCA (CPPCA) which is an extension of probabilistic PCA. Unlike SPPCA, the label class information is turned into a class probabilistic function by using a sigmoidal function. As the posterior distribution of latent variables are non-Gaussian, we use Laplace approximation with Expectation Maximization (EM) to obtain the solution. The formulation is applied to a domain adaptation classification problem where the labeled training data and unlabeled test data come from different but related domains. Experimental results show that the proposed model has accuracy over conventional probabilistic PCA, SPPCA and its semi-supervised version. It has similar performance when compared with popular dedicated algorithms for domain adaptation, the structural correspondence learning (SCL) and its variants.

Basket trading under co-integration with the logistic mixture autoregressive model	QUANTITATIVE FINANCE			English	Article						Basket trading; Co-integration; Logistic mixture; EM algorithm; Relative value trading	EM ALGORITHM; CONDITIONAL HETEROSCEDASTICITY	In this paper, we propose a co-integration model with a logistic mixture auto-regressive equilibrium error (co-integrated LMAR), in which the equilibrium relationship among cumulative returns of different financial assets is modelled by a logistic mixture autoregressive time series model. The traditional autoregression (AR) based unit root test (ADF test), used in testing co-integration, cannot give a sound explanation when a time series passes the ADF test. However, its largest root in the AR polynomial is extremely close to, but less than, one, which is most likely the result of a mixture of random-walk and mean-reverting processes in the time series data. With this background, we put an LMAR model into the co-integration framework to identify baskets that have a large spread but are still well co-integrated. A sufficient condition for the stationarity of the LMAR model is given and proved using a Markovian approach. A two-step estimating procedure, combining least-squares estimation and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, is given. The Bayesian information criterion (BIC) is used in model selection. The co-integrated LMAR model is applied to basket trading, which is a widely used tool for arbitrage. We use simulation to assess the model in basket trading strategies with the statistical arbitrage feature in equity markets. Data from several sectors of the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index are used in a simulation study on basket trading. Empirical results show that a portfolio using the co-integrated LMAR model has a higher return than portfolios selected by traditional methods. Although the volatility in the return increases, the Sharpe ratio also increases in most cases. This risk-return profile can be explained by the shorter converging period in the co-integrated LMAR model and the larger volatility in the 'mean-reverting' regime.	[Cheng, Xixin; Yu, Philip L.

To address this problem in brain resection images, we have recently proposed an algorithm in which the registration process is aided by an indicator map that is simultaneously estimated to distinguish between missing and valid tissue. We now extend our method to include both intensity and location information for the missing data. We introduce a prior on the indicator map using a Markov random field (MRF) framework to incorporate map smoothness and spatial knowledge of the missing correspondences. The parameters for the indicator map prior are automatically estimated along with the transformation and indicator map. The new method improves both segmentation and registration accuracy as demonstrated using synthetic and real patient data.

In this paper, we propose a joint channel estimation and ISI/ICI cancellation scheme in which a limited CP is used in a trade-off against high-rate performance in MIMO-OFDM systems. A channel estimation scheme based on the criterion of Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm can be proposed through the use of a training symbol. Simulation results show that the proposed method can significantly enhance the overall MIMO-OFDM system performance after only a few iterations.

AN EM COMPOSITE LIKELIHOOD APPROACH FOR MULTISTAGE SAMPLING OF FAMILY DATA	STATISTICA SINICA			English	Article						Composite likelihood; EM algorithm; family data; missing genotype; multistage sampling	PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODELS; GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; 2-STAGE ESTIMATION; REGRESSION-MODELS; ALGORITHM; CANCER; RISK	Multistage sampling of family data is a common design in the field of genetic epidemiology, but appropriate methodologies for analyzing data collected under this design are still lacking. We propose here a statistical approach based on the composite likelihood framework. The composite likelihood is a weighted product of individual likelihoods corresponding to the sampling strata, where the weights are the inverse sampling probabilities of the families in each stratum. Our approach is developed for time-to-event data and can handle missing genetic covariates by using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. A robust variance estimator is employed to account for the dependence of individuals within families. Our simulation studies have demonstrated the good properties of our approach in terms of consistency and efficiency of the genetic relative risk estimate in the presence of missing genotypes and under different multistage sampling designs. Finally, an application to a familial study of early-onset breast cancer shows the interest of our approach. While it confirms the important effect of the genes BRCA1. and BRCA2 in these families, it also shows that incorrect inference can be made about this effect if the sampling design is not properly taken into account.

This result is however not true at finite number of counts or iterations. In this study, we concentrate on the two dimensional Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization (2D OSEM) algorithm with a finite number of counts and iterations, and investigate the question: given its bias, does this algorithm achieve the minimum variance predicted by the Cramer-Rao lower bound? We found a threshold under which the variance significatively exceeds the biased CRLB. We also found that above this threshold, the variance almost equals the biased CRLB, even for a finite number of iterations and in cold regions. A further analysis is needed to investigate the reason of the observed difference, which might indicate that there exists an algorithm with a smaller variance than OSEM for the same bias, or that a higher bound could be found.

Algorithms that automatically segment and label seabed textures such as coral, sea grass, sand ripple, and mud, require suitable features that discriminate between the texture classes. Here we present a robust, parameterized SAS image texture model based on the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the intensity image. This ACF texture model has been shown to accurately model first-and second-order statistical features of various seabed environments. An unsupervised multi-class k-means segmentation algorithm that uses the features derived from the ACF model is employed to label rock and ripple textures from a set of textured SAS images. The results of the segmentation are compared against the performance of the segmentation approach using biorthogonal wavelets and Haralick features. In the described experiments, the ACF model features are shown to produce better segmentations than the features based on wavelet coefficients and Haralick features for classifiers of low complexity.

Accurate speed forecasting can help in trip planning by allowing travelers to avoid the congested routes, either by choosing the alternative routes or by changing the departure time. It is also helpful for traffic monitoring, control, and planning. An important feature of traffic is that it consists of free flow and congested regimes, which have significantly different properties. Training a single traffic speed predictor for both regimes typically results in suboptimal accuracy. To address this problem, a mixture of experts algorithm which consists of two regime-specific linear predictors and a decision tree gating function was developed. A generalized expectation maximization algorithm was used to train the linear predictors and the decision tree. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on a 5-mile stretch of I35 highway in Minneapolis containing 10 single loop detector stations, with prediction horizons ranging from 5 minutes to one hour ahead. Experimental results showed that mixture of experts approach outperforms several popular benchmark approaches.

Fast and Accurate 3D Compton Cone Projections on GPU Using CUDA	2011 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM AND MEDICAL IMAGING CONFERENCE (NSS/MIC)	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium/Medical Imaging Conference (NSS/MIC)/18th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X-Ray and Gamma-Ray Detectors	OCT 23-29, 2011	Valencia, SPAIN	IEEE, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Nucl & Plasma Sci Soc (IEEE NPSS)		Cone projections; Compton kinematics; GPU; CUDA	IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION	We present a fast and accurate method for reconstructing single photons detected by a Compton camera using 3D cone projection operations formulated to run on a graphics processing unit (GPU) and the compute unified device architecture (CUDA) framework. With these projection operations, image quality and accuracy of modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET) can be improved by incorporating Compton scatter events. We also use Monte Carlo simulation to produce a model of the blurring effects caused by limited energy and spatial resolution of the detectors to improve the quality and accuracy of the reconstructed images. The blur model is then incorporated into the cone projections in a cone-by-cone basis. Our method overcomes challenges such as compute thread divergence, and exploits GPU capabilities such as shared memory and texture memory. Unique challenges for projecting cones compared with projecting lines are also addressed for the GPU. The projection operations are integrated into a list-mode ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) framework to reconstruct images from a Compton camera. The algorithm with blurring model achieves an average of 17.3% improvement on CNR compared with the image reconstructed without the blurring model. The whole reconstruction algorithm takes 2.2 seconds per iteration to process 50, 000 cones in a 96 x 96 x 32 image on a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 480 GPU, including forward projection, backprojection, and multiplicative update. On a single core state-of-the-art central processing unit (CPU), it takes 3.1 hours for the same task with the same level of accuracy in blur modeling. Images generated using the CPU and GPU implementing the same blurring model are virtually identical, with root mean squared (RMS) deviation of 0.01%.

The derivation of the seeding algorithm is guided by the goal to select samples which are likely to be caused by source activity and not by noise and at the same time originate from different sources. The proposed algorithm has moderate computational complexity and finds better seed values than alternative schemes, as is demonstrated by experiments on the database of the SiSEC2010 challenge.

Missing or irregularly sampled observations are commonplace in the chemical industry. In order to circumvent the difficulties rendered by largely incomplete data set, an improved EM based algorithm, which uses the expected value of the log-likelihood function including the missing observations, is developed. Constrained particle filters are adopted to solve the expected log-likelihood function in the EM algorithm. The efficiency of the proposed method in handling missing data is illustrated through numerical examples and validated through experiments.

A Complexity-Reduced ML Parametric Signal Reconstruction Method	EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							TIME-FREQUENCY-DISTRIBUTIONS; WIGNER DISTRIBUTION; MULTICOMPONENT SIGNALS	The problem of component estimation from a multicomponent signal in additive white Gaussian noise is considered. A parametric ML approach, where all components are represented as a multiplication of a polynomial amplitude and polynomial phase term, is used. The formulated optimization problem is solved via nonlinear iterative techniques and the amplitude and phase parameters for all components are reconstructed. The initial amplitude and the phase parameters are obtained via time-frequency techniques. An alternative method, which iterates amplitude and phase parameters separately, is proposed. The proposed method reduces the computational complexity and convergence time significantly. Furthermore, by using the proposed method together with Expectation Maximization (EM) approach, better reconstruction error level is obtained at low SNR. Though the proposed method reduces the computations significantly, it does not guarantee global optimum. As is known, these types of non-linear optimization algorithms converge to local minimum and do not guarantee global optimum. The global optimum is initialization dependent.

NMF with the Kullback-Leibler divergence can be seen as maximisation of the joint likelihood of the dictionary and the expansion coefficients under Poisson observation noise. This approach lacks optimality because the number of parameters (which include the expansion coefficients) grows with the number of observations. As such, we describe a variational EM algorithm for optimisation of the marginal likelihood, i.e., the likelihood of the dictionary where the expansion coefficients have been integrated out (given a Gamma conjugate prior). We compare the output of both maximum joint likelihood estimation (i.e., standard NMF) and maximum marginal likelihood estimation (MMLE) on real and synthetical data. The MMLE approach is shown to embed automatic model order selection, similar to automatic relevance determination.

Application of a Bayesian network for land-cover classification from a Landsat 7 ETM+ image	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							REMOTELY-SENSED DATA; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; SATELLITE IMAGERY; EM ALGORITHM; LARGE AREAS; TM; CLASSIFIERS; INFORMATION; ACCURACY; SENSORS	This article describes the use of a Bayesian network (BN) for the classification of land cover from satellite imagery in northern Swaziland. The main objective of this work was to apply and evaluate the efficacy of a BN for land-cover classification using gap-filled and terrain-corrected Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery acquired on 15 May 2007. The posterior probabilities (parameters) were estimated using the expectation-maximization (EM) and conjugate gradient descent (CGD) algorithms. A comparison of the results obtained from the algorithms indicates similar and excellent overall classification accuracies of 93.01%, and kappa coefficient values of 0.9143. The main result obtained in this study is that both algorithms considered here provide relatively similar and accurate solutions for the classification of the multispectral image although the EM algorithm is marginally competitive relative to CGD algorithm when measured in terms of the Brier score and the logarithmic loss.

In this paper we focus on the computation of path-space smoothed additive functionals. More precisely, this contribution provides new results on the forward filtering backward smoothing (FFBS) and the forward filtering backward simulation (FFBSi) algorithms. We prove that the L(q)-mean error convergence rate of both algorithms depends on the number of observations T and the number of particles N only through the ratio T/N. We also derive non-asymptotic exponential deviation inequalities for these algorithms. The FFBS and FFBSi algorithms are compared when applied to parameter estimation in HMM.

We introduce an inverse Wishart prior over the covariance matrices, whose mean is given by the theory of statistical room acoustics and whose variance is learned from training data. We then derive an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the model parameters in the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) sense given prior knowledge about the microphone spacing and the source positions.

The heuristic approach in finding initial values for minimum density power divergence estimators	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION			English	Article						heuristic optimization; minimum density power divergence estimators; robust estimators; threshold accepting	EM ALGORITHM; LIKELIHOOD	It is well known that in the presence of outliers the maximum likelihood estimates are very unstable. In these situations, an alternative is resorting to the estimators based on the minimum density power divergence criterion for which feasible, computationally closed-form expressions can be derived, so that solutions can be achieved by any standard nonlinear optimization code. But since the function to be minimized is often ill-behaved, the convergence of the algorithm to optimal solutions strongly depends on the choice of the configuration of the initial values. A new procedure based on a heuristic local search approach is introduced in order to survey the parameters space and hence obtaining an accurate set of starting guesses for the gradient-method minimization routine.

Kernel and Stochastic Expectation Maximization Fusion for Target Detection in Hyperspectral Imagery	OPTICAL PATTERN RECOGNITION XXII	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Optical Pattern Recognition XXII	APR 28-29, 2011	Orlando, FL	SPIE		Hyperspectral imagery; pattern recognition; target detection; Gaussian mixture model; SEM algorithm	CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; PATTERN; SEM	In this paper, we present a new algorithm for target detection using hyperspectral imagery. The proposed algorithm is inspired by the outstanding performance of nonlinear RX-algorithm and the robustness of the stochastic expectation maximization (SEM) algorithm. The traditional technique of using SEM algorithm for target detection in hyperspectral imagery is associated with dimensionality reduction of the input data using binning or principal components analysis (PCA) algorithm. Although, the data reduction of the input data is enforced to reduce the computational burden on SEM algorithm, but it affects the results of target detection, especially the challenging one, due to not using the entire information of the potential targets. To facilitate detection of the target by using the entire targets information and simultaneously reducing the computational burden on SEM algorithm, we propose a new scheme for data reduction based on using Kernels. Kernel-based input data reduction is a nonlinear filtering technique in which the input data are mapped to the feature space where most of the background data is filtered using an easily selected threshold. Then, Gaussian mixture model is generated for the reduced input-data and SEM algorithm is employed to estimate the model parameters and to classify that input data. Finally, we allocated the target's class and isolated the target pixels. The proposed scheme for fusion the kernel with SEM algorithm has been tested using real life hyperspectral imagery and the results show superior performance compared to alternate algorithms.

Ridge Regression for Longitudinal Biomarker Data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOSTATISTICS			English	Article						biomarkers; cardiovascular disease (CVD); mixed effects; repeated measures; ridge regression	NONORTHOGONAL PROBLEMS	Technological advances facilitating the acquisition of large arrays of biomarker data have led to new opportunities to understand and characterize disease progression over time. This creates an analytical challenge, however, due to the large numbers of potentially informative markers, the high degrees of correlation among them, and the time-dependent trajectories of association. We propose a mixed ridge estimator, which integrates ridge regression into the mixed effects modeling framework in order to account for both the correlation induced by repeatedly measuring an outcome on each individual over time, as well as the potentially high degree of correlation among possible predictor variables. An expectation-maximization algorithm is described to account for unknown variance and covariance parameters.

In particular, we consider a network where sensors measure a common parameter with different precision rank. The goal of each unit is to estimate the unknown parameter and its own specific type through local communication and computation. Here, we present a decentralized version of the centralized maximum likelihood (ML) estimator. Each sensor computes local sufficient statistics by using its own observations and transmits its local information to its neighborhood. By using an Input Driven Consensus Algorithm (IDCA), the local information can be gradually propagated through the entire network, allowing to estimate the global parameter. We prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm and we show that the relative classification error converges to that of the centralized ML as the network dimension goes to infinity. We also compare this strategy with implementation of expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm via numerical simulations.

Due to the differences in production. mechanisms between neutral and whispered speech, there are considerable differences between the spectral structure of neutral and whispered speech, such as formant shifts and shifts in spectral slope. This study analyzes the dependency of these differences on speakers and phonemes by applying a Vector Taylor Series (VTS) approximation to a model of the transformation of neutral speech into whispered speech, and estimating the parameters of this model using an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The results from this study shed light on the speaker and phoneme dependency of the shifts of neutral to whisper speech, and suggest that similarly derived model adaptation or compensation schemes for whisper speech/speaker recognition will be highly speaker dependent.

It has been investigated from different aspects, but is still very challenging in practical applications. In this paper; based on the finite mixture model and under the EM framework, we maximize the Q-function by differentiation and construct a fixed-point EM algorithm for straight line detection. It is demonstrated by the experiments that this proposed algorithm can effectively detect the straight lines from a digital image or dataset.

We investigate this phenomenon by analysing the initial part of the career of employees starting with unstable contracts for a panel of Italian workers. Our aim is to estimate the probability of getting a stable job and to detect factors influencing both this probability and the duration of precariousness. To answer these questions, we use an ad hoc mixture cure rate model in a Bayesian framework.

A penalized log-likelihood function is proposed and Monte Carlo expectation-maximization algorithm is used to derive the estimates. Under some mild conditions, we establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the resulting estimators. Simulation studies are carried out to investigate the finite sample performance of the proposed method. For illustration purposes, the method is applied to a data set from a pharmaceutical company where the variable of interest is the number of episodes of side effects after the patient has taken the treatments.

While SADA had previously been applied to inference in Gaussian mixture models, we show this sampler to be particularly well suited for models having a composite structure, i.e., when the data may be written as a sum of latent components. The SADA sampler is shown to have favorable mixing properties and lesser storage requirement when compared to standard Gibbs sampling.

J	Fin, X; Huang, BA; Shook, DS				Fin, Xing; Huang, Biao; Shook, David S.			Multiple model LPV approach to nonlinear process identification with EM algorithm	JOURNAL OF PROCESS CONTROL			English	Article						LPV model; Nonlinear system identification; Multiple model; Expectation-maximization method	PREDICTIVE CONTROL	This paper is concerned with the identification of a nonlinear process which operates over several working points with consideration of transition dynamics between the working points. Operating point changes due to economic considerations (e.g. grade change in polymer plants) or working environment changes (e.g. feed raw materials property change) are commonly experienced in process industry. These transitions among different operating conditions excite the inherent nonlinearity of the chemical process and pose significant challenges for process modeling. To circumvent the difficulties, we propose a probability-based identification method in which a linear parameter varying (LPV) model is built using process input-output data. Without knowing the local model dynamics a priori, only excitation signals around each operating point are required to identify linear models of the local dynamics, and then the local models are synthesized with transition data to construct a global LPV model. Simulated numerical examples as well as an experiment performed on a pilot-scale heated tank are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

If not properly corrected, the registration errors can seriously degrade the global surveillance system performance. The relative sensor registration (or grid-locking) process aligns remote data to local data under the assumption that the local data are bias free and that all biases reside with the remote sensor. In this paper, we take into account all registration errors involved in the grid-locking problem. An EM-based estimator of these bias terms is derived and its statistical performance compared to the hybrid Cramer-Rao lower bound (HCRLB).

This is established for the case when the underlying process is either a linear Brownian motion with negative drift or a subordinated Gaussian process. To attain this, one revisits the Wiener-Hopf factorization identities provided by Pecherskii- Rogozin (1969). The Pecherskii- Rogozin identities bring more insight of how quantities like the ascending and descending epochs and the first time to its ultimum supremum inter-play to derive the explicit distribution of the argmax of the process. Extensive simulations are performed to show the closeness between the theoretical and its empirical distribution. We apply our methodology to three USA indices and we show its applicability. We finally provide more evidence that the asset price movement model follows a geometric subordinated Gaussian process.

The pioneer work of Lawrence and Scholkopf tackled this issue in datasets with independent observations by incorporating a statistical noise model within the inference algorithm. In this paper, the specific case of label noise in non-independent observations is rather considered. For this purpose, a label noise-tolerant expectation-maximisation algorithm is proposed in the frame of hidden Markov models. Experiments are carried on both healthy and pathological electrocardiogram signals with distinct types of additional artificial label noise. Results show that the proposed label noise-tolerant inference algorithm can improve the segmentation performances in the presence of label noise.

In the present study, we propose a most general generative model of binary data for Boolean factor analysis and introduce new Expectation-Maximization Boolean Factor Analysis algorithm which maximizes likelihood of Boolean Factor Analysis solution. Using the so-called bars problem benchmark, we compare efficiencies of Expectation-Maximization Boolean Factor Analysis algorithm with Dendritic Inhibition neural network. Then we discuss advantages and disadvantages of both approaches as regards results quality and methods efficiency.

Our dynamic dual decomposition approach uses Lagrange duality to decouple this hard problem into a sequence of tractable sub-problems. The resulting procedure is a straightforward modification of standard non-stationary Markov Decision Process solvers and gives an upper-bound on the total expected reward. The empirical performance of the method suggests that not only is it a rapidly convergent algorithm, but that it also performs favourably compared to standard planning algorithms such as policy gradients and lower-bound procedures such as Expectation Maximisation.

We illustrate its application in a study case of mass detection in mammography, providing a detailed description of a feasible and efficient implementation. Our proposed method overcomes numerical variable underflow problems by means of logarithmic and exponential manipulations and saves computational time using a look up table approach. We reduced computation time to 57.14% with respect to direct computation, achieving numerical conditions for convergence.

The main contributions of this paper are: i) a simplified version of Hierarchical Language Model (HLM), which involves scoring XML elements with a combined probability of generating the given query from itself and the top level articl node, is shown to outperform the baselines of LM and VSM scoring of XML elements; ii) the Expectation Maximization (EM) feedback in LM is shown to be the most effective on the domain specific collection of IMDB; automated removal of sentences indicating aspects of irrelevance from the narratives of INEX ad hoc topics is shown to improve retrieval effectiveness.

In our approach, the i-vector extractor parameters are numerically optimized to minimize the discriminative cross-entropy error function. Two versions of the i-vector extraction are studied the original approach as defined for Joint Factor Analysis, and the simplified version, where orthogonalization of the i-vector extractor matrix is performed.

Here, the mixture model stores a vector of sufficient statistics of the best solutions, which is subsequently used to obtain the parameters of the Gaussian components. This approach is able to incorporate into the current mixture model potentially relevant information of the previous and current iterations. The online nature of the proposal is desirable in the context of dynamic optimization, where prompt reaction to new scenarios should be promoted. To analyze the performance of our proposal, a set of dynamic optimization problems in continuous domains was considered with distinct levels of complexity, and the obtained results were compared to the results produced by other existing algorithms in the dynamic optimization literature.

Under standard assumptions, a latent-class mixed logit specification with three sub-populations is shown to capture well heterogeneity in individual contribution levels over time, while also accomodating for different degrees of heteroscedasticity. The estimation results are consistent with the conjecture that the majority of players in public goods games are strongly conditional cooperators, with smaller fractions of the population leaning to opportunistic or altruistic behavior.

However, the componentwise decomposition of a multidimensional log-likelihood function according to the EM or SAGE algorithm fails for realistic time-variant channels. Thus, we consider the minimization of a multidimensional log-likelihood function for the closely-spaced channel delays. To get this log-likelihood function, we use a decomposition of the highly time-variant channel path phasors based on Slepian's subspaces. The obtained log-likelihood function enables a coherent averaging over several hundred codewords even for high-mobility receivers. Therefore, we avoid the squaring loss (SL) that appears for the conventional incoherent averaging and incoherent log-likelihood functions. Our simulations show that the minimization of coherent log-likelihood functions based on Slepian's functions yields a root mean square error (RMSE) of the line of sight (LOS) delay estimation that approximates the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) rather closely.

Design and Initial Performance of PETbox4, a High Sensitivity Preclinical Imaging Tomograph	2011 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM AND MEDICAL IMAGING CONFERENCE (NSS/MIC)	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium/Medical Imaging Conference (NSS/MIC)/18th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X-Ray and Gamma-Ray Detectors	OCT 23-29, 2011	Valencia, SPAIN	IEEE, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Nucl & Plasma Sci Soc (IEEE NPSS)				PETBox4, currently under development at the Crump Institute is a new tomograph dedicated to preclinical imaging of mice. This system presents a significant improvement on sensitivity and spatial resolution compared to the first generation PETBox. We report here on its design and initial performance characteristics. Methods: PETBox4 consists of four opposing detector panels arranged in a box like geometry. Each panel is made by a 24 X 50 array of 1.825 x 1.825 x 7mm BGO scintillation crystals with a crystal pitch of 1.9025mm. Each scintillator array is coupled to two Hamamatsu H8500 photomultiplier tubes via a glass light guide. Images for a 45 x 45 x 94mm FOV are reconstructed with the ML-EM algorithm and a system model based in a parameterized detector response. The complete system is integrated with a real time respiratory monitoring system, and provides anatomical reference images via a combination of x-ray projection, optical images and a digital mouse atlas. Results: The measured crystal energy resolution ranged from 13.9% to 40.4% FWHM, with a mean of 18.0%. With an energy window of 150 - 650 keV optimized for mouse imaging, the peak absolute sensitivity was approximately 14% at the center of FOV based on the results of GATE Monte Carlo simulations. The intrinsic detector spatial resolution was 1.5mm FWHM in both transverse and axial directions. The reconstructed image spatial resolution for different positions in the FOV ranged from 1.32mm to 1.93mm, with an average of 1.46mm. Initial imaging studies were performed with fillable phantoms and live mice. Conclusion: In comparison to the first generation two panel PETBox system, PETBox4 achieves substantial improvements on sensitivity and spatial resolution, while it provides full 3D tomographic PET images, retaining the small overall footprint and provides a novel anatomical reference approach.

This difficulty arises from the necessity to model tens thousands correlated data simultaneously and to reliably learn such unusually complex mixture models. Presented paper surveys these novel generative colour image models based on multivariate discrete, Gaussian or Bernoulli mixtures, respectively and demonstrates their major advantages and drawbacks on texture modelling applications. Our mixture models are restricted to represent two-dimensional visual information. Thus a measured 3D multi-spectral texture is spectrally factorized and corresponding multivariate mixture models are further learned from single orthogonal mono-spectral components and used to synthesise and enlarge these mono-spectral factor components. Texture synthesis is based on easy computation of arbitrary conditional distributions from the model. Finally single synthesised mono-spectral texture planes are transformed into the required synthetic multi-spectral texture. Such models can easily serve not only for texture enlargement but also for segmentation, restoration, and retrieval or to model single factors in unusually complex seven dimensional Bidirectional Texture Function (BTF) space models. The strengths and weaknesses of the presented discrete, Gaussian or Bernoulli mixture based approaches are demonstrated on several colour texture examples.

J	Hajian-Tilaki, K; Hanley, JA; Nassiri, V				Hajian-Tilaki, Karimollah; Hanley, James A.; Nassiri, Vahid			An extension of parametric ROC analysis for calculating diagnostic accuracy when underlying distributions are mixture of Gaussian	JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						mixture of Gaussian; binormal model; area under the curve; true positive fraction; parametric ROC analysis; extension	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; CURVES; METHODOLOGY; AREA; ALGORITHM; ERROR; TESTS	The semiparametric LABROC approach of fitting binormal model for estimating AUC as a global index of accuracy has been justified (except for bimodal forms), while for estimating a local index of accuracy such as TPF, it may lead to a bias in severe departure of data from binormality. We extended parametric ROC analysis for quantitative data when one or both pair members are mixture of Gaussian (MG) in particular for bimodal forms. We analytically showed that AUC and TPF are a mixture of weighting parameters of different components of AUCs and TPFs of a mixture of underlying distributions. In a simulation study of six configurations of MG distributions:{bimodal, normal} and {bimodal, bimodal} pairs, the parameters of MGdistributions were estimated using the EM algorithm. The results showed that the estimated AUC from our proposed model was essentially unbiased, and that the bias in the estimated TPF at a clinically relevant range of FPF was roughly 0.01 for a sample size of n = 100/100. In practice, with severe departures from binormality, we recommend an extension of the LABROC and software development for future research to allow for each member of the pair of distributions to be a mixture of Gaussian that is a more flexible parametric form.

And binning data can be efficient in solving this problem. In the former study, basing cluster analysis on Gaussian mixture models becomes a classical and powerful approach. EM and CEM algorithm are commonly used in mixture approach and classification approach respectively. According to the parametrization of the variance matrices (allowing some of the features of clusters be the same or different: orientation, shape and volume), 14 Gaussian parsimonious models can be generated. Choosing the right parsimonious model is important in obtaining a good result. According to the existing study, Binned-EM algorithm was performed for the most general and diagonal model. In this paper, we apply binned-EM algorithm on spherical models. Two spherical models are studied and their performances on simulated data are compared. The influence of the size of bins in binned-EM algorithm is analyzed. Practical application is shown by applying on Iris data.

A four component (signal dropout, echocardiographic artifacts, blood and tissue) Rayleigh mixture model is proposed for modeling the inside and outside of the endocardium. The parameters of the mixture model are determined by Expectation Maximization, for the sequence. Annotated data is used to provide prior data, by which prior distributions for the inside and outside of the endocardium are constructed. Segmentation is then achieved by minimizing the Hellinger distance between prior and estimated distributions, under the constraints of a statistical shape prior built from principal eigenvectors of the annotated data. Since our model is convex, we can employ a fast optimization method: the Split-Bregman algorithm. Promising segmentation results and quantitative measures are provided.

Firstly, a complex Laplacian (Hermitian) matrix is constructed from the Gaussian-weighted distances and the difference of SIFT [10] angles between each pair of points in the two images to be matched. Matches are computed by comparing the complex eigenvectors of the Hermitian property matrices for the two point sets acquired from the two images. Secondly, we embed the complex modal structure within Carcassoni's [12] iterative alignment method to render it more robust to rotation.

Firstly, a complex Laplacian (Hermitian) matrix is constructed from the Gaussian-weighted distances and the difference of SIFT [10] angles between each pair of points in the two images to be matched. Matches are computed by comparing the complex eigenvectors of the Hermitian property matrices for the two point sets acquired from the two images. Secondly, we embed the complex modal structure within Carcassoni's [12] iterative alignment method to render it more robust to rotation. Our method has been evaluated on both synthetic and real-world data.

A Competitive Mechanism for Self-Organized Learning of Sensorimotor Mappings	2011 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DEVELOPMENT AND LEARNING (ICDL)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Development and Learning (ICDL)	AUG 24-27, 2011	GERMANY	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc, Frankfurt Inst Adv Studies (FIAS), CITEC, italk, Springer, Microsoft Res, IM CLeVeR			SYSTEMS	How can a robot learn sensorimotor knowledge in a developmental way based on its own experiences solely? An important step is the acquisition of a body-schema-learning about the physical behavior of its own body, and how incoming sensory stimuli can be put in relation to the own body. In this work, we study how a competitive learning mechanism, which is related to the EM algorithm, can help to simplify the learning problem. We demonstrate how a robot can learn the way visual stimuli move as a consequence of the robots own actions of moving its camera or moving its end-effector in front of its camera. We show how the robot can discriminate stimuli originating from these two kinds of actions and learn the position of the end-effector in its visual input. Previous approaches have relied on a preprocessing step to "self-detect", which we find is not necessary. The robot acquires a set of sensorimotor estimates, which could later be used, e. g. in visually guided reaching.

HMMs cannot represent incremental progress between behaviors, and sequences sampled from the models have unnatural segment durations, unsmooth transitions, and excessive rapid variation. We propose to address these problems by permitting the state variable to occupy positions between the discrete states, and present a concrete left-right model incorporating this idea. We call this intermediate-state HMMs. The state evolution remains Markovian. We describe training using the generalized EM-algorithm and present associated update formulas. An experiment shows that the intermediate-state model is capable of gradual transitions, with more natural durations and less noise in sampled sequences compared to a conventional HMM.

Three contributions are made. Firstly, the relations between correspondence based and some information-theoretic point cloud registration algorithms are formalized. Starting from the observation that the outlier handling of existing methods relies on heuristically determined models, a second contribution is made exploiting a fore mentioned relations to derive a new robust point set registration algorithm. Representing model and scene point clouds by mixtures of Gaussians, the method minimizes their Kullback-Leibler divergence both w.r.t. the registration transformation parameters and w.r.t. the scene's mixture coefficients. This results in an Expectation-Maximization Iterative Closest Point (EM-ICP) approach with a parameter-free outlier model that is optimal in information-theoretical sense. While the current (CUDA) implementation is limited to the rigid registration case, the underlying theory applies to both rigid and non-rigid point set registration. As a by-product of the registration algorithm's theory, a third contribution is made by suggesting a new point cloud Kernel Density Estimation approach which relies on maximizing the resulting distribution's entropy w.r.t. the kernel weights. The rigid registration algorithm is applied to align different patches of the publicly available Stanford Dragon and Stanford Happy Budha range data. The results show good performance regarding accuracy, robustness and convergence range.

Due to the excessive channel delay spread in CDD, traditional in-band pilot assisted channel estimation with limited frequency resolution fails to track the considerable variation in the frequency domain. Alternatively, increasing pilot overhead will degrade the system throughput significantly. In this paper, we propose to use superimposed pilots to estimate highly frequency selective channels in CDD-OFDM systems. Compared to in-band pilot based channel estimations, the proposed scheme with pilot symbols superimposed over each subcarrier has full frequency resolution, hence it is more robust to severe frequency selectivity from the excessively long CDD channel. An Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is employed to estimate the channel iteratively based on superimposed pilots and tentative soft decisions. At the end of each iteration, to exploit the inherent channel sparsity and refine the estimate, channel taps are sorted and selected according to the power. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed scheme is promising in time varying fading channels without an increase in pilot overhead.

There are two approaches of documents clustering, one is clustering with metadata of documents, and the other is clustering with content of documents. Most of previous clustering approaches with documents contents focused on the documents summary (summary of single or multiple files) and the words vector analysis of documents, found the few and important keywords to conduct documents clustering. In this study, we categorize hot commodity on the web then denominate them, in accordance with the web text (abstracts) of these hot commodity and their accessing times. Firstly, parsing Chinese web text of documents for hot commodity, applied the hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm-Ward method to analyze the properties of words into themes and decide the number s of themes. Secondly, adopting the Cross Collection Mixture Model which applied in Temporal Text Mining and the accessing times( the degree of user identification words) to collect dynamic themes, then gather stable words by probability distribution to be the vectors of documents clustering. Thirdly, estimate parameters with Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. Finally, apply K-means with extracted dynamic themes to be the features of documents clustering. This study proposes a novel approach of documents clustering and through a series of experiment, it is proven that the algorithm is effective and can improve the accuracy of clustering results.

Thus, the parameter estimation of a mixed-Weibull distribution is considered and the important issue of how to determine the number of components is discussed.

SPECT Reconstruction with Sub-Sinogram Acquisitions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGING SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						single photon emission computed tomography; positron emission tomography; reconstruction; sub-sinograms; iterative reconstruction	EM ALGORITHM; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; NOISE; IMAGES; SIZE	Described herein are the advantages of using sub-sinograms for single photon emission computed tomography image reconstruction. A sub-sinogram is a sinogram acquired with an entire data acquisition protocol, but in a fraction of the total acquisition time. A total-sinogram is the summation of all sub-sinograms. Images can be reconstructed from the total-sinogram or from sub-sinograms and then be summed to produce the final image. For a linear reconstruction method such as the filtered backprojection algorithm, there is no advantage of using sub-sinograms. However, for nonlinear methods such as the maximum likelihood (ML) expectation maximization algorithm, the use of sub-sinograms can produce better results. The ML estimator is a random variable, and one ML reconstruction is one realization of the random variable. The ML solution is better obtained via the mean value of the random variable of the ML estimator. Sub-sinograms can provide many realizations of the ML estimator. We show that the use of sub-sinograms can produce better estimations for the ML solution than can the total-sinogram and can also reduce the statistical noise within iteratively reconstructed images.

We use different selection techniques including KullBack - Leibler Divergence (KLD) for ranking different texture and intensity features. We then exploit graph cut, self organizing maps (SOM) and expectation maximization (EM) techniques to fuse selected features for brain tumors segmentation in multimodality T1, T2, and FLAIR MRI. We use different similarity metrics to evaluate quality and robustness of these selected features for tumor segmentation in MRI for real pediatric patients. We also demonstrate a non-patient-specific automated tumor prediction scheme by using improved AdaBoost classification based on these image features.

In this paper, a new parameter learning method based on compiling BNs is proposed. Firstly, a target BN with multiple evidence sets are compiled into a single shared binary decision diagram (SBDD) which shares common sub-graphs in multiple BDDs. Secondly, all conditional expectations which are required for executing the EM algorithm are simultaneously computed on the SBDD while their common local probabilities and expectations are shared. Due to these two types of sharing, the computation efficiency of the proposed method is higher than that of an EM algorithm which naively uses an existing BN compiler for exact inference.

In conversations, people tend to mimic their companions' behavior depending on their level of trust. With the proposed model, we assume that the word use of a speaker depends on the word use of previous speakers as well as their own earlier word use and the general word distribution. The influences can be efficiently estimated by using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Experiments on two meeting data sets in Japanese and in English demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

When dealing with a large-scale data set, P(2)LSA and P(2)LSA+ can improve the computing speed with the Hadoop platform. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is often used in the traditional PLSA method to estimate two hidden parameter vectors, while the parallel PLSA is to implement the EM algorithm in parallel. The EM algorithm includes two steps: E-step and M-step. In P(2)LSA, the Map function is adopted to perform the E-step and the Reduce function is adopted to perform the M-step. However, all the intermediate results computed in the E-step need to be sent to the M-step. Transferring a large amount of data between the E-step and the M-step increases the burden on the network and the overall running time. Different from P(2)LSA, the Map function in P(2)LSA+ performs the E-step and M-step simultaneously. Therefore, the data transferred between the E-step and M-step is reduced and the performance is improved. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the performances of P(2)LSA and P(2)LSA+. The data set includes 20000 users and 10927 goods. The speedup curves show that the overall running time decrease as the number of computing nodes increases. Also, the overall running time demonstrates that P(2)LSA+ is about 3 times faster than P(2)LSA.

In this research we evaluate the importance of resolution recovery in determining the absolute amount of activity in small liver tumors by comparing three different approaches: ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM), OSEM with 2D resolution recovery and OSEM with 3D resolution recovery. Two different sets of projections were created. Model based projections were created by layer by layer blurring of activity phantom using known distance dependent Gaussian functions. Simple ray sum of this blurred phantom was driven to create projections. This simulates noise free projections with completely known system response. The other set of projections was created using SIMIND Monte Carlo simulator. Eight small tumors (1x1x1 cm) were considered on different parts of NCAT liver phantom in such a way that all appear in same plane in a sagittal slice. Vertical distance between each couple of tumors was varied between 1 and 4 pixels (equal to 3.3 and 13.3 mm). To evaluate the value of resolution recovery during reconstruction, OSEM with the ability of modeling both 2D and 3D system response model during reconstruction was developed and used. Both 2D and 3D resolution recovery results in better quantitative results compared to simple OSEM. 3D resolution recovery, however reconstruct images with much higher quantitative accuracy. Only in 3D resolution recovery it is possible to separate all couple of tumors in axial direction. The amount of activity recovery depends on the number of iteration. Using 8 iterations and 8 subsets in each iteration, 3D resolution recovery results in 8% better activity recovery compared to 2D and 13% compared to simple OSEM. This amount is 27% and 46% for 25 iterations.

We experiment on classification problems and calculate misclassification rates (MR) for different missing data percentages (MDP) using a missing completely at random (MCAR) scheme. We compare three MDTs: pairwise deletion (PW), mean imputation (MI) and a maximum likelihood method that we call complete expectation maximization (CEM). We use a synthetic dataset, the Iris dataset and the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. We train a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). We test the trained GMM for two cases, in which test dataset is missing or complete. The results show that CEM is the most efficient method in both cases while MI is the worst performer of the three. PW and CEM proves to be more stable, in particular for higher MDP values than MI.

Simulated Performance of Algorithms for the Localization of Radioactive Sources from a Position Sensitive Radiation Detecting System (COCAE)	APPLICATIONS OF NUCLEAR TECHNIQUES: ELEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Applications of Nuclear Techniques	JUN 12-18, 2011	Crete, GREECE	Sci Applicat Int Corp (SAIC), Inc		Monte Carlo simulations; Semiconductor detectors; Gamma-ray spectroscopy; Compton camera		Simulation studies are presented regarding the performance of algorithms that localize point-like radioactive sources detected by a position sensitive portable radiation instrument (COCAE). The source direction is estimated by using the List Mode Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (LM-ML-EM) imaging algorithm. Furthermore, the source-to-detector distance is evaluated by three different algorithms based on the photo-peak count information of each detecting layer, the quality of the reconstructed source image, and the triangulation method. These algorithms have been tested on a large number of simulated photons over a wide energy range (from 200 keV to 2 MeV) emitted by point-like radioactive sources located at different orientations and source-to-detector distances.

The main contribution of our method is that the trajectories are automatically extracted from the video sequence and they are provided directly to a model-based clustering approach. In most other methodologies, the latter constitutes a difficult part since the resulting feature trajectories have a short duration, as the key points disappear and reappear due to occlusion, illumination, viewpoint changes and noise. We present here a sparse, translation invariant regression mixture model for clustering trajectories of variable length. The overall scheme is converted into a Maximum A Posteriori approach, where the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used for estimating the model parameters. The proposed method detects the different objects in the input image sequence by assigning each trajectory to a cluster, and simultaneously provides the motion of all objects. Numerical results demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to offer more accurate and robust solution in comparison with the mean shift tracker, especially in cases of occlusions.

J	Kau, JB; Keenan, DC; Li, XW				Kau, James B.; Keenan, Donald C.; Li, Xiaowei			An Analysis of Mortgage Termination Risks: A Shared Frailty Approach with MSA-Level Random Effects	JOURNAL OF REAL ESTATE FINANCE AND ECONOMICS			English	Article						Mortgage termination; MSA; Shared-frailty effect	BACKED SECURITIES; EM ALGORITHM; PREPAYMENT; VALUATION; MODEL; DEFAULT; RATES	Investigating the residential mortgage defaults and prepayments has been the subject of research for the past three decades. The literature on mortgage default and prepayment is often used to inform credit risk policies and asset pricing strategies. This literature has evolved from the use of logistic regressions to the use of survival and frailty models that control for unobserved heterogeneity. In this paper, we apply a shared-frailty survival model to analyze the mortgage termination risks. In particular, we investigate whether mortgages originated in the same Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) share common unobserved factors and how these factors affect the mortgage termination risks. The paper demonstrates that MSA-level frailty, together with other risk factors, has significant effects on the probability of mortgage terminations risks.

The system operates over a double-selective channel and includes a carrier frequency offset (CFO). We propose a maximum a posteriori probability expectation-maximization (MAP-EM) receiver with a different EM parameter division than standard methods. In such standard MAP-EM receivers, the E-step parameters correspond to the channel, while the M-step parameters correspond to the CFO and data symbols. This standard receiver parameter division results into a highly complex receiver for QAM, due to the large modulated symbol alphabet size, and the non-constant constellation symbol amplitude. In this paper, a new receiver framework introduces a different parameter division that leads to reduced complexity turbo receivers for QAM signaling, while still achieving close to optimal system performance. The new approach adapts the sum-product algorithm (SPA) parameter framework to the MAP-EM receiver. Thus, in the new receiver framework, the E-step parameters are data symbols, while the M-step parameters are the channel and the CFO. We evaluate the performance of the proposed receiver with and without automatic repeat request (ARQ), where in the former case packet combining applies to further improve performance.

The simulated signal using computational model differs from the true signal in that the signal does not simulated experimental noise. In order to use the computational models more effectively for signal processing algorithm development, experimental noise should be injected in the simulated signals. Experimental noise PDF (probability density function) can be numerically calculated from measured noise. The experimental signal PDF can then be generated by combining the simulation signal and measurement noise PDF. Sampling from experimental signal distribution is not a straight forward task as the distribution is generally not a standard parametric distribution. This paper presents a method that approximates experimental signal PDF as a mixture of Gaussian densities. Maximum-likelihood estimate of the parameters of Gaussian distributions from a given data set are computed using expectation-maximization (EM) technique. A sampling scheme from the mixture of Gaussian densities is also discussed. The overall algorithm is implemented on eddy current inspection data from steam generator (SG) tubing.

Variance-reduction normalization technique for a compton camera system	JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION			English	Article						Compton imaging; Medical-image reconstruction methods and algorithms, computer-aided so	IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION; SPECT	For an artifact-free dataset, pre-processing (known as normalization) is needed to correct inherent non-uniformity of detection property in the Compton camera which consists of scattering and absorbing detectors. The detection efficiency depends on the non-uniform detection efficiency of the scattering and absorbing detectors, different incidence angles onto the detector surfaces, and the geometry of the two detectors. The correction factor for each detected position pair which is referred to as the normalization coefficient, is expressed as a product of factors representing the various variations. The variance-reduction technique (VRT) for a Compton camera (a normalization method) was studied. For the VRT, the Compton list-mode data of a planar uniform source of 140 keV was generated from a GATE simulation tool. The projection data of a cylindrical software phantom were normalized with normalization coefficients determined from the non-uniformity map, and then reconstructed by an ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm. The coefficient of variations and percent errors of the 3-D reconstructed images showed that the VRT applied to the Compton camera provides an enhanced image quality and the increased recovery rate of uniformity in the reconstructed image.

As a consequence, white matter appears differently across the cortical lobes in MR images acquired during early postnatal development. At 1 year old specifically, the gray/white matter contrast of MR images in prefrontal and temporal lobes is limited and thus tissue segmentation results show commonly reduce accuracy in these lobes. In this novel work, we propose the use of spatial intensity growth maps (IGM) for T1 and T2 weighted image to compensate for local appearance inhomogeneity. The IGM captures expected intensity changes from 1 to 2 years of age, as appearance inhomogeneity is highly reduced by the age of 24 months. For that purpose, we employ MRI data from a large dataset of longitudinal (12 and 24 month old subjects) MR study of Autism. The IGM creation is based on automatically co-registered images at 12 months, corresponding registered 24 months images, and a final registration of all image to a prior average template. In template space, voxelwise correspondence is thus achieved and the IGM is computed as the coefficient of a voxelwise linear regression model between corresponding intensities at 1-year and 2-years. The proposed IGM shows low regression values of 1-10% in GM and CSF regions, as well as in WM regions at advanced stage of myelination at 1-year. However, in the prefrontal and temporal lobe we observed regression values of 20-25%, indicating that the IGM appropriately captures the expected large intensity change in these lobes due to myelination. The IGM is applied to cross-sectional MRI datasets of 1-year old subjects via registration, correction and tissue segmentation of the corrected dataset. We validated our approach in a small study of images with known, manual "ground truth" segmentations. We furthermore present an EM-like optimization of adapting existing non-optimal prior atlas probability maps to fit known expert rater segmentations.

Only a single light source with macro-illumination and wavelength-discrimination is required for the purpose of light emission stimulation and 3D image reconstruction. HEFT is built on fluorescent sources with a relatively broad spectral absorption profile (quantum dots) and a light propagation model for strongly absorbing tissue between wavelengths 560 nm and 660 nm (simplified spherical harmonics - SPN, - equations). The measured partial current of fluorescence light is cast into an algebraic system of equations, which is solved for the unknown quantum dot distribution with an expectation-maximization (EM) method. HEFT requires no source-detector multiplexing for 3D image reconstruction and, hence, offers a technologically simple design.

J	Ko, FS				Ko, Feng-Shou			Using the Score Test to Identify the Longitudinal Biomarker Considering Accelerate Failure Time Model with the Frailty in Survival Analysis	COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS			English	Article						EM algorithm; Longitudinal data; Measurement error; Random effect; Survival data	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; CENSORED-DATA; ERROR	Quality of life (QOL) is looked upon as a multidimensional entity comprising physical, psychological, social, and medical parameters. QOL is a good prognostic factor for the cancer patients. In this article, we want to determine if QOL is a good biomarker as a surrogate to indicate the survival time of gastric cancer patients. We conducted a single institutional trial and examines QOL of gastric cancer patients receiving the different surgery. In this trial, QOL is a longitudinal measurement. The accelerated failure time model can be used to deal with survival data when the proportionality assumption fails to capture the relationship between the survival time and covariates. In this article, similar to Henderson et al. (2000, 2002), a joint likelihood function combines the likelihood functions of the longitudinal biomarkers and the survival times under the accelerated failure time assumption. We introduce a method employing a frailty model to identify longitudinal biomarkers or surrogates for a time to event outcome. We allow random effects to be present in both the longitudinal biomarker and underlying survival function. The random effects in the biomarker are introduced via an explicit term while the random effect in the underlying survival function is introduced by the inclusion of frailty into the model. We will introduce a method to identify longitudinal biomarkers or surrogates for a time to event outcome based on the accelerated failure time assumption.

The software includes multiple expectation maximization based reconstruction algorithms as well as support for several scanner geometries. In order to implement novel reconstruction techniques (e.g. TV-based regularization or combined reconstruction and motion correction) or scanner models, full access to every stage of the reconstruction pipeline is vital. EMrecon is fully open and well-documented, thus permits testing without the need to care about data formats or standard reconstruction and data correction algorithms. Due to the GATE-like syntax new scanner geometries, including an exact definition of each single crystal, can be added easily. The parallel (multi-core) C implementation was successfully tested on several Linux distributions.

For accurate observation of weather data, we need to remove the effect of the ground clutter. In this paper, we propose to model the spectrum of an observed IQ signal as a mixture density function. To estimate the parameters of the density function, we apply the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm in a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation with hyper parameters learned from the actual measurements of the ground clutter. Experimental results show that the proposed method works well in estimating the wind velocity, rainfall amount, and turbulence from the weather echo even when the spectrum of the weather echo is overlapped with that of the ground clutter in a lower frequency band.

One of the difficult issues that need to be addressed is partial volume effect. The purpose of this study was to minimize the partial volume effect while preserving the optimal tradeoff between noise and bias, and maintaining spatial resolution in the reconstructed images acquired in FBC geometry. We modified conventional isotropic TV (L1) norm, which has only one hyperparameter, and replaced it with two independent TV (L1u) norms (TVxy and TVz) along two orthogonal basis vectors (XY, Z) in 3D reconstruction space. We investigated if the anisotropic norm with two hyperparameters (beta xy and beta z, where z is parallel to the axis-of-rotation) performed better in FBC-SPECT reconstruction, as compared to the conventional isotropic norm with one hyperparameter (beta) only. We found that MAP-OSEM reconstruction with modified TV norm produced images with smaller partial volume effect, as compared to the conventional TV norm at a cost of slight increase in the bias and noise.

One important step during this process is the identification of resonances in the data. However, due to noise, overlapping effects and artifacts occuring during the measurements, many algorithms fail to identify resonances correctly. In this paper, we present a novel interpretation of the data as a sample drawn from a mixture of bi-variate Gaussian distributions. Therefore, the identification of resonances can be reduced to a Gaussian mixture decomposition problem which is solved with the help of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. A program in the Java programming language that exploits an implementation of this algorithm is described and tested on experimental data. Our results indicate that this approach offers valuable information such as an objective measure on the likelihood of the identified resonances.

High contrast laminography using iterative algorithms	JOURNAL OF INSTRUMENTATION			English	Article						Data processing methods; Computerized Tomography (CT) and Computed Radiography; (CR); Inspection with x-rays; X-ray radiography and digital radiography (DR)		3D X-ray imaging of internal structure of large flat objects is often complicated by limited access to all viewing angles or extremely high absorption in certain directions, therefore the standard method of computed tomography (CT) fails. This problem can be solved by the method of laminography. During a laminographic measurement the imaging detector is placed close to the sample while the X-ray source irradiates both sample and detector at different angles. The application of the state-of-the-art pixel detector Medipix in laminography together with adapted tomographic iterative alghorithms for 3D reconstruction of sample structure has been investigated. Iterative algorithms such as EM (Expectation Maximization) and OSEM (Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization) improve the quality of the reconstruction and allow including more complex physical models. In this contribution results and proposed future approaches which could be used for resolution enhancement are presented.

In a realistic environment, however, a pirated copy will be distorted by an additional attack. Under the assumption that the distortion is modeled as AWGN, a soft decision method for a tracing algorithm has been proposed and the traceability has been experimentally evaluated. However, the previous soft decision method works directly with a received signal without considering the communication theory. In this study, we calculate the likelihood of received signal considering a posterior probability, and propose a soft decision tracing algorithm considering the characteristic of Gaussian channel. For the estimation of channel, we employ the expectation-maximization algorithm by giving constraints under the possible collusion strategies. We also propose an equalizer to give a proper weighting parameter for calculating a correlation score.

Presented algorithms differ from existing algorithms in consideration of the presence of human translator which usage we are trying to minimize. We treat human translator as an oracle who knows exact alignments and the goal of the system is to optimize (minimize) the use of this oracle. The effectiveness of the oracle is measured by the speed at which he can create "perfectly" aligned bilingual corpus. By "Perfectly" aligned corpus we mean zero entropy corpus because oracle can make alignments without any probabilistic interpretation, i.e., with 100% confidence. Sentence level alignments and word-to-word alignments, although treated separately in this paper, are integrated in a single framework. For sentence level alignments we provide a dynamic programming algorithm which achieves low precision and recall error rate. For word-to-word level alignments Expectation Maximization algorithm that integrates linguistic dictionaries is suggested as the main tool for the oracle to build "perfectly" aligned bilingual corpus. We show empirically that suggested pre-aligned corpus requires little interaction from the oracle and that creation of perfectly aligned corpus can be achieved almost with the speed of human reading. Presented algorithms are language independent but in this paper we verify them with English Lithuanian language pair on two types of text: law documents and fiction literature.

ONLINE EXPECTATION MAXIMIZATION ALGORITHM TO SOLVE THE SLAM PROBLEM	2011 IEEE STATISTICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING WORKSHOP (SSP)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Statistical Signal Processing Workshop (SSP)	JUN 28-30, 2011	Nice, FRANCE	IEEE		SLAM; Sequential Monte Carlo methods; additive functionals; Expectation Maximization		In this paper, a new algorithm - namely the onlineEM-SLAM - is proposed to solve the simultaneous localization and mapping problem (SLAM). The mapping problem is seen as an instance of inference in latent models, and the localization part is dealt with a particle approximation method. This new technique relies on an online version of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm: the algorithm includes a stochastic approximation version of the E-step to incorporate the information brought by the newly available observation. By linearizing the observation model, the stochastic approximation part is reduced to the computation of the expectation of additive functionals of the robot pose. Therefore, each iteration of the onlineEM-SLAM both provides a particle approximation of the distribution of the pose, and a point estimate of the map. This online variant of EM does not require the whole data set to be available at each iteration. The performance of this algorithm is illustrated through simulations using sampled observations and experimental data.

J	Lederman, D				Lederman, Dror			An endotracheal intubation confirmation system based on carina image detection: a proof of concept	MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING			English	Article						Airway management; Endotracheal intubation confirmation; Esophageal intubation detection; Greedy-GMM; One-lung intubation; Unsupervised clustering	MEDICAL-SERVICES SYSTEM; 2000 INCIDENT REPORTS; ENDOBRONCHIAL INTUBATION; ESOPHAGEAL INTUBATION; TUBE POSITION; EM ALGORITHM; COMPLICATIONS; MISPLACEMENT; CAPNOGRAPHY; PARAMEDICS	In this paper, a novel system for automatic confirmation of endotracheal intubation is proposed. The system comprises a miniature CMOS sensor and electric wires attached to a rigid stylet. Video signals are continuously acquired and processed by the algorithm implemented on a PC/DSP. The system is based on detection of the carina image as an anatomical landmark of correct tube positioning and it thus utilizes direct visual cues. Detection of the carina is performed based on unsupervised clustering, using a greedy-Gaussian mixture framework. The performance of the proposed system was initially evaluated using a mannequin model. A scientific prototype was assembled and used to perform repeated intubations on the model and collect a database of video signals which were processed off-line. The videos were categoried by a medical professional into carina, upper-trachea, and esophagus. An accuracy of 100% was achieved in discriminating between the carina and other anatomical structures including esophagus and upper-trachea. As an additional validation, the system was tested using a dataset of 231 video images recorded from five human subjects during intubation. The system correctly classified 120 out of 125 non-carina images (i.e. a sensitivity of 96.0%), and 100 out of 106 carina images (i.e. a specificity 94.3%). Using a 10th-order median filter, applied on the frame-based classification results, a 100% accuracy rate was obtained.

In eigenvoice the rank of variability space is bounded by the number of training speakers, so a variant of the probabilistic PCA approach is introduced for estimating the parameters. But this constraint doesn't exist in i-vector model. because the number of utterances is much bigger than the rank of total variability space. We adopt the EM algorithm for PCA. with the statistics to train the total variability space, and the maximum likelihood criterion is used. After WCCN, the cosine similarity scoring is used for decision. These two total variability spaces will be fused at feature-level and score-level. The experiments have been run on the NIST SRE 2008 data, and the results show that the performances in two total variability spaces are comparable. The performance can be improved obviously after feature fusion and score fusion.

However usually there is a huge amount of unlabeled data that are helpful for the increasing of its accuracy. Hence we use the EM algorithm in Semi-supervised learning as a reference, and proposed a Semi-Supervised Classifier system (SUCS) based on Bayes inference. The experiments we did using the UCI dataset showed that SUCS performed a much better accuracy than UCS by use of only a small number of labeled data and a large number of unlabeled data.

Firstly source images are decomposed by Contourlet transform, low frequency and high frequency subband coefficients are obtained; secondly, the high frequency subband coefficients are modeled using hidden markov tree and the model is trained using Expectation-Maximization(EM) algorithm to get the posterior probability of the coefficients; Thirdly, using the posterior probability to guide the fusion rules' design of high frequency subband coefficients in order to preserve the salient features of original images well and obtain good noise suppression; Finally, the fusion coefficients are inversed to get the final fusion result. SAR and Panchromatic images were taken to fuse, and the results were evaluated by Difference Coefficient, Correlation Coefficient and Signal-Noise Ration. The experimental result shows that the proposed algorithm is better than traditional fusion algorithms based on Contourlet and wavelet-domain hidden markov tree model.

We matched the stars in tow continuous images to get their speed at first and found moving target pairs through speed in both images, a kalman filter whose equation was updated by the centroid was adopted to track the target. The star's area was used to judge occlusion, a two Gaussian mixture model was build using the pixels' gray value of fusing region and we used the predicted value which the kalman filter given to detect the target. The model's parameters were estimated using the expectation-maximization method and applied to separate the target and the star as well as computing the precise centroid. Extensive experiments on real images sequences show that the proposed approach could effectively meet the requirements of the real-time detection with a low false alarm rate and a high detection probability, simulation results show that it can also create a accuracy centroid when occlusion happens.

However, the traditional PLSA method considers each image (document) independently, which would often be conflict with the real occasion. In this paper, we presents an improved PLSA model, named Correlated Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (C-PLSA). Different from PLSA, the topics of the given image are modeled by the images that are related to it. In our method, each image is represented by bag-of-visual-words. With this representation, we calculate the cosine similarity between each pair of images to capture their correlations. Then we use our C-PLSA model to generate K latent topics and Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is utilized for parameter estimation. Based on the latent topics, image clustering is carried out according to the estimated conditional probabilities. Extensive experiments are conducted on the publicly available database. The comparison results show that our approach is superior to the traditional PLSA for image clustering.

EM-PCA model can extract key independent factors among those complicated issues related to the selection of electric vehicles while AHP model tells us the selection of power source in a certain region. The results show that optimal selection of power sources differ from regions. For example, North America should put forward the priority to renewable energy as the selection of power source while Middle East should use petroleum.

In such scheme, generative models are used to derive feature maps for outputting a set of fixed length features that are used by discriminative models to perform classification. In this paper, we present a method, called posterior divergence, to derive feature maps from the log likelihood function implied in the incremental expectation-maximization algorithm. These feature maps evaluate a sample in three complementary measures: (1) how much the sample affects the model; (2) how well the sample fits the model; (3) how uncertain the fit is. We prove that the linear classification error rate using the outputs of the derived feature maps is at least as low as that of plug-in estimation. We present efficient algorithms for computing these feature maps for semi-supervised learning and supervised learning. We evaluate the proposed method on three typical applications, i.e. scene recognition, face and non-face classification and protein sequence analysis, and demonstrate improvements over related methods.

An Expectation Maximization Based Method for Subcellular Particle Tracking Using Multi-angle TIRF Microscopy	MEDICAL IMAGE COMPUTING AND COMPUTER-ASSISTED INTERVENTION, MICCAI 2011, PT I	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	14th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2011)	SEP 18-22, 2011	Toronto, CANADA					Multi-angle total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (MA-TIRFM) is a new generation of TIRF microscopy to study cellular processes near dorsal cell membrane in 4 dimensions (3D+t). To perform quantitative analysis using MA-TIRFM, it is necessary to track subcellular particles in these processes. In this paper, we propose a method based on a MAP framework for automatic particle tracking and apply it to track clathrin coated pits (CCPs). The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is employed to solve the MAP problem. To provide the initial estimations for the EM algorithm, we develop a forward filter based on the most probable trajectory (MPT) filter. Multiple linear models are used to model particle dynamics. For CCP tracking, we use two linear models to describe constrained Brownian motion and fluorophore variation according to CCP properties. The tracking method is evaluated on synthetic data and results show that it has high accuracy. The result on real data confirmed by human expert cell biologists is also presented.

The main ideas are: (1) utilizing both the speech and filler models of the recognizer to feedback confidence measures (CMs) that indicate the degree of separation between filtered speech and interference noises, and (2) automatically optimizing the parameters of the microphone array with an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm based on the proposed MCM criterion. Experimental results on a Mandarin voice command task show that the proposed approach significantly improves the final speech recognition rates. Moreover the observed performance degradation is usually graceful under low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and close interference noises conditions.

In this paper, we modeled the set of azimuth angles by a mixture of Gaussian densities, and divided narrowband emitter identification into two different stages. In the first stage, a competitive stop expectation-maximization (CSEM) algorithm was developed, which was based on Shapiro-Wilk test and minimum description length variant (MDL2) criterion. The CSEM only employed the estimated azimuth angles at all the signal-occupied frequency bins as feature parameters, while the frequency information implied in each cluster was not exploited sufficiently. So based on the implied frequency information, a postprocessing algorithm was introduced in the second stage. The experimental results show that the CSEM algorithm is more robust, and it has an increased capability to find the underlying model while maintaining a low execution time. By adopting CSEM and postprocessing algorithm in narrowband emitter identification, we are able to identify narrowband emitters with high correctness.

Spatial coherence within the network clusters is modeled using a hidden Markov random field prior. The normalized time-series data, which lie on a high-dimensional sphere, are modeled with a mixture of von Mises-Fisher distributions. To estimate the parameters of this model, we maximize the posterior using a Monte Carlo expectation maximization (MCEM) algorithm in which the intractable expectation over all possible labelings is approximated using Monte Carlo integration. We show that MCEM solutions on synthetic data are superior to those computed using a mode approximation of the expectation step. Finally, we demonstrate on real fMRI data that our method is able to identify visual, motor, salience, and default mode networks with considerable consistency between subjects.

For classification purpose, we propose a discriminative model selection method to optimize the orders of all classes. Based on the GMMs initialized in some way, the orders of all classes are adjusted heuristically to improve the cross-validated classification accuracy. The model orders selected in this discriminative way are expected to give higher generalized accuracy than classwise model selection. Our experimental results on some UCI datasets demonstrate the superior classification performance of the proposed method.

We propose three methods for generating probabilistic atlases: 1) the atlases are constructed in a template space using dense non-rigid transformations and transformed to the space of unseen data, 2) as the method 1 but atlas selection is performed in addition, and 3) the atlases are constructed directly in the space of the unseen data. The methods were evaluated in the segmentation of the hippocampus in 340 images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiaitve (ADNI). Dice overlaps (similarity index, SI) were 0.84, 0.85 and 0.87 with reference segmentations and the correlation coefficients for the volumes were 0.84, 0.92 and 0.96 for the three methods tested. Our results show clearly the importance of probabilistic atlases in segmentation.

This co-association matrix counts the co-occurrences (in the same cluster) of pairs of objects, thus avoiding the cluster correspondence problem faced by many other clustering combination approaches. Starting from the observation that co-occurrences are a special type of dyads, we propose to model co-association using a generative aspect model for dyadic data. Under the proposed model, the extraction of a consensus clustering corresponds to solving a maximum likelihood estimation problem, which we address using the expectation-maximization algorithm. We refer to the resulting method as probabilistic ensemble clustering algorithm (PEnCA). Moreover, the fact that the problem is placed in a probabilistic framework allows using model selection criteria to automatically choose the number of clusters. To compare our method with other combination techniques (also based on probabilistic modeling of the clustering ensemble problem), we performed experiments with synthetic and real benchmark data-sets, showing that the proposed approach leads to competitive results.

In this paper, we would like to tackle the source localization problem based on the realistic assumption where the sources are corrupted by spatially-non-white noise. We explore the respective limitations of our recently proposed algorithm, namely EM source localization algorithm, and design a new direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation based (DEB) source localization algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed DEB algorithm significantly outperforms the previous EM method.

While there are many good tracking systems, there are fewer methods that can identify the tracked players. Player identification is challenging in such videos due to blurry facial features (due to fast camera motion and low-resolution) and rarely visible jersey numbers (which, when visible, are deformed due to player movements). We introduce a new system consisting of three components: a robust tracking system, a robust person identification system, and a conditional random field (CRF) model that can perform joint probabilistic inference about the player identities. The resulting system is able to achieve a player recognition accuracy up to 85% on unlabeled NBA basketball clips.

Segmentation can been automatically done without initializing segmentation class numbers. The MDP model segmentation algorithm is used to segment natural images and MR (Magnetic Resonance) images in the paper. To demonstrate the accuracy of the MDP model segmentation algorithm, many compared experiments, such as EM (Expectation Maximization) image segmentation algorithm, K-means image segmentation algorithm and MRF (Markov Field) image segmentation algorithm, have been done to segment medical MR images. All the methods are also analyzed quantitatively by using DSC (Dice Similarity Coefficients).

The methodology is based on Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS) and the technique used for adjusting of the model parameters is an offline version of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. In order to automate the application of the methodology and facilitate the analysis of the results, a tool that allows managing streamflow forecasting studies and visualizing their information in graphical form was developed. A case study was applied to the data from three Brazilian hydroelectric plants whose operation is under the coordination of the Electric System National Operator. They are located in the Grande basin, a part of the Parana basin with two main rivers: the Grande and the Pardo. The benefits of the model are analyzed using statistics calculations, such as: root mean square error, mean absolute percentage error, mean absolute error and mass curve coefficient. Besides that, graphics that compare the registered and predicted streamflow are presented. The results show an adequate performance of the model, leading to a promising alternative for daily streamflow forecasting.

We assume that the volatilities of the assets are driven by a common state of economy, which is unobservable and represented by a hidden Markov chain. Under this hidden Markov model (HMM), we develop recursively computable filtering equations for certain functionals of the chain. Expectation maximization (EM) parameter estimation is then used.

The dynamics of the fading channels are captured using a mean-reverting linear stochastic differential equation driven by a Brownian motion. Recursive estimation and identification algorithms solely from received signal strength data are developed. These algorithms are based on combining the particle filter (PF) with the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that estimate and identify the power path-loss of the channel and its parameters, respectively. Numerical results are provided to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed algorithms.

A new method for 3D localization using a hybrid array in shallow ocean with non-Gaussian noise	2011 IEEE - OCEANS SPAIN	OCEANS-IEEE		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE OCEANS Conference	JUN 06-09, 2011	Santander, SPAIN	IEEE			BEARING ESTIMATION; WAVE-GUIDE; PERFORMANCE	In this paper, a new method is presented for three dimensional (3D) localization of narrow band acoustic sources in shallow ocean with non-Gaussian noise. The noise is modeled as a Gaussian mixture with a small number of components. The new algorithm consists of an initialization step to obtain rough estimates of the unknown parameters followed by an update step in which the initial estimates are updated sequentially using a novel approach based on the space alternating generalized expectation maximization (SAGE) algorithm. A hybrid array composed of one horizontal subarray and one vertical subarray is used. The vertical subarray data is used for range-depth estimation. The horizontal subarray data and the range-depth estimates are used for bearing estimation. The proposed method is computationally simpler than existing methods because it replaces the conventional 3D search by a 2D search and a small number of 1D searches. Simulation results are presented to show that the root-mean-square (RMS) errors of estimates obtained by the new method are significantly lower than the RMS errors of MUSIC estimator. The RMS errors of the proposed method are also compared with the CRB.	[Madadi, Z.; Premkumar, A.

A sample model is estimated from the data measured in a horizontal two-dimensional area above main battery in a hybrid vehicle. For the probability distribution model of the ensemble data of different transmitter antenna directions and all target frequencies, the mixture weights and the parameters for each component distribution are estimated using expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The result model showed good fitting to the measured data in probability density function plot and quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot. Based on the ensemble data distribution model, the probability distribution models for individual conditions of frequencies and antenna-directions are also estimated applying linear transformation. Results are tested using Q-Q plot, which shows good fitting with slight overestimation in very high-value region. Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) goodness of fit test at the 1% significance level also accepts this method for all the data measured above 600MHz.

These distributions are typically heavy tailed and positively skewed. In the text a net annual incomes per capita of the Czech households in 2004 and 2008 are analysed. The finite mixtures of lognormal distributions are fitted into data from the survey Results of the Living Conditions Survey (a national module of the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC)) that has been held by the Czech Statistical Office since 2005. Firstly, the components with known group membership are formed according to the education of a head of a household (factor with 5 levels) and number of children (2 levels factor children yes/no and more detailed 5 levels factor) in the household. Secondly, data are divided into groups with unknown group membership in order to obtain the best possible fit. In this case 1 to 5 components in the mixture are used. All models fitted into data are compared with the use of Akaike criterion.

Equivalent methods in murine models of obesity are still lacking. Current small animal micro-CT involves long-term X-ray exposure precluding longitudinal studies. We have overcome this limitation by using a human medical CT which allows very fast 3D imaging (2 sec) and minimal radiation exposure. This work presents novel methods fitted to in vivo investigations of mice model of obesity, allowing (i) automated detection of adipose tissue in abdominal regions of interest, (ii) quantification of visceral and subcutaneous fat. For each mouse, 1000 slices (100 mu m thickness, 160 mu m resolution) were acquired in 2 sec using a Toshiba medical CT (135 kV, 400mAs). A Gaussian mixture model of the Hounsfield curve of 2D slices was computed with the Expectation Maximization algorithm. Identification of each Gaussian part allowed the automatic classification of adipose tissue voxels. The abdominal region of interest (umbilical) was automatically detected as the slice showing the highest ratio of the Gaussian proportion between adipose and lean tissues. Segmentation of visceral and subcutaneous fat compartments was achieved with 2D 1/2 level set methods.

Based on this analysis, the image reconstruction scheme able to maximize the goodness of fit of the thresholding algorithm has been selected. A phantom study employing spherical targets was designed to determine slice-specific threshold (TS) levels which produce accurate cross-sectional areas. A wide range of TB ratio was investigated. Multiple regression methods were used to fit the data and to construct algorithms depending both on target cross-sectional area and TB ratio, using various reconstruction schemes employing a wide range of iteration number and amount of postfiltering Gaussian smoothing. Analysis of covariance was used to test the influence of iteration number and smoothing on threshold determination. The degree of convergence of ordered-subset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithms does not influence TS determination. Among these approaches, the OSEM at two iterations and eight subsets with a 6-8 mm post-reconstruction Gaussian three-dimensional filter provided the best fit with a coefficient of determination R(2) = 0.90 for cross-sectional areas <= 133 mm(2) and R(2) = 0.95 for cross-sectional areas > 133 mm(2). The amount of post-reconstruction smoothing has been directly incorporated in the adaptive thresholding algorithms. The feasibility of the method was tested in two patients with lymph node FDG accumulation and in five patients using the bladder to mimic an anatomical structure of large size and uniform uptake, with satisfactory results. Slice-specific adaptive thresholding algorithms look promising as a reproducible method for delineating PET target volumes with good accuracy.

Such novel algorithms inherit speedup properties of the alpha-EM algorithm. Since the alpha-EM algorithm includes the traditional log-EM algorithm as its special case, the alpha-HMM also includes the traditional log-HMM as its special case. This generalization appears as the utilization of the past information which is the main device of the speedup. Since the memorization of the past information requires only little increase of computational load and memory, the iteration speedup directly appears as that of CPU time. Experimental results are given.

These algorithms start from the alpha-EM algorithm which includes the traditional log-EM as its proper subset. Since existing or traditional HMMs are the outcome of the log-EM, it had been expected that the alpha-HMM would exist. In this paper, it is shown that this foresight is true by using methods of the iteration index shift and likelihood ratio expansion. In each iteration, new update equations utilize one-step past terms which are computed and stored during the previous maximization step. Therefore, iteration speedup directly appears as that of CPU time. Since the new method is theoretically based on the alpha-EM, all of its properties are inherited. There are eight types of alpha-HMMs derived. They are discrete, continuous, semi-continuous and discrete-continuous alpha-HMMs, and both for single and multiple sequences. Using the properties of the alpha-EM algorithm, the speedup property is theoretically analyzed. Experimental results including real world data are given.

Such activity recognition utilises sensor ID, task order and time of activation to learn about patient behavior, detect anomalies and provide prompts or other interventions. In this paper we use the sensor activation times to calculate durations and then investigate several model-based clustering approaches with a view to discretising the duration data and using such data to improve activity prediction. We explore several popular approaches to characterising such duration data, namely Coxian phase type distributions and Gaussian mixture distributions. We then show how we can utilise the learned clustering components for discretisation. Finally we use simulated data, based on a real smart kitchen deployment, to compare these approaches and evaluate the discretisation results with regard to activity prediction.

The promoter sequences are extracted from NCBI database and converted to motif (TFBS) sequences by using 'TF SEARCH' tool. A probabilistic model is developed for each motif sequence of the pathways considered and a database is created. Given query motif sequence is compared with all the sequences in the database and classified based on the log probability score obtained.

Single-and multi-hypothesis Kalman filter trackers are used to process contact measurements from the field, using parameters calculated from an initial analysis of the data. Track management is implemented using an m-out-of-n criterion and then a sequential probability ratio test (SPRT). Gaussian mixtures are used to accommodate the transformation of measurement errors from sensor coordinates into tracker coordinates. Results are presented for each tracker configuration.

Vector of predictors (v) over right arrow are extracted from time and non-linear dynamics domains and a Gaussian Mixture Model-based bayesian classifier, with probability density estimated by the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, is applied in order to detect shocks with "Success" according to the probability P((v) over right arrow /Success). A cross-validation analysis is performed independently on 136 first shocks (Group1) and 382 second and later shocks (Group2). At 5 s post-shock, an Organized Rhythm (OR) is considered as "Success" and Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) is defined as "No success". A decrease in performance of discrimination of OR versus VF between Group1 and Group2 is observed with an Area Under the ROC Curve of 0.82 and 0.65, respectively. This corroborates the current hypothesis that within-patient correlation affects defibrillation outcome prediction accuracy.

The effect of count statistics on the convergence value in OSEM reconstruction in PET and TOF PET	2011 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM AND MEDICAL IMAGING CONFERENCE (NSS/MIC)	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium/Medical Imaging Conference (NSS/MIC)/18th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X-Ray and Gamma-Ray Detectors	OCT 23-29, 2011	Valencia, SPAIN	IEEE, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Nucl & Plasma Sci Soc (IEEE NPSS)			TIME-OF-FLIGHT; PERFORMANCE; SCANNER; IMPACT	Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization (OSEM) has been introduced to greatly reduce reconstruction time compared to Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM) in Positron Emission Tomography (PET). In case of noise-free data, OSEM converges to a MLEM image, but in presence of noise this might not be true, and also OSEM might not converge at all but cycle between similar but distinct images. Assessing what are the limits of the OSEM in terms of reliable contrast recovery is particularly interesting in situation of very short acquisitions and very sparse data. In this work, we study the convergence value of the contrast recovery as a function of the count statistics (and therefore the noise level) in the PET data, using a NEMA image quality phantom. A comparison between Time-of-Flight (TOF) and non-TOF implementations is performed. The scope of the work is to assess how the count statistics affects the convergence value and the convergence rate for OSEM reconstruction, and then to compare the corresponding convergence rates in conventional PET and in TOF PET reconstructions, by analyzing both experimental and simulated data.

The proposed method is based on a hybrid technique that consists of Markov Chain Mont Carlo (MCMC), deterministic annealing expectation maximization (DAEM) algorithm to evaluate the effect of uncertainties of input variables on the output ones and in the nonlinear load flow. MCMC is useful for generating the samples from an arbitrary probabilistic distribution function (PDF) to reflect the non-Gaussian PDF and the nonlinear correlation. DAEM evaluates the maximum likelihood estimate of the non-Gaussian PDF. The proposed method is successfully applied to a sample system.

In this case standard reconstruction methods deliver only unsatisfactory and noisy results. We incorporate a priori information directly in the reconstruction process via nonlinear variational methods. A promising approach was the so-called EMTV algorithm, where the negative log-likelihood functional, which is minimized in the expectation maximization (ML-EM) algorithm, was modified by adding a total variation (TV) term. To improve the results and to overcome the issue of the loss of contrast we extend the algorithm by an inverse scale space method using Bregman distances, to which we refer as BREGMAN EMTV algorithm. The methods are tested on short time (S and 30 seconds) FDG measurements of the thorax. We can show that the EMTV approach can effectively reduce the noise, but still introduces an oversmoothing, which is eliminated by the BREGMAN EMTV method, obtaining a reconstruction of comparable quality to the corresponding long time (20 and 7 minutes) scan. This correction for the loss of contrast is necessary to obtain quantitative PET images.

Spatial unit convergence, called areal interpolation, is often applied to address this problem. Of the many proposed areal interpolation methods, few consider spatial autocorrelation, which is the general property of spatial data. In this paper, by employing a spatial process model, a new areal interpolation method that considers spatial autocorrelation is presented. First, we briefly survey previous areal interpolation techniques and demonstrate that the stochastic method is superior to the deterministic method in archiving accurate interpolations. Next, after a discussion on the spatial process model, a new areal interpolation method is suggested. In this method, both spatial autocorrelation and the volume preserving property, a property that should be considered in areal interpolation, are considered using a combination of a linear regression based areal interpolation method, and the spatial process model. Finally, a case study on the areal interpolation of a population is provided to demonstrate that the suggested method succeeds in improving the predictive accuracy. This case study indicates that the consideration of spatial autocorrelation is important for accurate areal interpolation. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

One way to obtain LAI value is by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) biophysical products (LAI MODIS). The LAI MODIS has been used to improve the physiological principles predicting growth (3-PG) model within a Bayesian Network (BN) set-up. The MODIS time series, however, contains gaps caused by persistent clouds, cloud contamination, and other retrieval problems. We therefore formulated the EM-algorithm to estimate the missing MODIS LAI values. The EM-algorithm is applied to three different cases: successive and not successive two winter seasons, and not successive missing MODIS LAI during the time study of 26 successive months at which the performance of the BN is assessed. Results show that the MODIS LAI is estimated such that the maximum value of the mean absolute error between the original MODIS LAI and the estimated MODIS LAI by EM-algorithm is 0.16. This is a low value, and shows the success of our approach. Moreover, the BN output improves when the EM-algorithm is carried out to estimate the inconsecutive missing MODIS LAI such that the root mean square error reduces from 1.57 to 1.49. We conclude that the EM-algorithm within a BN can handle the missing MODIS LAI values and that it improves estimation of the LAI. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A key step in ChIP-Seq data analysis is to map short reads from high-throughput sequencing to a reference genome and identify peak regions enriched with short reads. Although several methods have been proposed for ChIP-Seq analysis, most existing methods only consider reads that can be uniquely placed in the reference genome, and therefore have low power for detecting peaks located within repeat sequences. Here we introduce a probabilistic approach for ChIP-Seq data analysis which utilizes all reads, providing a truly genome-wide view of binding patterns. Reads are modeled using a mixture model corresponding to K enriched regions and a null genomic background. We use maximum likelihood to estimate the locations of the enriched regions, and implement an expectation-maximization (E-M) algorithm, called AREM (aligning reads by expectation maximization), to update the alignment probabilities of each read to different genomic locations. We apply the algorithm to identify genome-wide binding events of two proteins: Rad21, a component of cohesin and a key factor involved in chromatid cohesion, and Srebp-1, a transcription factor important for lipid/cholesterol homeostasis. Using AREM, we were able to identify 19,935 Rad21 peaks and 1,748 Srebp-1 peaks in the mouse genome with high confidence, including 1,517 (7.6%) Rad21 peaks and 227 (13%) Srebp-1 peaks that were missed using only uniquely mapped reads.

Probabilistic mixture model has been a well known approach to cluster analysis. However, as they rely on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), the algorithms are often very sensitive to noise and outliers. In this work, we implement a variant of the classical mixture model-based clustering (M2C) following a proposed general framework for handling outliers. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is incorporated into the framework to produce a novel algorithm called GA-based Partial M2C (GA-PM2C). Analytical and experimental studies show that GA-PM2C can overcome the negative impact of outliers in data clustering, hence provides highly accurate and reliable clustering results. It also exhibits excellent consistency in performance and low sensitivity to initializations.

In this paper we present a novel expectation-maximization algorithm, called DOE-EM, for inference of gene-specific expression levels from DOE tags. Unlike previous methods, our algorithm takes into account alternative splicing isoforms and tags that map at multiple locations in the genome, and corrects for incomplete digestion and sequencing errors. The open source Java/Scala implementation of the DOE-EM algorithm is freely available at http://dna.engr.uconn.edu/software/DGE-EM/. Experimental results on real DOE data generated from reference RNA samples show that our algorithm outperforms commonly used estimation methods based on unique tag counting. Furthermore, the accuracy of DOE-EM estimates is comparable to that obtained by state-of-the-art estimation algorithms from RNA-Seq data for the same samples. Results of a comprehensive simulation study assessing the effect of various experimental parameters suggest that further improvements in estimation accuracy could be achieved by optimizing DGE protocol parameters such as the anchoring enzymes and digestion time.

The MAP is defined as a point process whose inter-arrival time follows a phase-type distribution incorporating the correlation between successive two arrivals. This paper presents MAP representation of Markov-type SRMs, called MAP-based SRMs. This framework enables us to use generalized formulas for several reliability measures such as the expected number of failures and the software reliability which can be applied to all the Markov-type SRMs. In addition, we discuss the parameter estimation for the MAP-based SRMs from grouped failure data and find maximum likelihood estimates of all the Markov-type SRMs. The resulting MAP-based SRM is a novel approach to unifying the model-based software reliability evaluation using failure data.

In particular, we consider the parameter estimation algorithm for the SRGM with normal distribution. The developed algorithm is based on an EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm and is quite simple for implementation as software application.

The critical issue in robot audition is real-time processing and robustness against noisy environments with high flexibility to support various kinds of robots and hardware configurations. This paper presents two important aspects of robot audition; Missing-Feature-Theory (MET) approach and active audition. HARK open-source robot audition incorporates MFT approach to recognize speech signals that are localized and separated from a mixture of sound captured by 8-channel microphone array. HARK is ported to four robots, Honda ASIMO, SIG2, Robovie-R2 and HRP-2, with different microphone configurations and recognizes three simultaneous utterances with 1.9 sec latency. In binaural hearing, the most famous problem is a front-back confusion of sound sources. Active binaural robot audition implemented on SIG2 disambiguates the problem well by rotating its head with pitting. This active audition improves the localization for the periphery.

In this context, a well known problem is that all except a few diffusion processes lack closed-form expressions of the transition densities. Thus, in order to estimate efficiently the EM intermediate quantity we construct, using novel techniques for unbiased estimation of diffusion transition densities, a random weight fixed-lag auxiliary particle smoother, which avoids the well known problem of particle trajectory degeneracy in the smoothing mode. The estimator is justified theoretically and demonstrated on a simulated example.

This paper investigates three methods for estimating a conversational-side-specific projection or affine transform to compensate for session and channel effects. In the first, we estimate the projection based on an estimate of the within-class covariance matrix using a conversational-side-specific subset of the development data. In the second, we use a discriminative objective function to estimate the projection parameters. We present an iterative algorithm similar to the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the projection parameters which maximize this objective function. An affine transform of the observation vectors of each conversational side is estimated using maximum likelihood estimation in the third method. The maximum likelihood objective function is estimated on a selected subset of the development data. We present several experiments that show how these three techniques perform compared to our baseline system on the interview tasks of the NIST 2008 and the NIST 2010 speaker recognition evaluations. The best method of these techniques gives a performance improvement of up to 20% relative compared to the baseline system.

The model provides an accurate estimation of the probability distribution of coincidence events defined by pairs of scintillating crystals. This distribution is parameterized with 2D elliptical Gaussian functions defined in planes perpendicular to the main axis of the tube of response (TOR). The parameters of these Gaussian functions have been obtained by fitting Monte Carlo simulations that include positron range, acolinearity of gamma rays, as well as detector attenuation and scatter effects. The proposed model has been applied efficiently to list-mode reconstruction algorithms. Evaluation with Monte Carlo simulations over a rotating high resolution PET scanner indicates that this model allows to obtain better recovery to noise ratio in OSEM (ordered-subsets, expectation-maximization) reconstruction, if compared to list-mode reconstruction with symmetric circular Gaussian TOR model, and histogram-based OSEM with precalculated system matrix using Monte Carlo simulated models and symmetries.

The MEET R package includes five motif searching algorithms: MEME/MAST(Multiple Expectation-Maximization for Motif Elicitation), Q-residuals, MDscan (Motif Discovery scan), ITEME (Information Theory Elements for Motif Estimation) and MATCH. In addition MEET allows the user to work with different alignment algorithms: MUSCLE (Multiple Sequence Comparison by Log-Expectation), ClustalW and MEME. The package can work in two modes, training and detection. The training mode allows the user to choose the best parameters of a detector. Once the parameters are chosen, the detection mode allows to analyze a genome looking for binding sites. Both modes can combine the different alignment and detection methods, offering multiple possibilities. Combining the alignments and the detection algorithms makes possible the comparison between detection models at the same level, without having to care about the differences produced during the alignment process.

Given that the multi-state travel time reliability model provides significantly better fits when compared to using a single-mode density function, it is possible to quantify the incident impacts more accurately. In order to obtain travel times, the study simulates weekday traffic on a section of I-66 over 17 days, once with incidents and once without them, using the INTEGRATION microscopic traffic simulation software. The simulated travel time data sets are then used to fit a three-state travel time reliability model (three normal distributions) to calibrate the parameters of the density function using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The study demonstrates that incidents do not introduce an additional component distribution when congestion has already onset; instead they increase the mean travel time and variability in travel times for the congested conditions. For instance, the 90th percentile travel time of the second component distribution increases by up to 93 percent. Additionally, the study addresses technical issues related to the calibration and interpretation of the model from a practical standpoint.

For the feasibility of our ultra-high resolution SPECT system with CdTe, we compared the quality of the reconstructed image of our SPECT system to that of a conventional small animal SPECT system with NaI(Tl) detector. The pixel size of CdTe detector was 0.35 mm x 0.35 mm which was available for a real detector (PID350, AJAT, Finland). The detector size was 44.8 x 44.8 mm with 128 x 128 pixels and the thickness of this detector was 1 mm. The intrinsic resolution of CdTe detector and that of NaI(Tl) detector were 0.35 mm and 2.3 mm, respectively. The height parallel hole collimator made of lead was 25 mm and that of a septum was 0.2 mm. The shape of that parallel hole collimator and its radius were hexagonal and 0.5 mm, respectively. A SPECT liver scan was simulated for both SPECT with CdTe and conventional SPECT system using voxelized MOBY phantom. All SPECT images were obtained using 120 projection views acquired from 0 degrees to 360 degrees with a 3 degrees. Slices were reconstructed using an Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization (OS-EM) and 5 iterations with 4 subsets. We compared the quality of images for two systems in terms of spatial resolution (FWHM), sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise (CNR). Our simulation results indicated that the reconstructed SPECT images obtained with CdTe detector showed higher resolution compared to those with the conventional scintillation detector. These results demonstrated that the SPECT imaging based on pixelated CdTe detector can improve the performance of SPECT system for small animal imaging.

The effects of shielding around the source on neutron energy spectra	RADIATION EFFECTS AND DEFECTS IN SOLIDS			English	Article						shielded neutron source; unfolding procedure; pulse height distribution; neutron energy distribution; maximum-likelihood method; Monte Carlo method	PULSE-HEIGHT DISTRIBUTIONS; MONTE-CARLO	The knowledge of neutron energy spectra contributes to unambiguous identification of neutron sources in the fields of nuclear safeguards and nuclear non-proliferation. Since a real scenario situation includes the presence of shielding around the source, we have investigated the influence of the potential shielding surrounding the source on the shape of energy spectra for a few neutron sources. We have applied the maximum-likelihood, expectation-maximisation (MLEM) method with one-step-late (OSL) algorithm for neutron spectra unfolding. The pulse height distributions used in the unfolding procedures were simulated with the high accuracy by using the MCNP-PoliMi code based on the Monte Carlo method. A possibility to identify the shielded neutron sources by using the unfolding method was examined with two continuous-in-energy sources, such as (252)Cf and (241)Am-Be in source-shielding configurations with lead (Pb) and polyethylene (PE) blocks. The results of calculations have shown that the identification of (252)Cf and (241)Am-Be sources with 2.5 cm of Pb and PE shield can be achieved successfully by using the MLEM method with the OSL algorithm. However, the unfolded results for (252)Cf and (241)Am-Be sources with 10 cm of PE shield significantly deviate from the reference spectra and the sources cannot be correctly identified on the basis of their unfolded energy spectra.

Deconvolution in Neutron Spectrometry Based on Analytical Approach	TECHNICS TECHNOLOGIES EDUCATION MANAGEMENT-TTEM			English	Article						pulse height; neutron spectrum; deconvolution; analytical approach	SCINTILLATION DETECTORS; EM ALGORITHM; MONTE-CARLO; LIKELIHOOD; CODE	This paper deals with a new version of the derivative deconvolution of energy spectra from the simulated pulse height distributions by using analytical approach. The modified derivative method was tested with a few monoenergetic and continuous neutron sources (Cf-252 and Am-241-Be). It was demonstrated that the analytical method based on the first derivative of pulse height data and the detector response matrix taking into account one collision on hydrogen, can be rather successfully used for evaluation of discrete energy spectra with a few neutron peaks. More complex spectra continuous in energy, such as Cf-252 and Am-241-Be obtained by the analytical approach show significant oscillations although with the appropriate smoothing procedure the unfolded results generally follow the trend of the reference data. The more involved method as a reference unfolding method is based on the maximum likelihood expectation-maximization method (MLEM) with one-step-late (OSL) algorithm. The unfolding is performed on pulse height distributions generated with the MCNP-PoliMi numerical code. This code based on the Monte Carlo method is used to simulate each neutron interaction in the scintillaton detector with high accuracy. The results of this study have shown that the more involved unfolding method is superior to the analytical method for both monoenergetic and continuous sources, but it is more time consuming and computationally rather demanding. The analytical approach requires less computer storage space, as well as it is simple to implement and suitable for online applications. The results of the analytical approach show acceptable agreement with the results obtained by the more involved method.

And handling missing values has become a research hot issue in the classification field. EM algorithm, a method of iteration, has been widely applied to statistical inferences involving incomplete data such as missing data, censoring data, group data and data bearing disgusting parameters. This paper introduces EM algorithm. To deal with the defects of EM algorithm's slow convergence speed and local convergence. Forward sampling is introduced into EM algorithm. First, get hold of the swatch using forward sampling; then compute the expectation of missing data in the sample; the expectation is used as the initialization in EM algorithm. Finally, the experiment validates the improved EM algorithm is better than conventionality EM algorithm.

This is achieved through an appropriate choice of the image space model, the selection of an optimal set of points and the use of any available prior information during the reconstruction process. Accordingly, a number of reconstruction related parameters must be optimized for best performance. In this work, a 3D point cloud tetrahedral mesh reconstruction method is evaluated for quantitative tasks. A linear image model is employed to obtain the reconstruction system matrix and five point generation strategies are studied. The evaluation is performed using the recovery coefficient, as well as, voxel and template based estimates of bias and variance measures, computed over specific regions in the reconstructed image. A similar analysis is performed for regular grid reconstructions that use voxel basis functions. The maximum likelihood expectation maximization reconstruction algorithm is used. For the tetrahedral reconstructions, of the five point generation methods that are evaluated, three use image priors. For evaluation purposes, an object consisting of overlapping spheres with varying activity is simulated. The exact parallel projection data of this object is obtained analytically using a parallel projector and multiple Poisson noise realizations of this exact data are generated and reconstructed using the different point generation strategies. The unconstrained nature of point placement in some of the irregular mesh based reconstruction strategies has superior activity recovery for small, low contrast image regions. The results show that, with an appropriately generated set of mesh points, the irregular grid reconstruction methods can out-perform reconstructions on a regular grid for mathematical phantoms, in terms of the performance measures evaluated.

Although single-sensor processing is still an open research field, practical applications nowadays require video analysis systems to explicitly consider multiple sensors at once, since the use of multiple sensors can lead to better algorithms for tracking, object recognition, etc. However, given a network of video sensors, it is not always clear how the network should be configured (in terms of sensor orientations) in order to optimize the system performance. In this work we propose a method to compute a (locally) optimal network configuration maximizing the coverage of a 3D environment, given that a relevance map of the environment exists, expressing the coverage priorities for each zone. The proposed method relies on a transformation projecting the observed environment into a new space where the problem can be solved by means of standard techniques such as the Expectation-Maximization algorithm applied to Gaussian Mixture Models.

Dual-Particle Imager for Standoff Detection of Special Nuclear Material	2011 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM AND MEDICAL IMAGING CONFERENCE (NSS/MIC)	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium/Medical Imaging Conference (NSS/MIC)/18th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X-Ray and Gamma-Ray Detectors	OCT 23-29, 2011	Valencia, SPAIN	IEEE, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Nucl & Plasma Sci Soc (IEEE NPSS)			NEUTRON	An advanced dual-particle imaging system is being developed for standoff, passive detection of special nuclear material. This system consists of three detector planes and will be capable of imaging both photons and fast neutrons. The ability of the system to detect fast neutrons makes it more difficult to effectively shield a threat source. This feature has an advantage over the commonly used Compton-camera systems, which are only sensitive to photons. Additionally, the detection of fast neutrons will allow for increased performance in regions with high levels of photon background radiation. The first two planes of the system consist of EJ-309 liquid scintillators and the third plane consists of NaI scintillators. This detector/plane combination allows image reconstruction using both neutrons and photons. In the liquid scintillators, neutron interactions are distinguished from photon interactions using an optimized pulse shape discrimination technique. The Monte Carlo transport code MCNPX-PoliMi has been used for the initial studies of this system due to its ability to track detailed information on interactions of interest and time-correlated particle production. This information has been used to optimize system parameters and has also allowed for investigation of image reconstruction techniques including simple backprojection and maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM). A small-scale prototype is being developed for testing and validation of the simulations. This paper will analyze preliminary measurements and will also discuss simulations of several shielded source scenarios.	[Polack, J.

This study aims to characterize the behavior of the two main motion correction methods in terms of convergence and image properties. During the first method, reconstruct-transform-average (RTA), independent reconstructions of each gate are transformed to a reference gate and averaged. In the second method, motion-compensated image reconstruction (MCIR), all data are used with the motion information within a single reconstruction. The two methods are studied based on the OS EM algorithm. In this investigation motion fields were obtained from real dynamic MR acquisitions and concurrent PET data were simulated from the dynamic MR images. The two motion correction approaches were assessed statistically. Results indicate that MCIR is successful in the recovery of the true values of all regions, whereas RTA has high bias due to the non-negativity constraints and interpolation errors during transformation. It has been demonstrated that whilst at low iterations (i.e. 46 sub-iterations) the two methods have similar noise characteristics; at high iterations MCIR has increased noise. Finally, for low iterations the two methods have marginally similar coefficient of variation (CoV) whereas for large number of iterations RTA has clearly better CoY than MCIR. This study indicates that MCIR may provide superior performance overall to RTA providing the noise can be minimized.

Since planning as inference essentially tackles a non-convex optimization problem when the states are partially observable, there is a need to develop techniques that can robustly escape local optima. We investigate the local optima of finite state controllers in single agent partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that are optimized by expectation maximization (EM). We show that EM converges to controllers that are optimal with respect to a one-step lookahead. To escape local optima, we propose two algorithms: the first one adds nodes to the controller to ensure optimality with respect to a multi-step lookahead, while the second one splits nodes in a greedy fashion to improve reward likelihood. The approaches are demonstrated empirically on benchmark problems.

The method proposed is a modified expectation maximization algorithm which utilizes an initial estimate to track the dominant modes of the channel at the transmitter and the receiver blindly; and simultaneously detects the unknown data. Furthermore, the estimates are constrained to be within a confidence interval of the previous estimate in order to improve the tracking performance and mitigate the effect of error propagation. Monte-Carlo simulation results of the symbol error rate and the mean square inner product between the estimated and the true singular vector are plotted to show the performance benefits offered by the proposed method compared to existing techniques.

In this paper we generalize the EP distribution and show that the failure rate of the new distribution can be decreasing or increasing. The failure rate can also be upside-down bathtub shaped. We provide closed-form expressions for the density, cumulative distribution, survival and failure rate functions.

It is an abductive reasoning task that involves inferring cause from effect. Most existing approaches to plan recognition use either first-order logic or probabilistic graphical models. While the former cannot handle uncertainty, the latter cannot handle structured representations. In order to overcome these limitations, we develop an approach to plan recognition using Bayesian Logic Programs (BLPs), which combine first-order logic and Bayesian networks. Since BLPs employ logical deduction to construct the networks, they cannot be used effectively for plan recognition. Therefore, we extend BLPs to use logical abduction to construct Bayesian networks and call the resulting model Bayesian Abductive Logic Programs (BALPs). We learn the parameters in BALPs using the Expectation Maximization algorithm adapted for BLPs. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation of BALPs on three benchmark data sets and compare its performance with the state-of-the-art for plan recognition.

No spatial correlation exists when classifying tissue type by using GMM and it also assumes that each class of the tissues is described by one Gaussian distribution but these assumptions lead to poor performance. It fails to utilize strong spatial correlation between neighboring pixels when used for the classification of tissues. The FET based EM-GMM algorithm improves the classification accuracy as it takes into account of spatial correlation of neighboring pixels and as the segmentation done in Fourier domain instead of spatial domain. The solution via FFT is significantly faster compared to the classical solution in spatial domain - it is just O(N log N-2) instead of O(N(boolean AND)2) and therefore enables the use EM-GMM for high-throughput and real-time applications.

Estimation of free flow speed and critical density in a segmented freeway using missing data and Monte Carlo-based expectation maximisation algorithm	IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article							MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; STATE ESTIMATION; SYSTEMS	This study is concerned with the estimation of two key parameters in a stochastic non-linear second-order state-space model of traffic flow using the maximum likelihood approach while employing a recursive Monte Carl-based filtering and smoothing to solve related expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm. A maximum likelihood (ML) framework is employed in the interests of statistical efficiency. EM algorithm may be used to compute these ML estimates and Monte Carlo approach is used to compute required conditional expectations. Considered parameters, free flow speed and critical density are traffic flow characteristics which are key parameters used for traffic control, ramp metering, incident management etc. A set of field traffic data from the Interstate-494 highway located in Metro Freeway Network Area at Minnesota is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

The clustering algorithm is based on a principled method for probabilistic modelling of a set of fibre trajectories as individual sequences of points generated from a finite mixture model consisting of multivariate polynomial regression model components. Unsupervised learning is carried out using maximum likelihood principles. Specifically, conditional mixture is used together with an EM algorithm to estimate cluster membership. The result of clustering is a probabilistic assignment of fibre trajectories to each cluster and an estimate of cluster parameters. A statistical shape model is calculated for each clustered fibre bundle using fitted parameters of the probabilistic clustering. We illustrate the potential of our clustering approach on synthetic and real data.

The implementation of ISRA is straightforward: the ratio of the backprojected measured data to that of the backprojected expected data is used to multiplicatively update the current image estimate. This work starts with a modified weighted least squares objective function to derive a more general form of the ISRA algorithm, which importantly accommodates weighting of the backprojection. Simply by changing the choice of backprojection weighting factors at a given iteration, both the well known ML-EM (maximum likelihood expectation maximization) algorithm as well as the standard ISRA, are obtained as special cases. ML-EM corresponds to using the current estimate of the expected data as the weights for backprojection, and ISRA corresponds to the case of unit weighting during backprojection. Of particular interest however, is that the framework naturally suggests the existence of many alternative reconstruction algorithms through alternative data weighting choices. By changing the weighting factors, a performance improvement over ISRA is obtained, as well as a slight performance improvement compared to ML-EM (for the task of accurate region quantification which is considered in this work). Specifically, these improvements are obtained, for example, by using a spatially-smoothed copy of the measured data as weighting factors during backprojection.

This question is especially relevant in cases where the ASR engine is a black box - meaning that the only acoustic cues about the speech data come from the word recognition outputs. This paper presents an expectation maximization approach to inferring pronunciations from ASR word recognition hypotheses, which outperforms pronunciation estimates of a state of the art grapheme-to-phoneme system.

Both subject-specific detection and measurement of these changes, as well as their population-based analysis are of great interest in many clinical studies. Generally, both problems are handled separately. However, as population-based knowledge facilitates subject-specific analysis and vice versa, we propose a unified statistical framework for subject-specific and population-based analysis of longitudinal brain MR image sequences of subjects suffering from the same neurological disease. The proposed method uses a maximum a posteriori formulation and the expectation maximization algorithm to simultaneously and iteratively segment all images in separate tissue classes, construct a global probabilistic 3D brain atlas and non-rigidly deform the atlas to each of the images to guide their segmentation. In order to enable a population-based analysis of the disease progression, an intermediate 4D probabilistic brain atlas is introduced, representing a discrete set of disease progression stages. The 4D atlas is simultaneously constructed with the 3D brain atlas by incorporating assignments of each input image (voxelwise) to a particular disease progression stage in the statistical framework. Moreover, these assignments enable both temporal and spatial subject-specific disease progression analysis. This includes detecting delayed or advanced disease progression and indicating the affected regions. The method is validated on a publicly available data set on which it shows promising results.

We investigate the coverage and average width properties of these intervals via a simulation study. For small Poisson counts and small misclassification rates, the intervals can perform poorly in terms of coverage. The profile log-likelihood confidence interval (CI) is often proved to outperform the other intervals with good coverage and width properties. Lastly, we apply the CIs to a real data set involving traffic accident data that contain misclassified counts.

This paper introduces a technique for calculating a displacement field from three frames of ultrasound RF data. To this end, we first introduce constraints on variations of the displacement field with time using mechanics of materials. These constraints are then used to generate a regularized cost function that incorporates amplitude similarity of three ultrasound images and displacement continuity. We optimize the cost function in an expectation maximization (EM) framework. Iteratively reweighted least squares (IRIS) is used to minimize the effect of outliers. We show that, compared to using two images, the new algorithm reduces the noise of the displacement estimation. The displacement field is used to generate strain images for quasi-static elastography. Phantom experiments and in-vivo patient trials of imaging liver tumors and monitoring thermal ablation therapy of liver cancer are presented for validation.

When image pairs containing different instances are matched based on visual similarity, the pairwise geometric relations as well as the correspondences inferred from such pairs are erroneous, which can lead to catastrophic failures in the reconstruction. In this paper, we investigate the geometric ambiguities caused by the presence of repeated or duplicate structures and show that to disambiguate between multiple hypotheses requires more than pure geometric reasoning. We couple an expectation maximization (EM)-based algorithm that estimates camera poses and identifies the false match-pairs with an efficient sampling method to discover plausible data association hypotheses. The sampling method is informed by geometric and image-based cues. Our algorithm usually recovers the correct data association, even in the presence of large numbers of false pairwise matches.

However the online EM algorithm is restricted to models in which an analytical expectation can be computed for the E-step. In this paper, we show that a new algorithm called the simulated online EM algorithm may be applied to a broad class of models used in signal processing and machine learning. These models, which are characterized by the presence of latent (or unobserved) positive factors, include in particular probabilistic variants of Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). We provide the main convergence properties of the simulated online EM algorithm and detail its application to the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model.

Text Classification on a Grid Environment	HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING FOR COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE - VECPAR 2010	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on High Performance Computing for Computational Science	JUN 22-25, 2010	Berkeley, CA			grid computing; text classification; expectation-maximization and naive bayes		The enormous amount of information stored in unstructured texts cannot simply be used for further processing by computers, which typically handle text as simple sequences of character strings. Text mining is the process of extracting interesting information and knowledge from unstructured text. One key difficulty with text classification learning algorithms is that they require many hand-labeled documents to learn accurately. In the text mining pattern discovery phase, the text classification step aims at automatically attribute one or more pre-defined classes to text documents. In this research, we propose to use an algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeled documents based on the combination of Expectation-Maximization (EM) and a naive Bayes classifier on a grid environment, this combination is based on a mixture of multinomials, which is commonly used in text classification. Naive Bayes is a probabilistic approach to inductive learning. It estimates the a posteriori probability that a document belongs to a class Oven the observed feature values of the documents, assuming independence of the features. The class with the maximum a posteriori probability is assigned to the document. Expectation-Maximization (EM) is a class of iterative algorithms for maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori estimation in problems with unlabeled data. The grid environment is a geographically distributed computation infrastructure composed of a set of heterogeneous resources. The semi-supervised learning classifier in the grid is available as a grid service, expanding the functionality of Aiuri Portal, which is a framework for a cooperative academic environment for education and research. Text classification mining methods are time-consuming by using the grid infrastructure can bring significant benefits in learning and the classification process.

We propose an approach using combination of eigenspace-based maximum likelihood linear regression (EMLLR) and evolutionary algorithms. To find the best solution for the coefficients estimation problem, we suggest using genetic algorithm (GA) for rapid speaker adaptation. This is due to the fact that genetic algorithms are not as sensitive as expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to the amount of adaptation data. Experimental results on TIMIT database illustrate that genetic algorithm, using random individuals in first population, leads to up to 1.03% improvement in phoneme recognition rate. Moreover, we show that if the first population contains coefficients initially estimated by maximum likelihood criterion, further improvement can be achieved as well. However, the amount of adaptation data does not have considerable effect on the proposed method. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We show that the problem of BER estimation is equivalent to estimating the conditional probability density functions (pdf)s of soft channel/receiver outputs. We also propose a non parametric Gaussian Kernel-based pdf estimation technique. Then, we introduce an iterative stochastic expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for the estimation of both a priori and a posteriori probabilities of transmitted information bits, and the classification of soft observations according to transmitted bit values. These inputs serve in the iterative procedure used for the estimation of conditional pdfs. We analyze the performance of the proposed BER estimator and show that is asymptotically unbiased and point-wise consistent. We also provide numerical results in the case of CDMA systems and show that attractive performance is achieved compared with conventional Monte Carlo (MC)-aided techniques.

How we can choose the strategy of gradient descent including learning coefficients selecting and really is it optimized to learn the same for all feature vectors?, are the challenges made us to think precisely on those. In this study, GMM estimates the probability density of the feature space and then the optimal learning rates can be evaluated proportional to these probabilities. These cause the neurons to learn correspondence with the feature distribution likelihoods. Considering robust satellite subset selection, Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) factor is calculated for all subset of satellites and then the subset with lowest value is selected for positioning, but it is so non-linear and has computational burden to navigation systems. We use the proposed method to approximate it. The results on real GPS measurements demonstrate that it significantly track the non-linearity of GPS GDOP.	[Saraf, M.; Mohammadi, K.; Mosavi, M.

The ML-PMHT likelihood ratio formulation allows for multiple targets as well as multiple returns from any given target in a single scan, which is realistic in a multi-receiver environment where data from different receivers is combined together. Additionally, the likelihood ratio can be optimized very easily and rapidly with the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Here, we apply ML-PMHT to two multistatic data sets: the TNO blind 2008 data set and the Metron 2009 data set.

Gaussian Mixture Models are a popular choice in many applications. Although these mixtures are powerful enough to approximate complex distributions, they may not be the best choice for some applications. Usual software mixtures libraries are often limited to a particular kind of distribution, which makes difficult to change the distribution and so to choose the best one. In this paper we focus on a particular class of distributions, the exponential families (which contains a lot of usual distributions like Gaussian, Rayleigh or Gamma). We present pyMEF, a Python framework to manipulate, learn and simplify mixtures of exponential families.

J	Seo, B				Seo, Byungtae			A gradient-based algorithm for semiparametric models with missing covariates	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION			English	Article						missing data; likelihood-based methods; maximum likelihood; mixture models; computational algorithms; statistical computing	EM ALGORITHM; REGRESSION	In the parametric regression model, the covariate missing problem under missing at random is considered. It is often desirable to use flexible parametric or semiparametric models for the covariate distribution, which can reduce a potential misspecification problem. Recently, a completely nonparametric approach was developed by [H.Y. Chen, Nonparametric and semiparametric models for missing covariates in parameter regression, J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 99 (2004), pp. 1176-1189; Z. Zhang and H.E. Rockette, On maximum likelihood estimation in parametric regression with missing covariates, J. Statist. Plann. Inference 47 (2005), pp. 206-223]. Although it does not require a model for the covariate distribution or the missing data mechanism, the proposed method assumes that the covariate distribution is supported only by observed values. Consequently, their estimator is a restricted maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) rather than the global MLE. In this article, we show the restricted semiparametric MLE could be very misleading in some cases. We discuss why this problem occurs and suggest an algorithm to obtain the global MLE. Then, we assess the performance of the proposed method via some simulation experiments.

Passive Location Estimation Using TOA Measurements	2011 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ULTRA-WIDEBAND (ICUWB)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB)	SEP 14-16, 2011	Bologna, ITALY	IEEE		TOA; TDOA; location estimation; CRLB	LOCALIZATION; NETWORKS; ALGORITHMS	Ultra-wideband (UWB) radios offer highly accurate ranging, i.e., measurement of signal travel time. This is important for positioning (localization), in particular in indoor environments, where GPS is not available. This paper considers UWB-based positioning of passive objects, where one transmitter and multiple, distributed, receivers are employed. We consider the case where the transmitter and receivers can be synchronized, so that time-of-arrival (TOA) instead of time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) information can be utilized. Assuming Gaussian errors for the range estimates, we propose a novel, Two-Step, Expectation Maximization (TSEM) based algorithm for the localization of the passive object. This algorithm achieves the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of TOA algorithms. Simulation results show that the error variance of TSEM is much lower (often 30 dB) than that of the existing, TDOA-based, algorithms.

For doubly-truncated data, the lifetime T is observable only when U <= T <= V, where U and V are the left-truncated and right-truncated time, respectively. Based on the empirical likelihood approach of Zhou [21], we propose a modified EM algorithm of Turnbull [19] to construct the interval estimator of the distribution function of T. Simulation results indicate that the empirical likelihood method can be more efficient than the bootstrap method.

J	Sheng, JH				Sheng, Jinhua			An elliptical SPECT system with slit-slat collimation for cardiac imaging	COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS			English	Article						Cardiac SPECT; Fan beam; Geometric efficiency; Order subset expectation maximization; Slit-slat collimation; Truncated projection	EMISSION COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHMS; ITERATIVE RECONSTRUCTION; ORDERED SUBSETS; ATTENUATION	Cardiac studies are a good candidate for SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) because of the large clinical demand and the need for improved image quality. But SPECT imaging suffers from poor spatial resolution and high statistical noise. A new SPECT system with slit-slat collimation arranged on an elliptical arc for cardiac imaging is proposed in this paper. Simulated emission computed tomography data are generated along an elliptical moving orbit with system configuration parameters. The iterative reconstruction techniques are used to implement the cardiac imaging of the proposed SPECT system. Image reconstruction can be done using the OS-EM algorithm from the data collected. This system is developed to improve the reconstructed image if attenuation correction and depth-dependent correction are included in the reconstruction, and the body contour is used in the reconstruction for severely truncated data. The simulation results show that the present methods can provide significant improvement in the spatial resolution and the image quality of SPECT sets. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The projections of the noise robust sparse representations for audio signals computed by L-1 - minimization are used as feature. We consider the classifiers based on heterogeneous mixture models (hetMM) which combine multiple different kinds of distributions, since in practice the data may come from multiple sources and it is often unclear what the most suitable distribution is. Experimental results show that method with hetMM has better results than using a single distribution type and gives comparable performances with Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

In this paper, we introduce a model-based algorithm for detection of percussive events and test the algorithm on the detection and classification of different percussive sounds. We focus on tuning the algorithm for a good compromise between temporal precision, classification accuracy and low latency. The model is trained offline on different percussive sounds using the expectation maximization approach for learning spectral templates for each sound and is able to run online to detect and classify sounds from audio stream input by a Hidden Markov Model. Our results indicate that the approach is promising and applicable in design and development of interactive musical systems.

J	Siu, TK				Siu, Tak Kuen			Long-term strategic asset allocation with inflation risk and regime switching	QUANTITATIVE FINANCE			English	Article						Asset allocation; Inflation; Regime switching; Filtering; Martingale approach	VARIANCE PORTFOLIO SELECTION; CONTINUOUS-TIME MODEL; CONSUMPTION; EQUILIBRIUM; VALUATION; POLICIES; PRICES; MARKET	Long-term strategic asset allocation is an important problem in both finance and actuarial science. There are two key issues in long-term strategic asset allocation, namely, the presence of inflation risk and the impact of changes in (macro)-economic conditions on model dynamics. In this article, we take into account the two key issues in our model formulation and develop a quantitative model for long-term strategic asset allocation. A continuous-time, regime-switching market with the presence of inflation risk is considered. There are three tradeable assets in the market, namely, a fixed interest security, an ordinary share and an inflation-linked bond. We assume that the nominal rate of interest on the fixed interest security, the expected rate of return from the ordinary share and the appreciation rate of inflation are modulated by a continuous-time, finite-state, hidden Markov chain. The states of the chain represent different states of an economy. With knowledge about the price of the ordinary share and the price index level, an investor wishes to maximize the expected utility of real terminal wealth. By making use of the separation principle, we solve the optimal portfolio selection problem and the estimation problem independently. We derive a robust estimate of the hidden state of the chain and develop a robust, filter-based, EM algorithm for the on-line recursive estimates of the key model parameters.

Application of the multivariate skew normal mixture model with the EM Algorithm to Value-at-Risk	19TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2011)			English	Proceedings Paper	19th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)	DEC 12-16, 2011	Perth, AUSTRALIA	CSIRO, Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol, Per Convent & Exhibit Ctr, Perth Convent Bur, Curtin Univ, Australian Math Soc (Aust MS), Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math (ANZIAM), Australian Math Sci Inst (AMSI), Maralte Publishers, Econ Soc Australian (ESA), HEMA Consulting, Simulat Australia, Stat Soc Australia Inc (SSAI), Modelling & Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand Inc (MSSANZ), Int Assoc Math & Comp Simulat (IMACS)		Value-at-Risk; Mixture models; Skew normal; Skew normal mixtures; EM Algorithm		Since returns of financial assets generally exhibit skewness and kurtosis, modelling returns using a distribution with the ability to capture both of these statistical aspects will increase the accuracy of risk forecasts based on these distributions. The authors propose the use of the multivariate skew normal (MVSN) mixture model to fit asset returns in order to increase the accuracy of Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimates. This paper presents a novel application of the MVSN mixture model to estimate VaR. There is generally no explicit analytical solution for the parameters of the MVSN mixture model via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), therefore the use of the Expectation Maximization (EM) Algorithm is proposed in order to find the parameter estimates of the model. The example provided in this paper consists of a portfolio of monthly returns of six shares listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). The shares are BHP Billiton Limited (BHP), Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), Cochlear Limited (COH), News Corporation (NWS), Origin Energy (ORG), and Wesfarmers Limited (WES). Hence, the dimensionality, p, of this portfolio is six. The period of analysis for the data is 01/01/1998 - 01/04/2011. This paper models the MVSN mixture model with a number of mixtures ranging from one to four. A mixture of multivariate normal densities is modelled for comparison to the MVSN mixture model. We find that for one to three mixtures, the MVSN mixture model provides an improved fit. The improved fit of the MVSN mixture model is translated to the performance of the VaR models, where the results show that for one to three numbers of mixtures, the VaR model using the MVSN mixture model assumption indicates improved risk forecasts when compared to the mixture of multivariate normal densities. Furthermore, for the example examined, we find that the model which incorporates the skewness parameter (MVSN mixture model) requires a fewer number of mixtures when compared to a mixture of normal densities. This is an interesting result as reduced model complexity requires less computational ability, computation time, and will results in decreased computational anomalies.

This approach extends the vector Taylor series (VTS)-based feature compensation from the single channel to the multichannel case. Precisely, we use the first order YTS to approximate each of the microphone feature vectors. Afterwards, these features are jointly processed to estimate the acoustic channel and noise statistics via expectation maximization (EM).

The algorithm can be applied efficiently to Expectation Maximization (EM) techniques that include per-event probability distributions with shapes more complex than symmetric tubes of response. The algorithm is generic for any system geometry and draws the scalar field associated to a generic input kernel with a constant cut-off threshold independent from the actual kernel shape. In the current version it has been tested for reconstructing List-Mode (LM) data simulated with GATE on the rPET small animal scanner and used with a 2D Gaussian kernel specifically designed for the rPET. EM parallelization has been achieved at per-event level on a 8 core dual CPU. Results show that the new algorithm allows for LM reconstruction in low times with complex kernel functions of the relative position of the voxel with respect to the line of response.

This makes the tuning process of the INS/GNSS Kalman filter often sensitive and difficult. We are currently investigating two approaches for bounding the errors in the mechanization. The first is an improved modeling of stochastic errors through the superposition of several Auto-Regressive (AR) processes. A new algorithm is presented based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) principle that is able to estimate such complex models. The second approach focuses on redundancy through the use of multiple IMUs which don't need to be calibrated a priori. We present a synthetic IMU computation in which the residuals are modeled by a single ARMA model. The noise power issued from the residuals is then continuously estimated by a GARCH model, which enables a proper weighting of the individual devices in the synthetic IMU.

We have proposed a fuzzy edge incorporated Markov Random Field (MRF) model based spatial segmentation scheme that is able even to identify the blurred boundaries of objects in a scene. Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate the MRF model parameters. To reduce the complexity of searching, a new scheme is proposed to get a rough knowledge of maximum possible shift of objects from one frame to another by finding the amount of shift in positions of the centroid. Moving objects in the scene are detected by the proposed chi(2)-test based local histogram matching. It is noticed that the proposed scheme provides better results with less object background misclassification as compared to optical flow and label fusion based techniques.

Unlike Expectation-Maximization algorithm (EM), the mixture model distribution parameters are modeled by a set of hyper-parameters in VB inference framework. These hyper-parameters which characterize the mixture model distributions are estimated by a Variational Expectation-Maximization (VEM) learning algorithm. However, it is difficult to initialize the hyper-parameters for VEM algorithm without prior knowledge. This study introduces a hybrid GA and VEM methodology to estimate the finite mixture models fully automatically without any specific initialization steps for voxel classification in brain images. The proposed VEM, GAVEM algorithms are validated and compared with GA and EM algorithms on real three-dimensional human brain MRI images. The voxel tissue classification results demonstrate that VEM, and GAVEM algorithms achieve competitive segmentation results compared to other parameters estimation algorithms, and fully automatically.

Our model is general enough to be applied to any RTS game with the canonical gameplay of gathering resources to extend a technology tree and produce military units and we applied it to StarCraft1. This model can also predict the possible technology trees of the opponent, but we will focus on openings here. The parameters of this model are learned from replays (game logs), labeled with openings. We present a semi-supervised method of labeling replays with the expectation-maximization algorithm and key features, then we use these labels to learn our parameters and benchmark our method with cross-validation. Uses of such a model range from a commentary assistant (for competitive games) to a core component of a dynamic RTS bot/AI, as it will be part of our StarCraft AI competition entry bot.			gabriel.synnaeve@gmail.com; pierre.bessiere@imag.fr					Aha D.

The study of systems biology through ILP aims at improving the understanding of the physiological state of the cell and the interpretation of the interactions between metabolites and signaling networks. A logical model of the glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways of E. Coli is proposed to support our method description. We explain our original approach to building a symbolic model applied to kinetics based on Michaelis-Menten equation, starting with the discretization of the changes in concentration of some of the metabolites over time into relevant levels. We can then use them in our ILP-based model. Logical formulae on concentrations of some metabolites, which could not be measured during the dynamic state, are produced through logical abduction.

The method assumes (1) that the time-frequency representations of sources have disjoint support (W-disjoint orthogonality of sources), and (2) that each source is modeled as a superposition of components whose amplitudes vary over time coherently across all frequencies (amplitude coherence of frequency components) in order to jointly solve the indeterminacy involved in the frequency domain underdetermined BSS problem.

It is useful in protecting the privacy of users, but it can lead to the illegal use of some forbidden protocols. Because of the encryption, the Deep Payload Inspection (DPI) technique is ineffective in classifying the network traffic. This paper introduces how to employ the statistical pattern recognition method, Maximum Likelihood Classification [2, 3], to classify the SSH tunneled traffic, i.e. to decide which protocols is tunneled in the encrypted tunnels. It is very important to find out the boundary of a tunneled flow in processing the originate data. So we proposed a method for detecting the boundaries of SSH tunneled traffic.			hualing314159@126.com					DEMPSTER AP, 1977, J ROY STAT SOC B MET, V39, P1; Dusi M, 2009, COMPUT NETW, V53, P81, DOI 10.1016/j.comnet.2008.09.010; Dusi M., 2008, PRELIMINARY LOOK PRI; Dusi M., 2009, USING GMM SVM BASED; John A., 2006, REMOTE SENSING DIGIT, P439; Lonvick C., 2006, SECURE SHELL SSH PRO; REDNER RA, 1984, SIAM REV, V26, P195, DOI 10.1137/1026034; RISSANEN J, 1983, ANN STAT, V11, P416, DOI 10.1214/aos/1176346150	8	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA		978-1-4577-0321-8				2011							2347	2350				4	Automation & Control Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Automation & Control Systems; Engineering	BYG97	WOS:000298656802117

These centers receive and process the information that is collected from across the network. In this paper, we develop a decentralized adaptive strategy for information processing and apply it to the task of estimating the parameters of a Gaussian-mixture-model (GMM). The proposed technique employs adaptive diffusion algorithms that enable adaptation, learning, and cooperation at local levels. The simulation results illustrate how the proposed technique outperforms non-collaborative learning and is competitive against centralized solutions.

Recent studies succeeded in modeling origin-destination (OD) flows in a spatial econometric field, implying that considering spatial dependence among flows will improve the accuracy of the model. However, not all origin-destination flow data contains intraregional flows, and no research has been conducted on how to cope with such data. This study focuses on the problem wherein the spatial econometric model for flows proposed by LeSage and Pace (2008) is not feasible when the flow data does not have intraregional flows. The study also proposes the EM algorithm as a method to overcome this problem. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

MLEM method is known to be able to deal with the missing parts via system matrix modeling. We propose sequentially applied regularized MLEM method for the image reconstruction from the incomplete sinograms. Median filtering (MED), L-filtering (L) and block matching 3D (BM3D) filtering were employed as spatial domain regularizers, separately. The MLEM method was applied sequentially by decreasing gradually the amount of the regularization when the image update between the consecutive iterations was negligible. The sequential application of the MLEM method is used to compensate for the blurring caused by the regularization filters. In order to test the proposed approach thoroughly, we constructed wide test dataset consisting of three sparse sinograms (by using 25%, 10% and 5.5% of the sinogram data), the ECAT HRRT type sinogram (81.2% of the sinogram data), ClearPET type sinogram (88.3% of the sinogram data), AX-PET type sinogram (56% of the sinogram data) and a hypothetical checkerboard type sinogram (50% of the sinogram data) of the Shepp-Logan phantom. The constructed incomplete sinograms were contaminated with the Poisson noise. The incomplete sinograms were reconstructed by using filtered backprojection, MLEM without filtering, MLEM with MED, MLEM with L and MLEM with BM3D filtering. We evaluated the approach visually and with the quantitative normalized mean square error (NMSE). The results showed that MLEM without filtering cannot correct the artifacts related to the missing sinogram bins for some of the generated incomplete sinograms. On the other hand, MLEM method with spatial regularization filter was able to provide successfully reconstructed images for all cases. Quantitative NMSE values were in parallel with the visual impression of the reconstructed images.

The use of semi-Markov modeling approach is adapted in a multi-stage process involving acuity levels of patients. The parametric and nonparametric methods of estimation were used for maximum likelihood estimation of the sojourn time distribution. The stationary or long run distribution of the recovery pattern of patients in the Semi-Markov process (SMP) reveals that state G (6/18) is the best corrected acuity with 0.3485 proportions of patients. The distance in meters that the patient can stand and read certain alphabets is 6 and 18m is for a normal person, hence the acuity level of 6/18.	[Ugwuowo, F.

Recent trends suggest the need for good preprocessors and post analysing tools which characterize printed text for identification of print technology. Each printing technology differs in their process of placing marking material on the target. The paper focuses on frequently used word like 'the' as test sample for characterizing printed text. The novelty of the proposed algorithm is that the selected printed text is modelled as mixture of three Gaussian models namely text, noise and background. The associated patterns and features of the models are derived using Expectation Maximization(EM) algorithm and few indices are proposed based on these parameters. One of the indices called Print Index(PI) for text is used for basic print technology discrimination.

To overcome this problem, the deterministic annealing EM (DAEM) algorithm was once proposed and had achieved better performance than EM algorithm, but it is not very effective at avoiding local maxima. In this paper, a solution is proposed by integrating GA and DAEM into one procedure to further improve the solution quality. The population based search of genetic algorithm will produce different solutions and thus can increase the search space of DAEM. Therefore, the proposed algorithm will reach better solution than just using DAEM. The algorithm retains the property of DAEM and gets the better solution by genetic operation. Experiment results on Gaussian mixture model parameter estimation demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve better performance. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, since the method is based on minimum message length (MML) criterion, it can also determine the number of components of the mixture model. The simulation results demonstrate that our method outperform several other state-of-art model selection algorithms especially for the mixtures with components of very different weights.

The specific problem considered is the classification of radar high-resolution range profile (HRRP). We model the radar returns from each target as a t-mixture distribution. Estimation of the model parameters is achieved using a modified expectation-maximization (EM), i.e., fuzzy EM (FEM) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed statistical model not only has better recognition performance but also is more robust to noises than other methods.

This paper aimed to the convergence speed problem, presents a fast convergence method of phase estimation based on Em, which modify the priori probability with posteriori probability in the EM algorithm iterative. For the QPSK carrier phase estimation, compared with the traditional Method that assumed the transmitted signals is independent and no prior information.

The wearable vision system is implemented with embedded systems and can achieve real-time performance. The hardware of the system includes an asymmetric dual-core processer with an ARM core and a DSP core. The display device is a pico projector which has a small volume size but can project large screen size. A triple buffering mechanism is designed for efficient memory management. Software functions are partitioned and pipelined for effective execution in parallel. The gesture recognition is achieved first by a color classification which is based on the expectation-maximization algorithm and Gaussian mixture model (GMM). To improve the performance of the GMM, we devise a LUT (Look Up Table) technique. Fingertips are extracted and geometrical features of fingertip's shape are matched to recognize user's gesture commands finally. In order to verify the accuracy of the gesture recognition module, experiments are conducted in eight scenes with 400 test videos including the challenge of colorful background, low illumination, and flickering. The processing speed of the whole system including the gesture recognition is with the frame rate of 22.9FPS. Experimental results give 99% recognition rate. The experimental results demonstrate that this small-size large-screen wearable system has effective gesture interface with real-time performance.

Unlike existing methods, we cast the inpainting task as a sequential low-rank matrix recovery and completion problem, where the incomplete data matrix consists of the image patch to be inpainted and several similar intact candidate patches under the assumption that they can be described using a low-dimensional linear model. Besides, the non-negativity and sparsity constraints are enforced for the additive sparse linear combination. The WSNMF, based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) procedure, is then introduced to predict missing values. Experimental results show that this approach exploits the available information from the source region more adequately and thus has capabilities to recover both structure and composite textures more effectively as well as preventing unwanted artifacts compared to current exemplar-based techniques.

We evaluate the performance of. gain adapted multipitch tracking on the GRID database, where 3000 speech mixtures were generated for each mixing level. For gain differences in the range of zero up to 18dB, the proposed method achieves almost the same performance as for the case where the gain is assumed to be known.

Constrained Estimation of Mixture Vector Autoregressive Model	19TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2011)			English	Proceedings Paper	19th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)	DEC 12-16, 2011	Perth, AUSTRALIA	CSIRO, Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol, Per Convent & Exhibit Ctr, Perth Convent Bur, Curtin Univ, Australian Math Soc (Aust MS), Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math (ANZIAM), Australian Math Sci Inst (AMSI), Maralte Publishers, Econ Soc Australian (ESA), HEMA Consulting, Simulat Australia, Stat Soc Australia Inc (SSAI), Modelling & Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand Inc (MSSANZ), Int Assoc Math & Comp Simulat (IMACS)		EM algorithm; interest rate; likelihood ratio test; non-linear time-series model	NUISANCE PARAMETER; EM ALGORITHM	A mixture vector autoregressive model has recently been introduced to the literature. This model consists of a mixture of finite number of vector autoregressive models. The first-and second-order stationarity conditions have been derived and an EM algorithm for estimation has been proposed. A mixture of stationary and nonstationary vector autoregressive components may still result in a stationary model. With the shape-changing predictive distribution, flexible conditional moment and autocorrelation structures, the mixture vector autoregressive model represents an attractive candidate for nonlinear multiple time series modeling. However, previous methodology has two limitations. First, method for computing or approximating the standard errors of the estimates has not been investigated. The approximation of the standard errors based on numerical procedures could be seriously inaccurate. Second, as a multivariate model, the MVAR model contains a large number of parameters in its specification. Estimation efficiency for short time series may be poor. Thus, it is important to consider procedures that eliminate unnecessary parameters and estimate the models with parameter constraints. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, a form of parameter constraints is introduced with an efficient EM algorithm for estimation. Second, an accurate method for computing standard errors is presented for the model with and without parameter constraints. Lastly, a hypothesis-testing approach based on likelihood ratio tests is proposed, which aids in the selection of unnecessary parameters and leads to the greater efficiency at the estimation. An example employing U. S. Treasury constant maturity rates illustrates the applicability of the mixture vector autoregressive model with parameter constraints, and the importance of using a reliable method to compute standard errors.

The supervised method requires the training data to be labeled manually, which can be tedious and onerous. In this paper, a more challenging setting of the problems without complete information on data labels is investigated. In particular, as the horror scene is characterized by multiple features, this problem is formulated as a special multiple instance learning (MIL) problem - Multiple Grouped Instance Learning (MGIL), which requires partial labeled training. To solve the MGIL problem, a learning method is proposed Multiple Distance- Expectation Maximization Diversity Density (MD-EMDD). Additionally, a survey is conducted to collect people's opinions based on the definition of horror scenes. Combined with the survey results, Labeled with Ranking - MD - EMDD is proposed and demonstrated better results when compared to the traditional MIL algorithm and close to performance achieved by supervised method.

Compared to preceding approaches, the unique aspect of the proposed design is that it enables SPECT imaging only by axial translation of the imaging object to obtain sufficient angular sampling, rather than rotation of either the object or the collimator. This reduces the difficulty of geometrical calibration and facilitates accurate system matrix derivation. In order to minimize the axial overlap, the transverse section of the pinhole is designed to be elliptical. The sampling completeness of different scanning orbits is studied by a numerical approach based on Tuy sampling criteria. Results show that in the reconstruction images of a simulated Derenzo phantom, 1.35 mm hot rods are distinguishable. Image quality with only object translation is comparable to those with both object translation and rotation. A practical calibration method of the system geometrical parameters is developed and tested with simulation data. Finally, we incorporate the TV prior in OS-EM algorithm and the reconstruction results show the noise is efficiently suppressed. We conclude that we present a practical way to implement SPECT imaging on existing PET scanner without object or collimator rotation and desired spatial resolution is achievable with this design.

However, time-lapse images, acquired by TIRF microscopy imaging system suffer the problem of intensity loss due to photobleaching. In this paper, TIRF images were segmented by a Gaussian mixture model into foreground and background. Parameters of the model were estimated through the expectation maximization. Finally, the restored image was wrapped backward to reference frame with the help of foreground parameters. The experimental results showed that the corrected images were effectively compensated and maintained a relatively constant intensity along time.

Spatial and temporal hotspots of SVCs can be defined as clusters of SVCs that have exceeded the expected value over a certain time period and at certain locations. The EM (Expectation-Maximisation) algorithm was adopted to identify the characteristics of driver involved in vehicle crashes. Drivers were divided into different segments based on their socio-demographic characteristics, i.e., age and gender and driver related crash factors such as, drive license's types, alcohol consumption, speeding, fatigue and inattention etc. The spatial hotspots of the SVCs were identified using the Kernel Density Estimation method. Comap was used to integrate space, time and characteristics of drivers into one view to better understand the nature of the SVCs. The main conclusion draws from this study are as follows: Characteristics of drivers subject to SVCs Change over time with different contributing factors. Some subgroups of drivers at greater risk were identified. Females aged around 19, with BACs around 0.03%, on probationary licences were more likely to be involved in crashes between the hours of midnight and 2:10am and require hospital attention. Males aged around 61, on full licences were more likely to be involved in crashes between the hours of 7: 55am and 10: 55am because of inattention and require medical or hospital treatment. Males, and some females, aged around 26, on full licences, and with BACs around 0.07% were more likely to be involved in crashes between the hours of 2: 10am and 4: 55am because of alcohol, inattention, and speeding, and require hospital treatment. Males, and some females, aged around 36 were more likely to be involved in crashes between the hours of 10: 55am and 17:40am because of inattention and require medical attention. Males and females aged around 17 on probationary licences were more likely to be involved in crashes between the hours of 17:40pm and 20:55pm because of inattention, and require medical attention. Alcohol and speeding were found to be the main contributing factors in SVCs at night or early morning, and inattention was the main factor in SVCs during the day. Severity of SVCs is generally higher at night than during the day. The distribution of hotspots of SVCs varies over different time periods The results of this research will help road safety management authorities better understand the underlying nature of why crashes happen and where and when they do so that remedial action can take into account the characteristics of drivers.

We propose a statistical segmentation algorithm that incorporates the prior anatomical knowledge represented by probabilistic brain atlas into the variational Bayes inference to delineate gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in brain PET-CT images. Our approach adds an additional novel aspect by allowing voxels to have variable and adaptive prior probabilities of belonging to each class. We compared our algorithm to the segmentation approaches implemented in the expectation maximization segmentation (EMS) and statistical parametric mapping (SPM8) packages in 26 clinical cases. The results show that our algorithm improves the accuracy of brain PET-CT image segmentation.

The additional information to make the interior problem uniquely solvable is that a specific region inside the interior ROI is known to have uniform intensity level, but the constant level is unknown. The uniqueness of solution in this situation is analyzed by combining two existing approaches, namely (1) when the full knowledge of a small region inside the interior ROI is known, and (2) when the complete interior ROI is piecewise constant. The image reconstruction is provided by a mixed region and voxel based Poisson likelihood ML-EM algorithm that takes care of the photon statistics in emission tomography. This algorithm reconstructs the unknown constant (region-model) and the rest of the interior ROI (voxel-model) simultaneously. The uniqueness result assumes that all line integrals through the interior ROI are acquired. When only finite number of projection views are available, the mixed region and voxel based ML-EM algorithm can also reduce image artifacts from sparse-view and interior data acquisition in stationary multipinhole SPECT.

Next, the matrices inversions and multiplications are reduced by using the expectation maximum (EM) algorithm. Finally, the performance degradation due to the carrier frequency offset (CFO)) is improved by using the equivalent signal model (ESM). Simulation experiments show that the proposed H-infinity estimator has almost the same performance as the MAP estimator and EM-based H-infinity estimator has obviously improvement over least square (LS) estimator with good convergence. Furthermore, EM-based H-infinity estimator based on ESM could obtain remarkable improvement under frequency mismatch circumstance.

Unlike other images, the fingerprint images are obviously directional. Aiming at this feature, in this paper, an image segmentation method based on the directional information of fingerprint image is introduced, which sufficiently utilizes the directional information of fingerprint image and succeeds in separating the background information. However, owing to the absence of directional information in some local areas of fingerprint image, this method will produce large segmentation errors, even fail. Therefore, for these local regions without directional information, it is proposed to apply Bayesian decision-making theory based on minimum error probability to realize image segmentation. On the assumption that the gray values accord with the probability distribution of Gaussian finite mixture model in image feature space, EM algorithm is used to estimate the parameters of mixture model. The mixture application of two methods can effectively separate the background information from fingerprint image while saving the preprocessing time and ensuring the following identification accuracy of fingerprint. The experiments illustrate the feasibility of the hybrid approach.

For this purpose, we propose a novel method to extract statistical and morphological features. At the first stage, we estimate cell component memberships at each pixel by applying an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to the color information. Next we calculate the local co-occurrence of the memberships as image features. And then, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is applied to those features for final decision of whether cancer or not, with enhancing the discrimination.

In this paper, we extract spatial temporal movement features from human actions and adopt unsupervised clustering method for salient posture learning. First, spatial-temporal interest points (STIPs) were extracted according to the properties of human movement, and then, histogram of gradient was built to describe the distribution of STIPs in each frame for a single pose. In addition, the training samples were clustered by non-supervised classification method. Moreover, the salient postures were modeled with GMM according to Expectation Maximization (EM) estimation. The experiment results proved that our method can effectively and accurately recognize human's action postures.

Our aim was to find the optimal value of hyperparameter corresponding to the lowest bias at the lowest noise while maximizing uniformity and spatial resolution for the reconstructed myocardium in SPECT MPI. We found that the L-curve method that is by definition a global technique provides good guidance for selection of the optimal value of the hyperparameter. However, for a heterogeneous object such as human thorax the fine-tuning of the hyperparameter's value can be only accomplished by means of a local method such as the proposed bias-noise distance (BND) curve. We established that our BND-curve method provides accurate optimized hyperparameter's value estimation as long as the region of interest volume for which it is defined is sufficiently large and is located sufficiently close to the myocardium.

We use a joint random effect model of clustered failure times and cluster size. To investigate the possible association, two submodels are connected by a common latent variable. The EM algorithm is applied for the estimation of parameters in the models. Simulation studies are performed to assess the finite sample properties of the estimators. Also, sensitivity tests show the influence of the misspecification of random effect distributions. The methods are applied to a lymphatic filariasis study for adult worm nests.

Compton PET can use not only the photoelectric effect but also the Compton scattering effect for image reconstruction, and hence the detection efficiency should be inherently higher than that of conventional PET. By using a pixelized CZT detector, the detected position and deposited energy of the gamma ray were found precisely. With the position and energy information, the interaction sequence, which was one of the main factors to consider in the reconstruction of the source image, was identified correctly. The reconstruction algorithms were simple backprojection and MLEM, and three methods were used to evaluate the CZT Compton PET compared with conventional PET which uses the photoelectric effect only. The FWHMs (Full Widths at Half Maximum) and the maximum counts of images reconstructed by simple backprojection were calculated for comparison. Using an MLEM method, the FWHM and the relative standard deviation of the counts in the range of half of the FWHM around the maximum pixel were calculated at each iteration to evaluate the modalities quantitatively. For a 3D source phantom, simple backprojection and the MLEM method were applied to each modality and the reconstructed images were compared with each other by visual inspection.

Based on the Bayesian framework, we introduce a meta-learning mechanism to optimize the prior distribution and the model structure. In order to search for the optimal model structure efficiently, we also develop a hierarchical model selection method. The performance of our method is evaluated by using function approximation problems and an system identification problem of a nonlinear dynamical system. Experimental results show that our Bayesian framework results in the reduction of generalization error and achieves better function approximation than existing methods within the finite mixtures of experts family whim the number of training data is fairly small.

Based on our previous work on mobility for lifetime maximization, this paper investigates simultaneously designing mobility and routing strategies of robotic sensor nodes to improve the lifetime of a mobile sensor network. The network lifetime problem was formulated as a nonlinear non-convex optimization problem and is solved distributedly by a series of convex approximations and a proposed novel algorithm. Computer simulations illustrated quick convergence to the solution, and the lifetime of the network was improved tremendously. By comparison, the proposed joint design method has an edge over other methods, which further justifies the use of mobility for energy efficiency in robotic sensor networks.	[Yu, Shengwei; Lee, C. S.

A neural network hazard model is utilized here to model the relationship between covariates and the hazard. In order to consider incomplete covariates, the hidden layer target data are represented to be binary random variables. This will enable the training of the two-layer neural network hazard model to be decomposed into training of two single-layer structures. The training of input-hidden structure now becomes the logistic estimation problem with part of the input and all the output (the hidden layer target) missing. However, there are two major problems for this logistic estimation. It requires assumption about the distribution of the partially observed covariates. In addition, estimation for the logistic function will become complicated when the input data has missing values. Therefore, Instead of logistic function, the general location model is adopted to represent the mixed data set which involves missing values. The training of input-hidden structure thus becomes maximisation of the likelihood of mixed continuous data (covariates) and categorical data (hidden layer targets) within the general location model. The hidden layer targets link the two single structures and are updated iteratively. After each update, the expected values of the hidden layer targets are then used for the training of hidden-output structure of the neural network hazard model. This structure is now same as a generalised linear model (GLM) and is trained by the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approach. The training for both input-hidden and hidden-output structures will iterate until the estimation is converged. This new approach is applied to a group of bearing data. Parts of the data are deleted deliberately to create different realisations of incomplete covariate set. The numerical study demonstrates that this new approach is capable of handling the incomplete covariate data in the survival analysis and its results outperform those of conventional incomplete covariates handling approaches.

Within the computer model, there always exist some parameters which are unobservable in the real process but need to be specified in the computer model. The procedure to adjust these unknown parameters in order to fit the model to observed data and improve its predictive capability is known as calibration. In traditional calibration, once the optimal calibration parameter set is obtained, it is treated as known for future prediction. Calibration parameter uncertainty introduced from estimation is not accounted for. We will present a Bayesian calibration approach for stochastic computer models. We account for these additional uncertainties and derive the predictive distribution for the real process. Two numerical examples are used to illustrate the accuracy of the proposed method.

For safety-of-life navigation applications such as precision approach and landing, integrity plays a critical role. Carrier phase-based Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (CRAM) has been investigated for many years (Pervan et al, 1998; Feng et al, 2007). Assuming that the carrier phase error has a Gaussian distribution, conventional CRAIM algorithms were directly derived from the Pseudorange-based RAIM (PRAIM). However, the actual carrier phase error does not exactly follow the Gaussian distribution, hence the performance of the conventional CRAIM algorithm is not optimal. To approach this problem, this paper proposes a new CRAIM algorithm that uses Gaussian sum filters. A Gaussian sum filter can deal with any non-Gaussian error distribution and accurately present the posterior distributions of states. In this paper, a new method of making a Gaussian mixture model, which follows the true error distribution, is introduced. Additionally an integrity monitoring algorithm, using a Gaussian sum filter, is described in detail. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can have about 18% smaller Minimum Detectable Bias (MDB) and generates about 20% lower protection levels than those of the conventional CRAIM algorithm. In other words, by considering a non-Gaussian carrier phase error distribution, the new algorithm can improve the accuracy and the availability.

J	Yun, WY; Kim, JW				Yun, Won Young; Kim, Jong-Woon			Estimating the mixture of a proportional hazards model with three types of failure data	IIE TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						Proportional hazards model; incomplete data; EM algorithm; mixture model	MIXED-WEIBULL DISTRIBUTIONS; REPAIRABLE SYSTEMS; RELIABILITY; RATES	Cox's Proportional Hazards Model (PHM) has been widely applied in the analysis of lifetime data. It can be characterized in terms of covariates that influence the system lifetime, where the covariates describe the operating environment (e. g., temperature, pressure, humidity). When the covariates are assumed to be random variables, the hazards model becomes the mixed PHM. In this article, a parametric method is proposed to estimate the unknown parameters in the mixed PHM. Three types of data are considered: uncategorized field observations, categorized field ones, and categorized experimental ones. The expectation-maximization algorithm is used to handle the incomplete data problem. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the precision and some properties of the estimation results.

One of the important components of the continuous HMM we focus on is an emission probability which can be approximated by the weighted sum of Gaussians. Although, EM is a very fast iterative algorithm it can only guarantee a convergence to a local result. Therefore, the initialization process determines the final result. We suggested here two modifications of genetic algorithms for the initialization of EM. They are compared to the results of the EM with the same number of local multi-starts.

The proposed method is able to overcome the main problem in our database images; the inconsistency of grey level values due to different parameter settings during the scanning process that leads to different objects segmented within the same intensity level, as well as helps to automate the segmentation process. One hundred and fifty haemorrhage CT brain images of thirty one patients from Hospital Serdang and Hospital Putrajaya are used in this work. Performance of the segmentation method is quantitatively and qualitatively compared with available automated methods which are watershed and expectation maximization methods. The results show that the MLSA gives the best segmentation of average Percentage of Correct Classification, PCC = 97.1% with 93% of the haemorrhage cases excellently segmented. Besides, qualitatively, it also portrays good segmentation results. The MLSA proves to be accurate and reliable that would provide a strong basis for the application in content-based medical image retrieval.	[Zaki, W.

A power spectrogram of each source is modeled by superposition of nonnegative rank-1 basic spectrograms, which leads to a Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) model for each source. Since the number of recording channels may be lower than the number of true sources (speakers), under-determinedness is possible. Hence, any meaningful a priori information about the source or the mixing operator can improve the results of blind separation. In our approach, we assume that the basic rank-1 power spectrograms are locally smoothed both in frequency as well as time domains. To enforce the local smoothness, we incorporate the Markov Random Field (MRF) model in the form of the Gibbs prior to the complete data likelihood function. The simulations demonstrate that this approach considerably improves the separation results.

A novel generative model is proposed to describe the generic audio document categories and solve the GADC problem. This model is a four-level hierarchical model in which two latent variables "audio topic" and "audio word" are introduced in addition to the two observed variables category and audio feature. We present an iterative learning algorithm including two Expectation-Maximization (EM) cycles to estimate the model parameters and give a discriminative document weighting procedure to make the model more discriminative. Subsequently, the distribution of "audio topic" in the well-trained model is utilized to represent each generic audio document category. This is same with some bag-of-word methods. However, our method is advanced since it does not require quantizing the continuous audio features to a vocabulary of "audio words". Finally, experiment results show the effectiveness of our approach.

We design a Dual Repeated Weighted Boosting Search (DRWBS) scheme for joint channel estimation and MUD, which is capable of providing 'soft' outputs, directly fed to the Forward Error Correction (FEC) decoder. The proposed scheme reduces the complexity of the receiver, since it integrates the channel estimation and MUD into a single module and it forwards the Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs) to the channel decoder. It also provides an effective solution to the multi-user MIMO channel estimation and MUD problem in "rank-deficient" scenarios, when the number of users is higher than the number of receiver antennas. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is capable of attaining a BER performace close to the ideal scenario of the Maximum Likelihood (ML) MUD associated with perfect channel knowledge.

J	Zhang, RC; Tran, T				Zhang, Richong; Tran, Thomas			A Helpfulness Modeling Framework for Electronic Word-of-Mouth on Consumer Opinion Platforms	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Algorithms; Measurement; Ranking; recommender systems; online product reviews		Electronic Word-of-Mouth (eWOM) is growing exponentially with the rapid development of electronic commerce. As a result, consumers are increasingly crowded by a huge amount of eWOM contents and therefore there is a need to automatically recommend eWOM contents that are helpful to them. Existing helpfulness assessment approaches that deterministically estimate the helpfulness of eWOM contents lack a generative formulation and are limited to the training set that has been voted by many readers. This article presents a rigorous probabilistic framework for inferring the "helpfulness" of eWOM contents which can build a "helpfulness" model from a low number of votes on eWOM contents. Furthermore, we introduce a measurement, "helpfulness" bias, as the benchmark for the "helpfulness" of eWOM documents. We also propose a model that exploits the graphical model and expectation maximization algorithm, under this probabilistic framework, to demonstrate the versatility of our framework. Our algorithm is compared experimentally to other existing helpfulness discovering algorithms and the experimental results show that our framework can effectively model the helpfulness of eWOM contents better than other approaches, and therefore indicate the capability of our framework to recommend helpful eWOMs to potential consumers.

Firstly, we define a generalized multiresolution likelihood ratio (GMLR), which classifies different kinds of signals more accurately than classical likelihood ratio by fusing more and different signal features. For our SAR image segmentation application, multiresolution stochastic structure inherent in SAR imagery is well captured by a set of multiscale autoregressive (MAR) models. Secondly, good parameter estimates of GMLR can be obtained by estimating several MMARP models using EM algorithm. Thirdly, considering the independence assumption of maximum likelihood estimation of parameter by EM algorithm and reduction of the segmentation time, we present the bootstrap sampling techniques applied above algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm performs fairly well.

The novel technique of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm based on principal component analysis (PCA) with adaptively selecting dominant factors for color image segmentation in color spaces is studied here. And simultaneously, the final segmentation is completed by a simple labeling scheme. Then the comparative study of the refined EM algorithm is done in multiple color spaces. The experimental results from Berkeley segmentation dataset, illustrate that the improved EM algorithm with or without PCA has good segmentation results with fine adaptability in RGB, CIE XYZ, HSV, YCbCr, and YIQ(NTSC) color spaces where the results of test image changes little. Moreover, the optimized EM algorithm without PCA usually has better segmentation than the one with PCA. Nevertheless, these color spaces, i.e. CIE L*a*b*, and h1h2h3, usually produce poor segmentation on the reliability and accuracy of a set of test images by performance analysis with subjective and objective evaluation indicators.

It could distinguish inliers from outliers and learn a vector field fitting for the inliers simultaneously. A prior is taken to force the smoothness of the field, which is based on the Tiknonov regularization in vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Under a Bayesian framework, we associate each sample with a latent variable which indicates whether it is an inlier, and then formulate the problem as maximum a posteriori problem and use Expectation Maximization algorithm to solve it. The proposed method possesses two characteristics: 1) robust to outliers, and being able to tolerate 90% outliers and even more, 2) computationally efficient. As an application, we apply VFC to solve the problem of mismatch removing. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms many state-of-the-art methods, and it is very robust.

Multi-Scale Analysis of Long Range Dependent Traffic for Anomaly Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks	2011 50TH IEEE CONFERENCE ON DECISION AND CONTROL AND EUROPEAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (CDC-ECC)			English	Proceedings Paper	50th IEEE Conference of Decision and Control (CDC)/European Control Conference (ECC)	DEC 12-15, 2011	Orlando, FL	Honeywell, MathWorks, United Technol Res Ctr, HYCON2, IEEE, Contrl Syst Soc (CSS), EUCA				Anomaly detection is important for the correct functioning of wireless sensor networks. Recent studies have shown that node mobility along with spatial correlation of the monitored phenomenon in sensor networks can lead to observation data that have long range dependency, which could significantly increase the difficulty of anomaly detection. In this paper, we develop an anomaly detection scheme based on multi-scale analysis of the long range dependent traffic to address this challenge. In this proposed detection scheme, discrete wavelet transform is used to approximately de-correlate the traffic data and capture data characteristics in different time scales. The remaining dependencies are then captured by a multi-level hidden Markov model in the wavelet domain. To estimate the model parameters, we propose an online discounting Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, which also tracks variations of the estimated models over time. Network anomalies are detected as abrupt changes in the tracked model variation scores. We evaluate our detection scheme numerically using typical long range dependent time series.

A Robust Collaborative Filtering Algorithm Using Ordered Logistic Regression	2011 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS (ICC)	IEEE International Conference on Communications		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	JUN 05-09, 2011	Kyoto, JAPAN	IEEE, IEEE Commun Soc, IEICE Commun Soc, Sci Council Japan				The Internet offers tremendous opportunities for information sharing and content distribution. However, without proper filtering and selection, the large amount of information may likely swarm the users rather than benefit them. Collaborative filtering is a technique for extracting useful information from the large information pool generated by interconnected online communities. In this paper, we develop a probabilistic collaborative filtering algorithm, which is based on ordered logistic regression and takes into account both similarities among the users and similarities among the items. We make inference with maximum likelihood and Bayesian frameworks, and propose a Markov Chain Monte Carlo based Expectation Maximization algorithm to optimize model parameters. The power of our proposed algorithm is its extensibility. We show that it can incorporate content and contextual information. More importantly, it can be easily extended to include the trustworthiness of users, thus being more robust to malicious data manipulation. The experimental results on a real world data set show that our proposed algorithm with the trust extension is robust under different types of attacks in recommendation systems.

J	Zhou, H; Lange, K				Zhou, Hua; Lange, Kenneth			A fast procedure for calculating importance weights in bootstrap sampling	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Importance resampling; Bootstrap; Majorization; Quasi-Newton acceleration	EM ALGORITHM; REGRESSION; ACCELERATION	Importance sampling is an efficient strategy for reducing the variance of certain bootstrap estimates. It has found wide applications in bootstrap quantile estimation, proportional hazards regression, bootstrap confidence interval estimation, and other problems. Although estimation of the optimal sampling weights is a special case of convex programming, generic optimization methods are frustratingly slow on problems with large numbers of observations. For instance, interior point and adaptive barrier methods must cope with forming, storing, and inverting the Hessian of the objective function. In this paper, we present an efficient procedure for calculating the optimal importance weights and compare its performance to standard optimization methods on a representative data set. The procedure combines several potent ideas for large-scale optimization. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we propose a method based on bayesian networks to realize the fault diagnosis of systems with incomplete sample data. Our method uses the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the missing part of incomplete sample data, then selects the features based on the mutual information technique, and finally, constructs the bayesian network classifier to achieve the fault diagnosis of systems. We used the Tennessee Eastman Process as the simulation model, and analyzed the diagnostic performance under different degrees of missing data.

Haplotype association analyses in resources of mixed structure using Monte Carlo testing	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							AUTOMATIC GENOTYPE ELIMINATION; CANDIDATE-GENE ASSOCIATION; PEDIGREE DATA; CASE/PSEUDOCONTROL ANALYSIS; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; FREQUENCY ESTIMATION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; DIABETES-MELLITUS; RELATIVE RISKS; ALGORITHM	Background: Genomewide association studies have resulted in a great many genomic regions that are likely to harbor disease genes. Thorough interrogation of these specific regions is the logical next step, including regional haplotype studies to identify risk haplotypes upon which the underlying critical variants lie. Pedigrees ascertained for disease can be powerful for genetic analysis due to the cases being enriched for genetic disease. Here we present a Monte Carlo based method to perform haplotype association analysis. Our method, hapMC, allows for the analysis of full-length and sub-haplotypes, including imputation of missing data, in resources of nuclear families, general pedigrees, case-control data or mixtures thereof. Both traditional association statistics and transmission/disequilibrium statistics can be performed. The method includes a phasing algorithm that can be used in large pedigrees and optional use of pseudocontrols. Results: Our new phasing algorithm substantially outperformed the standard expectation-maximization algorithm that is ignorant of pedigree structure, and hence is preferable for resources that include pedigree structure. Through simulation we show that our Monte Carlo procedure maintains the correct type 1 error rates for all resource types. Power comparisons suggest that transmission-disequilibrium statistics are superior for performing association in resources of only nuclear families. For mixed structure resources, however, the newly implemented pseudocontrol approach appears to be the best choice. Results also indicated the value of large high-risk pedigrees for association analysis, which, in the simulations considered, were comparable in power to case-control resources of the same sample size. Conclusions: We propose hapMC as a valuable new tool to perform haplotype association analyses, particularly for resources of mixed structure. The availability of meta-association and haplotype-mining modules in our suite of Monte Carlo haplotype procedures adds further value to the approach.

Efficient algorithms for training the parameters of hidden Markov models using stochastic expectation maximization (EM) training and Viterbi training	ALGORITHMS FOR MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article							AB-INITIO PREDICTION; GENE PREDICTION; PAIR HMMS; GENOMES; SEQUENCES	Background: Hidden Markov models are widely employed by numerous bioinformatics programs used today. Applications range widely from comparative gene prediction to time-series analyses of micro-array data. The parameters of the underlying models need to be adjusted for specific data sets, for example the genome of a particular species, in order to maximize the prediction accuracy. Computationally efficient algorithms for parameter training are thus key to maximizing the usability of a wide range of bioinformatics applications. Results: We introduce two computationally efficient training algorithms, one for Viterbi training and one for stochastic expectation maximization (EM) training, which render the memory requirements independent of the sequence length. Unlike the existing algorithms for Viterbi and stochastic EM training which require a two-step procedure, our two new algorithms require only one step and scan the input sequence in only one direction. We also implement these two new algorithms and the already published linear-memory algorithm for EM training into the hidden Markov model compiler HMM-CONVERTER and examine their respective practical merits for three small example models. Conclusions: Bioinformatics applications employing hidden Markov models can use the two algorithms in order to make Viterbi training and stochastic EM training more computationally efficient. Using these algorithms, parameter training can thus be attempted for more complex models and longer training sequences. The two new algorithms have the added advantage of being easier to implement than the corresponding default algorithms for Viterbi training and stochastic EM training.

J	Chatzis, SP				Chatzis, Sotirios P.			Hidden Markov Models with Nonelliptically Contoured State Densities	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Hidden Markov models; multivariate normal inverse Gaussian (MNIG) distribution; expectation-maximization; sequential data modeling	INVERSE GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTIONS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; SKEW-NORMAL-DISTRIBUTION; STATISTICAL PROPERTIES; T-DISTRIBUTION; ALGORITHM	Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are a popular approach for modeling sequential data comprising continuous attributes. In such applications, the observation emission densities of the HMM hidden states are typically modeled by means of elliptically contoured distributions, usually multivariate Gaussian or Student's-t densities. However, elliptically contoured distributions cannot sufficiently model heavy-tailed or skewed populations which are typical in many fields, such as the financial and the communication signal processing domain. Employing finite mixtures of such elliptically contoured distributions to model the HMM state densities is a common approach for the amelioration of these issues. Nevertheless, the nature of the modeled data often requires postulation of a large number of mixture components for each HMM state, which might have a negative effect on both model efficiency and the training data set's size required to avoid overfitting. To resolve these issues, in this paper, we advocate for the utilization of a nonelliptically contoured distribution, the multivariate normal inverse Gaussian (MNIG) distribution, for modeling the observation densities of HMMs. As we experimentally demonstrate, our selection allows for more effective modeling of skewed and heavy-tailed populations in a simple and computationally efficient manner.

The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is introduced to derive the maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) of the parameters of the DTHMM. Based on the derived DTHMM, the Viterbi algorithm is introduced to predict the controller-to-actuator (C-A) delay during the current sampling period. The simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the modelling and predicting methods proposed.

For this purpose, the monthly and annual total precipitation records at stations operated by Turkish State Meteorological Service (DMI) from 1968 to 1998 were considered. In these stations, precipitation records for each month was investigated separately and the stations with missing values for too many years were eliminated. The missing values of the stations were completed by Expectation Maximization (EM) method by using the precipitation records of the nearest gauging station. In this analysis, 38 stations were eliminated because they had missing values for more than 5 years, 161 stations had no missing values and missing precipitation values were completed in the remaining 68 stations. By this analysis, annual total precipitation data were obtained by using the monthly values. These data should be hydrologically and statistically reliable for later hydrological, meteorological, climate change modelling and forecasting studies. For this reason, Standard Normal Homogeneity Test (SNHT), (Swed Eisenhart) Runs Test and Pettitt homogeneity tests were applied for the annual total precipitation data at 229 gauging stations from 1968 to 1998. The results of each of the testing methods were evaluated separately at a significance level of 95% and the inhomogeneous years were determined. With the application of the aforementioned methods, inhomogeneity was detected at 50 stations of which the natural structure was deteriorated and 179 stations were found to be homogeneous.

The method is based on estimating the multivariate probability distribution of the original microdata, which are supposed to be discrete or discretized continuous. The estimated statistical model in the form of a distribution mixture of product components can be used as a knowledge base of a probabilistic expert system. By means of the probabilistic inference mechanism we can derive conditional distributions of variables for each subpopulation interactively without any further access to the source database. The conditional distributions (histograms) describing the properties of subpopulations represent the basic form of user information. The statistical model does not contain the original data and therefore can be distributed without any confidentiality concerns. The accuracy achievable by the statistical model is comparable with that of the anonymized subsets of microdata.

J	Huang, SA; Pan, R; Li, J				Huang, Shuai; Pan, Rong; Li, Jing			A Graphical Technique and Penalized Likelihood Method for Identifying and Estimating Infant Failures	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY			English	Article						Expectation maximization; infant mortality; mixture detection plot; mixture distribution	WEIBULL-DISTRIBUTIONS; MIXTURE	Field failure data often exhibit extra heterogeneity as early failure data may have quite different distribution characteristics from later failure data. These infant failures may come from a defective subpopulation instead of the normal product population. Many exiting methods for field failure analyses focus only on the estimation for a hypothesized mixture model, while the model identification is ignored. This paper aims to develop efficient, accurate methods for both detecting data heterogeneity, and estimating mixture model parameters. Mixture distribution detection is achieved by applying a mixture detection plot (MDP) on field failure observations. The penalized likelihood method, and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm are then used for estimating the components in the mixture model. Two field datasets are employed to demonstrate and validate the proposed approach.

Most of this work focuses on how to share social networks owned by organizations without revealing the identities or the sensitive relationships of the users involved. Not much attention has been given to the privacy risk of users posed by their daily information-sharing activities. In this article, we approach the privacy issues raised in online social networks from the individual users' viewpoint: we propose a framework to compute the privacy score of a user. This score indicates the user's potential risk caused by his or her participation in the network. Our definition of privacy score satisfies the following intuitive properties: the more sensitive information a user discloses, the higher his or her privacy risk. Also, the more visible the disclosed information becomes in the network, the higher the privacy risk. We develop mathematical models to estimate both sensitivity and visibility of the information. We apply our methods to synthetic and real-world data and demonstrate their efficacy and practical utility.

Global registration and moving objects detection in noisy airborne image sequences	OPTICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						image motion estimation and global registration; EM algorithm; least-squares estimation; affine motion; maximum likelihood detection	MOTION ESTIMATION	This paper presents a method for registration of noisy airborne images for the purpose of the detection of moving objects. A new iterative algorithm is developed and presented for the correction of geometrical distortion caused by global motion in a scene. A binary hypotheses test is subsequently established using a likelihood ratio test (LRT) to classify the pixels in the corrected image as either locally moving (object motion) or not moving (stationary). The paper also incorporates the use of the Expectation-Maximization method for estimation of statistical image features needed by the LRT. We use and present experiments with real image sequences to validate the analytical developments. (C) 2010 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

Encoding of brain state changes in local field potentials modulated by motor behaviors	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Local field potentials; Motor system; State-space estimation	EM ALGORITHM; MOVEMENT; OSCILLATIONS; MODELS; CORTEX	Local field potentials (LFPs) measure aggregate neural activity resulting from the coordinated firing of neurons within a local network. We hypothesized that state parameters associated with the underlying brain dynamics may be encoded in LFPs but may not be directly measurable in the signal temporal and spectral contents. Using the Kalman filter we estimated latent state changes in LFPs recorded in monkey motor cortical areas during the execution of a visually instructed reaching task, under different applied force conditions. Prior to the estimation, matched filtering was performed to decouple behavior-relevant signals (Stamoulis and Richardson, J Comput Neurosci, 2009) from unrelated background oscillations. State changes associated with baseline oscillations appeared insignificant. In contrast, state changes estimated from LFP components associated with the execution of movement were significant. Approximately direction-invariant state vectors were consistently observed. Their patterns appeared invariant also to force field conditions, with a peak in the first 200 ms of the movement interval, but exponentially decreasing to the zero state approximately 200 ms from movement onset, also the time at which movement velocity reached its peak. Thus, state appeared to be modulated by the dynamics of movement but neither by movement direction nor by the mechanical environment. Finally, we compared state vectors estimated using the Kalman filter to the basis functions obtained through Principal Component Analysis. The pattern of the estimated state vector was very similar to that of the first PCA component, further suggesting that LFPs may directly encode brain state fluctuations associated with the dynamics of behavior.

However, it has two major problems. First, the imaging signals are very noisy. Second, the observation data are only the fluorescence intensities of Ca(2+) indicator dyes that provide indirect information about the Ca(2+) concentration. We develop a nonlinear state-space model for Ca imaging series involving Ca(2+) kinetics and a noisy fluorescence intensity pickup process. We devise recursive update algorithms for estimating the Ca(2+) concentration and Ca(2+) flux, and give the expectation-maximization algorithm for inferring model parameters.

Each simple classifier is termed a local "expert", and the number of experts and their construction are manifested via a Dirichlet process formulation. The simple form of the "experts" allows analytical handling of incomplete data. The model is extended to allow simultaneous design of classifiers on multiple data sets, termed multi-task learning, with this also performed non-parametrically via the Dirichlet process. Fast inference is performed using variational Bayesian (VB) analysis, and example results are presented for several data sets. We also perform inference via Gibbs sampling, to which we compare the VB results.

Instead of the usual Gaussian random effect model, our method uses the multivariate t-distribution model which has better robustness to outliers and noise. In our method, we use the B-spline curve to model curve data and apply the mixed-effects model to capture the randomness and covariance of all curves within the same cluster. After fitting the B-spline-based mixed-effects model to the proposed multivariate t-distribution, we derive an expectation-maximization algorithm for estimating the parameters of the model, and apply the proposed approach to the simulated data and the real dataset. The experimental results show that our model yields better clustering results when compared to the conventional Gaussian random effect model.

J	Zhang, YA; Bao, LC; Yang, SH; Welling, M; Wu, D				Zhang, Yuan; Bao, Lichun; Yang, Shih-Hsien; Welling, Max; Wu, Di			Localization Algorithms for Wireless Sensor Retrieval	COMPUTER JOURNAL			English	Article						localization; expectation maximization; Gaussian mixture model; path loss model	NETWORKS	In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), localization has many important applications, among which wireless sensor retrieval bears special importance for cost saving, data analysis and security purposes. Localization for sensor retrieval is especially challenging due to the fact that the number and locations of these sensors are both unknown. In this paper, we propose two probabilistic localization algorithms that iteratively identify the locations of multiple wireless sensors in WSNs, one of which calculates location information offline, and the other online. In both algorithms, we implement a two-step localization process - the first step is called Grid-LEGMM (grid location estimation based on the Gaussian mixture model), a coarse-grain location search using grids by choosing the proper number and locations of the wireless sensors that maximize a likelihood estimation, and the second step is called EM-LEGMM (expectation maximization based on the Gaussian mixture model), which uses the EM-method to refine the results of Grid-LEGMM. An additional step in the online localization algorithm is a credit-based filtering mechanism that removes spurious sensor locations. The performance of both offline and online localization algorithms are analyzed using the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB), and evaluated using simulations and real testbed experiments.

The polarization diversity of the remote scene provides additional information for successfully recovering a two-dimensional image from noisy autocorrelations obtained from laser speckle patterns or pupil plane images. The proposed system may be used to characterize space-borne objects and debris with an earth-based sensor array.

J	Calo, DG; Viroli, C				Calo, Daniela G.; Viroli, Cinzia			A dimensionally reduced finite mixture model for multilevel data	JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS			English	Article						Cluster analysis; Factor mixture model; Dimension reduction; EM-algorithm; Multilevel latent class analysis	LATENT CLASS; DATA SETS	Recently, different mixture models have been proposed for multilevel data, generally requiring the local independence assumption. In this work, this assumption is relaxed by allowing each mixture component at the lower level of the hierarchical structure to be modeled according to a multivariate Gaussian distribution with a non-diagonal covariance matrix. For high-dimensional problems, this solution can lead to highly parameterized models. In this proposal, the trade-off between model parsimony and flexibility is governed by assuming a latent factor generative model. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Of interest to us is the key role played by the EM algorithm during this transformation. We survey the use of the EM algorithm in a few important computational biology problems surrounding the "central dogma" of molecular biology: from DNA to RNA and then to proteins. Topics of this article include sequence motif discovery, protein sequence alignment, population genetics, evolutionary models and mRNA expression microarray data analysis.

Marginal likelihood inference for a model for item responses and response times	BRITISH JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; EM ALGORITHM; BAYESIAN-ESTIMATION; FIT ANALYSIS; IRT MODELS; PARAMETERS; ACCURACY; SPEED; TESTS	Marginal maximum-likelihood procedures for parameter estimation and testing the fit of a hierarchical model for speed and accuracy on test items are presented. The model is a composition of two first-level models for dichotomous responses and response times along with multivariate normal models for their item and person parameters. It is shown how the item parameters can easily be estimated using Fisher's identity. To test the fit of the model, Lagrange multiplier tests of the assumptions of subpopulation invariance of the item parameters (i.e., no differential item functioning), the shape of the response functions, and three different types of conditional independence were derived. Simulation studies were used to show the feasibility of the estimation and testing procedures and to estimate the power and Type I error rate of the latter. In addition, the procedures were applied to an empirical data set from a computerized adaptive test of language comprehension.	[Glas, Cees A.

This distribution helps to investigate quality of water with respect to its physical characterization. The analysis is conducted using the two-step density estimation method. The first step of the method is based on parametric density estimation and uses a modification of the EM algorithm to a normal mixture model. In the second step we apply the generalized kernel density estimator, being the convex combination of the well-known kernel density estimators. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Methods: The proposed algorithm was composed of two essential ideas. One was decomposing the region of interest (ROI) into foreground and background regions by a cell-based segmentation algorithm, called constrained fuzzy cell-based bipartition-EM (CFCB-EM) algorithm. The CFCB-EM algorithm deformed the contour in a fuzzy cell-based deformation fashion with the cell structures derived by the fuzzy cell competition (FCC) algorithm as the deformation unit and the boundary estimated by the normalized cut (NC) algorithm as the reference contour. The other was modeling the intensity inhomogeneity in an ROI as a spatially variant normal distribution with a constant variance and spatially variant means, which formed a polynomial surface of order n. The proposed algorithm was formulated as a nested EM algorithm comprising the outer-layer EM algorithm, i.e., the intensity inhomogeneity correction-EM (IIC-EM) algorithm, and the inner-layer EM algorithm, i.e., the CFCB-EM algorithm. The E step of the IIC-EM algorithm was to provide a reasonably good bipartition separating the ROI into foreground and background regions, which included three major component algorithms, namely, the FCC, the NC, and the CFCB-EM. The M step of the IIC-EM algorithm was to estimate and correct the intensity inhomogeneity field by least-squared fitting the intensity inhomogeneity to an nth order polynomial surface. Forty-nine breast sonograms with intensity inhomogeneity, each from a different subject, were randomly selected for performance analysis. Three assessments were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Results: Based on the visual evaluation of two experienced radiologists, in the first assessment, 46 out of 49 breast lesions were considered to have better contrasts on the inhomogeneity-corrected images by both radiologists. The interrater reliability for the radiologists was found to be kappa =0.479 (p=0.001). In the second assessment, the mean gradients of the low-gradient boundary points before and after correction of the intensity inhomogeneity were compared by the paired t-test, yielding a p-value of 0.000, which suggested the proposed intensity inhomogeneity algorithm may enhance the mean gradient of the low-gradient boundary points. By using the paired t-test, the third assessment further showed that the Chan and Vese level set method could derive a much better lesion boundary on the inhomogeneity-corrected image than on the original image (p=0.000). Conclusions: The proposed intensity inhomogeneity correction algorithm could not only augment the visibility of lesion boundary but also improve the segmentation result on a breast sonogram.

The primary objective concerns the connection between parameter expansion and efficient inference. It reviews the statistical interpretation of the PX-EM algorithm, in terms of efficient inference via bias reduction, and further unfolds the PX-EM mystery by looking at PX-EM from different perspectives. In addition, it briefly discusses potential applications of parameter expansion to statistical inference and the broader impact of statistical thinking on understanding and developing other iterative optimization algorithms.

J	Magalhaes, J; Ruger, S				Magalhaes, Joao; Rueger, Stefan			An Information-Theoretic Framework for Semantic-Multimedia Retrieval	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Algorithms; Measurement; Experimentation; Indexing; search; multimedia; automated keyword annotation	CLASSIFICATION	This article is set in the context of searching text and image repositories by keyword. We develop a unified probabilistic framework for text, image, and combined text and image retrieval that is based on the detection of keywords (concepts) using automated image annotation technology. Our framework is deeply rooted in information theory and lends itself to use with other media types. We estimate a statistical model in a multimodal feature space for each possible query keyword. The key element of our framework is to identify feature space transformations that make them comparable in complexity and density. We select the optimal multimodal feature space with a minimum description length criterion from a set of candidate feature spaces that are computed with the average-mutual-information criterion for the text part and hierarchical expectation maximization for the visual part of the data. We evaluate our approach in three retrieval experiments (only text retrieval, only image retrieval, and text combined with image retrieval), verify the framework's low computational complexity, and compare with existing state-of-the-art ad-hoc models.

The difficulties lie in the uncertainties in both target motion mode and target appearance, and the nonlinearity in the observation process when the images are treated as measurements directly. This paper presents a robust tracking algorithm to cope with these difficulties. We propose a mixture observation model, which can describe both the gradual intensity variation and sudden disappearance of target pixels, and use an online EM algorithm to update the model parameters. Target is racked with the interacting multiple model particle filter (IMM-PF), where the proposed adaptive observation model is used to assign weights to the particles based on current measurement. The problems of the simultaneous update of target state and observation model and calculation of motion model likelihood are investigated. Moreover, particle number adaptation is introduced to improve the efficiency and robustness of the algorithm. Finally, we extend the algorithm to multiple targets tracking by introducing a likelihood function based on the probabilistic: exclusion principle. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm.

Block-Conditional Missing at Random Models for Missing Data	STATISTICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Block-sequential missing data models; block-conditional MAR models; EM algorithm; categorical data	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; PATTERN-MIXTURE-MODELS; CONTINGENCY-TABLES; INCOMPLETE DATA; NONRESPONSE MODELS; NONCOMPLIANCE; ALGORITHM; RESPONSES; SELECTION; SUBJECT	Two major ideas in the analysis of missing data are (a) the EM algorithm [Dempster, Laird and Rubin, J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 39 (1977) 1-38] for maximum likelihood (ML) estimation, and (b) the formulation of models for the joint distribution of the data Z and missing data indicators M, and associated "missing at random" (MAR) condition under which a model for M is unnecessary [ Rubin, Biometrika 63 (1976) 581-592]. Most previous work has treated Z and M as single blocks, yielding selection or pattern-mixture models depending on how their joint distribution is factorized. This paper explores "block-sequential" models that interleave subsets of the variables and their missing data indicators, and then make parameter restrictions based on assumptions in each block. These include models that are not MAR. We examine a subclass of block-sequential models we call block-conditional MAR (BCMAR) models, and an associated block-monotone reduced likelihood strategy that typically yields consistent estimates by selectively discarding some data. Alternatively, full ML estimation can often be achieved via the EM algorithm. We examine in some detail BCMAR models for the case of two multinomially distributed categorical variables, and a two block structure where the first block is categorical and the second block arises from a (possibly multivariate) exponential family distribution.

Graphical models for inferring single molecule dynamics	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							RESONANCE ENERGY-TRANSFER; HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; RIBOSOMAL L1 STALK; SPECTROSCOPIC RULER; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; FRET DATA; FLUORESCENCE; ALGORITHM; TRANSLATION; ELONGATION	Background: The recent explosion of experimental techniques in single molecule biophysics has generated a variety of novel time series data requiring equally novel computational tools for analysis and inference. This article describes in general terms how graphical modeling may be used to learn from biophysical time series data using the variational Bayesian expectation maximization algorithm (VBEM). The discussion is illustrated by the example of single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) versus time data, where the smFRET time series is modeled as a hidden Markov model (HMM) with Gaussian observables. A detailed description of smFRET is provided as well. Results: The VBEM algorithm returns the model's evidence and an approximating posterior parameter distribution given the data. The former provides a metric for model selection via maximum evidence (ME), and the latter a description of the model's parameters learned from the data. ME/VBEM provide several advantages over the more commonly used approach of maximum likelihood (ML) optimized by the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, the most important being a natural form of model selection and a well-posed (non-divergent) optimization problem. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the utility of graphical modeling for inference of dynamic processes in single molecule biophysics.

At the receiver, a turbo-detector composed of a maximum a posteriori (MAP) equaliser and a MAP decoder is used. We give the expression of the MAP iterative burst-by-burst channel estimation algorithm using the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm. Since the obtained algorithm is complex, we propose to simplify it by neglecting the inter-symbol interference (ISI) term. In order to reduce the error caused by this simplification, we propose to use a candidate precoder at the transmitter chosen among a given set of precoders such that the selected precoded sequence leads to the minimum mean square value of the ISI neglected term. Simulations show that the performance of the approximate algorithm with precoding are almost similar to the performance of the exact algorithm. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The proposed approach is based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and an electromagnetism-like mechanism (EM) algorithm An ANN is used to build a system response function model. The performance measures, signal to-noise ratio (SNR), and sensitivity used by Taguchi are then integrated by exponential desirability functions to formulate an objective function of the system An EM algorithm then obtarus the optimal factor settings through the response function model.

The method is an extension of earlier work for models that are linear in parameters to non-linear multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). We used an EM algorithm combined with variational approximation, an evidence procedure, and an optimisation algorithm. The technique was tested on two forecasting applications. The first one is a synthetic dataset and the second is gas forward contract prices data from the UK energy market. The results showed that forecasting accuracy is significantly improved by using Student-t noise models. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

EM Algorithm for Estimating the Burr XII Parameters with Multiple Censored Data	QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Burr XII distribution; EM algorithm; maximum likelihood estimation; multiple censored data	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; DISTRIBUTIONS	The two-parameter Burr XII distribution has been widely used in various practical applications such as business, chemical engineering, quality control, medical research and reliability engineering. In this paper, we present maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the Burr XII parameters with multiple censored data. We also provide a method that can be used to construct the confidence intervals of the parameters, a method that computes the asymptotic variance and the covariance of the MLE from the complete and missing information matrices. A simulation study is conducted to compare the performance of the MLE via the EM algorithm and the Netwon-Raphson (NR) algorithm. The simulation results show that the EM algorithm outperforms the NR algorithm in most cases in terms of bias and errors in the root mean square. A numerical example is also used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	[Wang, F. K.; Cheng, Y.

First, fast EM iteration algorithm based on histogram of image difference in each band was used to obtain the change class threshold and change information. Second, the fuzzy theory and relationship matrix were adopted to integrate the classification information of all bands, and the final changed and unchanged map of the bitemporal remote sensing images were obtained. Thus, the change detection image was formed. The real bitemporal SPOTS and Landsat TM satellite imagery were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method reduces the processing time and gets better detection effectiveness comparing with other methods.

A semi-nonparametric mixture model for selecting functionally consistent proteins	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							ANTIBODY MICROARRAY; GENE-EXPRESSION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; PROSTATE-CANCER; EM ALGORITHM; IDENTIFICATION; BIOMARKERS; DISCOVERY; AGREEMENT; ISSUES	Background: High-throughput technologies have led to a new era of proteomics. Although protein microarray experiments are becoming more common place there are a variety of experimental and statistical issues that have yet to be addressed, and that will carry over to new high-throughput technologies unless they are investigated. One of the largest of these challenges is the selection of functionally consistent proteins. Results: We present a novel semi-nonparametric mixture model for classifying proteins as consistent or inconsistent while controlling the false discovery rate and the false non-discovery rate. The performance of the proposed approach is compared to current methods via simulation under a variety of experimental conditions. Conclusions: We provide a statistical method for selecting functionally consistent proteins in the context of protein microarray experiments, but the proposed semi-nonparametric mixture model method can certainly be generalized to solve other mixture data problems. The main advantage of this approach is that it provides the posterior probability of consistency for each protein.	[Doerge, R.

J	Daouk, J; Bailly, P; Fin, L; Meyer, ME				Daouk, Joel; Bailly, Pascal; Fin, Loic; Meyer, Marc-Etienne			Preliminary clinical applications of a device-dedicated whole-body positron emission tomography reconstruction method: impact on standardized uptake values	NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						(18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed; tomography; image reconstruction; quantitation; standardized uptake value	ITERATIVE RECONSTRUCTION; F-18-FDG PET/CT; LUNG-CANCER; DEFINITION; ONCOLOGY; SCANNER; NOISE	Background (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography has proven relevance in oncological diagnosis, staging and follow-up. The standardized uptake value (SUV) is one of the most widely used semi-quantitative criteria in PET imaging. However, factors such as noise and image resolution affect the measurement of the SUV. We reported earlier that a device-dedicated projector [attenuation-weighted ordered-subsets expectation maximization detector response (AW-OSEM DR), based on point-source measurements] introduces less noise than a geometrical model (AW-OSEM). Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the AW-OSEM DR method's impact on SUV measurements under clinical conditions. Methods We first performed a bias analysis to assess the accuracy of the quantitation for the two reconstruction methods as a function of target size and the number of iterations, with 14 acquisitions of the NEMA IEC/2001 phantom. We then used each method to calculate the maximum and average SUVs, respectively for 32 lesions. Results For all spheres and all iterations, the bias was significantly lower with AW-OSEM DR than with AW-OSEM (P = 0.012). Moreover, a paired Student's t-test showed significant intermethod differences for maximum SUV and average SUV (both P < 0.001) in cancer patients. Conversely, the two methods did not differ significantly in terms of the mean SUV and signal-to-noise ratio calculated in the liver for each patient (P = 0.5 and 0.08, respectively). Conclusion Phantom and patient studies were performed to quantify the effects of AW-OSEM DR on PET images.

Here we consider a batch marking experiment where the full likelihood is complex and without resorting to devices such as the computationally intensive expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is intractable. However, a pseudo-likelihood that yields tractable estimating equations may be easily constructed and its effectiveness is demonstrated via simulation studies. The methodology was applied to study the abundance of Oriental weatherloach in a waterbody in South-Eastern Australia.

Such distributions were introduced by Dryden and Mardia (1991) and represent an important parameterized family of shape distributions for shape analysis. This article reports a method for performing maximum likelihood estimation of parameters involved. The method consists of an EM algorithm with simple update rules and is shown to be easily applicable in many practical examples. We also show the necessary adjustments needed for using this algorithm for shape regression, missing landmark data, and mixtures of offset-normal shape distributions.

J	Lu, Y; Wu, HY; Zhou, L; Wu, ZY				Lue, Yong; Wu, Haiyang; Zhou, Lin; Wu, Zhenyang			Multi-environment model adaptation based on vector Taylor series for robust speech recognition	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Model adaptation; Vector Taylor series; Multi-environment model; Speech recognition	FEATURE COMPENSATION; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; HMM ADAPTATION; NOISE; COMBINATION; FRAMEWORK	In this paper, we propose a multi-environment model adaptation method based on vector Taylor series (VTS) for robust speech recognition. In the training phase, the clean speech is contaminated with noise at different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels to produce several types of noisy training speech and each type is used to obtain a noisy hidden Markov model (HMM) set. In the recognition phase, the HMM set which best matches the testing environment is selected, and further adjusted to reduce the environmental mismatch by the VTS-based model adaptation method. In the proposed method, the VTS approximation based on noisy training speech is given and the testing noise parameters are estimated from the noisy testing speech using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The experimental results indicate that the proposed multi-environment model adaptation method can significantly improve the performance of speech recognizers and outperforms the traditional model adaptation method and the linear regression-based multi-environment method.

J	Mori, R; Suzuki, S				Mori, Ryota; Suzuki, Shinji			Modeling of Pilot Landing Approach Control Using Stochastic Switched Linear Regression Model	JOURNAL OF AIRCRAFT			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORK; RECOGNITION	Human pilot control during the landing approach is modeled using a stochastic switched model, which is a combination of the conventional linear regression model and a hidden Markov model. Using this model, the time histories of pilot control can be categorized in several states, such as pitch stabilizing mode. First, the selection of model inputs is discussed. Based on data obtained in flight simulator experiments, the pilot approach control model is constructed for several cases, with different wind conditions applying an expectation-maximization algorithm. The obtained models are analyzed with respect to the timing of state transitions and the stochastic-switched-model gain parameters. The current findings suggest that the proposed analysis method has a great potential to reveal a pilot's decision-making process.

Probing the existence of medium pulmonary crackles via model-based clustering	COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Pulmonary crackles; Coarse; Medium; Fine crackle types; EM clustering; BIC	WAVE-FORM; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; BREATH SOUNDS; HEART-FAILURE; EM ALGORITHM; LUNG SOUNDS; CLASSIFICATION	The objective of this study is to probe the existence of a third crackle type, medium, besides the traditionally accepted types, namely, fine and coarse crackles and, furthermore, to explore the representative parameter values for each crackle type. A set of clustering experiments have been conducted on pulmonary crackles to this end. A model-based clustering algorithm, the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, is used and the resulting cluster numbers are validated with Bayesian Inference Criterion. Four different feature sets are extracted from the preprocessed crackle samples, the first of which consists of conventional parameters derived from the zero-crossings of crackle waveforms. The second feature set corresponds to the spectral components of the crackles, whereas the remaining two sets are derived from a single- and double-nodes wavelet network modeling. The results of the clustering experiments demonstrate strong evidence for the existence of a third crackle type. Moreover the labels yielded by clustering experiments, using different feature sets match for roughly 80% or more of the crackle samples, resulting in similar representative crackle parameter values of the three clusters for all feature sets.

Thus, the detection of those cancer-causing mutations has received considerable interest in cancer genetic research. Here, we propose a statistical model for characterizing genes that lead to cancer through point mutations using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. The basic idea of the model is that mutated genes may be in high association with their nearby SNPs because of evolutionary forces. By genotyping SNPs in both normal and cancer cells, we formulate a polynomial likelihood to estimate the population genetic parameters related to cancer, such as allele frequencies of cancer-causing alleles, mutation rates of alleles derived from maternal or paternal parents, and zygotic linkage disequilibria between different loci after the mutation occurs. We implement the EM algorithm to estimate some of these parameters because of the missing information in the likelihood construction. The model allows the elegant tests of the significant associations between mutated cancer genes and genome-wide SNPs, thus providing a way for predicting the occurrence and formation of cancer with genetic information.

J	Sansom, J; Thomson, P				Sansom, John; Thomson, Peter			A hidden seasonal switching model for high-resolution breakpoint rainfall data	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							SEMI-MARKOV CHAINS; EM ALGORITHM; OBSERVED INFORMATION; MATRIX	A nonhomogeneous hidden semi-Markov model (NHSMM) for breakpoint rainfall data is proposed which extends the homogeneous hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) of Sansom and Thomson (2001) to incorporate stochastic seasonality. The NHSMM model is able to switch seasons at times that are earlier or later than expected and, in this way, is able to explain additional seasonal variability due to varying length seasons. The model's hidden rainfall states align with precipitation mechanisms that are seasonally invariant, but the state dynamics are assumed to vary with season. Recursions for constructing the likelihood are developed and the EM algorithm used to fit the parameters of the model. An application of the model to breakpoint rainfall measurements from Invercargill, New Zealand, is discussed, and the results of fitting a number of different NHSMMs are compared to those from fitting the non-seasonal homogeneous HSMM.

Joint EM channel and covariance estimation with sufficient-statistic chip combining for a SIMO MC-CDMA anti-jam system	EUROPEAN TRANSACTIONS ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS			English	Article								Joint iterative channel and covariance estimation with sufficient-statistic-based chip combining is studied for the downlink of a multicarrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) system operating under partial-band noise jamming (PBNJ). To estimate the channel and AWGN-plus-PBNJ covariance, we apply the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm which exploits the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) from the decoder. The proposed chip combiner guarantees no loss of information in the soft output generated by the demapper. In our approach, the channel estimator or the chip combiner only requires the AWGN-plus-PBNJ power of each subcarrier to suppress jamming. Therefore, significant complexity reduction is achieved because the receiver does not need to estimate the jammer state information (JSI) and individual variances of the AWGN and PBNJ on each subcarrier for chip combining. Simulation results show that the sufficient-statistic chip combiner always offers a smaller bit error rate (BER) than the minimum mean square error (MMSE) chip combiner provided that reliable estimates of the channel impulse response and noise-plus-jamming covariance are available.

However, most of these methods presume that the measurement matrix is completely known. We develop a new blind maximum likelihood method-the expectation-sparse-maximization (ESpaM) algorithm-for models where the measurement matrix is the product of one unknown and one known matrix. This method is a variant of the expectation-maximization algorithm to deal with the resulting problem that the maximization step is no longer unique. The ESpaM algorithm is justified theoretically. We present as well numerical results for two concrete examples of blind channel identification in digital communications, a doubly-selective channel model and linear time invariant sparse channel model.

J	Cho, BR; Choi, Y; Shin, S				Cho, Byung Rae; Choi, Yongsun; Shin, Sangmun			Development of censored data-based robust design for pharmaceutical quality by design	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Robust design; Mixture experiments; Pharmaceutical formulations; Censored data; Expectation-maximization algorithm; Maximum likelihood estimation	RESPONSE-SURFACE OPTIMIZATION; LINEAR MIXTURE-MODELS; TO-NOISE RATIOS; PARAMETER DESIGN; VARIABLES; TAGUCHI; OPTIMALITY	Robust design techniques, which are based on the concept of building quality into products or processes, are increasingly popular in many manufacturing industries. In this paper, we propose a new robust design model in the context of pharmaceutical production research and development. Traditional robust design principles have often been applied to situations in which the quality characteristics of interest are typically time insensitive. In pharmaceutical manufacturing processes, time-oriented quality characteristics, such as the degradation of a drug, are often of interest. As a result, current robust design models for quality improvement which have been studied in the literature may not be effective in finding robust design solutions. To address such practical needs, this paper develops a robust design model using censored data, which is perhaps the first attempt in the robust design field. We then study estimation methods, such as the expectation-maximization algorithm and the maximum likelihood method, in the robust design context. Finally, comparative studies are discussed for model verification via a numerical example.

Handling sparse data problems in the context of monitoring multiple parameters in complex systems	INSIGHT			English	Article							SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NOVELTY DETECTION; FAULT-DIAGNOSIS; EM ALGORITHM; STATISTICS; LIKELIHOOD	The notion of utilising models of normality for health monitoring applications is now well understood([1]). Robust models can be constructed from large volumes of normal data and then used as a reference to test for abnormality against new observed data. Such techniques have already proved to be very effective for monitoring individual parameters of complex systems([2,3,4]). The introduction of. extreme value theory (EVT)([5,6]), and its variant Bayesian EVT([7]) has also improved the mechanism for establishing novelty thresholds in situations where only small quantities of running data exist([8]). These thresholds are then allowed to adapt as additional data is observed and a more complete representation of the tails in the underlying distribution is understood. The focus of this paper is with the practical considerations of applying these ideas to the monitoring of multiple parameters of gas turbines. More specifically, our interest lies with the problem of establishing a corresponding multi-dimension novelty threshold for such complex systems during their early stages of running and hence when relatively little service data is available.

J	Poon, WY; Wang, HB				Poon, Wai-Yin; Wang, Hai-Bin			Analysis of a Two-Level Structural Equation Model With Missing Data	SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH			English	Article						structural equation model; multilevel research; missing data	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; COVARIANCE STRUCTURE-ANALYSIS; EM ALGORITHM; POLYTOMOUS DATA; GENERAL-MODEL; CONSTRUCTS; VARIABLES	Structural equation models are widely used to model relationships among latent unobservable constructs and observable variables. In some studies, the data set used for analysis is comprised of observations that are drawn from a known hierarchical structure and involves missing entries. A two-level structural equation model can be used to analyze such data sets. Direct maximum likelihood methods for analyzing two-level structural equation models are available in software, such as LISREL and Mplus. These software programs also have options to handle missing observations. The authors develop an alternative procedure that uses an expectation maximization (EM) type algorithm. Using appropriate approximations, the procedure can be implemented using simple statistical software in combination with a basic structural equation modeling program. The authors address the implementation of the procedure in detail and provide syntax codes in R, which is available in the public domain, to implement the proposed procedure. The discussion of the procedure is made with reference to the analysis of a data set that studies job characteristic variables. The authors also use simulation studies to examine the performance of the proposed procedure. The results indicate that the proposed method, which is easily accessible to users, represents a reliable alternative for analyzing two-level structural equation models with missing data.

From videos acquired by an uncalibrated stationary camera, we first recover the vanishing line and the vertical point of the scene based upon tracking moving objects that primarily lie on a ground plane. Using geometric properties of moving objects, a probabilistic model is constructed for simultaneously grouping trajectories and estimating vanishing points. Then we apply a single view mensuration algorithm to each of the frames to obtain height measurements. We finally fuse the multiframe measurements using the least median of squares (LMedS) as a robust cost function and the Robbins-Monro stochastic approximation (RMSA) technique. This method enables less human supervision, more flexibility and improved robustness. From the uncertainty analysis, we conclude that the method with auto-calibration is robust in practice. Results are shown based upon realistic tracking data from a variety of scenes.

J	Thandrayen, J; Wang, Y				Thandrayen, Joanne; Wang, Yan			Capture-recapture analysis with a latent class model allowing for local dependence and observed heterogeneity	BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Covariate; EM algorithm; Latent class model; List dependence; Multinomial logit	RECORD SYSTEMS ESTIMATION; VARIABLE REGRESSION; CLOSED POPULATIONS; ASCERTAINMENT; SIZE	In epidemiology, capture recapture models are commonly used to estimate the size of an unknown population based on several incomplete lists of individuals. The method operates under two main assumptions: independence between the lists (local independence) and homogeneity of capture probabilities of individuals. In practice, these assumptions are rarely satisfied. We introduce a multinomial latent class model that can account for both list dependence and heterogeneity. Parameter estimation is performed by maximizing the conditional likelihood function with the use of the EM algorithm. In addition, a new approach for evaluating the standard errors of the parameter estimates is discussed, which considerably reduces the computational burden associated with the evaluation of the variance of the population size estimate.

Likelihood Analysis of Multivariate Probit Models Using a Parameter Expanded MCEM Algorithm	TECHNOMETRICS			English	Article						Correlated binary data; Gibbs sampler; Monte Carlo expectation maximization algorithm; Parameter expansion	EM ALGORITHM; REGRESSION-MODEL; EXPANSION; INFERENCE; RESPONSES	Multivariate binary data arise in a variety of settings. In this article we propose a practical and efficient computational framework for maximum likelihood estimation of multivariate probit regression models. This approach uses the Monte Carlo expectation maximization (MCEM) algorithm, with parameter expansion to complete the M-step, to avoid the direct evaluation of the intractable multivariate normal orthant probabilities. The parameter expansion not only enables a closed-form solution in the M-step, but also improves efficiency. Using the simulation studies, we compare the performance of our approach with the MCEM algorithms developed by Chib and Greenberg (1998) and Song and Lee (2005), as well as the iterative approach proposed by Li and Schafer (2008). Our approach is further illustrated using a real-world example.

J	Kim, I; Cohen, ND; Roussel, A; Wang, N				Kim, Inyoung; Cohen, Noah D.; Roussel, Allen; Wang, Naisyin			A two-component nonlinear mixed effects model for longitudinal data, with application to gastric emptying studies	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						expectation maximization algorithm; global two-stage method; random coefficient model	ACID BREATH TEST; NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS; HUMAN STOMACH	Gastric emptying studies are of great interest in human and veterinary medical research to evaluate effects of medications or diets for promoting gastrointestinal motility and to examine unintended side-effects of new or existing medications, diets, or procedures. Summarizing gastric emptying data is important to allow easier comparison between treatments or groups of subjects and comparisons of results among studies. The standard method for assessing gastric emptying is by using scintigraphy and summarizing the nonlinear emptying of the radioisotope. A popular model for fitting gastric emptying data is the power exponential model. This model can only describes a globally decreasing pattern and thus has the limitation of poorly describing localized intragastric events that can occur during emptying. Hence, we develop a new model for gastric emptying studies to improve population and individual inferences using a mixture of nonlinear mixed effects models. One mixture component is based on a power exponential model which captures globally decreasing patterns. The other is based on a locally extended power exponential model which captures both local bumping and rapid decay. We refer to this mixture model as a two-component nonlinear mixed effects model. The parameters in our model have clear graphical interpretations that provide a more accurate representation and summary of the curves of gastric emptying pattern. Two methods are developed to fit our proposed model: one is the mixture of an Expectation Maximization algorithm and a global two-stage method and the other is the mixture of an Expectation Maximization algorithm and the Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization algorithm. We compare our methods using simulation, showing that the two approaches are comparable to one another. For estimating the variance and covariance matrix, the second approach appears approximately more efficient and is also numerically more stable in some cases. Our new model and approaches are applicable for assessing gastric emptying in human and veterinary medical research and in many other biomedical fields such as pharmacokinetics, toxicokinetics, and physiological research. An example of gastric emptying data from equine medicine is used to demonstrate the advantage of our approaches. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Sensitivity evaluation of dynamic speckle activity measurements using clustering methods	APPLIED OPTICS			English	Article							SELF-ORGANIZING MAP; ENTROPY	We evaluate and compare the use of competitive neural networks, self-organizing maps, the expectation-maximization algorithm, K-means, and fuzzy C-means techniques as partitional clustering methods, when the sensitivity of the activity measurement of dynamic speckle images needs to be improved. The temporal history of the acquired intensity generated by each pixel is analyzed in a wavelet decomposition framework, and it is shown that the mean energy of its corresponding wavelet coefficients provides a suited feature space for clustering purposes. The sensitivity obtained by using the evaluated clustering techniques is also compared with the well-known methods of Konishi-Fujii, weighted generalized differences, and wavelet entropy. The performance of the partitional clustering approach is evaluated using simulated dynamic speckle patterns and also experimental data.

Finite mixture models have traditionally been used to describe the distribution of responses in treated subjects for such studies. In this paper, we first study the mixture normal model with multi-levels and multiple mixture sub-populations under each level, with particular attention being given to the model in which the proportions of susceptibility are related to dose levels, then we use EM-algorithm to find the maximum likelihood estimators of model parameters. Our results are generalizations of the existing results. Finally, we illustrate realistic significance of the above extension based on a set of real dose-response data.

Therefore, HSP70-hom gene polymorphisms may act as important factors in predicting the prognosis of patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). To evaluate the role of HSP70-hom gene polymorphisms in the prognosis of patients receiving sibling human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched allogeneic HSCT, the HSP70-hom polymorphisms, T2437C and G2763A, were genotyped in 147 patients receiving sibling HLA-matched allogeneic HSCT. Individual diplotypes were estimated from genotype data of the two HSP70-hom polymorphisms using the expectation maximization algorithm. Patients with the 2763GG or GA genotype showed longer overall survival compared with those with the 2763AA genotype, and patients with a TG haplotype (TG/TA, TG/TG or TG/CG) also showed longer overall survival compared with those with a non-TG haplotype (TA/TA or TA/CG) (both G2763A genotype and diplotype, p < 0.01). Moreover, the 2437TT genotype was found to be protective for treatment-related death compared with the 2437TC genotype, and a TG haplotype was found to be very protective for treatment-related death compared with a non-TG haplotype (T2437C genotype, p = 0.04; and diplotype, p = 0.02). Therefore, our results suggest that HSP70-hom polymorphisms play an important role in the prognosis of patients receiving sibling HLA-matched allogeneic HSCT.

In this work, we develop a novel technique to find this region within different time windows, which is robust against the changes of view, scale, and background. The main thrust of our technique is to integrate audiovisual correlation analysis into a video segmentation framework. We analyze the audiovisual correlation locally by computing quadratic mutual information between our audiovisual features. The computation of quadratic mutual information is based on the probability density functions estimated by kernel density estimation with adaptive kernel bandwidth. The results of this audiovisual correlation analysis are incorporated into graph cut-based video segmentation to resolve a globally optimum extraction of the speaker's face region. The setting of any heuristic threshold in this segmentation is avoided by learning the correlation distributions of speaker and background by expectation maximization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can detect the speaker's face region accurately and robustly for different views, scales, and backgrounds.

Experimental evaluation of an automatic parameter setting system	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Setting parameters; Case-based reasoning; Bayesian networks; Genetic algorithms; Constructive geometric constraint solving	EM ALGORITHM; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; BAYESIAN NETWORKS; OPTIMIZATION; MODEL	Finding the parameter setting that will result in the optimal performance of a given algorithm for solving a problem is a tedious task. This paper briefly describes a system that automatically chooses the best algorithm parameter configuration conditioned by the current problem instance to solve. The system uses bayesian networks (BN) and case-based reasoning (CBR) methodology to find such a configuration. CBR provides a mechanism to acquire knowledge about the specific problem domain. BN provide a tool to model quantitative and qualitative relationships between parameters of interest. However, the aim of this work is to empirically evaluate the system described, using as an example the configuration of a genetic algorithm that solves the root identification problem. In this context, we report on several statistically guided experimental evaluations. The experimental results confirm the validity of the proposed system and its potential effectiveness for configuring algorithms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Thakuriah, P				Thakuriah (Vonu), Piyushimita			Evaluation of alternative data imputation strategies: A case study of motor carrier safety	TRANSPORTATION LETTERS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH			English	Article						motor carrier safety; missing data imputation; Markov Chain Monte Carlo; Expectation-Maximization; Data Augmentation; odds ratio		This paper examines the effectiveness of different methods in imputing mileage incurred by commercial motor carriers (used as exposure measures in deriving safety indices of carriers), by using an administrative dataset on motor carriers. The objective of the paper is to assess the behavior of different imputation methods, using simulation. A series of odds-ratio tests confirm that the mileage data on motor carriers are not in fact ideally suited for data imputation approaches. However, the literature indicates that data imputation methods may be quite robust with respect to departures from the imputation model assumptions. In order to evaluate the level of robustness, samples of motor carriers are constructed by simulation to mimic different total "non-response" conditions and "item nonresponse" (with respect to mileage values of carriers). Four data imputation methods are then evaluated on these simulated samples including: Unconditional Mean Imputation (where mean values are substituted for missing values), Conditional Mean Imputation (regression-based imputation), Expectation Maximization algorithm with simulation (EMis) (an EM-based algorithm that includes a fast simulator for randomly imputing missing values based on estimated EM parameters) and a Data Augmentation based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method]. Conclusions are drawn regarding the use of imputation in safety research.

J	Wang, SF; Tsodikov, A				Wang, Shufang; Tsodikov, Alex			A self-consistency approach to multinomial logit model with random effects	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE			English	Article						QEM algorithm; Multinomial logit model with random effects	LINEAR MIXED MODELS; CARLO EM ALGORITHM; LIKELIHOOD	The computation in the multinomial logit mixed effects model is costly especially when the response variable has a large number of categories, since it involves high-dimensional integration and maximization. Tsodikov and Chefo (2008) developed a stable MLE approach to problems with independent observations, based on generalized self-consistency and quasi-EM algorithm developed in Tsodikov (2003). In this paper, we apply the idea to clustered multinomial response to simplify the maximization step. The method transforms the complex multinomial likelihood to Poisson-type likelihood and hence allows for the estimates to be obtained iteratively solving a set of independent low-dimensional problems. The methodology is applied to real data and studied by simulations. While maximization is simplified, numerical integration remains the dominant challenge to computational efficiency.

J	Wang, Y				Wang, Yong			Fisher scoring: An interpolation family and its Monte Carlo implementations	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Fisher information; Fisher scoring; Iteratively reweighted least squares; EM algorithm; Mixed-effects model; Mixture model; Randomized algorithm	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; EM ALGORITHM; VARIANCE-COMPONENTS; MIXING DISTRIBUTION; COMPUTATION; MODELS	The Fisher scoring method is widely used for likelihood maximization, but its application can be difficult in situations where the expected information matrix is not available in closed form or when parameters have constraints In this paper, we describe an interpolation family that generalizes the Fisher scoring method and propose a general Monte Carlo approach that makes these generalized methods also applicable in such situations. With this approach, random samples are generated from the iteratively estimated models and used to provide estimates of the expected information As a result, the likelihood function can be optimized by repeatedly solving weighted linear regression problems Specific extensions of this general approach to fitting multivariate normal mixtures and to fitting mixed-effects models with a single discrete random effect are also described. Numerical studies show that the proposed algorithms are fast and reliable to use, as compared with the classical expectation-maximization algorithm (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved	Univ Auckland, Dept Stat, Auckland 1, New Zealand	Wang, Y (reprint author), Univ Auckland, Dept Stat, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1, New Zealand.

In this paper, we propose a multiple imputation method for the semiparametric accelerated failure time mixture cure model based on the rank estimation method and the profile likelihood method. Both approaches can be easily implemented in R environment However, the computation time for the rank estimation method is longer than that from the profile likelihood method Simulation studies demonstrate that the performances of estimated parameters from the proposed methods are comparable to those from the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, and the estimated variances are comparable to those from the empirical approach For illustration, we apply the proposed method to a data set of failure times from the bone marrow transplantation (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved.

J	Zanghi, H; Volant, S; Ambroise, C				Zanghi, Hugo; Volant, Stevenn; Ambroise, Christophe			Clustering based on random graph model embedding vertex features	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						Variational EM algoritm; Graph clustering; Vertex features	EM ALGORITHM; LIKELIHOOD	Large datasets with interactions between objects are common to numerous scientific fields including the social sciences and biology, as well as being a feature of specific phenomena such as the internet. The interactions naturally define a graph, and a common way of exploring and summarizing such datasets is graph clustering. Most techniques for clustering graph vertices use only the topology of connections, while ignoring information about the vertices' features. In this paper we provide a clustering algorithm that harnesses both types of data, based on a statistical model with a latent structure characterizing each vertex both by a vector of features and by its connectivity. We perform simulations to compare our algorithm with existing approaches, and also evaluate our method using real datasets based on hypertext documents. We find that our algorithm successfully exploits whatever information is found both in the connectivity pattern and in the features. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This heterogeneity is defined as unobservable heterogeneity. The data set's heterogeneity produces serious deviations in the parameter estimates and the standard deviations. Heterogeneity is overcome when the data set divides itself into homogeneous sub-populations. Thus, while homogeneity is attained for sub-populations, the heterogeneity between the sub-populations is tried to be put forward. Akaike's information criteria (AIC), Bayesian information criteria (BIC), and Entropy classification criteria are used to determine the number of sub-populations. After the number of sub-populations is determined, the model determines the probability that each observation will fall within a particular sub-population. In this study, the classification of districts based on fruit traits is achieved by applying mixture modeling to walnut fruits collected from eight districts. According to the AIC, BIC, and entropy criteria, a model with five sub-populations was chosen where the data set is the most distributed. Therefore, it was determined that each district does not form a different population according to the studied walnut fruit traits, but are distributed into five sub-populations. The fourth sub-population had the most desirable traits for walnut improvement, and the highest proportion of these traits came from the naturally grown populations of Adilcevaz and Ahlat districts.

We introduce new types of mean functions which can be either NHPP-I or NHPP-II according to the choice of the distribution function. The proposed mean function is motivated by the fact that a strictly monotone increasing function can be modeled by a distribution function and an unknown distribution function approximated by a mixture of beta distributions. Some existing mean functions can be regarded as special cases of the proposed mean functions. The EM algorithm is used to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters in the proposed model.

The segmentation of playfield is essential because it usually offers important cue of higher-level content in sport videos. The colors in playfield may change significantly due to variation of illumination, which thus results in a large amount of segmentation errors for color-based segmentation schemes. In this paper, we present a new playfield segmentation method for baseball videos based on an adaptive Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to train the model parameters. An adaptive GMM model is constructed by a novel training sample selection, which automatically selects appropriate samples from input video for the parameter estimation of EM process. The simulation results indicate that the new method achieves very low error rates of segmentation in an efficient manner.

The increasing number of processors on a single Chip opens new opportunity for parallel computing. Our goal is to make use of the multi-core as well as multi-processor architectures to speed up large-scale data mining algorithms. In this paper, we present a general parallel learning framework, Cut-And-Stitch, for training hidden Markov chain models. Particularly, we propose two model-specific variants, CAS-LDS for learning linear dynamical systems (LDS) and CAS-HMM for learning hidden Markov models (HMM). Our main contribution is a novel method to handle the data dependencies due to the chain structure of hidden variables, so as to parallelize the EM-based parameter learning algorithm. We implement CAS-LDS and CAS-HMM using OpenMP on two supercomputers and a quad-core commercial desktop. The experimental results show that parallel algorithms using Cut-And-Stitch achieve comparable accuracy and almost linear speedups over the traditional serial version.

Regression Analysis with a Misclassified Covariate from a Current Status Observation Scheme	BIOMETRICS			English	Article						Current status observation; EM algorithm; Misclassified covariate; Nonparametric estimation; Regression model	GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS; HIP-REPLACEMENT SURGERY; IN-VARIABLES MODELS; VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM; POSTOPERATIVE FONDAPARINUX; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; INCOMPLETE DATA; EM ALGORITHM; MISSING DATA; ERRORS	Naive use of misclassified covariates leads to inconsistent estimators of covariate effects in regression models. A variety if methods have been proposed to address this problem including likelihood, pseudo-likelihood, estimating equation methods, and Bayesian methods, with all of these methods typically requiring either internal or external validation samples or replication studies. We consider a problem arising from a series of orthopedic studies in which interest lies in examining the effect of a short-term serological response and other covariates on the risk of developing a longer term thrombotic condition called deep vein thrombosis. The serological response is an indicator of whether the patient developed antibodies following exposure to an antithrombotic drug, but the seroconversion status of patients is only available it the time of a blood sample taken upon the discharge from hospital. The seroconversion time is therefore subject to a current status observation scheme: or Case I interval censoring, and subjects tested before seroconversion are misclassified as nonseroconverters. We develop a likelihood-based approach for fitting regression models that: accounts for misclassification of the seroconversion status due to early testing using parametric and nonparametric estimates of the seroconversion time distribution. The method is shown to reduce the bias resulting from naive analyses in simulation studies and all application to the data from; the orthopedic studies provides further illustration.

J	Tanaka, E; Kudo, H				Tanaka, Eiichi; Kudo, Hiroyuki			Optimal relaxation parameters of DRAMA (dynamic RAMLA) aiming at one-pass image reconstruction for 3D-PET	PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article							BLOCK-ITERATIVE ALGORITHMS; EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; ORDERED-SUBSETS; EM ALGORITHM; PET	We have reported a block-iterative algorithm named DRAMA for image reconstruction for emission tomography (Tanaka and Kudo 2003 Phys. Med. Biol. 48 1405-22). DRAMA is a modified version of the row-action maximum likelihood algorithm (RAMLA), in which the relaxation parameter is subset dependent and is changed in such a way that the noise propagation from subsets to the reconstructed image is substantially independent of the access order of the subsets. The algorithm provides fast convergence with a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio. The optimal relaxation parameter has been derived assuming a two-dimensional (2D)-PET model, and detailed performance in three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction has not been clear enough. We have developed the new version 'DRAMA-3D', based on the 3D-PET model. The optimal relaxation parameter is a function of the access order of the subsets and the ring difference, and its value is determined by simple formulas from the design parameters of the PET scanner, the operating conditions and the post-smoothing resolution. In this paper, we present the theory of DRAMA-3D, the results of simulation studies on the performance of DRAMA-3D and the comparative studies of the related algorithms. It is shown that DRAMA-3D is robust for various access orders of subsets and is suitable to realize one-pass (single-iteration) reconstruction.

Application of a Gaussian, Missing-Data Model to Product Recommendation	IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						Conditional mean; expectation maximization; gradient descent; maximum likelihood		A Gaussian, missing-data model is applied to predict product ratings. Vectors of product ratings from users are assumed to be independent and identically distributed. Two approaches for parameter estimation in this model are studied: Little and Rubin's expectation-maximization algorithm and McMichael's modified stochastic gradient descent approach. The resulting estimates are used in minimum mean squared error prediction of product ratings using the conditional mean. On a large dataset, performance using McMichael's approach is better than reported performance of the popular matrix factorization approach.

Machine learning study of the heulandite family of zeolites	MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS			English	Article						Zeolite; Heulandite; Clinoptilolite; Data mining clustering; Machine learning	THERMAL-STABILITY; CLINOPTILOLITE; FRAMEWORK	Heulandite and clinoptilolite form the most abundant family of natural zeolite crystals. The topology of both of them is characterized by the framework type HEU. Despite many studies on these crystals the, mineral assignment to a zeolite as heulandite or clinoptilolite is still controversial and unresolved today. Based on a machine learning clustering analysis of crystallographic data of zeolite crystals, we show that zeolites belonging to the HEU framework type are divided into three groups of minerals instead of two. Two of the groups, HEU-h and HEU-c, contain crystals with names heulandite and clinoptilolite, respectively. The third newly proposed group HEU-m is composed of mixed zeolites named under both traditional names. The grouping is based on the EM algorithm and a set of descriptors built from data collected in the NIST/FIZ Inorganic Crystal Structure Database. Verification of the division of the HEU family into three groups is provided based on a battery of machine learning tests. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Stability of maximum-likelihood-based clustering methods: exploring the backbone of classifications	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT			English	Article						random graphs; networks	HOUSE-OF-REPRESENTATIVES; FOOD-WEB STRUCTURE; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; NETWORKS; ORGANIZATION; PREDICTION; RESOLUTION; MIXTURE	Components of complex systems are often classified according to the way they interact with each other. In graph theory such groups are known as clusters or communities. Many different techniques have been recently proposed to detect them, some of which involve inference methods using either Bayesian or maximum likelihood approaches. In this paper, we study a statistical model designed for detecting clusters based on connection similarity. The basic assumption of the model is that the graph was generated by a certain grouping of the nodes and an expectation maximization algorithm is employed to infer that grouping. We show that the method admits further development to yield a stability analysis of the groupings that quantifies the extent to which each node influences its neighbors' group membership. Our approach naturally allows for the identification of the key elements responsible for the grouping and their resilience to changes in the network. Given the generality of the assumptions underlying the statistical model, such nodes are likely to play special roles in the original system. We illustrate this point by analyzing several empirical networks for which further information about the properties of the nodes is available. The search and identification of stabilizing nodes constitutes thus a novel technique to characterize the relevance of nodes in complex networks.

Texture based prelens tear film segmentation in interferometry images	MACHINE VISION AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Prelens tear film; Texture segmentation; Gabor filter; Clustering; Gaussian mixture models	SPATIAL-FREQUENCY; GABOR FILTERS; THICKNESS; PRECORNEAL; CHANNELS	Interferometric imaging has been identified as a novel approach to the evaluation of prelens tear film (PLTF) thickness in contact lens patients. In this paper, we present a texture based segmentation approach for the detection of tear film breakup regions on interferometry images. First, the textural information was extracted from the studied images using a bank of Gabor filters. A novel classifier, EM-MDA, which integrates traditional Expectation-Maximization with Multiple Discriminant Analysis, was then trained for the recognition of breakup regions of the PLTF. Experimental results provided a correct classification rate of 91.0% which proved significantly higher compared to traditional EM or well known Linear Discriminant Analysis.

However, mental state prediction is not only uncertain but also context dependent. In this paper, we present a dynamic Bayesian network model of the temporal evolution of students' mental states and causal associations between mental states and body gestures in context. Our approach is to convert sensory descriptions of student gestures into semantic descriptions of their mental states in a classroom lecture situation. At model learning time, we use expectation maximization (EM) to estimate model parameters from partly labeled training data, and at run time, we use the junction tree algorithm to infer mental states from body gesture evidence. A maximum a posteriori classifier evaluated with leave-one-out cross validation on labeled data from 11 students obtains a generalization accuracy of 97.4% over cases where the student reported a definite mental state, and 83.2% when we include cases where the student reported no mental state. Experimental results demonstrate the validity of our approach. Future work will explore utilization of the model in real-time intelligent tutoring systems.

Penalized multinomial mixture logit model	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS			English	Article						Mixture models; EM algorithm; Logit models; Penalty parameter; Leukemia data	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; CLASSIFICATION; SEPARATION	Normal distribution based discriminant methods have been used for the classification of new entities into different groups based on a discriminant rule constructed from the learning set. In practice if the groups are not homogeneous, then mixture discriminant analysis of Hastie and Tibshirani (J R Stat Soc Ser B 58(1):155-176, 1996) is a useful approach, assuming that the distribution of the feature vectors is a mixture of multivariate normals. In this paper a new logistic regression model for heterogenous group structure of the learning set is proposed based on penalized multinomial mixture logit models. This approach is shown through simulation studies to be more effective. The results were compared with the standard mixture discriminant analysis approach using the probability of misclassification criterion. This comparison showed a slight reduction in the average probability of misclassification using this penalized multinomial mixture logit model as compared to the classical discriminant rules. It also showed better results when applied to practical life data problems producing smaller errors.

J	Chen, LC				Chen, Lin-Chih			Using a two-stage technique to design a keyword suggestion system	INFORMATION RESEARCH-AN INTERNATIONAL ELECTRONIC JOURNAL			English	Article							LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; SEARCH ENGINE; EM ALGORITHM; MODELS; KNOWLEDGE; WEB	Introduction. The study of keyword suggestion in the field of search engine marketing is an important issue for paid search advertising or sponsored advertisements. The challenge of this issue is not only to suggest the relevant keywords, but also to find more such keywords. Methods. In this paper, we propose a system, the main goal of which is not only to suggest a list of relevant keywords, but also to determine the degree of similarity between the user's query and each suggested keyword. Analysis. Three experiments were performed to illustrated the performance comparison between different systems and the relevant parameters considered in our system. Results. According to the results of the first experiment, our system was found to be better than other online systems. According to the results of the second experiment, we concluded that the performance model. According to the results of the third experiment, we verified that the termination criteria of our system could yield a cost effective solution within a controlled period of time. Conclusions. In this paper, we make several contributions. First, we propose an intelligent system that is based on several semantic analysis methods, Second, we define a new performance metric to compare the results of different systems. Third, we design a combined technique to find a cost effective solution with controlled period of time.

Separating mixtures of probability distributions with the grid method of moments and the grid maximal likelihood method	AUTOMATION AND REMOTE CONTROL			English	Article								We consider the so-called grid methods for approximate statistical separation of probability distribution mixtures based on (i) minimizing the disparity between theoretical and empirical moments and (ii) maximizing the grid likelihood function. We show that problems of type (i) can be reduced to linear programming problems. For a numerical solution of problems of type (ii) we offer the "truncated" EM algorithm and the conditional gradient algorithm. We show results of a comparative study of the suggested approaches' efficiency based on solving the decomposition problem for the volatility function of financial indices. We give examples of volatility decompositions for the CAC 40 index.	[Korolev, V. Yu.; Nazarov, A. L.] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Korolev, V.

The imperfect channel estimate is provided by a least squares estimator using a training sequence (TS). The derivation of the MAP criterion taking into account the channel estimation error exists in the literature but no direct practical implementation has been proposed. In this paper, we propose an approximate solution to the problem by using an iterative burst-by-burst equalizer based on the Expectation Maximisation (EM) algorithm. Simulation results show that the performance of our iterative equalizer is significantly better than the performance of the non-iterative equalizer which does not take into account the channel estimation error.

In this paper, we propose a new estimation technique for the parameters in two multinomial populations under stochastic orderings when missing data are present. In comparison with traditional maximum likelihood estimation method, our new method can guarantee the uniqueness of the maximum of the likelihood function. Furthermore, it does not depend on the choice of initial values for the parameters in contrast to the EM algorithm.

J	Yuan, H; Zhang, XP				Yuan, Hua; Zhang, Xiao-Ping			Statistical Modeling in the Wavelet Domain for Compact Feature Extraction and Similarity Measure of Images	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Expectation-maximization algorithm; feature extraction; Gaussian mixture model; generalized Gaussian mixture model; image retrieval; Kullback divergence; similarity measure; wavelet transforms	RETRIEVAL; TRANSFORM	Image feature extraction and similarity measure in feature space are active research topics. They are basic components in a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system. In this letter, we present a new statistical model-based image feature extraction method in the wavelet domain and a novel Kullback divergence-based similarity measure. First, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a more systematic generalized Gaussian mixture model (GGMM) are employed to describe the statistical characteristics of the wavelet coefficients and the model parameters are employed to construct a compact image feature space. A nontrivial expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for the GGMM model is derived. Subsequently, a new Kullback divergence-based similarity measure with low-computation cost is derived and analyzed. The Brodatz texture image database and some other image databases are used to evaluate the retrieval performance based on the presented new methods. Experimental results indicate that the GMM and the GGMM-based image texture features are very effective in representing multiscale image characteristics and that the new methods outperforms other conventional wavelet-based methods in retrieval performance with a comparable level of computational complexity. It is also demonstrated that for image features extracted by the new statistical models, the similarity measure based on Kullback divergence is more effective than conventional similarity measures.

Improving of parameter learning beyond ML has been performed based on the concept of discrimination among classes in contrast to maximizing likelihood of each individual class. In this paper, we propose a discriminative feature transformation method based on genetic algorithm, to increase Hidden Markov Model likelihoods in its training phase for a better class discrimination. The method is evaluated for phoneme recognition on clean and noisy TIMIT. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed transformation method results in higher phone recognition rate than well-known feature transformations methods and conventional HMM learning algorithm based on ML criterion.

The main result (Theorem 1) shows that this approximation converges uniformly to the unknown likelihood function and can therefore be used efficiently with any algorithm for sampling from the law of the bridge. We also introduce an expected maximum likelihood (EML) algorithm for inferring the parameters of discretely observed diffusion processes. The approach is applicable to a subclass of nonlinear SDEs with constant volatility and drift that is linear in the model parameters. In this setting, globally optimal parameters are obtained in a single step by solving a linear system. Simulation Studies to test the EML algorithm show that it performs well when compared with algorithms based on the exact maximum likelihood as well its closed-form likelihood expansions.

A case study is presented where the sample includes partial respondents, who did not answer some questionnaire items. The total score takes, hence, the form of an interval-censored variable and, as a result, the level of cognitive functioning is missing on some subjects. We handle the partial respondents by taking a likelihood-based approach where survival time is jointly modelled with the censored total score and the size of the censoring interval. Estimates are obtained by an E-M-type algorithm that reduces to the iterative maximization of three complete log-likelihood functions derived from two augmented data sets with case weights, alternated with weights updating. This methodology is exploited to assess the Mini-Mental State Examination index as a prognostic factor of survival in a sample of Chinese older adults. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A precise prediction of individual disease outcome is important to identify patients who have a high risk of disease recurrence, and to tailor treatments to the individual patient. Genes, however, are not the sole determinants of disease outcomes. Non-genetic factors have roles in many stages of tumourigenesis, and the simultaneous use of genetic-staging and clinical risk factors may therefore improve the prediction of disease outcome. In this paper, we aim to quantify the prognostic value of genetic-staging from gene expressions by using mixture model-based clustering methods. We also investigate via the use of logistric regression whether a more accurate prediction of disease outcome can be obtained by using genetic-staging in conjunction with clinical risk factors. The proposed method is illustrated using a real example of breast cancer data. It shows that genetic-staging provides significant additional prognostic information when it is obtained by applying sophisticated model-based clustering method for the identification of marker-genes that are relevant to predict disease outcomes.

Performance Analysis of Multi-Carrier Relay-Based UAV Network Over Fading Channels	2010 IEEE GLOBECOM WORKSHOPS			English	Proceedings Paper	Globecom Workshops	DEC 05-10, 2010	Miami, FL				TO-END PERFORMANCE; CAPACITY THEOREMS	The performance analysis of multi-carrier relay-based Unmanned Airborne Vehicles (UAVs) network is studied analytically over fading channels. A relay-based topology with one ground control unit (GCU) is assumed, where the cooperative UAVs can communicate with the GCU directly or through relay. The outage probability of the system is defined as the probability that either the transmission rate over any of the links drops below a predefined minimum threshold for that link or the Relay-GCU link is not able to transmit the aggregate data from all relayed UAVs. Finite Mixture with Expectation-Maximization algorithm is utilized to derive a simple approximate expression for the probability density function (pdf) of the achievable bit rate assuming adaptive M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM). The outage probability and the average achievable bit rate of a cooperative multi-carrier system are derived over generalized Gaussian-Finite-Mixture fading channels.

J	Adamic, P; Dixon, S; Gillis, D				Adamic, Peter; Dixon, Stephanie; Gillis, Daniel			Multiple decrement modeling in the presence of interval censoring and masking	SCANDINAVIAN ACTUARIAL JOURNAL			English	Article						Survival function; Self-consistency; Multiple risks; Innermost interval; Interval censoring	COMPETING-RISKS MODEL; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; MASKED CAUSES; EM ALGORITHM; SURVIVAL; ESTIMATOR; FAILURE	A self-consistent algorithm will be proposed to non-parametrically estimate the cause-specific cumulative incidence functions (CIFs) in an interval censored, multiple decrement context. More specifically, the censoring mechanism will be assumed to be a mixture of case 2 interval-censored data with the additional possibility of exact observations. The proposed algorithm is a generalization of the classical univariate algorithms of Efron and Turnbull. However, unlike any previous non-parametric models proposed in the literature to date, the algorithm will explicitly allow for the possibility of any combination of masked modes of failure, where failure is known only to occur due to a subset from the set of all possible causes. A simulation study is also conducted to demonstrate the consistency of the estimators of the CIFs produced by the proposed algorithm, as well as to explore the effect of masking. The paper concludes by applying the method to masked mortality data obtained for Pueblo County, CO, for three risks: death by cancer; cardiovascular failure; or other.

A Novel Parameter Estimation Algorithm for the Multivariate t-Distribution and Its Application to Computer Vision	COMPUTER VISION-ECCV 2010, PT II	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	11th European Conference on Computer Vision	SEP 05-11, 2010	Heraklion, GREECE	Inst Natl Rech Informat & Automat, Google, Microsoft Res, Technicolor, Adobe, DynaVox Mayer-Johnson, Eur Res Consortium Informat Math, Gen Elect, IBM, Johnson Controls, Point Grey, Univ Houston, Siemens			TRACKING; EM	We present a novel algorithm for approximating the parameters of a multivariate t-distribution. At the expense of a slightly decreased accuracy in the estimates, the proposed algorithm is significantly faster and easier to implement compared to the maximum likelihood estimates computed using the expectation-maximization algorithm. The formulation of the proposed algorithm also provides theoretical guidance for solving problems that are intractable with the maximum likelihood equations. In particular, we show how the proposed algorithm can be modified to give an incremental solution for fast online parameter estimation. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by using the approximated t-distribution as a drop in replacement for the conventional Gaussian distribution in two computer vision applications: object recognition and tracking. In both cases the t-distribution gives better performance with no increase in computation.

S	Agostini, A; Celaya, E			IEEE	Agostini, Alejandro; Celaya, Enric			Reinforcement Learning with a Gaussian Mixture Model	2010 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS IJCNN 2010	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2010)	2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE			EM ALGORITHM	Recent approaches to Reinforcement Learning (RL) with function approximation include Neural Fitted Q Iteration and the use of Gaussian Processes. They belong to the class of fitted value iteration algorithms, which use a set of support points to fit the value-function in a batch iterative process. These techniques make efficient use of a reduced number of samples by reusing them as needed, and are appropriate for applications where the cost of experiencing a new sample is higher than storing and reusing it, but this is at the expense of increasing the computational effort, since these algorithms are not incremental. On the other hand, non-parametric models for function approximation, like Gaussian Processes, are preferred against parametric ones, due to their greater flexibility. A further advantage of using Gaussian Processes for function approximation is that they allow to quantify the uncertainty of the estimation at each point. In this paper, we propose a new approach for RL in continuous domains based on Probability Density Estimations. Our method combines the best features of the previous methods: it is non-parametric and provides an estimation of the variance of the approximated function at any point of the domain. In addition, our method is simple, incremental, and computationally efficient. All these features make this approach more appealing than Gaussian Processes and fitted value iteration algorithms in general.

Two versions of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm are used to predict the mean flow length and complete flow distributions for subsequent timesteps. A model is first used to represent the histogram of flows corresponding to any given time interval, and the EM algorithms are then used to estimate the parameters of the model. The proposed algorithms are tested on a large number of commonly-available data traces and both show high prediction accuracy.

First, we introduce a data model using von-Mises distribution to represent the phase error terms. Then we employ expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the error distribution parameter and target returns as well as the noise variance.

There are well developed mathematical theories proving that unless certain a priori information is known about the image, some of these limited data sets will be insufficient to generate images of acceptable quality. While in various cases such a priori information is readily available, the translation of this knowledge into mathematical constraints and their subsequent incorporation into image reconstruction algorithms has proved to be a formidable task, and there are very few results on this matter. In this paper we introduce a method that uses the knowledge of image patterns consisting of nodules to stabilize the image reconstruction in incomplete data x-ray tomography. The technique uses a modified expectation-maximization algorithm to cluster singularities in Radon domain, and recover the centers and radii of a finite number of nodules in the image.

The discovery of reliable image-derived biomarkers could potentially identify people with ASD, or infants who will subsequently develop or are already developing subtle signs of ASD. We hypothesize that the quantification of regional signal change and connectivity information from particular functional subnetworks in the brain responding to ASD-related biological motion tasks, informed by anatomical and diffusion information, will provide more sensitive and robust image-derived biomarkers for studying ASD. Thus, we focus our efforts on the development of a unique mathematical approach that uses image-derived information regarding gray matter location and white matter pathways to inform the estimation of three functionally connected subnetworks related to ASD. Our computational strategy is aimed at grouping ASD-task-related activation into these functional subnetworks using a new multiview Expectation Maximization (EM) formulation.

Its goal is to extract a grammar representing the language structure using texts without annotations of this structure. We have devised an evolutionary algorithm which for each sentence evolves a population of trees that represent different parse trees of that sentence. Each of these trees represent a part of a grammar. The evaluation function takes into account the contexts in which each sequence of Part-Of-Speech tags (POSseq) appears in the training corpus, as well as the frequencies of those POSseqs and contexts. The grammar for the whole training corpus is constructed in an incremental manner. The algorithm has been evaluated using a well known Annotated English corpus, though the annotation have only been used for evaluation purposes. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm is able to improve the results of a classical optimization algorithm, such as EM (Expectation Maximization), for short grammar constituents (right side of the grammar rules), and its precision is better in general.

Expectation-Maximization (EM) is the standard algorithm employed to estimate the parameters of these models. However, such iterative optimization methods can easily get trapped into local maxima. Researchers use population-based stochastic search algorithms to obtain better estimates. We present a novel particle swarm optimization-based algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of Gaussian mixture models. The proposed approach provides solutions for important problems in effective application of population-based algorithms to the clustering problem. We present a new parametrization for arbitrary covariance matrices that allows independent updating of individual parameters during the search process. We also describe an optimization formulation for identifying the correspondence relations between different parameter orderings of candidate solutions. Experiments on a hyperspectral image show better clustering results compared to the commonly used EM algorithm for estimating GMMs.	[Ari, Caglar] Bilkent Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey	Ari, C (reprint author), Bilkent Univ, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.	cari@ee.bilkent.edu.tr; saksoy@cs.bilkent.edu.tr	Aksoy, Selim/C-3365-2008	Aksoy, Selim/0000-0003-4185-0565			Chang DX, 2009, PATTERN RECOGN, V42, P1210, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2008.11.006; EDMONDS J, 1972, J ACM, V19, P248, DOI 10.1145/321694.321699; Golub G.

Our results show that the receiver can achieve near-optimum performance with modest complexity using very few training symbols. Furthermore, our simulation results confirm that the proposed receiver is near-far resistant and offers fast convergence in severe near-far scenarios.

Validation of CT-based Attenuation Correction for Multi-Pinhole PSF Reconstruction for Small-Animal SPECT	2010 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD (NSS/MIC)	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium (NSS)/Medical Imaging Conference (MIC)/17th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X-ray and Gamma-ray Detectors	OCT 30-NOV 06, 2010	Knoxville, TN	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Nucl & Plasma Sci Soc, IEEE				We recently reported a numerical ray-tracing algorithm for calculating the point-spread function (PSF) used in 3-D ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction of single and multi-pinhole collimated single photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT) images. In this work, we evaluated the performance of our PSF reconstruction method with and without X-ray CT-based attenuation correction (AC) and dual energy window scatter correction (SC). X-ray CT data was acquired to create the attenuation maps. SPECT data was acquired using Tc-99m phantoms and 5-pinhole tungsten collimators with 1.0 mm diameter pinholes. With no corrections applied, an axial image slice of a 3 cm diameter cylinder uniformly filled with Tc-99m showed a 13% dip near the center of the phantom. When AC and SC were applied, the cross-section through an axial slice showed a desirable flattened profile that dipped only 3%. We also scanned a mouse with Tc-99m implantable sources that had negligible self-attenuation. The sources were first scanned in air for calibration. Our results show that the reconstructed SPECT images with no corrections underestimated the activity for each 99mTc implanted source by 12% on average, while the image with AC and SC underestimated the activity by only 3.3% on average. We repeated all of the experiments with I-125 phantoms but did not apply SC to the I-125 data. With no correction applied, an axial slice of a 3 cm diameter cylinder uniformly filled with I-125 dipped 25% near the center of the phantom. After applying AC, the I-125 image profile no longer dipped but rather was overcorrected by 4.5%. Similarly, the reconstructed image of the I-125 implants with no correction underestimated the activity of each source by 23% on average, while the I-125 image with AC overestimated the activity in the sources by 4.6% on average. These results have shown that our PSF reconstruction method with CT-based attenuation correction improved the quantitative accuracy of SPECT images for representative Tc-99m and I-125 studies.

Exploratory Parcellation of fMRI Data Based on Finite Mixture Models and Self-Annealing Expectation Maximization	26TH SOUTHERN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING CONFERENCE: SBEC 2010	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	26th Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference, SBEC 2010	APR 30-MAY 02, 2010	College Park, MD	Natl Sci Fdn, Biomedical Engn Soc, Natl Canc Inst	Univ Maryland	Parcellation; functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI); Finite Mixture Model (FMM)	FUNCTIONAL MRI; BRAIN	We present a new exploratory method for brain parcellation based on a probabilistic model in which anatomical and functional features of fMRI data are used. The goal of this procedure is to segregate the brain into spatially connected and functionally homogeneous components, and to account for variability of the fMRI response in different brain regions. To achieve this goal, the parcellation algorithm relies on the optimization of a compound criterion reflecting both the spatial and functional structures of the individual brains and hence the topology of the dataset. We employ unsupervised learning techniques to classify the fMRI data in an exploratory fashion through a Finite Mixture Model (FMM) for the distribution of the feature vectors of voxels, where the voxels of each parcel follow a normal density. A self-annealing Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to fit the FMM to the data. To find, the number of parcels, K, we employ Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The algorithm is tested on synthetic fMRI data as well as real fMRI data. Applying this method to data from a motor experiment, we were able to find homogeneous and connected regions in the motor cortex and the cerebellum that have been previously found using hypothesis-driven methods. Simulation studies have shown that the parcellation results of our method are more accurate than those of the formerly developed methods.	[Balajoo, S. Maleki; Hossein-Zadeh, G.

We present a general framework which includes approximate Viterbi algorithms like the M-algorithm and the T-algorithm as well as particle filtering algorithms. The algorithmic concepts are very close, since the difference is simply the choice of the norm in the weights calculation. The general framework yields hence a new interpretation of these algorithms and may give rise to a series of new algorithms by using general selection schemes or a different choice for the norm. We show that the (approximate) expectation maximization Viterbi algorithm (EMVA) profits from using Chi Squared optimal selection compared to the standard EMVA.

There is a bias estimation whenever the statistical (linear) model is under-specified, that is, when there are some omitted variables and they are correlated with the regressors. This work shows how an appropriate specification of a regime-switching model (independent or Markov-switching) can eliminate or reduce this correlation, hence the estimation bias. A demonstration is given, together with some Monte Carlo simulations. An empirical verification, based on Fisher's equation, is also provided.

Generally, methods for BSS consider several observations of the same recording. Single microphone analysis is the worst underdetermined case, but, it is also the more realistic one. In this article, the autoregressive structure (short term prediction) and the periodic signature (long term prediction) of voiced speech signal are modeled and a linear state space model with unknown parameters is derived. The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate these unknown parameters and therefore help source separation.	[Bensaid, Siouar; Schutz, Antony; Slock, Dirk T.

This technique extracts from the system outputs the multivariate relationships of the system natural modes, by means of the separation property of the Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT). Then, it applies a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to the KLT output vectors in order to give an optimal representation of data. Finally, it exploits an optimized Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to find the optimal parameters of a Gaussian mixture model. The resulting statistical system identification is thus based on the estimation of the multivariate probability density function (PDF) of system outputs, whose convergence towards that computed by kernel estimation has also been proved by verifying the asymptotically vanishing of Kullback-Leibler divergences. A large number of simulations on ECG signals demonstrated the validity and the excellent performance of this technique along with its applicability to noninvasive diagnosis of a large class of medical pathologies originated by unknown, unpractical to measure, physiological factors.

Mixture parameters (weights, means vectors, and covariance matrices) are estimated by the Expectation Maximization algorithm (EM) which maximizes the log-likelihood criterion. The similarity between a block in the current image and the more resembling one in a search window on the reference image is measured by the minimization of Extended Mahalanobis distance between the clusters of mixture. Performed experiments on sequences of real images have given good results, and PSNR reached 3 dB.

We assume that the measurement model relating the observed items and the latent variable, at each time, is a. Rasch model. Besides the description of these models, the objective aimed in this work, is the estimation of the parameters of the model by maximum likelihood method via an EM algorithm. We consider more deeply two classes of distribution for the longitudinal latent process: (1) the General Latent Markov process and a special case, (2) the latent autoregressive process of order one.

The technique is based on: i) the representation of the change detection problem in polar coordinates; and ii) a 2-step decision strategy. First of all the change information present in the multitemporal dataset is represented taking advantage from the framework for change detection in polar coordinates. Within this representation the Bayesian decision theory is applied twice: the first time for distinguishing changed from unchanged pixels; and the second one for discriminating different kinds of change within changed pixels. The procedure exploits the Expectation-Maximization algorithm and is completely automatic and unsupervised. Experiments carried out on high and very high resolution multispectral and multitemporal datasets confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Benefits from improved sensitivity include shorter acquisition times and smaller dose requirements. An order of magnitude increase in sensitivity over conventional technology is possible with the use of multipinhole collimators on conventional SPECT cameras. Here we present MGEANT Monte Carlo simulation results of a dual-isotope myocardial perfusion imaging study performed with a pair of focusing 20-pinhole collimators with tungsten apertures demonstrating that a complete rest/stress study is possible in 10 minutes with a reduced Tc-99m dose. Two radionuclides were simulated, Tc-99m (500 mu Ci, rest) and Tl-201 (200 mu Ci, stress), with 20% and 30% window sizes, respectively. Full isotropic emission was simulated for 8 gamma-ray lines. The imaging protocol consisted of 2 views per head with 300 s per view. The activity distributions were derived from the mathematical cardiac and torso (MCAT) phantom. Attenuation was modeled using a water phantom. Images were reconstructed using 75 iterations of pixel-based ordered subsets expectation maximization and post-filtered with an 12.5 mm (FWHM) 3D Gaussian filter. Scatter corrections were performed using the triple energy window method. Scatter comprises 37% and 61% of the total counts in the Tc-99m and Tl-201 energy windows, respectively. Tc-99m downscatter contributes 52% of the scatter component in the Tl-201 window, though tungsten fluorescence is negligible (0.2%). Reconstructed images are qualitatively in agreement with the input activity distributions.

The target application is browsing among these documents. A first partition of the data is built, based on geo-temporal measurement. The events found are then grouped according to geolocation. This is carried out through fitting a two-level hierarchy of mixture models to the data. Both mixtures are estimated in a Bayesian setting, with a variational procedure: the classical VBEM algorithm is applied for the finer level, while a new variational-Bayes-EM algorithm is introduced to search for suitable groups of mixture components from the finer level. Experimental results are reported on artificial and real data.

Our purpose was to develop a novel method of EC for non-cathartic dual-energy CTC (DE-CTC) using a subvoxel multi-spectral material classifier and a regional material decomposition method for differentiation of residual fecal materials from colonic soft-tissue structures. In this study, an anthropomorphic colon phantom, which was filled with a mixture of aqueous fiber (psyllium), ground foodstuff (cereal), and non-ionic iodinated agent (Omnipaque iohexol, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI), was scanned by a dual-energy CT scanner (SOMATON, Siemens) with two photon energies: 80 kVp and 140 kVp. The DE-CTC images were subjected to a dual-energy EC (DE-EC) scheme, in which a multi-spectral material classifier was used to compute the fraction of each material within one voxel by an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. This was followed by a regional material segmentation method for identifying of homogeneous sub-regions (tiles) as fecal materials from other tissue types. The results were compared with the structural-analysis cleansing (SA-EC) method based upon the CTC images of native phantom without fillings. The mean cleansing ratio of the DE-EC scheme was 96.57 +/- 1.21% compared to 76.3 +/- 5.56% of the SA-EC scheme. The soft-tissue preservation ratio of the DE-EC scheme was 97.05%+/- 0.64% compared to 99.25 +/- 0.77% of the SA-EC scheme.

Inferences for Mixtures of Distributions for Centrally Censored Data with Partial Identification	COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS			English	Article						Bayesian inference; EM algorithm; Fiducial inference; Gibbs sampler; MCMC; Middle censoring; Profile likelihood	EM ALGORITHM; PARAMETERS; DENSITIES	In this article, several methods to make inferences about the parameters of a finite mixture of distributions in the context of centrally censored data with partial identification are revised. These methods are an adaptation of the work in Contreras-Cristan, Gutierrez-Pena, and O'Reilly (2003) in the case of right censoring. The first method focuses on an asymptotic approximation to a suitably simplified likelihood using some latent quantities; the second method is based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Both methods make explicit use of latent variables and provide computationally efficient procedures compared to non-Bayesian methods that deal directly with the full likelihood of the mixture appealing to its asymptotic approximation. The third method, from a Bayesian perspective, uses data augmentation to work with an uncensored sample. This last method is related to a recently proposed Bayesian method in Baker, Mengersen, and Davis (2005). Our proposal of the three adapted methods is shown to provide similar inferential answers, thus offering alternative analyses.

This situation can often be encountered in photon-limited medical imaging applications such as MLEM reconstructed Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images. In this study, we propose a median non-local means filter for denoising low-SNR images. The proposed method incorporates a median filtering operation indirectly in the non-local means (NLM) method, which gives more robust estimation of the weights used to average the pixels in the image. For the application of multi-modality imaging such as PET/CT, we further extended the method to incorporate anatomical side information which can be obtained from co-registered CT images without segmentation to preserve abrupt changes between organs on PET images and reduce the computational cost of weight calculations. We applied the proposed method (AMNLM) to a PET/CT simulation, a real physical phantom study and a clinical patient study with lung lesions. The results suggest that the proposed method outperforms the standard Gaussian filtering approach, anisotropic-median diffusion filtering (AMDF) and NLM in terms of visual assessment and trade-off between lesion contrast and noise.

Probabilistic Robust Hyperbola Mixture Model for Interpreting Ground Penetrating Radar Data	2010 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS IJCNN 2010	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2010)	2010	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE			EM ALGORITHM; ELLIPSES; OBJECTS; IMAGES	This paper proposes a probabilistic robust hyperbola mixture model based on a classification expectation maximization algorithm and applies this algorithm to Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) spatial data interpretation. Previous work tackling this problem using the Hough transform or neural networks for identifying GPR hyperbolae are unsuitable for on-site applications owing to their computational demands and the difficulties of getting sufficient appropriate training data for neural network based approaches. By incorporating a robust hyperbola fitting algorithm based on orthogonal distance into the probabilistic mixture model, the proposed algorithm can identify the hyperbolae in GPR data in real time and also calculate the depth and the size of the buried utility pipes. The number of the hyperbolae can be determined by conducting model selection using a Bayesian information criterion. The experimental results on both the synthetic/simulated and real GPR data show the effectiveness of this algorithm.

For the channel estimation, we apply an expectation-maximization algorithm which adopts an iterative computation of maximum-likelihood parameter estimates, with a few number of iterations, the channel coefficient in each finger of Rake receiver can be efficiently estimated. A fuzzy step size LMS algorithm that adopts a variable step size for the interference cancellation is proposed in the multiuser transmission environment. To achieve a better performance, the joint of expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and fuzzy adaptive filter is presented for the DS-UWB systems and the simulation result is investigated as well.

For exponential distribution, the explicit expression of MLE of failure rate cannot be obtained when the intervals are not equal in length. The direct application of some numerical algorithms, such as the Newton-Raphson algorithm, is non-ideal because of the cumbersome second derivative. We apply some equivalent quantities to obtain the MLE of failure rate of exponential distribution. Based on the equivalent quantities and the Weibull-to-exponential transformation technique, we propose a new algorithm to obtain the MLEs for the parameters of progressive Type-I interval Weibull data. An example reanalysis and some simulation studies are carried out to illustrate the performance of the estimations using the new algorithm.

Although MHPA has been evaluated in multiple clinical studies, its accuracy can be limited under highly noisy conditions. The purpose of this study is to develop a 4D post-reconstruction method for suppressing noise in GSPECT MPI data. SPECT images acquired at different temporal points were first registered to the same point. By summing the registered images, the uncorrelated noise was greatly reduced and the myocardial signals were strengthened. The same process then repeated for different temporal points. A deformable registration with a simulated annealing optimization scheme was implemented in this work. The proposed method was evaluated using a simulation study on an extended cardiac torso phantom (XCAT). The projection data were first calculated analytically and Poisson noise was added with a level matching that in clinical data. An ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm was used in the reconstruction. The comparison of SPECT images without versus with the noise reduction showed that the proposed noise reduction method increased the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by an average factor of similar to 2.3. Our approach was able to substantially reduce image noise without losing faithful information of myocardial activities. The next step is to use this method to reduce noise in clinical GSPECT MPI data to improve the accuracy of MHPA, especially in a region with severe myocardial scar.

In applications one usually needs to rotate the estimated factor loading matrix in order to obtain a more understandable model. In this article, an l(1) penalization method is introduced for performing sparse factor analysis in which factor loadings naturally adopt a sparse representation, greatly facilitating the interpretation of the fitted factor model.

Here we augment PPCA with a temporal model in the latent space by coupling the latent variables in time with an autoregressive model and show that the new model may be viewed as a generalisation of PPCA. We present an algorithm which utilises both expectation maximisation and a forward-backward algorithm to infer the values of the model parameters and demonstrate that it is able to make good estimates of the parameter values for synthetic data. We show that the additional temporal information is advantageous when imputing values for missing observations when compared with two non-temporal PPCA methods, both against synthetic data and real UK industrial production output data.

In this paper, we propose a novel method of epitomized summarization of WCE videos for efficient visualization to a gastroenterologist. For each short sequence of a WCE video, an epitomized frame is generated. New constraints are introduced into the epitome formulation to achieve the necessary visual quality for manual examination, and an EM algorithm for learning the epitome is derived. First, the local context weights are introduced to generate the epitomized frame. The epitomized frame preserves the appearance of all the input patches from the frames of the short sequence. Furthermore, by introducing spatial distributions for semantic interpretation of image patches in our epitome formulation, we show that it also provides a framework to facilitate the semantic description of visual features to generate organized visual summarization of WCE video, where the patches in different positions correspond to different semantic information. Our experiments on real WCE videos show that, using epitomized summarization, the number of frames have to be examined by the gastroenterologist can be reduced to less than one-tenth of the original frames in the video.

We interpret the values of the short time Fourier transform of the microphone signals to be draws from a mixture of complex Watson distributions, a probabilistic model which naturally accounts for spatial aliasing. The parameters of the density are related to the a priori source probabilities, the power of the sources and the transfer function ratios from sources to sensors. Estimation formulas are derived for these parameters by employing the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The E-step corresponds to the estimation of the source presence probabilities for each time-frequency bin, while the M-step leads to a maximum signal-to-noise ratio (MaxSNR) beamformer in the presence of uncertainty about the source activity. Experimental results are reported for an implementation in a generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) like spatial beamforming configuration for 3 speech sources with significant coherent noise in reverberant environments, demonstrating the usefulness of the novel modeling framework.

In particular, when regression models are used to model phenotype as a function of SNP genotypes in several different genes, the most common approach is a complete case analysis, in which only individuals with no missing genotypes are included. But this can lead to substantial reduction in sample size and thus potential bias and loss in efficiency. A number of other methods for handling missing data are applicable, but have rarely been used in this context. The purpose of this paper is to describe how several standard methods for handling missing data can be applied or adapted to this problem, and to compare their performance using a simulation study. We demonstrate these techniques using an Alzheimer's disease association study. We show that the expectation-maximization algorithm and multiple imputation with a bootstrapped expectation-maximization sampling algorithm have the best properties of all the estimators studied.

A proposed representation of the human body is explored defined over joints that employs full conditional models learnt between connected joints. This representation is compared against a popular alternative defined over parts using approximated limb conditionals. It is shown that using full limb conditionals results in a model that is far more representative of the original training data. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that Expectation Maximization is suitable for estimating 31) pose and better convergence is achieved when using full limb conditionals. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method it is applied to the domain of 3D pose estimation using a single monocular image. Quantitative results are provided using the Human Eva dataset which confirm that the proposed method outperforms that of the competing part based model. In this work just a single model is learnt to represent all actions contained in the dataset which is applied to all subjects viewed from differing angles.

A therapeutic response is usually defined as variations of semi-quantitative parameters such as standardized uptake value (SUV) measured in PET scans performed during the treatment. However, this approach does not take into account volume variation and cannot address heterogeneous uptake variations within a tumor volume. Our fusion method is derived from multi-observation approaches principally used in the astronomy field and is aimed at merging several follow-up PET acquisitions in order to assess an accurate tumor metabolic volume variation, by automatically delineating the various uptake and shape variations of the tumor. The statistical approach developed assumes data can be modeled by a mixture distribution of random fields. The parameters defining the mixture distribution are estimated using the stochastic expectation maximization (SEM) method. The proposed fusion process has been applied to simulated follow-up PET images, considering tumors with non spherical shapes and inhomogeneous activity distributions. To assess the relevance of our fusion method, we have compared the resulting fused map with superposition of individual segmented maps obtained with the standard Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm. In the various cases considered the multi-observation fusion was more efficient than the superposition of FCM maps for the automatic delineation of different concentration activities based on the comparison of volume errors for both approaches. Future work will consist in evaluating the ability of the ASEM fusion method to evaluate clinical response to therapy in oncology applications.

ML Segmentation Strategies for Object Interference Compensation in FDG-PET Lesion Quantification	METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Workshop on Biosignal Interpretation (BSI)	JUN, 2009	New Haven, CT		Yale Univ	PET-CT; AWOSEM; partial volume effect correction; lesion quantification; targeted reconstruction	PARTIAL VOLUME CORRECTION; EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY	Background: Quantification of lesion activity by FDG uptake in oncological PET is severely limited by partial volume effects. A maximum likelihood (ML) expectation maximization (EM) algorithm considering regional basis functions (AWOSEM-region) had been previously developed. Regional basis functions are iteratively segmented and quantified, thus identifying the volume and the activity of the lesion. Objectives: Improvement of AWOSEM-region when analyzing proximal interfering hot objects is addressed by proper segmentation initialization steps and models of spill-out and partial volume effects. Conditions relevant to lung PET-CT studies are considered: 1) lesion close to hot organ (e.g. chest wall, heart and mediastinum), 2) two close lesions Methods: CT image was considered for pre-segmenting hot anatomical structures, never for lesion identification, solely defined by iterations on PET data Further resolution recovery beyond the smooth standard clinical image was necessary to start lesion segmentation A watershed algorithm was used to separate two close lesions. A subtraction of the spill-out-from a nearby hot organ was introduced to enhance a lesion for the initial. segmentation and start the further quantification steps. Biograph scanner blurring was modeled from phantom data in order to implement the procedure for 3D clinical lung. studies. Results: In simulations, the procedure was able to separate structures as close as one pixel-size (2.25 mm). Robustness against the. input segmentation errors defining the addressed objects Was tested showing that convergence was not sensitive to initial volume overestimates up to 130%. Poor robustness was found against underestimates. A clinical study of a small lung lesion close to chest wall displayed a good recovery of both lesion activity and volume. Conclusions: With proper initialization and models of spill-out from hot organs, AWOSEM-region can be successfully applied to lung oncological studies.	[De Bernardi, E.; Gallotta, F.

For multiple non-directional detectors, source is estimated by grid search on the joint log-likelihood of registered counts to find the MLE. For directional detectors, the well-known List Mode Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization Algorithm (MLEM) is extended to fuse information from multiple detectors and estimate the source in cartesian coordinates. Here, the angular event likelihoods from Compton scattering are projected into a common Cartesian grid followed by List Mode MLEM computations. We also derive multi-sensor fusion algorithms for a mix of both non-directional and directional detectors using combinations of MLE and MLEM methods. Results are presented which illustrate the behavior and performance of our proposed approaches.	[Deb, Budhaditya; Ross, J. A.

Assuming that we know a catalog of the background music, we develop a generative model for the superposed speech and music spectrograms. We represent the speech spectrogram by a Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) model and the music spectrogram by a conditional Poisson Mixture Model (PMM). By choosing the size of the catalog, i.e., the number of mixture components we can tradeoff speed versus accuracy. The combined hierarchical model leads to a mixture of multinomial distributions as the joint posterior of music and speech. Separation and hyper-parameter adaptation can be achieved via an Expectation Maximization algorithm. Experimental results show that separation performance of the algorithm is promising. Furthermore, we show that incorporating prior information such as volume adjustment parameter can enhance the separation performance.

In this study, the authors imputed missing values for the CA-125 tumor marker in a large data set of ovarian tumors that was used to develop models for predicting malignancy. Four imputation techniques were applied: regression imputation, expectation-maximization, data augmentation, and hotdeck. Models using the imputed data sets were compared with models without CA-125 to investigate the important clinical issue concerning the necessity of CA-125 information for diagnostic models and with models using only complete cases to investigate differences between imputation and complete case strategies for missing values. The models are based on Bayesian generalized linear models (GLMs) and Bayesian least squares support vector machines. Results indicate that the use of CA-125 resulted in small, clinically nonsignificant increases in the AUC of diagnostic models. Minor differences between imputation methods were observed, and imputing CA-125 resulted in minor differences in the AUC compared with complete case analysis (CCA). However, GLM parameter estimates of predictor variables often differed between CCA and models based on imputation. The authors conclude that CA-125 is not indispensable in diagnostic models for ovarian tumors and that missing value imputation is preferred over CCA.

In this paper, we derive a related yarn, for exponential family mixture models (EMMs) and test its accuracy using the weighted local maximum likelihood agglomerative clustering technique. Minimizing varKL between a reference and a restructured AM led previously to the variational expectation maximization (varEM) algorithm; which we extend to EMMs. We present results on a clustering task using AMs trained on 50 hrs of Broadcast News (BN). EMMs are trained on fMMI-PLP features combined with frame level phone posterior probabilities given by the recently introduced sparse representation phone identification process. As we reduce model size, we test the word error rate using the standard BN test set and compare with baseline models of the same size, trained directly from data.			pdognin@us.ibm.com; jrhershe@us.ibm.com; vgoel@us.ibm.com; pederao@us.ibm.com					CSISZAR I, 1991, ANN STAT, V19, P2032, DOI 10.1214/aos/1176348385; Dognin P.

In this paper, we propose a probabilistic interpretation of Sezer's algorithm and suggest a novel optimization procedure based on the EM algorithm. Comparisons of the performance in terms of missed detection rate show a clear superiority of the proposed approach.

Based on the Expectation-Maximisation method, we show that the new algorithm offers significative performance gain compared to classical ones pushing back the frontiers of the barcode technology.

We propose a velocity anisotropy correction method of time-of-flight (TOF) data for image reconstruction on the basis of the maximum likelihood-expectation maximization (ML-EM) method. We also examine the effect of the interpolation of the TOF data as the density of the TOF data has a considerable effect on image quality in the ML-EM method.

Goal is correct segmentation as well as maintaining the details of the lung region in the chest cavity. In particular, it is essential that the lung nodules inside the lungs as well as on the boundary regions be maintained for subsequent steps that aim at automatic detection and classification of nodules from LDCT scanning; a step for early diagnosis of lung cancer. An approach for segmentation based on combination of EM algorithm and morphological operations is presented. This algorithm is compared with respect two other approaches that are based on level sets and energy optimization by the Graph Cuts technique. Performance evaluation is conducted on a labeled data set from the Early Lung Cancer Action Program (ELCAP) database. The new segmentation approach provides comparable results to Level sets and Graph-Cuts, with the advantage of faster execution time, and minimal user interception.

One is region-labeling, which obeys the intensity-based classification methods. Although modeling the tissue intensity is straightforward by applying local statistical methods and spatial dependencies, the results might suffer from noise and incomplete data. The second group of techniques applies active contour models, in which the objective is to find the optimal partition of the image domain using a closed or open curve by using prior constraints on the shape variation. However, estimating optimal curve is intractable due to the incomplete observation data. This paper extends a previously reported joint active contour model for medical image segmentation in a new Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework, wherein the evolution curve is constrained not only by a shape-based statistical model but also by applying a hidden variable model from the image observation. In this approach, the hidden variable model is defined by the local voxel labeling computed from its likelihood function, depended on the image functions and the prior anatomical knowledge. Comparative results on segmenting putamen and caudate shapes in MR brain images confirmed both robustness and accuracy of the proposed curve evolution algorithm.

Image segmentation; curve evolution; statistical model; level set; EM algorithm	MODELS	This paper proposes a new Expectation-Maximization curve evolution algorithm for medical image segmentation. Traditional level set algorithms perform poorly when image information is incomplete, missing or some objects are corrupted. In such cases, statistical model-based segmentation methods are widely used since they allow object shape variations subject to shape prior constraints to overcome the incomplete or noisy information. Although matching robustly in dealing with noisy and low contrast images, the shape parameters are estimated intractably through the Maximum A Posterior (MAP) framework by using incomplete image features. In this paper, we present a statistical shape-based joint curve evolution algorithm for image segmentation based on the assumption that using hidden features of the image as missing data can simplify the estimation problem and help improve the matching performance. In our method, these hidden features are designed to be the local voxel labeling data determined based on the intensity distribution of the image and priori anatomical knowledge. Using an Expectation-Maximization formulation, both the hidden features and the object shapes can be extracted. In addition, this EM-based algorithm is applied to the joint parameter and non-parameter shape model for more accurate segmentation. Comparative results on segmenting putamen and caudate shapes in MR brain images confirm both robustness and accuracy of the proposed curve evolution algorithm.

In contrast to earlier approaches, where the distribution of noise was estimated based on a vector Taylor series expansion, we use a combination of importance sampling and Parzen-window density estimation to numerically approximate the occurring integrals with the Monte Carlo method. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has superior convergence properties, compared to previous implementations of the EM algorithm. Its application to speech feature enhancement reduced the word error rate by over 30% on a phone number recognition task recorded in a (real) noisy car environment.

J	Fu, ZH; Tao, JA; Shi, NZ				Fu, Zhi-Hui; Tao, Jian; Shi, Ning-Zhong			Bayesian estimation of the multidimensional graded response model with nonignorable missing data	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION			English	Article						Bayesian estimation; data augmentation; Gibbs sampling; item response theory; nonignorable missing data	ITEM NONRESPONSE; EM ALGORITHM	A Bayesian approach is developed for analysing item response models with nonignorable missing data. The relevant model for the observed data is estimated concurrently in conjunction with the item response model for the missing-data process. Since the approach is fully Bayesian, it can be easily generalized to more complicated and realistic models, such as those models with covariates. Furthermore, the proposed approach is illustrated with item response data modelled as the multidimensional graded response models. Finally, a simulation study is conducted to assess the extent to which the bias caused by ignoring the missing-data mechanism can be reduced.

In order to realize this system, a robot has to provide two functions: mimicking and evaluating the child's motion in real time. The former function is achieved by selecting key frames using the Q-Learning approach to remove noisy camera data. The latter is established via a cluster-based framework on Mixture Gaussian and Expectation-Maximization algorithm using parameters which are converted by Principal Component Analysis. Practical experiments are shown in which autistic children interact with a robot and are trained by executing specific tasks for improving imitation skill.

The main results encompass consistency and asymptotic normality of the method of moments estimators. Also, the asymptotic covariance matrix of the maximum likelihood estimator is derived, extending some existing results in elliptical distributions. A measure of asymptotic relative efficiency is reported. Wald-type statistics are considered and numerical results obtained by Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the performance of estimators and tests are provided for Student-t and contaminated normal distributions. An application to a real dataset is also included.

The motivation behind this work is to develop a computationally efficient and robust algorithm for estimation of wastewater treatment plant model parameters. The mathematical model of the plant is required for the application of advanced predictive control algorithms and condition monitoring. The presented algorithm employs the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to compute the Maximum likelihood estimates of the unknown model parameters. The algorithm uses the Unscented Transformation (UT) to approximate the posterior distribution of the random variable that undergoes a nonlinear transformations. The advantage of this approach lies in efficient approximation methods that greatly reduce the computational load of the algorithm and is therefore suitable for on-line implementation.

There were one network module and four kernel modules (sensor, controller, actuator and interference nodes) on this simulation platform, and the composition and the main Matlab codes of each module were presented. On the simulation platform designed, the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm was achieved to derive the parameters of the DTHMM and the Viterbi algorithm was achieved to predict the controller-to-actuator delay (C-A delay) in the current sampling period. Based on the derived DTHMM and the predicted delays, a state-feedback controller to stabilize the NCS was also implemented on the simulation platform and used to solve the linear matrix inequalities. Taking a damped compound pendulum as the plant in the NCS, after 500 sampling periods the effectiveness of the modeling and controlling methods was carried out, and demonstrated the efficiency and easy operation of the simulation platform.

Task-Oriented and Study-Dependent Optimization of 3D and Fully 4D Reconstruction Parameters for [F-18]FDG Imaging	2010 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD (NSS/MIC)	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium (NSS)/Medical Imaging Conference (MIC)/17th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X-ray and Gamma-ray Detectors	OCT 30-NOV 06, 2010	Knoxville, TN	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Nucl & Plasma Sci Soc, IEEE				3D and fully 4D dynamic PET iterative image reconstructions are usually performed with a predefined set of reconstruction parameters (number of iterations, level of smoothing, number and type of basis functions used in the 4D reconstruction). These parameters are often chosen without due attention to i) the specific task (reason for the scan) and ii) the unique characteristics of the acquired data at hand. For the task of functional parameter estimation (such as glucose metabolic rate), both the image reconstruction parameters and the statistics of the unique dataset have a significant impact on the final estimates. As such, there is a need for a more systematic approach to reconstruction parameter selection. This work investigates the impact of using both 3D and fully 4D reconstruction on kinetic parameter estimation (influx rate constant (K-i)) for an [F-18]FDG brain imaging data set acquired on the high resolution research tomograph (HRRT). Using a data-subsetting approach, it is shown that the choice of iteration number significantly affects the final kinetic parameter estimates (influx rate constant (K-i)) and hence the iteration number can be more optimally selected for each unique data set to deliver lower errors in the parameter estimates. As such, the approach advocates a study-dependent and task-oriented early stopping of the EM algorithm.

The learning procedure is performed by means of a expectation maximization (EM) methodology. The key feature of our approach is related to a top-down hierarchical search for the number of components, together with the integration of the model selection criterion within a modified EM procedure, used for the learning the mixture parameters. We start with a single component covering the whole data set. Then new components are added and optimized to best cover the data. The process is recursive and builds a binary tree like structure that effectively explores the search space. We show that our approach is faster that state-of-the-art alternatives, is insensitive to initialization, and has better data fits in average. We elucidate this through a series of experiments, both with synthetic and real data.

However, most image segmentation approaches are still too slow to allow real-time robot operation. In this paper we explore a new method for image segmentation based on the expectation maximization algorithm applied to Gaussian Mixtures. Our approach is fully automatic in the choice of the number of mixture components, the initialization parameters and the stopping criterion. The rationale is to start with a single Gaussian in the mixture, covering the whole data set, and split it incrementally during expectation maximization steps until a good data likelihood is reached. Singe the method starts with a single Gaussian, it is more computationally efficient that others, especially in the initial steps. We show the effectiveness of the method in a series of simulated experiments both with synthetic and real images, including experiments with the iCub humanoid robot.

The probabilistic approach to neural networks provides a statistically justified subspace method of classification. The underlying structural mixture model includes binary structural parameters and can be optimized by EM algorithm in full generality. Formally, the structural model reduces the number of parameters included and therefore the structural mixtures become less complex and less prone to overfitting. We illustrate how recognition accuracy and the effect of overfitting is influenced by mixture complexity and by the size of training data set.

Since the optimization problem is formulated in the cross-ambiguity function (CAF) domain of the transmitted signal and the received array outputs, the proposed technique is called as PSO-CAF. The performance of the PSO-CAF is compared with the space alternating generalized expectation maximization (SAGE) technique and with another recently proposed PSO based technique for various SNR values. Simulation results indicate the superior performance of the PSO-CAF technique over mentioned techniques for all SNR values.

At times, new extracted features might be linear combinations of some primitive features that are not able to provide better classification accuracy. To solve this problem, we propose the integration of genetic programming and the expectation maximization algorithm (GP-EM) to automatically synthesize feature functions based on primitive input features for breast cancer detection. With the Gaussian mixture model, the proposed algorithm is able to perform nonlinear transformations of primitive feature vectors and data modeling simultaneously. Compared to the performance of other algorithms, such us the support vector machine, multi-layer perceptrons, inductive machine learning and logistic regression, which all used the entire primitive feature set, the proposed algorithm achieves a higher recognition rate by using one single synthesized feature function.

In this paper, the technique of the feature generation is carried out by integrating genetic programming and the expectation maximization algorithm with the fitness of the mean square error measure (GP-EM-MSE) in order to improve the overall performance of a hand-based biometric system. The GP program trees of the approach are utilized to find optimal generated feature representations in a nonlinear fashion; derived from EM, the learning task results in the simple k-means problem that reveals better convergence properties. As a subsequent refinement of the identification, GP-EM-MSE exhibits an improved capability which achieves a recognition rate of 96% accuracy by using the generated features, better than the performance obtained by the selected primitive features.

In constructing a blog entry classifier, we need as training data a rather large set of blog entries that are manually labeled with a class label. In contrast, we can easily obtain a set of blog sites with class labels. In this paper, we present a method for constructing a blog entry classifier using only a set of blog sites with class labels. Our method is based on the Naive Bayes classifier coupled with the EM algorithm.

A joint iterative algorithm is developed based on the maximum a posteriori expectation-maximization (MAP-EM) algorithm. In addition, a novel algorithm is also proposed to obtain the initial estimates of CFO and channels. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed CFO and channel estimators approaches to that of the estimators with full training at high SNRs. Moreover, after convergence, the performance of data detection is close to the ideal case with perfect CFO and channel state information.

Tolerance relation can describe the concept of Granular systems. In this paper, a novel definition of Granular System(GS), which is described by metric function under the framework of tolerance relation, is presented, concepts are created upon GS, and we introduce semi-supervised learning into the Granular computing for concepts creating. For this purpose, a novel back propagation approach is developed for concepts learning.

Cortical surface parcellation; optimal combination; performance estimation	HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; BRAIN; SEGMENTATION; IMAGES; REGISTRATION; ALGORITHM; FRAMEWORK	A variety of methodologies have been developed for the parcellation of human cortical surface into sulcal or gyral regions due to its importance in structural and functional mapping of the human brain. However, characterizing the performance of surface parcellation methods and the estimation of ground truth of segmentation are still open problems. In this paper, we present an algorithm for simultaneous truth and performance estimation of various approaches for human cortical surface parcellation. The probabilistic true segmentation is estimated as a weighted combination of the segmentations resulted from multiple methods. Afterward, an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to optimize the weighting depending on the estimated performance level of each method. Furthermore, a spatial homogeneity constraint modeled by the Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) theory is incorporated to refine the estimated true segmentation into a spatially homogenous decision. The proposed method has been evaluated using both synthetic and real data. The experimental results demonstrate the validity of the method proposed in this paper. Also, it has been used to generate reference sulci regions to perform a comparison study of three methods for cortical surface parcellation.

In this simulation the camera consists of one large field of view detector with parallel-hole collimation and a smaller field of view high resolution detector with pinhole collimation. The parallel-hole collimated detector images the whole brain and acquires data without truncation. It localizes areas of particular diagnostic interest, and also provides support information for the reconstruction of data acquired by the pinhole collimated detectors. The pinhole collimated detector images small regions of the brain. It provides high resolution truncated projections, from which a high resolution region of interest (ROI) is obtained. The reconstruction is performed using a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate with total variation regularization within the ROI. The low resolution image from the parallel-hole collimated detector is used as prior information. This improves the quantitation for the interior problem. The combination of a large field of view parallel-hole collimated detector and a smaller field of view high resolution pinhole detector improves the quantitation in the simulated brain imaging study. It makes use of the high sensitivity of the pinhole collimator while compensates for the degradation in the reconstructed image due to interior problem caused by the small field of view of the pinhole collimator. Our simulations show potential for clinical application, where the quantitation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral vascular reactivity (CVR) are valuable in diagnosis of ischemia, and the quantitation of benzodiazepine receptor density is important in evaluating neuronal damage due to ischemic effects.

The aim is to devise a robust unsupervised segmentation approach that can segment a color textured image more accurately. Here, color and texture information of each individual pixel along with the spatial relationship within its neighborhood have been considered for producing more accuracy in segmentation. In this particular work, the problem we want to investigate is to implement a robust unsupervised Multidimensional Spatially Variant Finite Mixture Model (MSVFMM) based color image segmentation approach using Cluster Ensembles and MRF model along with Daubechies wavelet transforms for increasing the content sensitivity of the segmentation model in order to get a better accuracy in segmentation. Here, Cluster Ensemble has been utilized as a robust automatic tool for finding the number of components in an image. The main idea behind this work is introducing a Bayesian inference based approach to estimate the Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) to identify the different objects/components in a color image. Markov Random Field (MRF) plays a crucial role in capturing the relationships among the neighboring pixels. An Expectation Maximization (EM) model fitting MAP algorithm segments the image utilizing the pixel's color and texture features and the captured neighborhood relationships among them. The algorithm simultaneously calculates the model parameters and segments the pixels iteratively in an interleaved manner. Finally, it converges to a solution where the model parameters and pixel labels are stabilized within a specified criterion. Finally, we have compared our results with another recent segmentation approach 1101, which is similar in nature. The experimental results reveal that the proposed approach is capable of producing more accurate and faithful segmentation and can be employed in different practical image content understanding applications.

Biometric features such as fingerprint, face, iris, hand geometry and more recently dental features are being used for human identification. Image analysis of each of these biometric features has various challenges to overcome. To address such contemporary problems of image segmentation, we provide a novel approach based on maximum a posteriori (MAP) fitting Gaussian mixture model using Expectation-Minimization (EM) algorithm within the Bayesian framework. Our new algorithm captures the pixel intensity by the likelihood term in Bayesian Networks, and a priori biasing term of the spatial location information with the help of Markov Random Fields (MRF) model. We have employed a novel approach of using Daubechies wavelet transform for texture feature extraction that uses MRF model and a robust technique of determining the number of pixel classes based on Cluster Ensembles for a reliable segmentation of dental X-ray images. We present how our approach could be applied in dental biometrics to achieve very fast and reliable human identification. Experiments show that our new unsupervised image segmentation technique provides accurate feature extraction and teeth segmentation for effective biometric identification.

To overcome this limit, we may increase the number of samples by using the wobbling motion. Since the line spread function (LSF) of the sinogram is determined by the detector width, however, the increase of the number of samples is not sufficient to improve the sinogram resolution. In this paper, based on oversampled data obtained from the wobbling motion, we propose a novel and efficient super-resolution (SR) scheme for the sinogram. Since the proposed SR scheme adopts the penalized expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, it guarantees non-negative values of the super-resolved sinogram data. Through the experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed SR scheme can noticeably improve the spatial image resolution.

The proposed estimator works for many types of space-time codes (STC), including full-rate full-diversity (FRFD) codes, Bell Laboratories layered space-time architecture (BLAST) and orthogonal STC's. The principle idea is to treat the channel coefficients as the unknown parameters, and the transmitted symbols as the unobserved variables in the EM algorithm. The posterior distribution of the symbols is approximated by a factorized distribution, whose Kullback-Liebler divergence with the true distribution is minimized, thereby explaining the "variational" aspect of the technique. The channel estimates may then be used for coherent decoding - here we use the K-best detector for a 2 x 2 system. Simulation results show that the new channel estimator can reduce system complexity greatly compared with traditional schemes, while achieving near-ideal performance.

The instrument utilizes a mechanically cooled indium antimonide focal plane array which is optically coupled using an Offner relay to a state-of the-art two-dimensional grating. The grating is a computer-generated hologram design fabricated by electron-beam lithography on a convex substrate. The system performs shapshot capture of the spatial and spectral information in a scene, enabling transient events to be characterized. The shortwave spectral information in the higher diffraction orders was reconstructed using existing expectation maximization methodologies while a co-registered thermal image from the zeroth-order was analyzed. A co-registered contour map of the shortwave information was displayed superimposed on the thermal image and processed for accurate retrieval of scene knowledge. Spectral accuracy and radiometric test and evaluation results such as noise equivalence temperature difference (NEDT) and minimum resolvable temperature difference (MRTD) are presented for this new spectral imager and a general explanation is given for the theory of its tomographic operation.

In the fuzzy EM algorithm, the dissimilarity function is defined as the multiplicative inverse of probability density function. Different from FCMs, the defined dissimilarity function is based on the exponential function of the distance. The fuzzy EM algorithm is compared with normal EM algorithm in terms of fitting degree and convergence speed. The experimental results in modeling random data and various characters demonstrate the ability of the proposed algorithm in reducing the computational cost of GMMs.	[Ju, Zhaojie; Liu, Honghai] Univ Portsmouth, Sch Creat Technol, Intelligent Syst & Robot Grp, Portsmouth PO1 2UP, Hants, England	Ju, ZJ (reprint author), Univ Portsmouth, Sch Creat Technol, Intelligent Syst & Robot Grp, Portsmouth PO1 2UP, Hants, England.	zhao-jie.ju@port.ac.uk; hong-hai.liu@port.ac.uk					Agiomyrgiannakis Y, 2009, IEEE T AUDIO SPEECH, V17, P775, DOI 10.1109/TASL.2008.2008229; Bezdek J.C., 1981, PATTERN RECOGNITION; Bilmes J.A., 1998, ICSITR970, P1; CHAN CS, 2009, FUZZY SYSTEMS IEEE T, V17, P1; CHOE H, 1992, FUZZY IEEE, P349; DAVID Z, 2008, COMMUNICATIONS IEEE, V56, P2094; Dunn JC, 1973, CYBERNET SYST, V3, P32, DOI 10.1080/01969727308546046; GATH I, 1989, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V11, P773, DOI 10.1109/34.192473; Gustafson Donald E., 1978, DEC CONTR INCL 17 S, V17, P761; HATHAWAY RJ, 1986, STAT PROBABIL LETT, V4, P53, DOI 10.1016/0167-7152(86)90016-7; Huang X, 1990, HIDDEN MARKOV MODELS; Ichihashi H., 2001, P 10 IEEE INT C FUZZ, V2, P924; Ji XF, 2010, IEEE T SYST MAN CY C, V40, P13, DOI 10.1109/TSMCC.2009.2027608; Ju ZJ, 2009, ADV ROBOTICS, V23, P1359, DOI 10.1163/156855309X462628; Liu H, 2008, IEEE T FUZZY SYST, V16, P808, DOI 10.1109/TFUZZ.2007.905922; Liu HH, 2008, IEEE T FUZZY SYST, V16, P1522, DOI 10.1109/TFUZZ.2008.2005004; Malegaonkar AS, 2007, IEEE T AUDIO SPEECH, V15, P1859, DOI 10.1109/TASL.2007.896665; Miyamoto S., 1997, P 7 INT FUZZ SYST AS, V2, P86; Montagnuolo M, 2007, DEXA 2007: 18TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATABASE AND EXPERT SYSTEMS APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS, P99; PAL NR, 1995, IEEE T FUZZY SYST, V3, P370, DOI 10.1109/91.413225; Pei J., SPIE P SERIES, P246; Persson D, 2008, IEEE T IMAGE PROCESS, V17, P145, DOI 10.1109/TIP.2007.914151; Routtenberg T, 2009, IEEE T SIGNAL PROCES, V57, P1717, DOI 10.1109/TSP.2008.2011825; Siu MH, 2009, IEEE T AUDIO SPEECH, V17, P187, DOI 10.1109/TASL.2008.2006653; Song JH, 2008, IEEE SIGNAL PROC LET, V15, P103, DOI 10.1109/LSP.2007.911184; Takahashi S, 2009, IEICE T FUND ELECTR, VE92A, P900, DOI 10.1587/transfun.E92.A.900; Tran D., 1998, 5 INT C SPOK LANG PR, P759; Ververidis D, 2008, IEEE T SIGNAL PROCES, V56, P2797, DOI 10.1109/TSP.2008.917350; Vondra M, 2009, LECT NOTES ARTIF INT, V5398, P256; Wahab A, 2009, IEEE T NEURAL NETWOR, V20, P563, DOI 10.1109/TNN.2008.2007906; WANG X, 2008, COMP SCI SOFTW ENG 2, V2, P923; Yu J, 2004, IEEE T SYST MAN CY B, V34, P634, DOI 10.1109/TSMCB.2003.810951	32	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	1098-7584	978-1-4244-6920-8	IEEE INT CONF FUZZY			2010												6	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Computer Science; Engineering	BTO07	WOS:000287453600017

An estimate of the average radar cross section (RCS) of the target is required in order to adjust transmitted power based on the estimate such that a desired SNR can be realized. In this paper, a maximum-likelihood (ML) approach is presented for estimating the average RCS, and a numerical solution to the approach is proposed based on a generalized expectation maximization (GEM) algorithm. Estimation accuracy of the approach is compared to that of a previously reported procedure.

We provide a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem for the case of two Gaussians in n dimensions (even if they overlap), with provably minimal assumptions on the Gaussians, and polynomial data requirements. In statistical terms, our estimator converges at an inverse polynomial rate, and, no such estimator (even exponential time) was known for this problem (even in one dimension). Our algorithm reduces the n-dimensional problem to the one-dimensional problem, where the method of moments is applied. One technical challenge is proving that noisy estimates of the first six moments of a univariate mixture suffice to recover accurate estimates of the mixture parameters, as conjectured by Pearson (1894), and in fact these estimates converge at an inverse polynomial rate. As a corollary, we can efficiently perform near-optimal clustering: in the case where the overlap between the Gaussians is small, one can accurately cluster the data, and when the Gaussian:3 have partial overlap, one can still accurately cluster those data points which are not in the overlap region. A second consequence is a polynomial-time density estimation algorithm for arbitrary mixtures of two Gaussians, generalizing previous work on axis-aligned Gaussians (Feldman et al, 2006).

The method usually has two steps: inference of haplotype frequencies and inference of diplotype for each subject. The first step can be done by using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, but it incurs an unreasonably large calculation cost when the number of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci of concern is large. In this article, we describe an approximate probabilistic model of haplotype frequencies. The model is constructed by using several distributions of nearby local SNPs. This approximation seems good because SNPs are generally more strongly correlated when they are close to one another on a chromosome. To implement this approach, we use a log linear model, the Walsh-Hadamard transform, and a combinatorial optimization method. Artificial data suggested that the overall haplotype inference of our method is good if there are nine or more local consecutive SNPs. Some minor problems should be dealt with before this method can be applied to real data.

Our multidimensional model is estimated by maximizing a penalized log-likelihood function, while previous mixed-type models were estimated by maximum likelihood methods for one-dimensional data. The penalized estimation performs well for our multidimensional model, while maximum likelihood methods yield unstable parameter estimates and some of the parameter estimates are infinite. Numerical experiments are conducted to investigate the effectiveness of our method for some types of missing data. The proposed method is applied to handwriting data, which consist of the XY coordinates values in handwritings.

The space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm is used to improve the receiver performance from the one obtained by using the pilot symbol based least-squares (LS) channel estimator. The DD channel estimation improves the performance with high user velocities, where the pilot symbol density is not sufficient. The DD channel estimation can also be used to reduce the pilot overhead without any performance degradation by transmitting data instead of pilot symbols. The complexity of the SAGE channel estimator is discussed as well.

The scenario studied represents a multiple-input (MI) situation wherein the multiple inputs are all equal (i.e. repetition coding). Each of the cooperation-involved nodes presents independent carrier frequency offset (CFO) to the destination receiver. The optimized iterative destination receiver employs the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for inner-loop detection, and an outer-loop Soft-Input Soft-Output (SISO) Viterbi algorithm. Thus, it iteratively estimates the doubly selective channels of the source and relay nodes, compensate for the multiple CFO, and decode the message. Due to the multiplicity of CFO present, the resulting detection algorithm becomes more involved. The novel receiver developed to successfully deal with this situation is termed Cooperative Optimized Independent per Node Receiver (CO-ICFO). The system employs M-ary Phase Shift Keying (MPSK) modulation. A minimum number of embedded pilots is used for initial channel estimation of each link through the Least Squares Estimation (LSE) algorithm. Both systems with and without Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) are considered. High cooperation diversity gains, on the order of 4 dB are achieved, without ARQ, while the gain with ARQ is reduced to about 3 dB. The presented results show that in general, cooperation offers high gains. Further, adding ARQ results in significantly better performance and more system flexibility.

First, cepstral domain missing feature marginalization is established using a linear transformation, after tying the mean and variance of non-existing cepstral coefficients. Second, IBM estimation is formulated using a generalized expectation maximization algorithm directly to optimize the ASR performance. Experimental results show that even in highly non-stationary mismatch condition (dance music as background noise), the proposed method achieves much higher absolute ASR accuracy improvement ranging from 14.69% at 0 dB SNR to 40.10% at 15 dB SNR compared with the conventional noise suppression method.

The biometric multimodal interface can recognize a user's emotion and concentration status by analyzing ECG(electrocardiogram) and EEG(electroencephalogram) patterns. The electroencephalogram analysis system utilizes 5 basic signal values to predict the concentration status of the user: MID_BETA, THETA, ALPHA, DELTA, and GAMMA signal. To recognize the user's electrocardiogram signal patterns, K-means-based EM algorithm was applied. In emotion recognition, the neural emotion showed the highest accuracy, and three emotions were in a range of 55.8 to 75.1% accuracy. Stress recognition showed a high performance result of 83.2% accuracy.

The mixture densities to be learned allow for nonlinear dependencies between the variables and exact closed-form inference. For learning the network's parameters, an incremental gradient ascent algorithm is derived. Analytic expressions for the partial derivatives and their combination with messages are presented. This hybrid approach subsumes the existing approach for purely discrete-valued networks and is applicable to partially observable networks, too.

Registration techniques needed for conflation can be rigid or non-rigid, depending on the underlying transformation. A key characteristic of rigid transformation is that all distances are preserved. Fully automated conflation still remains a major challenge, primarily due to the inability of existing algorithms to cope with the complex non-linear transformation models required for a complete solution. Our objective in this paper is to improve the accuracy of the conflation by incorporating a non-rigid transformation in to the above solution. We discuss the essentials of a probabilistic approach to solving the correspondence/conflation problem for a pair of vector datasets. We then describe the results of our approach implemented on OpenJUMP, an open source Geographic Information Science (GIS) platform.

Hyperparameter selection for OSEM SPECT reconstruction in mesh domain with total variation regularization	MEDICAL IMAGING 2010: PHYSICS OF MEDICAL IMAGING	Proceedings of SPIE-The International Society for Optical Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Medical Imaging - Physics of Medical Imaging	FEB 15-18, 2010	San Diego, CA	SPIE		OSEM MAP reconstruction; total variation regularization; mesh domain; hyperparameter selection; L-curve method	BAYESIAN RECONSTRUCTION; IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION; EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; EM ALGORITHM; POSED PROBLEMS; L-CURVE; RESOLUTION; MODEL	The purpose of this study was investigation of the L-curve method performance for the optimized hyperparameter selection in maximum a posteriori (MAP) Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization (OSEM) Single Photon Computed Emission Tomography (SPECT) reconstruction in mesh domain with Total Variation (TV) regularization for different noise levels and three different mesh resolutions. Reconstruction with TV prior requires tuning of only one Bayesian hyperparameter beta. This was accomplished by application of the L-curve method. We analyzed the reconstructed image quality for various values of beta and investigated the relationship between the optimized beta, the mesh structure and the noise level in the projection data. We have found that each obtained L-curve exhibited one well-defined minimum and the optimal trade-off between noise and spatial resolution in the reconstructed images occurred for the value of beta defined by that minimum. The L-curves minima shifted towards lower values with increasing mesh resolution and towards higher values with increasing noise in the SPECT data. The shape of the L-curve depended on the mesh resolution and the noise level. By analyzing the reconstructed image quality, we have verified that the L-curve method is a suitable tool for estimation of the optimized value for the hyperparameter.

In general, the SAGE method transforms a multidimensional search problem into a sequence of one-dimensional searches, which greatly simplifies the estimation procedure. However, the conventional algorithms based on the SAGE method require a large amount of computations to estimate the CFO due to exhaustive grid search. To reduce the computational burden, we exploit the leakage on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) output of the received signal after the multiple access interference is removed by the SAGE method. Then, this leakage-based approach reduces the complexity of the conventional SAGE algorithm regardless of an employed carrier assignment scheme by avoiding grid search. Simulation results show that our modified SAGE algorithm approaches the Cramer Rao bound at all signal to noise ratio (SNR) region with greatly reduced complexity compared to the conventional SAGE algorithms.

Since the size of the system matrix for a typical Compton camera is extremely large, it is impractical to use a caching scheme that reads pre-stored values of the elements of the system matrix instead of repeatedly calculating conical projection and backprojection which are the most time consuming operations. In this paper we propose GPU (graphics processing unit) accelerated methods that can rapidly perform conical projection and backprojection on the fly. Since the conventional ray-based backprojection method is inefficient for GPU, we develop fully voxel-based conical backprojection methods using two different approaches. In the first approach, we approximate the intersecting chord length of the ray passing through a voxel with the normal distance from the center of the voxel to the ray. In the second approach, each voxel is regarded as a dimensionless point, and the backprojection is performed without the need for calculating intersecting chord lengths. Our experimental studies with the M-BSREM (modified block sequential regularized EM) algorithm show that GPU-based methods significantly outperforms the conventional CPU-based method in computation time without a considerable loss of reconstruction accuracy.

J	Lee, W; Shi, JQ; Lee, Y				Lee, Woojoo; Shi, Jian Qing; Lee, Youngjo			Approximate conditional inference in mixed-effects models with binary data	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article							GENERALIZED LINEAR-MODELS; 2 X-2 TABLES; LIKELIHOODS; METAANALYSIS	The conditional likelihood approach is a sensible choice fora hierarchical logistic regression model or other generalized regression models with binary data. However, its heavy computational burden limits its use, especially for the related mixed-effects model. A modified profile likelihood is used as an accurate approximation to conditional likelihood, and then the use of two methods for inferences for the hierarchical generalized regression models with mixed effects is proposed. One is based on a hierarchical likelihood and Laplace approximation method, and the other is based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo EM algorithm. The methods are applied to a meta-analysis model for trend estimation and the model for multi-arm trials. A simulation study is conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed methods.

One important category of approaches uses distance measurements between anchors and sensors to localize the unknown node. However, most approaches assume that the anchor positions are perfectly known, while in practice the anchor positions may not be accurate due to estimation errors as well as observation errors. In this paper, we study the localization of wireless sensor node with erroneous anchors, and propose an EM estimator which iteratively refines the anchor positions and estimates the sensor location. Simulation results shows that the EM estimator converges in a few iterations and outperforms the existing robust least squares algorithm.

Artifact aware tracking of left ventricular contours in 3D ultrasound	MEDICAL IMAGING 2010: IMAGE PROCESSING	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Medical Imaging 2010 - Image Processing	FEB 14-16, 2010	San Diego, CA	SPIE, Medtronic, Inc., Aeroflex, Inc., OpenXi, Tungsten Heavy Powder, Inc.		Echocardiography; artifact detection; segmentation; expectation maximization	ACTIVE APPEARANCE MODELS; OPTICAL-FLOW TECHNIQUES; ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC SEQUENCES; CLUTTER REJECTION; SEGMENTATION; IMAGES; MOTION; ALGORITHM	The analysis of echocardiograms, whether visual or automated, is often hampered by ultrasound artifacts which obscure the moving myocardial wall. In this study, a probabilistic framework for tracking the endocardial surface in 3D ultrasound images is proposed, which distinguishes between visible and artifact-obscured myocardium. Motion estimation of visible myocardium relies more using a local, data-driven tracker, whereas tracking of obscured myocardium is assisted by a global, statistical model of cardiac motion. To make this distinction, the expectation-maximization algorithm is applied in a stationary and dynamic frame-of-reference. Evaluation on 35 three-dimensional echocardiographic sequences shows that this artifact-aware tracker gives better results than when no distinction is made. In conclusion, the proposed tracker is able to reduce the influence of artifacts, potentially improving quantitative analysis of clinical quality echocardiograms.	[Leung, K. Y.

The proposed method consists of two major steps. First, the cortical surface is automatically parcellated into sulcal based regions using several procedures: estimating principal curvatures and principal directions; applying the hidden Markov random field and the Expectation-Maximization (HMRF-EM) framework for sulcal region segmentation based on the maximum principal curvature; diffusing the maximum principal direction field in order to propagate reliable and informative principal directions at gyral crests and sulcal bottoms to other flat cortical regions with noisy principal directions by minimization of an energy function; tracking the flow field towards sulcal bottoms to parcellate the cortical surfaces into sulcal basins. The sulcal parcellation provides a very good initialization for the following steps of gyral parcellation on cortical surfaces. Second, based on the sulcal parcellation results, the cortical surface is further parcellated into gyral based regions using the following procedures: extracting gyral crest segments; dilating gyral crest segments; inverting the principal direction flow field and tracking the flow field towards gyral crests in order to partition the cortical surface into a collection of gyral patches; merging gyral patches to obtain gyral parcellation of the cortical surface. The proposed algorithm pipeline is applied to nine randomly selected cortical surfaces of normal brains and promising results are obtained. The accuracy of the semi-automatic gyral parcellation is comparable to that labeled manually by experts.

The new algorithms take full advantage of some known channel information (for example, the length of channel impulse response L which can be estimated easily and explicitly by systems) to reduce computational complexity, the impact of noise and interference. Special time-domain training sequences were designed to accomplish these algorithms in simple and efficient ways. Firstly, the paper derived a precise mathematical model and the coarse CFO acquisition in which the influence of unknown multipath Channel Impulse Response (CIR) can be removed. Then mathematics seal solution Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection for coarse CFO is formulated instead of EM iteration detection. Secondly, time-domain CIR estimation algorithm is formulated with the advantage of noise and residual CFO reduction. Moreover, the new CIR estimator adopts matrix dimension reduction algorithm to reduce computational complexity. Thirdly, to improve the CFO acquisition performance, improved Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is employed as fine CFO acquisition. Simulation results indicate that compared with classical EM algorithm, the performance and convergent speed of EM iteration are both improved.

Two special cases are considered: 1) Longest Queue First (LQF) scheduling, where the priorities are computed using queue lengths, and 2) Static Priority (SP) scheduling, where the priorities are preassigned. We first propose a closed-form lower bound stability region for LQF scheduling, and discuss the tightness result in some scenarios. We then propose an lower bound stability region for SP scheduling with multiple priority vectors, as well as a heuristic priority assignment algorithm, which is related to the well-known Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The performance gain of the proposed heuristic algorithm is finally confirmed by simulations.

The problem is presented as the joint Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation of the channel parameters where typically, the high dimensional non-linear cost function is deemed to be too computationally expensive to be solved directly. Simulation results show that the proposed method is extremely robust to initialisation errors and low SNR environments, while at the same time it is also computationally more efficient than popular iterative ML methods i.e. the Space-Alternating Generalised Expectation-maximisation (SAGE) algorithm.

In this paper, a novel method using the texture-based boundary enhancement and active contour models is developed to semiautomatically segment the fetal lung from fetal chest ultrasound images. The texture-based boundary enhancement procedure is firstly proposed to enhance boundary regions by using multiple textural features. Then the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm followed by a morphological thinning process is applied to identify and obtain the interesting boundaries. Finally, three rectangular regions of interest (ROIs) are manually selected for the fetal chest, the fetal heart, and the fetal spine respectively. After initializing the deformation models, the vector field convolution model (VFC) extracts contours of the fetal chest, the fetal heart, and the fetal spine. The fetal lung is the region within the fetal chest but excluding the fetal heart and the fetal spine. Experiments on real clinical fetal chest ultrasound images demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.

Abandoning the "bag of words" assumption in traditional topic models, A Firm incorporates spatial structure into traditional LDA. AITM extends LDA by modeling visual words with latent affine transformations as well as latent topics, treating topics as different parts of objects and assuming a common affine transformation of visual words given a certain topic. MCMC is employed to make inference for latent variables, MCMC-EM algorithm is used to parameter estimation, and Bayesian decision rule is used to perform classification. Experiments on two challenging data sets demonstrate the efficiency of AITM.

This creation process is accomplished by adjusting two factors: the setting of parameters on a camera and the position between the camera and the object which he or she is interested in. In this paper, this procedure is learned using the machine learning technique so that what the interest of the photographer is and what the core content of a photo wants to display can be reversely calculated. A photo retrieval system was built upon the category of interesting regions and the metadata is used for help. The research also explore the argument how local or global feature affects the performance of image retrieval. A novel stochastic segmentation algorithm called region restricted EM algorithm was applied in order to construct the interesting regions. Experimental evaluation on over 7000+ photos taken by 200+ different models of cameras with variety of interests has shown the robustness of our technique.

More specifically, we employ the standard maximum likelihood framework and derive an expectation maximization type algorithm. This involves a non-linear smoothing problem for the state variables, which for the conditionally linear Gaussian system can be efficiently solved using a so called Rao-Blackwellized particle smoother (RBPS). As a secondary contribution of this paper we extend an existing RBPS to be able to handle the fully interconnected model under study.

Each particle's best value is replaced by the weighted value of all particles' best value and local search mechanism is used in the algorithm. The results of testing typical function demonstrate that the convergence precision and convergence rate of EMPSO algorithm are better than those of PSO algorithm. EMPSO algorithm is used to identify the typical transfer function of thermal processes and the transfer function between primary air volume and bed temperature in a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler, achieving some satisfactory identification results.

The two sub-systems are aligned. The microCT provides 3D morphological information of the sample, which can be also used for attenuation correction during microXRF reconstruction. The microXRF, based on a pin-hole collimator and a photon-counting energy-sensitive 2D-detector, obtains 2D projections of 3D chemical composition inside the sample with 50-70 microns spatial resolution. The reconstruction of 3D microXRF scans is challenging because of very low photon counting statistics due to limited power of laboratory x-ray sources and the strong self-absorption of the low-energy fluorescence photons. We have developed a maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (ML-EM) algorithm based on Poisson model. This algorithm has proven to be rather robust and good reconstructions have been obtained with sample scans. Regularization is necessary to achieve stable reconstruction. One method is to apply smoothing between iterations. Two different smoothing kernels have been evaluated: 3D symmetric Gaussian kernel and minimization of total variation. For further improvement, a multi-ray resolution recovery technique has been evaluated. The self-absorption is currently compensated by a simplified method: the correction coefficients are pre-calculated and obtained by forward-projecting the attenuation map for both the primary X-rays and the fluorescence photons. The attenuation maps at the energy of fluorescence photons are approximated from the CT image.

Firstly, a non-parametric mixture model based on the second Laguerre orthogonal polynomial is designed, and then estimate smoothing parameter of every model with minimum mean-square error (MISE). Secondly, get orthogonal polynomial coefficients and mixing ratio of the models by EM algorithm. The method proposed in the paper overcomes model mismatch without any assumption to the model. Image segmentation experiments shows that the method is more efficient than Gaussian mixture model segmentation, and that it has higher quality than other non-parametric mixture models segmentations do.

While most such integrated approaches have been tested on static images, in this work we focus on JRS of dynamic image sequences. For dynamic contrast enhanced images, previous works have focused on multi-stage approaches that interleave registration and segmentation. We propose a Markov random field (MRF) based solution which uses saliency, intensity, edge orientation and segmentation labels for JRS of renal perfusion images. An expectation-maximization (EM) framework is used where the entire image sequence is first registered followed by updating the segmentation labels. Experiments on real patient datasets exhibiting elastic deformations demonstrate the effectiveness of our MRF-based JRS approach.

J	Majumdar, A; Gries, C				Majumdar, Anandamayee; Gries, Corinna			Bivariate Zero-Inflated Regression for Count Data: A Bayesian Approach with Application to Plant Counts	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOSTATISTICS			English	Article						Bayesian inference; regression model; bivariate zero-inflated Poisson; data augmentation; generalized linear model; multivariate zero-inflated Poisson	DISTRIBUTIONS; MODELS	Lately, bivariate zero-inflated (BZI) regression models have been used in many instances in the medical sciences to model excess zeros. Examples include the BZI Poisson (BZIP), BZI negative binomial (BZINB) models, etc. Such formulations vary in the basic modeling aspect and use the EM algorithm (Dempster, Laird and Rubin, 1977) for parameter estimation. A different modeling formulation in the Bayesian context is given by Dagne (2004). We extend the modeling to a more general setting for multivariate ZIP models for count data with excess zeros as proposed by Li, Lu, Park, Kim, Brinkley and Peterson (1999), focusing on a particular bivariate regression formulation. For the basic formulation in the case of bivariate data, we assume that Xi are (latent) independent Poisson random variables with parameters lambda (i), i = 0, 1, 2. A bi-variate count vector (Y(1), Y(2)) response follows a mixture of four distributions; p(0) stands for the mixing probability of a point mass distribution at (0, 0); p(1), the mixing probability that Y(2) = 0, while Y(1) = X(0) + X(1); p(2), the mixing probability that Y(1) = 0 while Y(2) = X(0) + X(2); and finally (1 - p(0) - p(1) - p(2)), the mixing probability that Y(i) = X(i) + X(0), i = 1, 2. The choice of the parameters {p(i), lambda (i), i = 0, 1, 2} ensures that the marginal distributions of Y(i) are zero inflated Poisson (lambda (0) + lambda (i)). All the parameters thus introduced are allowed to depend on co-variates through canonical link generalized linear models (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989). This flexibility allows for a range of real-life applications, especially in the medical and biological fields, where the counts are bivariate in nature (with strong association between the processes) and where there are excess of zeros in one or both processes. Our contribution in this paper is to employ a fully Bayesian approach consolidating the work of Dagne (2004) and Li et al. (1999) generalizing the modeling and sampling-based methods described by Ghosh, Mukhopadhyay and Lu (2006) to estimate the parameters and obtain posterior credible intervals both in the case where co-variates are not available as well as in the case where they are. In this context, we provide explicit data augmentation techniques that lend themselves to easier implementation of the Gibbs sampler by giving rise to well-known and closed-form posterior distributions in the bivariate ZIP case. We then use simulations to explore the effectiveness of this estimation using the Bayesian BZIP procedure, comparing the performance to the Bayesian and classical ZIP approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the methodology based on bivariate plant count data with excess zeros that was collected on plots in the Phoenix metropolitan area and compare the results with independent ZIP regression models fitted to both processes.

This general class of model has enjoyed a huge and diverse range of applications, for example, speech processing, biomedical signal processing and more recently quantitative finance. However, a lesser known extension of this general class of model is the so-called Factorial Hidden Markov Model (FHMM). FHMMs also have diverse applications, notably in machine learning, artificial intelligence and speech recognition [13, 17]. FHMMs extend the usual class of HMMs, by supposing the partially observed state process is a finite collection of distinct Markov chains, either statistically independent or dependent. There is also considerable current activity in applying collections of partially observed Markov chains to complex action recognition problems, see, for example, [6]. In this article we consider the Maximum Likelihood (ML) parameter estimation problem for FHMMs. Much of the extant literature concerning this problem presents parameter estimation schemes based on full data log-likelihood EM algorithms. This approach can be slow to converge and often imposes heavy demands on computer memory. The latter point is particularly relevant for the class of FHMMs where state space dimensions are relatively large. The contribution in this article is to develop new recursive formulae for a filter-based EM algorithm that can be implemented online. Our new formulae are equivalent ML estimators, however, these formulae are purely recursive and so, significantly reduce numerical complexity and memory requirements. A computer simulation is included to demonstrate the performance of our results.	[Malcolm, W.

A Scenario-based Approach to Parameter Estimation in State-Space Models having Quantized Output Data	49TH IEEE CONFERENCE ON DECISION AND CONTROL (CDC)			English	Proceedings Paper	49th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	DEC 15-17, 2010	Atlanta, GA	IEEE				In this paper we describe an algorithm for estimating the parameters of a linear, discrete-time system, in state-space form, having quantized measurements. The estimation is carried out using the maximum likelihood criterion. The solution is found using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. A technical difficulty in applying this algorithm for this problem is that the a posteriori probability density function, found in the EM algorithm, is non-Gaussian. To deal with this issue, we sequentially approximate it using scenarios, i.e., a weighted sum of impulses which are deterministically computed. Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach leads to a significantly more accurate estimation than the one obtained by ignoring the presence of the quantizer and applying standard estimation methods.

The estimation algorithm is based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, exploiting information from the pilot symbols and detected data symbols in a systematic fashion. To reduce the complexity of the estimation algorithm, a suboptimal scheme is also introduced.

Cardiac gated SPECT images are affected by a high level of noise. Noise reduction methods usually do not account for cardiac motion and therefore introduce motion blur-an artifact that can decrease diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, image reconstruction methods typically rely on uniform sampling and Cartesian griding for image representation. The proposed method utilizes a mesh representation of the images in order to utilize the benefits of content-adaptive nonuniform sampling. The mesh model allows for accurate representation of important regions while significantly compressing the data. The content-adaptive deformable mesh model is generated by combining nodes generated on the full torso using pre-reconstructed emission and attenuation images with nodes accurately sampled on the left ventricle. Ventricular nodes are further displaced according to cardiac motion using our previously introduced motion estimation technique. The resulting mesh structure is then used to perform iterative image reconstruction using a mesh-based maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization algorithm. Finally, motion-compensated post-reconstruction temporal filtering is applied in the mesh domain using the deformable mesh model. Reconstructed images as well as quantitative evaluation show that the proposed method offers improved image quality while reducing the data size.

Its goal is to identify lesion's shape, location and connectivity to the vessel system. Nowadays, the clinical practice is to use volumetric contrast enhanced CT images, acquired before and after contrast agent injection. However, currently, liver CAD systems work on a single volumetric image, i.e. the volume exhibiting the best contrast enhancement. Therefore, the motivation of our work is to explore the gray-level enhancement in the different abdominal tissues and organs present in all acquired images. The described method at first aligns all images and progresses with the segmentation - a combination of an initial clustering approach and the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to optimally model the joint histogram by a sum of multivariate Gaussian distributions. It is performed hierarchically: firstly, it is invoked on the whole abdominal volume, secondly on the detected liver region, and finally over the lesions. Experiments show that if the contrast information is sufficient, the results are accurate in comparison to the ground truth: reference segmentation performed by a radiologist using a commercial tool. Moreover, we show that our method provides beneficial information to radiologists about the lesion nature and its behavior throughout the different phases.

Simulation results show that the performance of our iterative decoder using the EM algorithm is very close to the performance obtained when the channel is perfectly known. We also propose an efficient implementation of the iterative decoder (based on the EM algorithm) on FPGA.

Precoding vectors are used in relays to cancel out multiple access interference at the mobile stations. Statistical distribution of signal to noise ratio (SNR) is approximated by an expectation maximization algorithm. Based on this distribution, system performance is evaluated for low and high SNR. Simulation results confirm the analytic calculations and show that the maximum diversity advantage can be obtained, which is the product of the number of antennas at each relay by the number of relays minus the total number of system constraints.

Planar and Tomographic (SPECT) Imaging of Small Volume Targets Using a Cross-Slit Collimator	2010 IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM CONFERENCE RECORD (NSS/MIC)	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium (NSS)/Medical Imaging Conference (MIC)/17th International Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X-ray and Gamma-ray Detectors	OCT 30-NOV 06, 2010	Knoxville, TN	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Nucl & Plasma Sci Soc, IEEE			ULTRA-HIGH-RESOLUTION; UNIFORMLY REDUNDANT ARRAYS; CODED-APERTURE; PINHOLE SPECT; SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; SENSITIVITY; RECONSTRUCTION; DEVICE	In vivo imaging techniques applied to small animals are important tools in basic research. Scintigraphic planar and tomographic images allow in vivo functional expression of the protocol's effect on the animal's organs to be assessed. In that way, long term dynamical studies can be developed on the same animal, which can be used as its own control, helping to reduce statistical uncertainties, to cut costs and to improve ethical aspects of the experiment. Considering the small size of those animals' organs, specially adapted instruments must be used in order to reach, simultaneously, good spatial resolution and sensitivity. Because of the intrinsic magnification factor, small-size pinhole-like collimators seem to be the obvious option to reach good spatial resolution. However, sensitivity is limited by the aperture's size. In this work, we propose the use of a combination of two 11-mm long, 0.8-mm width, mutually perpendicular slits as the collimator, in combination with appropriate restoration algorithms. By being narrow, information on high resolution is encoded on the recorded image, while, by being long, a large effective open area allows for good sensitivity. The slits are short enough such that individual open elements produce almost identical projections of the target. In a pre-processing stage, an implementation of the Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization algorithm was used to decode individual projections, producing high resolution planar images of the target. The same algorithm was used to combine those pre-processed individual projections, this time as if they would be obtained with a small size single pinhole collimator, obtaining a three-dimensional (3D) model of the target's radiotracer distribution. Monte Carlo simulations and physical phantoms were used to test the proposed methodology. Spatial resolution, equivalent to the one obtained with a 1.5-mm diameter pinhole collimator, was reached. Considering the collimator's open area, sensitivity should increase by a factor nearly 9, when compared with the same 1.5-mm diameter pinhole collimator. The experimental results are consistent with that theoretical value. Additionally, the pre-processing stage does not introduces a significant increase in the total processing time necessary for convergence to the reconstructed 3D object model. In this way, this kind of collimator appears as a good alternative to reduce the acquisition time, improving ethical aspects on animal management, as well as to allow the 3D target emission model to be obtained with no increased machine burden.

The time required for identifying a speaker is a function of feature vectors and their dimensionality and the number of speakers in the database. In this paper, we focus on optimizing the performance of Gaussian mixture (GMM) based speaker identification system. An improved approach for model parameter calculation is presented. The advantage of proposed approach lies in the reduction in computational time by a significant amount over an approach which uses expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to calculate the model parameter values. This approach is based on forming clusters and assigning weights to them depending upon the number of mixtures used for modeling the speaker. The reduction in computation time depends upon how many mixtures are used for training the speaker model.			metka001@umn.edu; cohen082@umn.edu; parhi@umn.edu					Chan Arthur, 2004, P INT 2004, P689; DAVIS SB, 1980, IEEE T ACOUST SPEECH, V28, P357, DOI 10.1109/TASSP.1980.1163420; Kinnuen Tomi, 2006, IEEE T AUDIO SPEECH, V14; LINDE Y, 1980, IEEE T COMMUN, V28, P84, DOI 10.1109/TCOM.1980.1094577; McLaughlin J., 1999, P EUR, P1215; Reynolds D.

This high count rate can result in an initially high randoms rate and substantial deadtime. With the short halflife, the deadtime and randoms fractions change dramatically over the duration of the scan. Accounting for this time dependence for more accurate reconstruction is the goal of this study. In particular, an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm was developed to exploit differences between true, scattered, and random events over the time course of the scan and also to exploit differences in time-of-flight (TOF) information. The algorithm can be expressed in terms of modulation functions that impact the expected true, scatter, and random events independently. These functions can also include the effect of deadtime on each contribution. When the modulation functions for the different components are equal, the update formulas revert to the standard EM solutions. The TOF dependence is accounted for as an independent dimension in the likelihood function; the trues follow a Gaussian distribution about the expected mean and the randoms follow a uniform distribution related to the timing-coincidence window. The formulas were tested by simulated list-mode data from a cardiac scan with cold defects. Three data sets were generated: trues-only (ideal data); trues and randoms; and trues and randoms with deadtime modeling. Reconstructions were performed using and not using TOF information.

To illustrate the method, we use cell tracks obtained from the intravital video microscopy of a zebrafish embryo.

We adopt the before-after technique and we assume that at any one target site the total number of accidents recorded is multinomially distibuted between the periods and types of accidents. In this article, we propose a minorization-majorization (MM) algorithm for obtaining the constrained maximum likelihood estimates of the parameter vector. We compare it with a gradient projection-expectation maximization (GP-EM) algorithm, based on gradient projections. The performance of the algorithms is examined through a simulation study of road safety data.

Their use is founded on the good qualities of GMM models when aimed at approximating Probability Density Functions (PDF) of random variables. But in some cases, where models are to be adapted from small sample sets instead of large but generic databases, a problem of balance between model complexity and sample size may play an important role. From this perspective, we show, through simple sound classification experiments, that constrained GMM, with fewer degrees of freedom, as compared to GMM with full covariance matrices, provide better classification performances. Moreover, pushing this argument even further, we also show that a Parzen model can do even better than usual GMM.

The paper presents a new Bayesian method which sequentially processes the observed data points by forming candidate sequences of labels assigning data points to mixture components. Using conjugate priors, we derive analytically a recursive formula for the computation of the probability of each label sequence. The practical implementation of this algorithm keeps only a predefined number of the highest ranked label sequences with the ranking based on posterior probabilities. We show by numerical simulations that the proposed technique consistently outperforms both the k-means and the EM algorithm.

With this approach, only harmonic-parts are extracted from the phoneme spectrum, and the time-varying spectrum corresponding to the harmonics or sinusoidal components is modeled using the Multiple function. We introduce two types of the functions, and present the method to estimate the parameters of each function using the observed phoneme spectrum. In the synthesis stage, speech signals are generated from the parameters of the Multiple function. The advantage of this method is that it only requires a few speech synthesis parameters. We discuss the effectiveness of our proposed method through experimental results.

With this approach, source separation is achieved by iterating two simple sub-procedures, namely the clustering of time-frequency (TF) bins into individual sources and the independent updating of the model parameters of each source. An advantage of this approach is that we can update the model parameters of each source independently of those of the other sources in each iteration, and thus the update can be computationally very efficient. We show by simulation experiments that the proposed method can greatly improve, in a computationally efficient manner, the quality of each source signal from sound mixtures in terms of cepstral distortion using an speaker independent HMM composed of a very small number of states.			nak@cslab.kecl.ntt.co.jp; shoko@cslab.kecl.ntt.co.jp; takuya@cslab.kecl.ntt.co.jp; masakiyo@cslab.kecl.ntt.co.jp					Araki S, 2010, INT CONF ACOUST SPEE, P5, DOI 10.1109/ICASSP.2010.5496283; Cooke M.P., SPEECH SEPARATION CH; Hyvarinen A., 2001, INDEPENDENT COMPONEN; Radfar M H, 2010, Proceedings 2010 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, ICASSP 2010, DOI 10.1109/ICASSP.2010.5495323; Rennie SJ, 2009, 2009 IEEE WORKSHOP ON AUTOMATIC SPEECH RECOGNITION & UNDERSTANDING (ASRU 2009), P176, DOI 10.1109/ASRU.2009.5373446; Roweis S.T., 2003, P EUR, P1009; Yilmaz O, 2004, IEEE T SIGNAL PROCES, V52, P1830, DOI [10.1109/TSP.2004.828896, 10.1109/TSP.2004.V8896]	7	0	0	ISCA-INST SPEECH COMMUNICATION ASSOC	BAIXAS	C/O EMMANUELLE FOXONET, 4 RUE DES FAUVETTES, LIEU DIT LOUS TOURILS, BAIXAS, F-66390, FRANCE		978-1-61782-123-3				2010							2470	2473				4	Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications	Engineering; Telecommunications	BDG18	WOS:000313086500230

A new observation model for a mixture of sparse sources is introduced for this purpose. With this approach, source separation is achieved by iterating two simple sub-procedures, namely the clustering of the time-frequency (TF) bins into individual sources and the separate updating of the model parameters of each source. An advantage of this approach is that we can update the model parameters of each source assuming each cluster to contain a single source, and thus we can utilize the various model parameter estimation algorithms used for single source analysis, which can be simple and accurate, in an efficient and unified manner. We implement a harmonicity based source separation method with this approach using a robust fundamental frequency (F0) estimation algorithm. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In [1] we presented a new iterative algorithm for the correction of geometrical distortion caused by global motion in a scene. A binary hypotheses test was subsequently established to classify the pixels in the corrected image as either locally moving (object motion) or not moving (stationary). There were some unknown parameters, such as noise variance and motion variance, in the developments that needed to be estimated. This paper presents the use of the EM algorithm to estimate these parameters. We present experiments with real image sequences to validate the analytical developments.

However, many data can comprise multiple feature subsets, where each feature subset corresponds to the meaningful clusters differently. In this paper, we attempt to reveal a feature partition consisting of multiple non-overlapped feature blocks that each one fits a finite mixture model. To find the desired feature partition, we used a local search algorithm based on a Simulated Annealing technique. During the process of searching for the optimal feature partition, reutilization of the previous estimation results has been adopted to reduce computational cost.

Our approach is able to compute simultaneously the parameters of the dominant vanishing point in the image plane and the most significant lines passing through it. It is based on a novel definition of the likelihood distribution of the gradient image considering both the position and the orientation of the gradient pixels. Besides, the mixture model in which the EM algorithm operates is extended, compared to other works, to consider an additional component to control the presence of outliers. Some synthetic data tests are described to show the robustness and efficiency of the proposed method. The plane rectification results show that the method is able to remove the perspective and affine distortion of real traffic sequences without the need to compute two vanishing points.

They have been studied and applied during decades for plane rectification, 3D reconstruction, and mainly auto-calibration tasks. Nevertheless, the literature lacks accurate online solutions for multiple vanishing point estimation. Most strategies focalize on the accuracy, using highly computational demanding iterative procedures. We propose a novel strategy for multiple vanishing point estimation that finds a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, being able to operate in real time for video sequences. This strategy takes advantage of the temporal coherence of the images of the sequences to reduce the computational load of the processing algorithms while keeping a high level of accuracy due to an optimization process. The key element of the approach is a robust scheme based on the MLESAC algorithm, which is used in a similar way to the EM algorithm. This approach ensures robust and accurate estimations, since we use the MLESAC in combination with a novel error function, based on the angular error between the vanishing point and the image features. To increase the speed of the MLESAC algorithm, the selection of the minimal sample sets is substituted by a random sampling step that takes into account temporal information to provide better initializations. Besides, for the sake of flexibility, the proposed error function has been designed to work using as image features indiscriminately gradient-pixels or line segments. Hence, we increase the range of applications in which our approach can be used, according to the type of information that is available. The results show a real-time system that delivers real-time accurate estimations of multiple vanishing points for online processing, tested in moving camera video sequences of structured scenarios, both indoors and outdoors, such as rooms, corridors, facades, roads, etc.	[Nieto, Marcos; Salgado, Luis] Univ Politecn Madrid, Grp Tratamiento Imagenes, ETS Ing Telecomunicac, E-28040 Madrid, Spain	Nieto, M (reprint author), Univ Politecn Madrid, Grp Tratamiento Imagenes, ETS Ing Telecomunicac, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.	mnd@gti.ssr.upm.es					BARNARD ST, 1983, ARTIF INTELL, V21, P435, DOI 10.1016/S0004-3702(83)80021-6; CARBALLEIRA P, 2008, IEEE IMAGE PROC, P205; Collins R.

Classically these two tasks are attended separately resulting in simple yet non-optimal receivers. During the last decade, a family of iterative receivers has been introduced to approximate the optimal solution to joint estimation and detection problem by means of the turbo principle. With the help of graph theory and the belief propagation framework these receiver structures are unified and soft information driven schemes emerged, leading to more reliable detection. The essence of these schemes lays in factorization of a global function whose marginal corresponds to the objective function and obtained via simple message passing algorithms. On the other hand, as far as our knowledge, all of the proposed structures pursue a specific factorization while devising their respective schemes. In this work utilizing a different factorization, we introduce a novel iterative receiver for joint equalization/detection problem. With the aid of Variational Bayesian approximation we show that the complexity can be reduced without sacrificing the error performance drastically.

These dynamics are the important cues for perceiving individuality of a singer, and can be a useful measure for various applications, such as singing skill evaluation and singing voice synthesis. While most previous studies have modeled the dynamics using a second-order linear system, the automatic and accurate estimation of model parameters has yet to be accomplished. In this paper, we first develop a complete stochastic representation of the second-order system with Gaussian processes from parametric discretization, and propose a complete, efficient scheme for parameter estimation using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method can decompose an F0 contour into a musical component and a dynamics component. Finally, we discuss estimating singing styles from the model parameters for each singer.			ohishi@cs.brl.ntt.co.jp; kameoka@cs.brl.ntt.co.jp; daichi@cslab.kecl.ntt.co.jp; nagano@cs.brl.ntt.co.jp; kunio@cs.brl.ntt.co.jp					Bach F., P ICML 2004, P6; Bonada J., P SMAC 2003; Dannenberg RB, 2007, J AM SOC INF SCI TEC, V58, P687, DOI 10.1002/asi.20532; de Cheveigne A, 2002, J ACOUST SOC AM, V111, P1917, DOI 10.1121/1.1458024; Fujisaki H., 1988, VOCAL PHYSL VOICE PR, P347; Fukayama S, 2009, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V5709, P309; Kako T., P ISMIR 2009, P393; Kameoka H., P ICASSP 2009, P3437; Minematsu N., P SPEECHPROSODY 2004, P487; Nakano T, 2006, INTERSPEECH 2006 AND 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SPOKEN LANGUAGE PROCESSING, VOLS 1-5, P1706; Nakano T., P SMC 2009, P343; Ohishi Y, 2008, INTERSPEECH 2008: 9TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPEECH COMMUNICATION ASSOCIATION 2008, VOLS 1-5, P139; Proutskova P., P ISMIR 2009, P759; Rasmussen CE, 2005, ADAPT COMPUT MACH LE, P1; Saitou T., EUROSPEECH 2009, P832; Saitou T., WASSPA 2007, P215; Sundberg J., 2006, ADV COGNITIVE PSYCHO, V2, P131	17	0	0	ISCA-INST SPEECH COMMUNICATION ASSOC	BAIXAS	C/O EMMANUELLE FOXONET, 4 RUE DES FAUVETTES, LIEU DIT LOUS TOURILS, BAIXAS, F-66390, FRANCE		978-1-61782-123-3				2010							2606	2609				4	Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications	Engineering; Telecommunications	BDG18	WOS:000313086500264

The basic building block of our method is the general linear model (GML) that constitute a well-known probabilistic approach for regression. By treating regression coefficients as random variables, we can apply an appropriate Gibbs distribution function in order to capture spatial constraints of fMRI time series. In the same time, sparse properties are also embedded through a RVM-based sparse prior over coefficients. The proposed scheme is described as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach, where the known Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is applied offering closed form update equations. We have demonstrated that our method produces improved performance and enhanced functional activation detection in both simulated data and real applications.

The physics of positron trajectories through tissue was simulated by a Monte-Carlo simulator based on elastic scattering from the nucleus, inelastic collisions with atomic electrons, hard elastic collisions producing delta electrons, and the positron emission energy spectra. Data from this comprehensive physics based Monte Carlo simulation was fed into the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, and adapted to a binary mixture of exponential distributions. This binary mixture distribution provides a fast and accurate way to estimate positron-range for PET Monte Carlo simulation packages. For F-18 and O-15 point source simulations, the root mean square (rms) deviations within 2xFWHM between this mixture model and the full Monte Carlo simulation of positron endpoint probabilities was 4 and 7%, respectively.

Spot detection and analysis is an important task for the biological studies from the observed images. However, while the spots have irregular sizes and positions due to the variant amount of objects on each spot, the quantitative interpretation of the labeled objects is still heavily reliant on manual evaluation. In this paper, a novel shape modeling algorithm is proposed for automating the detection and analysis of the spots of interest. The algorithm exploits a Gaussian mixture model to characterize the spatial intensity distribution of the spots, and optimizes the model parameters using split-and-merge expectation maximization (SMEM) algorithm. As a result, a large amount of target objects with uncertain shapes can be analyzed in a systematic way.

Regardless of the estimation algorithm, if there are no restrictions on the form of the matrices we want to estimate, the matrices can be determined up to within a linear transformation and thus the result may be different than the true solution and the convergence of iterative algorithms may be affected. In this paper, we apply a new identification procedure based on the Expectation Maximization framework to a family of identifiable state-space models. To our knowledge, this is the first complete solution of Maximum-Likelihood estimation for general linear state-space models.

In this situation, the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates often fall in the boundary solution, causing the ML estimates to become unstable. To deal with such a multi-way table, we present an EM algorithm which generalizes the previous algorithm used for incomplete one-way tables. Three of the five types of priors were previously introduced while the other two are newly proposed to reflect different response patterns between respondents and nonrespondents. Data analysis and simulation studies show that Bayesian estimates based on the old three priors can be worse than the ML regardless of occurrence of boundary solution, contrary to previous studies. The Bayesian estimates from the two new priors are most preferable when a boundary solution occurs. We provide an illustrating example using data for a study of the relationship between a mother's smoking and her newborn's weight.

Firstly, a density-based clustering approach is developed using a density function estimated by the EM algorithm and in the second stage, a hierarchical strategy is used to merge clusters according to a dissimilarity measure here introduced in order to assess the overlap and proximity of the clusters. Several synthetic and real world data sets are used to evaluate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the new algorithm, indicating that it obtains satisfactory clustering results.
