Joint Data Detection and Channel Estimation for MIMO-OFDM Systems via EM Algorithm and Sphere Decoding	GLOBECOM 2006 - 2006 IEEE GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (Globecom)		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM 06)	NOV 27-DEC 01, 2006	San Francisco, CA	IEEE Commun Soc			MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; FADING CHANNELS; COMPLEXITY; CAPACITY; LATTICE	We consider joint data detection and channel estimation for Multiple-input Multiple-output Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing systems. The Expectation Maximization algorithm is employed to capture the dynamics of a time-varying fading channel and also to recover the channel input. This is done iteratively: channel estimates are updated in the E-step, whilst the Sphere Decoding algorithm is used in the M-step to realize data recovery. Initial channel estimates are obtained through the use of a small number of pilot symbols. We show by simulation that the performance of the proposed algorithm can approach coherent detection with reasonable computational complexity.

Its parameters can be exact estimated through the LS-EM algorithm discussed in this paper. After descriptions of the model and estimation problem, LS-EM algorithm is deduced. And a numerical instance is illustrated. In fact, LS-EM is an algorithm for coupling estimation of parameters between probability density and power spectrum density. Firstly, rough estimation of the latter is obtained using the conventional least squares technology and then prewhitenning is applied to forecast white driving source, based on which estimation of the former is produced by the EM iteration. And then, a weighted function is founded on probability density parameter, with which the weighted least squares estimation is built up. In such a way, the accurate estimation of model parameters is obtained.

AutoClass is a classical Bayesian clustering algorithm that uses Naive-Bayes in combination with EM algorithm to find the probability distribution parameters to best fit the data. In this study, we introduce a robust approach, which is similar to AutoClass, it can arbitrarily impose any Bayesian classifiers in combination with EM algorithm to enhance cluster's performance. This paper focuses on how clustering techniques can benefit from classification. We provide experimental evidence that more accurate than original results of clustering in the t-test on most of the benchmark data sets.

Hyperspectral image spectroscopy gives much greater information content per pixel on the image than a normal colour image. This should greatly help with the autonomous identification of natural and man-made objects in unfamiliar terrains for robotic vehicles. However, the large information content of such data makes interpretation of hyperspectral images time-consuming and user-intensive. Isomap is used to fend the underlying manifold of the training data. This low dimensional representation of the hyperspectral data facilitates the learning of a mixture of linear models representation similar to a mixture of factor analysers, the joint probability distributions of the model can be calculated offline. The learnt model is then applied to the hyperspectral image at ran-time and data classification can be performed. We also show the comparison with results from standard techniques.

To ensure realistic synthesis, the model must be learned to fit the real distribution of human motion. Usually the fitness is measured by likelihood. In this paper, we present a new HMM learning algorithm, which incorporates stochastic optimization technique within the Expectation-Maximization (EM) learning framework. This algorithm is less prone to be trapped in local optimal and converges faster than traditional Baum-Welch learning algorithm. We apply the new algorithm to learning 3D motion under control of a style variable, which encodes the mood or personality of the performer. Given new style value, motions with corresponding style can be generated from the learned model.

The algorithms combine logic and probabilistic models through inductive generalisation. The inductive generalisation algorithms consist of three parts. The first part describes the graphical generalisation of state transition models. State transition models are generalised by applying state mergers. The second part involves symbolic generalisation of logic programs which are embedded in each states. Plotkin's LGG is used for symbolic generalisation of logic programs. The third part covers learning of parameters using statistics derived from the input sequences. The state transitions are unobservable in our settings. The probability distributions over the state transitions and actions are estimated using the EM algorithm. As an application of these algorithms, we learn chemical reaction rules from StochSim, the stochastic software simulator of biochemical reactions.

In CFT, the transfer vector is decomposed into a unit direction vector and a scaling factor. By using coarse tied Gaussian class (coarse class) estimation for the unit direction vector, and by using fine tied Gaussian class (fine class) estimation for the scaling factor, we can obtain accurate transfer vectors with a small number of free parameters. Directional statistics is a method for analyzing geometric parameters (e.g. angle and unit vector) using directional data, and is suited for the analysis of the CFT representation. Using directional statistics as a basis, we construct expectation-maximization algorithms for CFT parameters analytically using the maximum likelihood and Bayesian (maximum a posteriori) approaches. In particular, with the Bayesian approach, prior and posterior distributions for unit direction vectors are represented with a von Mises distribution, a representative distribution in directional statistics. Speaker adaptation experiments show that our proposal improves the performance of large vocabulary continuous speech recognition due to the efficient coarse/fine representation of transfer vectors, compared with the conventional transfer vector adaptation.

Given an original SAR images, we construct multiscale sequence of SAR imagery and randomly select a small representative set of pixels based on Bootstrap technique, which reduces the dependence effect of pixels in SAR imagery. Then, mixture multiscale autoregressive model (MMAR) is employed for modeling SAR imagery, and BSAEM algorithm is proposed for SAR imagery segmentation. The algorithm consists of four steps, namely Expectation Step, Stochastic Step, Annealing Step and Maximization Step, which not only modifies convergence property of classical Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm but also reduces the segmentation time. Finally, some experiment results are given based on our proposed approach, and compared to that of the EM algorithm. The results show that our algorithm gives better results than the EM algorithm both in the quality of the segmented image and the computational time.

Genome wide discovery of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) would aid in understanding gene expression. Various experimental techniques are currently used for TFBS discovery, but are limited in scale and speed. Computational approaches have proven to be fast and reliable alternatives for discovering TFBS on a whole genome scale and offer several advantages to experimental techniques. However, algorithms for TFBS discovery are highly compute-intensive. This has so far limited their application to relatively small problem sizes.

The new algorithm can overcome the problem of getting stuck in sub-optimal solutions which occurs in most existing learning algorithms. The experimental results on the data sets generated from several benchmark networks illustrate that the new algorithm has better performance than some state-of-the-art algorithms. We also apply the approach to a data set of direct marketing and compare the performance of the discovered Bayesian networks obtained by the new algorithm with the networks generated by other methods. In the comparison, the Bayesian networks learned by the new algorithm outperform other networks.

As this approach is Bayesian,, it allows us to integrate prior knowledge about the problem in a principled way. Because it is non-parametric we are able to avoid model selection, a difficult problem that most current spike sorting methods do not address. We compare this approach to using penalized log likelihood to select the best from multiple finite mixture models trained by expectation maximization. We show favorable offline sorting results on real data and discuss ways to extend our model to online applications.

However a single histogram suffers from the inability to encode spatial image variation. In this paper, we propose a simple yet novel classification method based on local multi-resolution histograms that utilize the difference among multiple histograms of consecutive image resolutions. We have designed such histogram based attribute vectors which have many desired properties including that they are easy to compute, translation and rotation invariant, and sufficient to encode local spatial information. Comparisons between different methods for expectation-maximization-like (EM-like) procedures and hidden markov random field method for simultaneous parameter estimation and partial volume estimation are reported. Experimental results show that our method allows for more accurate and robust classification for brain tissue than these algorithms.

Instead of the conventional symbol-spaced (SS) MLSE structure, a new design based upon T/2-spaced samples for alpha-EM MLSE receivers has been scrutinized. Simulation results reveal that the number of branch metric computations and the accuracy of received sampling data dominate the overall convergence speed. That is, fractionally-spaced (FS) adaptive alpha-EM MLSE receivers have not only demonstrated a better BER performance, but they also could further speed up the convergence speed for alpha >= -0.5 under SNR <= 20 dB. Furthermore, the FS adaptive alpha-EM-MLSE receiver gives the more accurate sampling data for compensating the penalty of its twice number of branch metric computations so that both FS and SS receivers would reach almost the same convergence speed under the circumstance of SNR > 20 dB and alpha >= -0.5.

First, an initially oversegmented image derived from the watershed segmentation algorithm as well as the original SAR image is taken as the inputs of the proposed method. Secondly, a MRF is defined on RAG of the initial over segmented regions, with a novel multilevel logistic (MLL) model for the region class labels and Gamma distribution for the marginal distribution of each class in the SAR images. The criterion used for getting the optimal segmentation is the maximization of the posterior marginal (MPM), which minimizing the expected value of the number of the misclassified regions in the over-segmented image. In the implementation, the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate the parameters of Gamma distribution, and the parameters of the MLL model is derived from the RAG. Experimental results on real SAR images show that the proposed method can reduce the computational complexity greatly and provide precise segmentation results.

The SSEM is a further development of the NASA Size Estimation Model (SEM). It does not require knowledge of the size of each individual object and takes into account the distribution of the RCS of an object of a given size over shape, orientation, and composition. The size distribution is best estimated through an iterative technique based on the multiplicative rule of probability and Bayes' theorem. The Bayesian algorithm is consistent with the EM (expectation maximization) algorithm for solving linear inverse problems with positivity constraints, leading to maximum likelihood estimates. An advantage of the Bayesian approach is that it provides a convenient way for uncertainty estimation for the inferred size distribution because posterior probabilities are simultaneously obtained in the process of model parameter inference. Practical calculations show that both model parameters and the associated uncertainties estimated by the SSEM agree with those of other standard statistical methods. Practical examples also show that SSEM-derived size distributions are fairly close to those derived from the original NASA SEM.

This micron-CT uses a point X-ray source with a spot size of llmn and an X-ray CCD with 1000x1000 pixels of 8 mu m x 8 mu m, achieving a spatial resolutions of the order of micro-meter. The event data obtained by the X-ray CCD is statistically poor and the 3 dimensional filtered back projection (3D FBP) algorithm, generally used in image reconstruction of X-ray CT, is not suitable because it is highly sensitive to statistical noise. Hence, we applied the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for image reconstruction and developed an image reconstruction method using 3D EM algorithm. To confirm the validity of the reconstruction method, we irradiated two hairs inside a micro tube and reconstructed the CT image applying both EM and FBP algorithm on projection data. With 200 X 200 X 200 voxels of 4 mu m x 4 mu m x 4 mu m in the field of view, the computation time was less than 2 mins per iteration on a DELL Precision650 Workstation 3.2GHz. The resulting EM image showed a better contrast than FBP image, and in the EM reconstructed CT image, we were able to reconstruct the micro tube of 270 mu m diameter and 451 mu m wall thickness and to visualize the two hairs inside.

We formulate the imaging process of these small geometric structures as volume rendering followed by image matting, and prove that the inverse problem can be solved by reducing the nonlinear equations to a large linear system. This estimation, which we call inverse volume rendering, can be performed efficiently through expectation maximization method, even when the linear system is under-constrained owing to data sparseness. We reconstruct object shape by a set of coarse voxels that can model the spatial occupancy inside each voxel. Experimental results show that intricately-shaped objects can successfully be modeled by our proposed method, and the original and other novel view-images of the objects can be synthesized by forward volume rendering.

This method takes advantage of the similar intensity or texture in a region for fusion. A statistical image formation model using Gaussian mixture distortion is built for each region and the EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm is used in conjunction with the model to develop the region-level EM fusion algorithm to produce the fused image. Since in most applications of image fusion, objects carry the information of interest and regions can be used to represent objects, the region-based fusion approaches could be more meaningful than pixel-based methods. Our experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed region-base fusion method and the advantages in dealing with region interface artifacts for concealed wealpon detection and night vision applications.

The proposed approach is a two-step one. In the first stage, the flow length distribution is estimated by an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that in addition provides an estimate for the number of active flows in the link. In the second stage, two estimators are derived for the original flow length, using information from the posterior distribution previously obtained. The proposed approach is illustrated on a number of synthetic and real data sets.

Based on this algorithm, a novel statistical approach for segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) image data is presented in this paper, which involves three steps. Firstly, after pre-processing the image with the curvature anisotropic diffusion filter, the background (BG) and brain masks of the image are obtained by applying a combination approach of thresholding with morphology. Secondly, the connected threshold region growing technique is employed to get the preliminary results of white matter (WM), gray matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on a brain MRI. Finally, the previous results are served as the priori knowledge for the improved EM algorithm to segment the brain MRI. The performance of the proposed method is compared with those of standard EM algorithm and the popular used fuzzy-C means (FCM) segmentation. Experimental results show our approach is effective, robust and significantly faster than the conventional EM based method.

The algorithm is put forward to overcome the drawback of standard EM algorithm, which is extremely computationally expensive for calculating the maximum likelihood (ML) parameters in the statistical segmentation. Combining the SHEM algorithm and the connected threshold region-growing algorithm that is used to provide a priori knowledge, a novel statistical approach for segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) image data is thus proposed. The performance of our SHEM based method is compared with those of the EM based method and the commonly applied fuzzy C-means (FCM) segmentation. Experimental results show the proposed approach to be effective, robust and significantly faster than the conventional EM based method.

However, the septal penetration and scattering of photons emitted with energy above 159 keV will affect the image contrast and quantitative accuracy of images. To reduce this effect, medium energy (ME) collimator has been used with the cost of lower counting statistics and spatial resolution. The effects of collimator dependency on the quantitative accuracy of attenuation corrected (AC) I-123 SPECT images using X-ray-based attenuation map was investigated. Both brain and heart/thorax phantoms were used to evaluate different degree of attenuation effect between brain and thorax. Experiments were performed at different target-to-background ratios to simulate different object contrast. Both photopeak and scatter projections were collected for dual-energy window scatter correction (SC). Images were reconstructed and compared using different reconstruction methods, which included FBP (filtered backprojection), and OSEM (ordered subset expectation maximization) without corrections, with AC, with SC, and with AC and SC. In both phantom studies, the image contrast and quantitative accuracy were both improved with the use of CT-based transmission map for AC. The image contrast provided by ME collimator was better than that of LE collimator, especially in the region with void activity of thorax phantom. From the results of phantom studies, medium energy collimator with CT-based transmission map showed improvements in image contrast and quantitative accuracy of I-123 SPECT images.

This model is employed to propose an unsupervised expectation-maximization (EM) estimation algorithm of the coding-decoding distortion that is able to cancel the effect of coders with as few as one adapting utterance. No knowledge about the coder is required. The feature-dependent adaptation can give a word error rate (WER) 21% lower than the feature-independent model. Finally, when compared to the baseline system, the reduction in WER can be as high as 70%. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We impose this a priori constraint of the underlying data by using the multiphase level set framework introduced by Vese et al. As a result, level set method is incorporated into the updates of the proposed iterative reconstruction algorithm. Using our proposed algorithm, we reconstruct from 13 projections of a numerical chest phantom uniformly sampled over 180 degrees and compare it with reconstructions by unfiltered backprojection, filtered backprojection, and maximum likelihood expectation maximization(MLEM) algorithm. Results show that there is no loss of reconstruction quality for the noise-free case and improved image quality for the noisy case. Our results are promising for a broad spectrum of applications where the number of projections are inherently limited.

A classical remedy is to impose an a priori constraint for a penalized ML or maximum a posteriori probability solution. The penalty reduces the checkerboard artifacts and also introduces uncertainty because a priori information is usually unknown in clinic. Recent theoretical investigation reveals that the noise can be divided into two components. One is called null-space noise which annihilates during filtered backprojection (FBP)-type analytical image reconstruction. The other is called range-space noise which propagates into the FBP-type analytically reconstructed image. In particular, the null-space noise can be numerically estimated. The aim of this work is to investigate the relation between the null-space noise and the checkerboard artifacts in the ML-EM image reconstruction from noise projection data. It is expected that removing the null-space noise from the projection data could improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the data and, therefore, reduce the checkerboard artifacts in the ML-EM reconstructed images. The expectation was realized by computer simulation studies with application to single photon emission computed tomography, where the noise has been a major factor for image degradation. The reduction of the ML-EM checkerboard artifacts by removing the null-space noise avoids the uncertainty of using a priori penalty.

But the model has to face the problem of state space expansion. Taking the mobile path prediction as the research background, the paper firstly proposes a Step-k Markov model and validates its feasibility. Secondly, a hybrid Markov predictor model is put forward based on the Step-k Markov model. The complexity of the Hybrid Markov Model is O(N) while the Order-k Markov model is O(N(2)). And the memory demand of the hybrid Markov model is O(N(2)) while Order-k Markov model is O(N(3)). Finally, it is proved that the hybrid Markov predictor can get close performance with Order-k Markov Predictor at much lower expense by conditional entropy analysis and user mobility data analysis. Also, it can alleviate the zero probability problem in Order-k Markov model to some extent. The hybrid Markov predictor is more practical than Order-k Markov predictor under WLAN.

In this paper we propose a fast EM algorithm (FEMA) to address the limitations of EM and enhance its efficiency. FEMA achieves low running time by combining principal component analysis(PCA), a grid cell expansion algorithm(GCEA) and a hierarchical cluster tree. PCA and multi-dimensional grid are applied to find a set of "good" initial parameters for the EM algorithm, while the hierarchical cluster tree deals with the case where the cluster is concave by making use of a merging algorithm. The experiments indicate that FEMA outperforms EM by reducing 45% of the CPU time.

In this paper, a secret key based fragile watermarking scheme is presented based on this statistical model. The Gaussian statistical model parameters are obtained by an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and modified in a way to form special relationships for image authentication. The secret key is designed to securely embed a message bit stream, such as personal signatures or copyright logos, into a host image. Because of the secret embedding key, the new method is robust to most image tampering, even when the attackers are fully aware of the watermark embedding algorithms. Besides, the secret embedding key can be encrypted and embedded as a robust watermark into the same host image of the fragile watermarks for the benefit that the decoding of fragile watermarks only requires a single encryption key other than the image itself. The new method also has the advantage of changing only a few image data for watermark embedding and being able to distinguish some normal image operations such as compression from malicious to achieve a semi-fragile application.

Multiplicative noise and high dynamics should be taken into account in SAR image classification. Our main work is to select a Gaussian mixture model and then use it in a MAP classification algorithm. The model is assumed that the whole distribution could be separated into finite parametric density distributions, and then the maximum likelihood parameters of each proportional distribution can be estimated by EM iterative computation. In our experiment, the stable factor and momentum item are introduced to ensure correct convergence and accelerate the convergence respectively. Finally, experimental results obtained from the MAP classification algorithm show that this approach is effective for SAR image classification using MSTAR database.

Whereas manufacturing technology has moved to the stage of automation, there is still an unsolved problem in metal cutting processes: cutting chatter. Due to its complexity, thus cutting chatter is still the primary problem in metal cutting processes. According to the characteristic of cutting chatter, a real time monitoring technique of cutting chatter based on fuzzy hidden Markov model (FHMM) was presented. Hidden Markov model (HMM) is a state-of-the-art technique for speech recognition because of its elegant mathematical structure and the availability of computer implementation of these models. In this paper, the fuzzy EM algorithm was used to the Baum-Welch algorithm in the HMM method, and the strategy of time frequency feature extraction to non-stability signal was described. The experimental results show that the proposed method is feasible and effective for the monitoring of cutting chatter in the metal cutting processes.

It is a method of fitting different scales of different Gaussians, and the point-wise sum of these Gaussians approximates the actual histogram. The parameters of GMM are obtained by expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm. In general, a sequence of images taken from an object in a short time interval is affected by the lightings and the illuminant colours. A preprocessing procedure known as comprehensive colour image normalisation is used to make the shape of the histogram more stable, so that the variance of the EM fitting will be reduced. After fitting, the next step is to assign a cost function in classifying which pixel belongs to which Gaussian model. This procedure is called pixel clustering and the determination of the cost function is described. This paper also briefly discusses the situation when there are two classes.

So the ability to detect and locate obstacles using on-board sensors is an essential step in the autonomous navigation of aircraft low-altitude flight. This paper describes a novel method to detect and locate obstacles using a sequence of images from a passive sensor (TV, FLIR). We model 3D scenes in the field-of-view (FOV) as a collection of approximately planar layers that corresponds to the background and obstacles respectively. So each pixel within a layer can have the same 2D affine motion model which depends on the relative depth of the layer. We formulate the prior assumptions about the layers and scene within a Bayesian decision making framework which is used to automatically determine the assignment of individual pixels to layers. Then, a generalized expectation maximization (EM) method is used to find the MAP solution. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that this method is successful.

For example, we may label web pages from universities according to their categories, such as "student" or "faculty", or according the source universities, such as "Cornell" or "Texas". We call one kind of labels the content and the other kind the style. Given a set of documents, each with both content and style labels, we seek to effectively learn to classify a set of documents in a new style with no content labels into its content classes. Assuming that every document is generated using words drawn from a mixture of two multinomial component models, one content model and one style model, we propose a method named Cartesian EM that constructs content models and style models through Expectation Maximization and performs classification of the unknown content classes transductively. Our experiments on real-world datasets show the proposed method to be effective for style independent text content classification.

The proposed mixture model characterizes both convolutive mixture and post-nonlinear distortions of the sources. A novel iterative technique based on Maximum Likelihood (ML) approach is developed where the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is generalized to estimate the parameters in the proposed model. The post-nonlinear distortion is estimated by using a set of polynomials. The sufficient statistics associated with the source signals are estimated in the E-step while in the M-step, the parameters are optimized by using these statistics. In general, the nonlinear maximization in the M-step is difficult to be formulated in a closed form. However, the use of polynomial as the nonlinearity estimator facilitates the M-step tractable and can be solved via linear equations.

We present a two-stage method in this paper, which first determines all feasible haplotype configurations for each trio, then uses the expectation-maximization (EM algorithm to estimate haplotype frequencies based on these haplotype configurations. We design the haplotyping algorithm and the EM algorithm to estimate haplotype frequencies for this special trio genotype data. All algorithms are implemented in a C software package TRIOHAP. Its effectiveness and efficiency have been tested both on simulated and real data sets. The experimental results show that, TRIOHAP runs much faster than the other popular haplotyping software, which discards the trio information. Moreover, because TRIOHAP utilizes such information, our estimation is more accurate and more reliable.

The gains are considered to be stochastic variables in an HMM framework. The speech gain models the energy variations of speech phones, typically due to differences in pronunciation and/or different vocalizations of individual speakers. The noise gain helps to improve the tracking of the time-varying energy of non-stationary noise. The time-varying parameters of the gain models are estimated on-line using the recursive expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The performance of the proposed enhancement system is evaluated through both objective and subjective tests. The experimental results confirm the advantage of explicit gain modeling, particularly for non-stationary noise sources.

These grammar systems need to be properly trained to get the accurate probabilistic parameters from the training sequences. The context sensitive property inherent in these systems poses a difficulty for parameter estimation. In particular, existing algorithms, such as the INSIDE-OUTSIDE algorithm, are suitable for context-free structure models that containing only parallel and nested relationships between the objects; they do not apply to context-sensitive models in which object relationships may be in crossing patterns. In this paper, we present an EM algorithm for learning the parameters of context-sensitive structure models. Based upon a stochastic grammar system model we previously developed for the profiling of RNA pseudoknot structures, the algorithm, called UPWARD-DOWNWARD, can re-estimate the probabilistic parameters from a given training data set. This full dynamic programming algorithm can be regarded as a natural extension of INSIDE-OUTSIDE from context-free to context-sensitive structures including crossing patterns.

In this paper, a RANSAC-based EM algorithm for robust detection and segmentation of cylindrical fragments from calibrated C-arm images is presented. By detection, we mean that the axes and the radii of the principal fragments will be automatically determined. And by segmentation, we mean that the contour of the fragment projection onto each image plane will be automatically extracted. Benefited from the cylindrical shape of the fragments, we formulate the detection problem as an optimal process for fitting parameterized three-dimensional (3D) cylinder model to images. A RANSAC-based EM algorithm is proposed to find the optimal solution by converting the fragment detection procedure to an iterative closest point (ICP) matching procedure. The outer projection boundary of the estimated cylinder model is then fed to a region-based active contour model to robustly extract the contour of the fragment projection. The proposed algorithm has been successfully applied to real patient data with/without external objects, yielding promising results.

Automatic pulmonary vessel segmentation in 3D computed tomographic pulmonary angiographic (CTPA) images - art. no. 61444Q	Medical Imaging 2006: Image Processing, Pts 1-3	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE)		English	Proceedings Paper	Medical Imaging 2006 Conference	FEB 12-14, 2006	San Diego, CA	SPIE		computer-aided diagnosis; image segmentation; pulmonary vessel tree; computer vision technique	EMBOLISM; DIAGNOSIS; AGREEMENT	Automatic and accurate segmentation of the pulmonary vessels in 3D computed tomographic angiographic images (CTPA) is an essential step for computerized detection of pulmonary embolism (PE) because PEs only occur inside the pulmonary arteries. We are developing an automated method to segment the pulmonary vessels in 3D CTPA images. The lung region is first extracted using thresholding and morphological operations. 3D multiscale filters in combination with a newly developed response function derived from the eigenvalues of Hessian matrices are used to enhance all vascular structures including the vessel bifurcations and suppress non-vessel structures such as the lymphoid tissues surrounding the vessels. At each scale, a volume of interest (VOI) containing the response function value at each voxel is defined. The voxels with a high response indicate that there is an enhanced vessel whose size matches the given filter scale. A hierarchical expectation-maximization (EM) estimation is then applied to the VOI to segment the vessel by extracting the high response voxels at this single scale. The vessel tree is finally reconstructed by combining the segmented vessels at all scales based on a "connected component" analysis. Two experienced thoracic radiolooists provided the gold standard of pulmonary arteries by manually tracking the arterial tree and marking the center of the vessels using a computer graphical user interface. Two CTPA cases containing PEs were used to evaluate the performance. One of these two cases also contained other lung diseases. The accuracy of vessel tree segmentation was evaluated by the percentage of the "gold standard" vessel center points overlapping with the segmented vessels. The result shows that 97.3% (1868/1920) and 92.0% (2277/2476) of the manually marked center points overlapped with the segmented vessels for the cases without and with other lung disease, respectively.

Two probabilistic algorithms for MEG/EEG source reconstruction	2006 3RD IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON BIOMEDICAL IMAGING: MACRO TO NANO, VOLS 1-3	IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging	APR 06-09, 2006	Arlington, VA	IEEE				We have developed two algorithms for source imaging from MEG/EEG data. Contribution to sensor data from a source at a particular voxel is expressed as the product of a known lead field and temporal basis functions with unknown coefficients. Temporal basis functions are in turn estimated from data. The first algorithm models activity outside the voxel of interest by a full-rank covariance matrix and estimates unknowns by maximizing the likelihood. The second algorithm parameterizes activity outside the voxel of interest as a linear mixture of a set of unknown Gaussian factors plus Gaussian sensor noise and estimates all unknown quantities using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. In both cases, the source image map is the likelihood of a dipole source at each voxel. Performance in simulations and real data demonstrate significant improvement over existing source localization methods.

A probabilistic algorithm for MEG source reconstruction	2006 IEEE SENSOR ARRAY AND MULTICHANNEL SIGNAL PROCESSING WORKSHOP PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1 AND 2	Proceedings of the IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop		English	Proceedings Paper	4th IEEE Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop	JUL 12-14, 2006	Waltham, MA	IEEE Signal Proc Soc, IEEE Boston Sect, Air Force Res Lab, Def Adv Res Projects Agcy, Air Force Off Sci Res, Off Naval Res				We present a novel algorithm for source localization based on probabilistic modeling of stimulus-evoked MEG/EEG data. This algorithm localizes multiple dipoles with the computational complexity equivalent to a single dipole scan, and is therefore more efficient than traditional multidipole fitting procedures. The algorithm assumes that the activity of multiple dipolar sources can be characterized by a linear combination of known temporal basis functions with unknown coefficients. We model the sensor data as arising from activity in each voxel of interest, plus background activity. We estimate temporal basis functions from the data using a probabilistic algorithm called partitioned-factor analysis, previously developed in our lab. We model background activity outside the voxel of interest as an unknown linear mixture of unobserved background factors plus diagonal sensor noise. We use an Expectation-Maximization algorithm to calculate MAP estimates of unknown basis function coefficients, background mixing matrix, sensor noise covariance and the likelihood of a dipole in each voxel of interest. In simulations, the algorithm is able to accurately localize several simultaneously-active dipoles, at SNRs typical for averaged MEG data. The algorithm performs well even in configurations that include deep sources and highly correlated sources, and thus is superior to MUSIC and beamforming techniques which are sensitive to correlated sources. The algorithm also correctly localizes real somatosensory and auditory evoked fields to the postcentral sulcus and lower bank of the lateral sulcus, respectively.

Bandwidth-efficient target tracking in distributed sensor networks using particle filters	2006 9th International Conference on Information Fusion, Vols 1-4			English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Information Fusion	JUL   10, 2006	Florence, ITALY			target Tracking; data association; particle filtering; Gaussian mixture model; EM algorithm	SEQUENTIAL MONTE-CARLO	This paper considers the problem of tracking a moving target in a multisensor environment using distributed particle filters (DPFs). Particle filters have a great potential for solving highly nonlinear and non-Gaussian estimation problems, in which the traditional Kalman Filter(KF) and Extended Kalman Filter(EKF) generally fail. However, in a sensor network, the implementation of distributed particle filters requires huge communications between local sensor nodes and the fusion center. To make the DPF approach feasible for real time processing and to reduce communication requirements, we approximate a posteriori distribution obtained from the local particle,filters by a Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM). We propose a modified EM algorithm to estimate the parameters of GMMs obtained locally. These parameters are transmitted to the fusion center where the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator(BLUE) is. used for fusion. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

J	Annis, DH; Craig, BA				Annis, DH; Craig, BA			Statistical properties and inference of the antimicrobial MIC test	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						serial dilution assay; measurement error; interval censoring; EM algorithm		A common method for measuring the drug-specific minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an antibacterial agent is via a two-fold broth dilution test known as the MIC test. Because this procedure implicitly rounds data upward, inference based on unadjusted measurements is biased and overestimates bacterial resistance to a drug. We detail this test procedure and its associated bias, which, in many cases, has an expected value of approximately 0.5 on the log(2) scale. In addition, new bias-corrected estimates of resistance are proposed. A numeric example is used to illustrate the extent to which the traditional resistance estimate can overestimate the true proportion of resistant strains, a phenomenon which is remedied by using the proposed estimates.

Our group is constructing an imager based on discrete detector arrays that will acquire multi-angle data to produce tomographic images of the breast. The goal of this investigation was to utilize Monte-Carlo simulations to determine the effect of detector element dimensions on breast lesion detectability. Specifically, the Geant4 Application for Tomography Emission (GATE) software package was used to simulate the performance of the new system. Scanners configured with detector arrays having square elements with widths of 1.5, 2 and 3 mm, and thicknesses of 10, 15 and 20 mm were tested. An ellipsoid filled with F-18 containing four spheres with diameters of 5, 4, 3 and 2 mm also filled with F-18 (target-to-background ratio = 8.5:1) was used to simulate a breast with tracer-avid tumors. Images were created with an iterative maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) image reconstruction algorithm. Lesion detectability was assessed by calculating the peak signal-to-noise ratio for each sphere. Since the GATE software does not model optical effects in the scintillator, a simulation study investigating photon transport in the detector elements using DETECT97 was performed. Results from these studies indicated that narrow (1.5 or 2.0 mm wide) elements 10 or 15 mm in length should produce an imager that would detect breast lesions <= 3 mm in diameter.

In this paper, we examined how the estimates fluctuate during an EM procedure for a recursive model of categorical variables. It is found that the fluctuation takes place mostly during the initial stage of the procedure and that it can be reduced by applying a Bayes method of estimation.

J	Farrell, MD; Mersereau, RM				Farrell, MD; Mersereau, RM			Hyperspectral parameter estimation of elliptically contoured t mixture models using expectation-maximisation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							EM ALGORITHM; ATMOSPHERIC CORRECTIONS; IMAGERY	The remote sensing community has been interested in parameter estimation for many years, and with the maturation of hyperspectral imaging technology, it is natural to turn our attention to estimating parameters of models for hyperspectral data. Existing statistical models employ one or many normal distributions to account for spectral variability. However, recent work demonstrates the deviation from normality for many data, and the lack of robustness of normal models. As such, we develop adaptive probability density models for hyperspectral images based on a mixture of I distributions. Model parameters are estimated using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, both in a traditional and stochastic formulation, with I distributions to account for the long, heavy tails exhibited by remotely sensed hyperspectral data. What makes this paper unique is the fact that unlike earlier work that uses EM in the context of normal or other distributions, no manual manipulation is required during model generation, and all parameters (including the important degrees of freedom) are estimated simultaneously from the data. Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data demonstrate our automated approach, and clustering is performed based on posterior probabilities. Results are statistically evaluated for goodness-of-fit. While multivariate distributions are used to accommodate the vector nature of hyperspectral image pixels, the techniques developed here apply equally well to univariate distributions for standard image processing with scalar pixel values.

A continuous time capture-recapture sampling technique is used to monitor the distribution of the population between the different areas. Using measure change techniques finite-dimensional filters for the number of animals in each region are derived. Using the EM algorithm the parameters of the model are updated.

However, there have been very few attempts to estimate noise characteristics under the assumption that there is a correlation between data samples. In this work, we propose a new and a novel approach for the simultaneous Bayesian estimation of the unknown colored or correlated noise (population) covariance matrix and the hyperparameters of the covariance model using the well-known facet model. We also estimate the facet model coefficients. We use the facet model because of its simple, yet elegant, mathematical formulation. We use the generalized inverted Wishart density as the prior model for the noise covariance matrix. We place a structure on the covariance matrix using. the parameters of a correlation filter. These hyperparameters are estimated by a new extension of the expectation-maximization algorithm called the generalized constrained expectation maximization algorithm that we developed.

In the proposed method, the covariance matrix of each Gaussian component is decomposed into two parts, namely a transformation matrix shared among the components and a component specific diagonal covariance matrix of the transformed feature. We call this model a semi-tied full covariance Gaussian mixture model, and present a generalized expectation maximization algorithm to estimate the model parameters. Compared with previous similar approaches such as orthogonal Gaussian mixture model, our model achieves higher recognition rate without increasing the number of free parameters. We apply the proposed model on handwritten numeral recognition, and the experimental results validate its effectiveness.

An important early model was proposed by Barrett and Marshall (1969) and extended by Schwartz, MacDonald and Heuchel (1980). Recently, researchers have further extended these models by adding covariates. However, the increasingly complicated models are challenging to analyze with frequentist methods such as the EM algorithm. Bayesian models are more feasible, and the computation can be done via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We consider a Bayesian model with an effect for protected intercourse to analyze data from the California Women's Reproductive Health Study and assess the effects of water contaminants and hormones. There are two main contributions in the paper. (1) For protected intercourse, we propose modeling the ratios of daily conception probabilities with protected intercourse to corresponding daily conception probabilities with unprotected intercourse. Due to the small sample size of our data set, we assume the ratios are the same for each day but unknown. (2) We consider Bayesian analysis under a unimodality assumption where the probabilities of conception increase before ovulation and decrease after ovulation. Gibbs sampling is used for finding the Bayesian estimates. There is some evidence that the two covariates affect fecundability.

Within this framework, the noise characteristics of four common analytical techniques [FAME, FAME2-pos, CN (carbon number), and AgLC] were investigated and modeled by both additive and multiplicative noise terms. The fat blend recognition (FBR) performance was investigated under these two types of noise, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, an extension is proposed that makes it possible to detect interesterifications of unknown mixtures, which was impossible before. The proposed procedure is divided into a qualitative estimation stage, which is focused on identifying the raw materials (RM), followed by a quantitative estimation stage, which is focused on quantifying the levels of the RM identified. We compared two qualitative strategies and four quantitative methods for their ability to correctly estimate simulated mixtures under the noise characteristics determined. The comparison of methods was extended to actual mixtures, revealing promising results. Our analysis presents multiple directions for further adulteration and FBR studies.

J	Mao, DQ; Luo, Y; Cheng, MS; Zhang, JH				Mao, DQ; Luo, Y; Cheng, MS; Zhang, JH			Functional grouping of yeast genes via biclustering microarray data	FRONTIERS IN BIOSCIENCE			English	Article						biclustering; yeast; gene; pattern	EXPRESSION DATA; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE	Biclustering algorithm on Gibbs sampling strategy is a recruit in the field of the analysis of gene expression data of microarray experiments. Its feasibility and validity still need to be researched not only for synthetic datasets but also for real datasets. Here we investigated a biclustering algorithm on a microarray dataset of Yeast genome through building a database for storing microarray datasets and MIPS data, and running the scripts on Matlab platform to discover gene patterns. In contrast with standard clusterings that reveal genes behaving similarly over all the conditions, biclustering groups genes over only a subset of conditions for which those genes have a sharp probability distribution. It has the key advantage of providing a transparent probabilistic interpretation of the biclusters. Its basic strategy of Gibbs sampling does not suffer from the problem of local minima that often characterizes expectation maximization, so that the patterns should be more global and accurate. Also we tested it wit h the known explanation of genes in MIPS, objectively to demonstrate the effectiveness and deficiencies of biclustering approach, and the functions of a few unknown ORFs in some bicluster can be deduced in the present research. In addition, the result of similarity searching in Blast-Search can be an assistant evidence for its effectivity.

J	Wang, Y				Wang, Y			A semiparametric regression model with missing covariates in continuous-time capture-recapture studies	AUSTRALIAN & NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF STATISTICS			English	Article						capture-recapture studies; conditional likelihood; EM algorithm; missing covariates; Monte Carlo method; semiparametric model	EM ALGORITHM	Covariate data were missing when a semiparametric regression model was used to study bird abundance in the Mai Po Sanctuary, Hong Kong. This paper proposes an EM-type algorithm to estimate the regression parameters for that study. Analytical calculation of the expectation in the EM method is difficult, or even impossible, especially when missing covariates are continuous. A Monte Carlo method is used in the EM algorithm to ease the calculation complexity. Asymptotic variances of the parameter estimates are also derived. Properties of the proposed estimators are assessed through numerical simulations and a real example.

J	Yu, D; Acero, A				Yu, D; Acero, A			System-initiative spoken dialog applications using interactive clustering	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SPEECH AND AUDIO PROCESSING			English	Article						automatic analysis; call transition diagram; data mining; model-based clustering; semi-supervised clustering; speech recognition	EM ALGORITHM	While many successful spoken dialog systems have been deployed over telephone networks in recent years, the high cost of developing such applications has led to limited adoption. Despite large research efforts in user-initiative and mixed-initiative systems, most commercial applications follow a system initiative approach because they are simpler to design and are found to work adequately. Yet, even designing such system-initiative spoken dialog systems has proven costly when compared with simpler touchtone systems. To address this issue, we describe in this paper our efforts in building diagnostics tools to let nonexperienced speech developers write usable applications without the need for transcribing calls. Our approach consists of two steps. In the first step, we cluster calls based on Question/Answer (QA) states and transitions, analyze the success rates associated with each QA state and transition, and identify the most problematic QA states and transitions based on a criterion we call Arc Cut Gain in Success Rate (ACGSR). In the second step, we cluster calls associated with problematic QA transitions through an approach we term Interactive Clustering (IC). The purpose of this step is to automatically cluster calls that are similar to those already labeled by the developers to maximize productivity. Experiments on an internal auto-attendant application show that our approach can significantly reduce the time and effort needed to identify problems in spoken dialog applications.

One of the goals of this study is to reveal the relationship between subcomponents of cholesterol and pulmonary function. We consider the subcomponents of total cholesterol, namely high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, to investigate the relationship of cholesterol levels with pulmonary function in a longitudinal study. To answer these questions, we propose new methodology for hierarchical reciprocal graphical models. We consider the identification and estimation of these models, and propose maximum likelihood estimation using a generalized EM algorithm. A simulation study of the algorithm and the corresponding estimates reveals excellent performance of the proposed procedures. Application of this methodology to the Normative Aging Study reveals complicated associations between pulmonary function and the subcomponents of total cholesterol.

J	Desousa, C; Murrells, T				Desousa, C; Murrells, T			The use of SPlus software to analyse event history data: An application to the early career promotion of nurses in UK	QUALITY & QUANTITY			English	Article						SPlus; event history analysis; survival analysis; nursing; career promotion	SURVIVAL ANALYSIS; EM ALGORITHM; DURATION	This paper discusses the benefits of using SPlus software to carry out longitudinal analyses such as event history methods. An illustration is provided using three-year career histories of a nationally drawn cohort of recently qualified registered nurses, who completed a diploma programme in the UK between August 1997 and September 1998. For the purposes of this paper, the time to first promotion is examined using a Cox proportional hazards model with a frailty term included, to allow for unobserved heterogeneity. The results indicated that men have a slightly higher rate of promotion compared with women, and particularly when compared with women who took a maternity break during their early career. Age is also a significant factor, with younger cohort members being promoted at a higher rate than their older colleagues. The inclusion of a frailty term to account for clustering at the university level also significantly improved the model. It is shown that SPlus, which is a powerful, user-friendly statistical package, can be easily utilized by researchers to carry out event history analysis as well produce high quality cumulative hazard and diagnostic plots using its sophisticated graphics facilities.

The image is described as a sample of a joint Gibbs random field of region labels and grey levels. To initialize the model, a mixed multimodal empirical grey-level distribution is approximated with linear combinations of Gaussians, one combination per region. Bayesian decisions involving expectation maximization and genetic optimization techniques are used to sequentially estimate and refine parameters of the model, including the number of Gaussians for each region. The final estimates are more accurate than with conventional normal mixture models and result in more adequate region borders in the image. Experiments show that the proposed technique segments complex multimodal medical images of different types more accurately than several other known algorithms.

J	Fang, XZ; Chen, JD				Fang, XZ; Chen, JD			The computation of Buehler confidence limits	SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES A-MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Buehler confidence limits; EM algorithm; small sample	EM ALGORITHM	In medicine and industry, small sample size often arises owing to the high test cost. Then exact confidence inference is important. Buehler confidence limit is a kind of exact confidence limit for the function of parameters in a model. It can be always defined if the order in sample space is given. But the computing problem is often difficult, especially for the cases with high dimension parameter or with incomplete data. This paper presents an algorithm to compute the Buehler confidence limits by EM algorithm. This is the first-time usage of EM algorithm on Buehler confidence limits, but the algorithm is often used for maximum likelihood estimate in literatures. Three computation examples are given to illustrate the method.

We show how the parallel transport of surface normals can be used to impose curvature consistency and also to iteratively update surface normal directions so as to improve the brightness error. We commence by showing how to make local estimates of the Hessian matrix from surface normal information. With the local Hessian matrix to hand, we develop an "EM-like" algorithm for updating the surface normal directions. At each image location. parallel transport is applied to the neighbouring surface normals to generate a sample of local surface orientation predictions. From this sample, a local weighted estimate of the image brightness is made. The transported surface normal which gives the brightness prediction which is closest to this value is selected as the revised estimate of surface orientation. The revised surface normals obtained in this way may in turn be used to re-estimate the Hessian matrix, and the process iterated until stability is reached. We experiment with the method on a variety of real world and synthetic data. Here we explore the properties of the fields of surface normals and the height data delivered by the method.

The good error correcting capability of BTC and the large diversity gain characteristics of STBC can be achieved simultaneously. The resulting receiver outperforms the iterative convolutional Turbo receiver with maximum a posteriori probability expectation-maximization (MAP-EM) algorithm. Because of its ability to perform the encoding and decoding processes in parallel, the proposed system is easy to implement in real time.

Different demodulation schemes based on expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm are studied along with the channel impulse response (CIR) algorithms. We studied different CIR guessing algorithms including the Em-based algorithms such as a space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization algorithm (SAGE). It is shown that the proposed turbo-EM receiver employing a soft maximum a posteriori (MAP) EM demodulator and a belief propagation LDPC decoder can perform within I dB from the ergodic capacity of the studied MIMO OFDM channels. Besides, we find that a suboptimum structure based oil a soft interference cancellation MMSE filtering demodulator exhibits negligible loss in non-correlated fading MIMO channels but suffer extra performance loss in highly correlated MIMO channels.

J	Van Der Maas, HLJ; Raijmakers, MEJ; Visser, I				Van Der Maas, HLJ; Raijmakers, MEJ; Visser, I			Inferring the structure of latent class models using a genetic algorithm	BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS			English	Article							CROSS-VALIDATION; EM ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION; CONSTRAINTS; SELECTION; HMM	Present optimization techniques in latent class analysis apply the expectation maximization algorithm or the Newton-Raphson algorithm for optimizing the parameter values of a prespecified model. These techniques can be used to find maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters, given the specified structure of the model, which is defined by the number of classes and, possibly, fixation and equality constraints. The model structure is usually chosen on theoretical grounds. A large variety of structurally different latent class models can be compared using goodness-of-fit indices of the chi-square family, Akaike's information criterion, the Bayesian information criterion, and various other statistics. However, finding the optimal structure for a given goodness-of-fit index often requires a lengthy search in which all kinds of model structures are tested. Moreover, solutions may depend on the choice of initial values for the parameters. This article presents a new method by which one can simultaneously infer the model structure from the data and optimize the parameter values. The method consists of a genetic algorithm in which any goodness-of-fit index can be used as a fitness criterion. In a number of test cases in which data sets from the literature were used, it is shown that this method provides models that fit equally well as or better than the models suggested in the original articles.

First, histogram patterns of a specific image feature, such as intensity or hue value, are estimated from image sequence and stored up. Next, Gaussian distribution parameters which correspond to object components involved in the scene are estimated by applying the EM algorithm to the accumulated histogram. The number of the components is simultaneously estimated by evaluating the minimum value of Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This method can be applied to a variety of computer vision issues, for example, the color image segmentation and the recognition of scene situation transition. Experimental results applied for indoor and outdoor scenes showed the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In a standard HMM, observation vectors are represented by mixture of Gaussians (MoG) that are dependent on discrete-valued hidden state sequence. The GFA-HMM introduces a hierarchy of continuous-valued latent representation of observation vectors, where latent vectors in one level are acoustic-unit dependent and latent vectors in a higher level are acoustic-unit independent. An expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is derived for maximum likelihood estimation of the model. We show through a set of experiments to verify the potential of the GFA-HMM as an alternative acoustic modeling technique. In one experiment, by varying the latent dimension and the number of mixture components in the latent spaces, the GFA-HMM attained more compact representation than the standard HMM. In other experiments with varies noise types and speaking styles, the GFA-HMM was able to have (statistically significant) improvement with respect to the standard HMM, (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Amaral, JA; Pereira, EP; Paixao, MT				Amaral, JA; Pereira, EP; Paixao, MT			Data and projections of HIV/AIDS cases in Portugal: An unstoppable epidemic?	JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						HIV/AIDS; back-calculation; projections; Portugal	SHORT-TERM PROJECTIONS; AIDS EPIDEMIC; SIZE; HIV	The size of the affected population with HIV/AIDS is a vital question asked by healthcare providers. A statistical procedure called Back-calculation has been the most widely used method to answer that question. Recent discussions suggest that this method is gradually becoming less appropriate for reliable incidence and prevalence estimates, as it does not take into account the effect of treatment. In spite of this, in the current paper that method and a worst-case scenario are used to assess the quality of previous projections and obtain new ones. The first problem faced was the need to account for reporting delays, no reporting and underreporting. The adjusted AIDS incidence data were then used to obtain lower bounds on the size of the AIDS epidemic, using the back-calculation methodology. A Weibull and Gamma distribution was considered for the latency period distribution. The EM algorithm was applied to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the HIV incidence. The density of infection times was parameterized as a step function. The methodology is applied to AIDS incidence in Portugal for four different transmission categories ( injecting drug users, heterosexual, homo/bisexual and other) to obtain short-term projections ( 2002 - 2005) and an estimate of the minimum size of the epidemic.

The utilization of supplementary information. in an estimation system utilizing channel estimation results, blind modulation estimation, and blind encoder estimation using several decoders information and encoder transitions have been considered to overcome these two problems. There are however many issues in these methods. such as the channel estimation difference between transmitter and receiver, computational complexity and the assumption of perfect Channel State Information (CSI). Our proposal, on the other hand, decreases decoder and demodulator selection error using a Hidden-Markov Model (HMM). In order to estimate the switching patterns of the encoder and modulator. our proposed system selects the maximum likelihood encoder and modulator transition patterns using both encoder and modulator transition probability based on the HMM obtained by CSI and also Decoder and Demodulator Selection Error probabilities. Therefore, the decoder and demodulation results can be achieved efficiently without any restraint on the pattern of switching encoder and modulation.

In addition, image noise from reconstructions acquired with various levels of axial collimation was investigated. A warm cylinder (20-cm diameter and 70-cm long) was simulated using the GEANT 3.21 Monte Carlo simulation code for different collimator designs: open-frame (OPEN), parallel (PAR) axial, and hybrid parallel fan-beam (HPF) axial collimators. Twenty noisy sets of list-mode data were simulated for each collimator. In addition, events from the first noisy list-mode data set of each category (OPEN, PAR axial, and HPF axial collimators) were chosen at random with replacement to produce twenty new sets of the same size. List-mode data were reconstructed using a 3-D ordered-subsets expectation-maximization (OSEM) list-mode iterative reconstruction algorithm using two subsets and up to 10 iterations. The standard deviations within volumes of interest (VOIs) were computed, and the mean value of this estimate over noise realizations was evaluated. The results indicate that there is no statistical significant difference in the standard deviation of VOI estimates from noisy realizations and bootstrap samples when using the OPEN, the PAR axial, and the HPF axial collimators. The results showed that the precision of VOI estimates varies with the axial spatial location within the object and the axial collimator. In addition, noise variation within list-mode reconstructed images appears to be related to the 3-D sensitivity map.

ANTANES collaboration	Algorithms to search for point-like neutrinos sources with the ANTARES telescope	Proceedings of the 29th International Cosmic Ray Conference, Vol 5: OG 2.5, 2.6 & 2.7			English	Proceedings Paper	29th International Cosmic Ray Conference	AUG 03-10, 2005	Pune, INDIA	Forsch Zentrum Karsruhe Inst Kernphys, Univ Karlsruhe, Inst Expt Kemphys, Tata Inst Fundamental Res, Int Union Pure & Appl Phys				The detection of astrophysical sources of high energy neutrinos is one of the main motivations for building a neutrino telescope. The ANTARES telescope is being deployed in the Mediterranean Sea. the detector will consist in a tridimensional array of photomultipliers (PMTs) that will detect the Cherenkov fight induced by the muons produced in neutrino interactions. Since the neutrino fluxes from point-like sources are expected to be small, it is of the utmost importance to take advantage of the ANTARES accurate pointing power (angular resolution less than 0.3 degrees for E-nu greater than 10 TeV) to disentangle a possible signal from the unavoidable atmospheric neutrino background. In order to distinguish an excess of neutrino events from the background, several search algorithms have been developed within the ANTARES collaboration. Some of them perform binned searches of clusters, some others use likelihood maximization techniques and recently a method based on the well known Expectation-Maximization clustering algorithm has been devised. In this contribution, these different methods are reviewed and their discovery potential using the ANTARES neutrino telescope are presented.

In this paper, we propose a basis function optimization method using a mixture density model. We generalize the Gaussian radial basis functions to arbitrary covariance matrices, in order to fully utilize the Gaussian probability density function. We also try to achieve a parsimonious network topology by using a systematic procedure. According to experimental results, the proposed method achieved fairly comparable performance with smaller number of hidden layer nodes to the conventional approach in terms of correct classification rates.

However, for proper recovery of the input, the OFDM receiver needs accurate channel information. In this paper, we propose an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for joint channel and data recovery. The algorithm makes use of the rich structure of the underlying communication problem- a structure induced by the data and channel constraints. These constraints include pilots, the cyclic prefix, and the finite alphabet constraints on the data, and sparsity, finite delay spread, and the statistical properties of the channel (frequency and time correlation). The algorithm boils down to a forward-backward (FB) Kalman filter. We also suggest a suboptimal modification that is able to track the channel and recover the data with no latency.

The ILP transform is a pyramid of decimated complex-valued coefficients at multiple scales, derived from dual-tree complex wavelets, whose phases indicate the presence of different feature types (edges and ridges). We use an Expectation-Maximization algorithm to cluster large ILP coefficients that are spatially adjacent and similar in phase. We then demonstrate the relationship that these clusters possess with respect to observable image content, and conclude with a took at potential applications of these clusters, such as rotation- and scale-invariant object recognition.

The presence of a few highly erroneous measurements, or outliers, results in erroneous sensor location estimates. In this paper we employ the EM algorithm to iteratively detect outlier measurements and provide robust position estimates of the sensors. The derivation of the algorithm is given, and Monte-Carlo simulations are presented to compare this estimator to others. The performance of the EM-based algorithm is also shown to be close to the Cramer-Rao lower bound for position estimation when perfect knowledge of the outlier process is known.

This model is a powerful tool for modeling the images which are composed of homogeneous regions. The joint estimation of the sources, classification labels, the mixing matrix and all the hyperparameters of the model (noise covariance, means and variances of the pixels in each region) can be done through the Gibbs sampling of the joint posterior probability law of these unknowns, given the observed mixed data. In previous works, we had implemented this general algorithm. However the huge complexity and cost of this algorithm limits its use in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a Mean Field Approximation (MFA) approach which consists in approximating this joint posterior by a separable one whose sampling will be much easier and less expensive. Based on MFA, we propose three algorithms which look like the Stochastic Expectation-Maximization (SEM) to jointly separate and segment the image sources.

In the case of the Gaussian Mixture models, the reduced rank discriminant analysis is equivalent to the weighted rank k linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The reduced rank solution in the mixtures of multivariate Gaussian models was obtained from the full rank robust mixture solution. The classification in the new dimensions was compared with the discriminant analysis approach based on the original coordinates, using robust S-estimators. In most of the cases, the robust reduced rank mixture discriminant analysis (mda) performed better for the test data. However, for the case of common component covariance being diagonal, the robust reduced rank mixture discriminant analysis performed better than the robust full rank mixture discriminant analysis producing smaller errors in classification.

In particular, the statistical parameters related to changed and unchanged classes in the log-ratio image are estimated in an explicit way by the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Then, we propose to identify automatically the number of changes present in the log-ratio image using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Finally, in order to increase the accuracy of the change-detection map we perform the analysis of the log-ratio image using Markov Random Fields (MRF) that exploits the interpixel class dependency in the spatial domain according to the use of a regularization term. The experimental results obtained on multitemporal SAR images characterized by a single change confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The algorithms are based on radiative transfer theory and statistical signal processing methods. A subspace orthogonal projection operator is used to statistically subtract the large thermal background contribution to the measurements and a robust maximum likelihood solution is used to deduce the target spectrum and estimate its mass-column concentration. The deduced BG (TEP) extinction spectrum matched the library spectrum very well. The estimation of the TEP vapor time-dependent concentration is excellent. Detection threshold and probabilities of detection and false alarm are computed (expectation-maximization) with a Gaussian-mixture model. The results of this study are encouraging, as they suggest, for the first time to our knowledge, the feasibility of detecting bio-aerosols with passive FTIR sensors.

By using PBRT (physically based rendering toolkit) we create a scripting environment that simplifies the programming of tomography algorithms such as Maximum-Likelihood Expectation Maximization (ML-EM) or Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (SART, a deviant of ART). This allows the rapid development and testing of novel algorithms with a variety of parameter configurations. Additionally, it takes advantage of speed-up techniques that are common and well-researched in the graphics community, such as multi-resolution techniques, based on octree's or similar space-partitioning data structures as well as algorithms accelerated through graphics hardware (GPU). Using our framework, we have evaluated different attenuation correction schemes during the back projection of ML-EM and SART.

When trying to infer a model from little information it is necessary to give much more precedence to generalization, rather than specificity, otherwise, any attempt will be fated to overfitting. In this paper we address this issue by focusing on data sparseness and noisy information, and propose a density estimation technique that achieves regularized curves when data is scarce. We first compare the proposed method with the EM algorithm for mixture models on density estimation problems. Next, we apply the method, together with Bayesian networks, on realistic simulations of static gene networks, and compare the obtained results with the standard discrete Bayesian network model. We intend to demonstrate that adopting a discrete approach is not justifiable when only a small amount of information is available.

Multipoint methods dominate the literature, specifically methods that require the acquisition of three images at different echo times. These methods estimate the contribution of fat and water signals by solving a set of equations using echos acquired with the relative phase of fat and water at -pi, 0, pi. We present a novel approach to fat suppression that requires only a single image. Using an expectation maximization algorithm on a gradient echo image with the relative phase of fat and water at approximately pi/2, the pixel composition and inhomogeneity of the magnetic field are estimated. Fat suppressed images are generated from estimated inhomogeneity. Our method does not need custom pulse sequences. Results from mathematical phantoms and volunteer images are reported.

During thermal cancer treatment there are usually small temperature fluctuations of between 37 degrees C and 43 degrees C inside the human body. These fluctuations are very important to monitor accurately for quality cancer treatment, preferably with a non-invasive technique. Through-trans mission ultrasonic tomography is a convenient non-invasive technique, which allows internal cross-sectional images of acoustic properties to be obtained; acoustic properties change as the temperature changes, and this allows temperature fields in tissue to be measured. Computer modeling of temperature fluctuation reconstruction using ultrasonic through-trans mission tomography has been carried out. The model considers a fan-bean tomography scheme (60 sensors, 2160 rays in total) and iterative techniques for solving the inverse problem. It also assumes the 2D temperature is being reconstructed in an area of tissue of 60mm x 60mm size, and the temperature fluctuation size is similar to 6.5 mm in diameter. Such heated regions can appear, for example, during thermal treatment using high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). Algorithms for solving the inverse problem using algebraic iterative methods (including EM, ART and SART) have been investigated. Bilinear interpolation of temperature values was used in between the nodes, in which temperature is being reconstructed. The model takes into account electronic measurement noise and assumes increasing linear dependence of sound speed on temperature, which is approximately correct for the considered temperature range and non-fatty tissue. Circular and ellipsoidal heated regions have been investigated, along with multiple contrasts. It was shown that it is possible to reconstruct temperature fluctuations with a good accuracy. A reconstruction technique was also investigated for regions of tissue which contain bones or other acoustically nontransparent objects, as these objects cause missing parts in the projection data. A special method for temperature distribution reconstruction from noisy projections with missing data was developed. The developed method reduces the number of unknowns by partial substitution of values obtained by iterative EM technique reconstruction. The accuracy of the developed method was investigated by computer modeling and compared with known expectation maximization methods. It was shown that the developed method gives higher accuracy and less distortion after reconstruction than the expectation maximization method. The developed method, therefore, may give a better opportunity to accurately monitor the thermal cancer treatment of more regions of the human body.

This paper is dedicated to considering problems on the estimation of a density function simply from its marginal distributions. The possibility of the learning problem is first investigated and a uniqueness proposition involving a large family of distribution functions is proposed. The learning problem is then reformulated into an optimization task which is studied and applied to Gaussian mixture models (GMM) via the generalized expectation maximization procedure (GEM) and Monte Carlo method. Experimental results show that our approach for GMM, only using partial information of the coordinates of the samples, can obtain satisfactory performance, which in turn verifies the proposed reformulation and proposition.

Usually, the difficulty of regularization is to suppress the noise but not smooth the edges. In order to preserve the edges of restored image effectively, a general wavelet-domain edge-preserving regularization scheme which is analogous to the space-domain maximum a posterior probability (MAP) estimation in Markov random field (MRF) is proposed. The corresponding solving strategy of the wavelet-domain regularization is also put forward. Several potential functions which have the ability of edge-preserving are analyzed and tested. To get rid of the Gibbs effects brought during the wavelet-domain restoration, the horizontal (or vertical) continuity in horizontal (or vertical) subband of natural image is employed in the form of an additional penalty. And, experiments are presented to verify the theoretical results.

This contribution focus oil the computation of derivatives of the log-likelihood and proposes a (comparatively) simple and general framework. based oil the use of Fisher and Louis identities, to obtain recursive equations for computing the score and observed information matrix. This approach is thought to be simpler than (although equivalent to) the solution provided by the so-called sensitivity equations. It is based oil the original remark that recursive smoothers for HMMs are also available for some functionals of the hidden states which do not reduce to sum functionals. This view of the problem also suggests ways in which these exact equations could be approximated using sequential Monte Carlo methods.

Radiologist's confidence level on microcallcification detection would be improved if a probability estimate of its presence could be obtained from computer-aided diagnosis. In this paper we explore detection performance of a simple Bayesian classifier based on Gaussian mixture probability density functions (pdf). Posterior probability of microcalcification presence may be estimated from the probabilistic model. Two model selection algorithms have been tested, one based on the Minimum Message Length criterion and the other on discriminative criteria obtained from the classifier performance. In addition, we propose a complementing model selection algorithm in order to improve the initial system performance obtained with these methods. Simulation results show that our model gets a good compromise between classification performance and probability estimation accuracy.

In literature, multi-user interference is often approximated with a white Gaussian process and embodied in the overall noise term. However, it has been found that, in typical indoor environments, such approximation is inadequate. In this paper, we propose a new approach to characterize the interference, based on the Gaussian mixture model, which allows to derive a joint channel and multi-user interference statistics estimator, based on the iterative Space-Alternating Generalized Expectation Maximization algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed estimator is shown by means of numerical examples.

In this article, we propose a likelihood ratio test (LRT) for symmetry of a NIG distribution. Due to the complexity of the likelihood function, an EM type algorithm proposed by Karlis ( 2002) is used to find the maximum likelihood estimates of the NIG distribution. The conclusions from a simulation study show that the LRT is usually able to achieve the desired significance levels and the testing power increases as the asymmetry increases, i.e., the proposed LRT is successful in detecting the asymmetric behavior of the NIG distribution.

A hybrid EM algorithm has also been implemented in list-mode reconstruction (H-LMEM) using delayed-coincidence event subtraction technique with the same scatter correction as in OP-LMEM. The reconstructed images of a dynamic scanning sequence of a contrast phantom have been compared with those reconstructed using the histogram-mode reconstruction, in particular, 3D Ordinary Poisson Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization (3D-OP) with the same variance-reduced random and estimated scatter. The transaxial and axial profile analyses have shown excellent agreement between histogram and both list-mode reconstructions. Likewise the preliminary contrast and noise analyses have shown a close agreement between histogram-mode and both list-mode reconstructions. Based on these results, a dual reconstruction scheme can now be applied to dynamic imaging in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with scatter correction; i.e. histogram-mode reconstruction (3D-OP) can be applied to frames with a large number of counts, and list-mode reconstruction (OP-LMEM) will subsequently be used for low statistics frames, as an effort to obtain efficient and quantitatively accurate reconstructions applicable to state-of-the-art dynamic PET imaging using the HRRT.

Since the fading is too fast for coherent reception, we employ M-ary frequency shift keying with soft noncoherent demodulation. Information is encoded by a binary turbo code. To improve performance, the soft demodulator and decoder work cooperatively through the iterative exchange of extrinsic information. During each iteration, the receiver estimates the channel state information (CSI), here defined to be the average received signal energy and noise spectral density for each block of symbols. The channel estimator uses the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm and exploits extrinsic information fed from the decoder. Simulation results show that for 16-NFSK in block independent Rayleigh fading, performance can be within 0.6 dB of the perfect CSI case by using blocks as small as 4 symbols.

The recursive relation is developed based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm with a quadratic constraint. This new perspective enables the use of linear estimation theory to deal with the blind CFO estimation problem, leading to an analytic CFO estimate in closed-form. The multiple access interference (MAI) is mitigated using the second order statistics of the interference-plus-noise vector, which can also be updated in a recursive manner under the EM formulation. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with computer simulation.

We use the mean shift procedure to determine the number of components in a mixture model and to detect their modes of each mixture component. Next, we have adopted the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to represent the probability distribution of color feature vectors. A DAEM formula is used to estimate the parameters of the GMM which represents the multi-colored objects statistically. The experimental results show that the mean shift part of the proposed MS-DAEM algorithm is efficient to determine the number of components and initial modes of each component in mixture models. And also it shows that the DAEM part provides a global optimal solution for the parameter estimation in a mixture model and the natural color images are segmented efficiently by using the GMM with components estimated by MS-DAEM algorithm.

The OPET system is capable of detecting and simultaneously imaging both high-energy gamma-rays from PET tracers and single photons in the optical wavelength from bioluminescence. The PET performance characteristics for a two-detector prototype of the OPET system are described here. Each detector consists of an 8 x 8 array of GSO crystals cut to different lengths providing a detector surface with a circular profile and a 3.4 cm ring diameter. The crystals were inserted into a laser-cut grid assembly constructed from 0.067 mm thick reflector film. Crystals were coupled to a 64-channel photomultiplier tube (PMT) and a charge-division readout circuit was implemented to decode the signals from the 64 outputs of the PMT into event location data. Flood images were taken to obtain look-up tables as well as energy spectra for each crystal. The timing resolution was determined to be 6.6 nsec. A 0.3mm Na-22 point source was stepped across the field of view (FOV) and the intrinsic detector spatial resolution was 1.23mm FWHM. The estimated peak absolute system sensitivity at the center of FOV for the two detector system was 0.33%. Data from a line phantom was acquired and reconstructed with an expectation maximization 3D reconstruction algorithm.

Although side-scan sensors do not provide direct measures of seabed elevation, their images are directly related to seabed topography. Using a mathematical model for the sonar ensonification process, approximations to the seabed characteristics can be inferred from the sonar image. The problem is however severely under-constrained, in the sense that not all the parameters involved in the image formation process can be directly determined from the side-scan image. To overcome this difficulty, we propose the utilization of a multi-resolution expectation-maximization framework to select the most probable parameters from the solution space. At every iteration the estimated- solution is used to simulate a side-scan image of the observed scene, which is then be compared to the side-scan image actually observed; solution parameters are then refined using gradient-descent optimization. The process is repeated until convergence is achieved.

Perhaps the ultimate embedded system is a neural prosthetic, where probes are inserted into the brain and recorded electrical activity is analyzed to determine which neurons have fired. In turn, this information can be used to manipulate an external device such as a robot arm or a computer mouse. To make the detection of these signals possible, some baseline data must be processed to correlate impulses to particular neurons. One method for processing this data uses a statistical clustering algorithm called Expectation Maximization, or EM. In this paper, we examine the EM clustering algorithm, determine the most computationally intensive portion, map it onto a reconfigurable device, and show several areas of performance gain.

[1] In paper "The EM algorithm and it's application in quantitative remote sensing inversion", corresponding to student-t error distribution we put forward EM algorithm and validate it's precision and robustness in theory using the 73 dataset which can be used to produce prior knowledge. As we all know, the 73 dataset have different precision with air-borne and space-borne images and there are different in application and theory. In this paper, we will use four algorithms to inverse the albedo of a 400*400 AMTIS image and compare their precision and robustness.

GS-PC first utilizes an alignment-based approach, the Gibbs sampler (the 1995 version), to derive a consensus pattern for the TFBSs present in a set of co-regulated promoter sequences. Using this consensus pattern as a drastically reduced pattern space, all obtainable 6-patterns are then enumerated, allowing up to one mismatch. After filtering off the random pattern matches, i.e., those with information content less than a user-specified cutoff value, the site alignment of each 6-pattern is evaluated for its expected frequency. All 6-patterns are thus examined, and finally the statistically most significant 6-pattern is reported, together with its site alignment. When run on three sequence sets of Escherichia coli, GS-PC performs comparably to the latest Gibbs sampler.

Different positions for each subject (pose parameters) as well as high energy shape variations need to be compensated before performing statistical analysis (like principal components analysis) on the database. The atlas is obtained as the hidden variable of an Expectation-Maximization (EM), looking for the right signal intensity at each voxel in the collection of subjects, Each subject is aligned on the current probabilistic atlas by maximizing mutual information. A fast stochastic optimization algorithm is used for estimating pose and scale parameters and a variational approach has been designed to estimate non-rigid transformations. We illustrate the effectiveness of this method for the alignment of 31 brain segmented in 4 labels : background, white and gray matter and ventricles. Our approach has the advantage of keeping a reasonably low complexity even for large databases.

In this approach, the object function is formulated as a mixture model in which the unknown model parameters describe the local structure, and local motion, of different regions in the object. The Radon transform is used to transform this model into a corresponding mixture model for the set of tomographic projections, and there is a simple relationship between the parameters of the object function and the parameters of the projections. Finally, the problem is solved in an iterative fashion to yield the set of parameters giving the best fit between the projection model and the measured projection data. A bonus of the method is the flexibility to process incomplete data in which projections are available only over a limited range of viewing angles. Results of computer simulations are presented to illustrate the algorithm performance. This problem relates to several practical aspects of CT imaging including the correction of motion artifacts caused by patient movement or breathing, as well as the important problem of imaging a beating heart.

When some prior information about the statistical models of the signal and noise is available, the estimation problem can be solved by using the maximum a postetiori (MAP) principle. In this paper, we develop an EM algorithm for the MAP estimate of signals modeled by a family of heavy-tail prior distributions: Laplacian, student-t and slash. We establish links between the EM algorithm and the Wiener estimation. We then modify the EM algorithm and propose two generalized Wiener estimation algorithms for image denoising. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed algorithms is better than that of the bi-shrinkage algorithm which is arguably one of the best in recent publications.

First, a construction algorithm of speech spectral GMM is introduced and it is based on the distance measure of speech spectral Gaussian probability. Then a noise estimation algorithm based on the GMM is proposed in the Maximum Likelihood criterion using the Expectation-Maximum (EM) algorithm. Speech enhancement experimental results show that the GMM-based MMSE estimators, especially the GMM-based MMSE short-time spectral estimator, can afford better performance than alternative speech enhancement algorithms and the proposed noise estimation algorithm can improve the enhancement performance more, especially at low SNRs.

Although the existing shot-based approaches facilitate our access to video than the raw video data do, they are still not effective for the semantic level video browsing and retrieval. To represent video structure on semantic levels, the proposed method employs an extended hidden Markov model trained by EM algorithm in order to explore the meaningful objects and the important video structures. According to the principles of the proposed method, important objects and video structure with the consideration of short term statistic as well as long term recurrence can be captured and several interesting video analysis tasks can also be performed. Finally, experiments based on several different videos validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

This algorithm updates parameter components by subblocks by alternating missing data spaces. Its efficiency has been reported in numerous simulation studies. We propose here a MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) strategy named SADA (Space-Alternating Data Augmentation) which relies on the same principle in order to sample efficiently from (posterior) distributions and we discuss its application to finite mixtures of Gaussians. For this model, we also present an original implementation of the SAGE algorithm. In Monte Carlo simulations and in an application to speaker recognition, these methods which are straightforward modifications of the standard EM and DA (Data augmentation) algorithms consistently outperform them.

MCB contains the bilingual bootstrapping as its kernel algorithm that leads to incremental knowledge acquisition. EM model is performed to train parameters in base learner. Feature translation model is improved by semantic correlation estimation. In addition we use multi-engine to produce qualified starting seeds from parallel corpora and monolingual corpora. Those seeds that are generated through unsupervised machine learning approaches can also ensure bootstrapping effectiveness in contrast with manual selected seeds in spite of their different selection mechanisms. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of MCB. Some factors including feature space and starting seed number are concerned in our experiments because EM algorithm is sensible to starting values. Limitation of resources is also concerned.

These errors could not, however, be eliminated because watermarked pictures are subjected to wide varieties of image processing such as compression, resizing, filtering, or D/A or A/D conversion. Estimating errors of video watermarks is therefore an essential requirement for electric equipment that is to use copyright and copy-control information properly. This paper proposes a video watermarking method that estimates error probability from each watermarked frame at hand after image processing by using the expectation-maximization algorithm from inferential statistics. The paper also proposes a reliable detection system of video watermarks by using the proposed method. Experimental evaluations have shown that the new method can be used reliably with the margin factor and can be widely used in electric equipment as well as content-distribution systems.

Some interesting properties of this algorithm are discussed, such as its ability to break certain cycles in factor graphs. Systems with LDPC codes are used as a starting point for practical applications of the FGEM algorithm. In particular, in channels with an unknown channel state, FGEM-based estimation-decoding algorithms can be straightforwardly obtained, and specific examples are given using the block fading channel. Applications for LDPC-based source coding, especially the Slepian-Wolf coding problem, are also given.

The models used in such analysis relate all observed variables to latent common factors. In many applications, the observations are highly non normal or discrete, e.g., polytomous responses or counts. The existing approaches for non normal observations can be considered lacking in several aspects, especially for multi-group samples situations. We propose a generalized linear model approach for multi-sample latent variable analysis that can handle a broad class of non normal and discrete observations, and that furnishes meaningful interpretation and inference in multi-group studies through maximum likelihood analysis. A Monte Carlo EM algorithm is proposed for parameter estimation. The convergence assessment and standard error estimation is addressed. Simulation studies are reported to show the usefulness of the our approach. An example from a substance abuse prevention study is also presented.

Blood vessels are separated from background tissues (fat, bones, or grey and white brain matter) by voxel-wise classification based on precise approximation of a multi-modal empirical marginal intensity distribution of the TOF-MRA data. The approximation involves a linear combination of discrete Gaussians (LCDG) with alternating signs, and we modify the conventional Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to deal with the LCDG. To validate the accuracy of our algorithm, a special 3D geometrical phantom motivated by statistical analysis of the MRA-TOF data is designed. Experiments with both the phantom and 50 real data sets confirm high accuracy of the proposed approach.

We introduce a novel fast and robust bi-directional parametric deformable model which is able to segment regions of intricate shape in multi-modal greyscale images. The power of the algorithm in terms of computation time and robustness is owing to the use of joint probabilities of the signals and region labels in individual points as external forces guiding the model evolution. These joint probabilities are derived from a Markov-Gibbs random field (MGRF) image model considering an image as a sample of two interrelated spatial stochastic processes. The low level process with conditionally independent and arbitrarily distributed signals relates to the observed image whereas its hidden map of regions is represented with the high level MGRF of interdependent region labels. Marginal probability distributions of signals in each region are recovered from a mixed empirical signal distribution over the whole image. In so doing, each marginal is approximated with a linear combination of Gaussians (LCG) having both positive and negative components. The LCG parameters are estimated using our previously proposed modification of the EM algorithm, and the high-level Gibbs potentials are computed analytically. Comparative experiments show that the proposed model outlines complicated boundaries of different modal objects much more accurately than other known counterparts.

Semi-analytical response function for ML-EM deconvolution of NaI detector energy spectra	2005 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record, Vols 1-5	IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM - CONFERENCE RECORD		English	Proceedings Paper	Nuclear Science Symposium/Medical Imaging Conference	OCT 23-29, 2005	Fajardo, PR	IEEE Nucl & Plasma Sci Soc, Brookhaven Natl Lab, CEA Saclay, DOE, CERN, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Stanford Linear Accelerator Ctr, Univ Calif Davis, Univ Washington				The response functions of two very different geometry NaI scintillation detectors were derived from a combination of Monte Carlo modeling and semi-analytical extension throughout a wide energy range. The two geometries considered were the 3 '' right circular cylinder NaI detector, that is the de facto standard for declaring sensitivity for gamma-ray spectrometers, and a 50 x 40 x 1 cm(3) NaI plate, that is typical of nuclear medicine gamma cameras. The response functions, encompassing a range of 50-2500 keV, were developed both to compare the performance of these two detector geometries and to provide the basis for implementing a Maximum Likelihood-Expectation Maximization (ML-EM) deconvolution to improve spectroscopic analysis. The goal of this development is to establish the desirability for utilizing nuclear medicine gamma cameras as high sensitivity gamma-ray spectrometers in the event of a radiological emergency.

Taking advantage of the sparsity of representations, a regularization through a prior penalty is imposed on the reconstructed coefficients. From a statistical point of view, the inpainting can be viewed as an estimation problem with missing data. The EM framework is a general iterative algorithm for ML estimation in such situations. The EM framework gives a principled way to establish formally the idea that missing samples can be recovered based on sparse representations. Furthermore, owing to its well known theoretical properties, the EM algorithm allows to investigate the convergence behavior of the inpainting algorithm.

By integrating concept hierarchy for semantic image concept organization, a hierarchical mixture model is proposed to enable multi-level image concept modeling and hierarchical classifier training. To effectively learn the base-level classifiers for the atomic image concepts at the first level of the concept hierarchy, we have proposed a novel adaptive EM algorithm to achieve more effective classifier training with higher prediction accuracy. To effectively learn the classifiers for the higher-level semantic image concepts, we have also proposed a novel technique for classifier combining by using hierarchical mixture model. The experimental results on two large-scale image databases are also provided.

The proposed approach is based on using the logistic regression model to get initial density estimation for the given empirical density. The empirical data does not exactly follow the logistic regression model, so, there will be a deviation between the empirical density and the density estimated using logistic regression model. This deviation may be positive and/or negative. In this paper we use a linear combination of Gaussian (LCG) with positive and negative components as a model for this deviation. Also, we will use the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameters of LCG. Experiments on real images demonstrate the accuracy of our approach.

This approach combines a hybrid scene model for representing the range distribution of the field and a statistical mixture model for the range data measurement noise. The image segmentation problem is formulated as an energy minimization problem which jointly estimates the target boundary together with the target region intensity and background texture directly from the noisy range data. Curve evolution techniques and an expectation-maximization algorithm are jointly employed as an efficient solver for minimizing the objective energy.

Ordinarily this algorithm. requires O(N-3) floating point operations, per iteration, for the estimation of an N-point power spectrum. However, if the linear model relating the observations to the underlying variables is sparse, the computational burden can be reduced to O(N) operations. This sparsity can be achieved approximately by a data preprocessing step that causes the effect of each underlying variable to be seen in only one component of the preprocessed observation vectors. An illustrative example involving a rotating linear array as the sensor and a Chebyshev filter bank as the preprocessor is given.

In the case of large project databases with data coming from heterogeneous sources, a single mathematical model cannot properly capture the diverse nature of the projects under consideration. In this paper, a clustering algorithm have been used as a tool to produce segmented models. A concrete case study using a modified EM algorithm is reported. In cases in which the clustering algorithm produces an statistical characterization of each of the resulting clusters, as happens with the EM algorithm, such representations can be used as similarity metrics to derive analogical estimates. This can be put in contrast with deriving partial parametric models for each cluster The paper also provides a comparison of quality of adjustment of both approaches.

HCI analysts use a number of techniques to build models that are faithful to actual computer use. A key technique is through eye tracking, in which the region of the screen being examined is recorded in order to determine key areas of use. Clustering techniques allow these regions to be grouped to help facilitate usability analysis. Historically, approaches such as the Expectation Maximization (EM) and K-Means algorithm have performed well. Unfortunately, these approaches require the number of clusters k to be known beforehand in many real world situations, this hampers the effectiveness of the analysis of the data. We propose a novel algorithm that is well suited for cluster discovery for HCI data; we do not require the number of clusters to be specified a priori and our approach scales very well for both large datasets and high dimensionality. Experiments have demonstrated that our approach works well for real data from HCI applications.

An efficient iterative deconvolution system is introduced, where the multisensor images are fused, based on the classification of each image in a predetermined number of classes that represent the components of a finite mixture of normal densities (FMN). The EM algorithm is utilized for the learning of the FMN model. The recursive employment of the classification and fusion processes, followed by an optimized adaptive filtering, converges to a global enhanced version of the original scene in only a few iterations. Experimental results establish the efficiency of the proposed scheme.

Neither the original host nor the embedding signature is assumed available. We demonstrate that for hidden messages of sufficient length (data sample support), recovery can be achieved with probability of error close to what may be attained with known embedding signature and known original host autocorrelation matrix. For small hidden messages, the signature estimate calculated by the iterative generalized least squares Procedure can be fed as initial value to a (computationally costly) expectation-maximization signature identification scheme that we derive. Message recovery can again be carried out successfully by means of a linear sample-matrix-inversion minimum-mean-square-error receiver.

In practice, researchers using various methods deal with this problem in many less or more satisfactory ways. This paper validates the use of SOM (Self-Organizing Map) in estimating missing data in a marketing field and refers to another non-trivial method of handling missing values called expectation maximization (EM).

We introduce a temporal prior based on motion-compensation to enforce temporal correlations along the curved trajectories that follow the cardiac motion. The image frames in a sequence are reconstructed simultaneously through maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. We evaluated the performance of our algorithm using the 4D gated mathematical cardiac-torso (gMCAT) D1.01 phantom to simulate gated SPECT perfusion imaging with Tc-99m-sestamibi. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach could significantly improve the accuracy of reconstructed images without causing cross-frame blurring that may arise form the cardiac motion.

We propose a strategy to synchronize and detect a new user accessing the system by exploiting the knowledge of the synchronization parameters of previously sync chronized users. In this way, we can synchronize one user at a time and hereby avoid complex multi-dimensional optimization problems. To limit the number of pilot symbols required for this problem, we exploit all available information, i.e., pilot symbols and the unknown coded symbols of all users. We resort to the iterative Space Alternating Generalized Expectation Maximization (SAGE) algorithm to tackle this problem in a systematic manner.

Using a pilot sequence to obtain sufficiently accurate channel estimates for this system requires an unacceptably large number of pilot symbols. In this contribution, we consider several code-aided estimation schemes which can be incorporated in an iterative Space-Time (ST) turbo detection scheme. We point out that the EM algorithm, which has recently been addressed as a convenient tool for code-aided estimation, has some serious drawbacks because of the large number of parameters to be estimated. These can be resolved using the Space Alternating Generalized Expectation Maximization (SAGE) algorithm. We show through computer simulations that the proposed low complexity ST receiver with SAGE estimation considerably outperforms conventional estimation schemes.

Conventional estimation algorithms rely mainly on the presence of training symbols within the data stream, reducing both the energy- and bandwidth efficiency. Our main goal is to remove the need for long training sequences by exploiting the presence of an underlying error-correcting code.

In this contribution we consider a system with bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) with an iterative detector consisting of Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) Interference Cancellation, followed by a soft demapper and a MAP decoder. We derive an estimator that makes use of the a posteriori probabilities computed by the detector. This multi-user estimator is based on the iterative Space Alternating Generalized Expectation Maximization (SAGE) algorithm. We show through computer simulation that the proposed receiver considerably outperforms conventional channel estimation schemes. Finally, the impact of different mappings in the BICM scheme will be evaluated.

Since the long continuous daily human motion data has high dimensions and becomes huge size, the human posture data should be effectively compressed. The long term posture data has nonlinear distribution on the posture space, since each specific posture such as standing and sitting has different property. The posture data is allocated into some subspaces and compressed for each subspace with Mixtures of Probabilistic Principal Component Analyzer (MPPCA). MPPCA is improved by replacing conventional EM algorithm with Deterministic annealing EM algorithm (DAEM) to avoid initial parameter sensitivity. The posture probability density is constructed over those subspaces. The adequate human posture can be reconstructed from the insufficient data by introducing the posture probability density into the Sequential Monte Carlo frame work. The experimental results show that the robust human posture estimation can be realized since this method does not estimate the unique posture but estimates the proper posterior posture density with using the posture prior knowledge.

The new designs and technologies of these scanners and the modern reconstruction methods have allowed to reach high spatial resolution and sensitivity. Despite their successes, some important issues remain to be addressed in high resolution PET imaging. First, iterative reconstruction methods like maximum likelihood-expectation maximization (MLEM) are known to recover resolution, but also to create noisy images and edge artifacts if some kind of regularization is not imposed. Second, the limit of resolution achievable by iterative methods on high resolution scanners is not quantitatively understood. Third, the use of regularization methods like Sieves or maximum a posteriori (MAP) requires the determination of the optimal values of several adjustable parameter that may be object-dependent. In this work we review these problems in high resolution PET and establish that the origin of them is more related with the physical effects involved in the emission and detection of the radiation during the acquisition than with the kind of iterative reconstruction method chosen. These physical effects (positron range, non-collinearity, scatter inside the object and inside the detector materials) cause that the tube of response (TOR) that connects the voxels with a line of response (LOR) is rather thick. This implies that the higher frequencies of the patient organ structures are not recorded by the scanner and therefore cannot be recovered during the reconstruction. As iterations grow, MLEM algorithms try to recover higher frequencies in the image. Once that a certain critic frequency is reached, this only maximizes high frequency noise. Using frequency response analyses techniques, we determine the maximum achievable resolution, before edge artifacts spoil the quality of the image, for a particular scanner as a function of the thickness of the TOR, and independently of the reconstruction method employed. With the same techniques, we can deduce well defined stopping criteria for reconstructions methods. Also, criteria for the highest number of subsets which should be used and how the design of the scanners can be optimized when statistical reconstruction methods are employed, is established.

One common representation of a motif is a Markov model known as a score matrix. Matrix based motif discovery has been extensively studied but no positive results have been known regarding its theoretical hardness. We present the first non-trivial upper bound on the complexity (worst-case computation time) of this problem. Other than linear terms, our bound depends only on the motif width w (which is typically 5-20) and is a dramatic improvement relative to previously known bounds. We prove this bound by relating the motif discovery problem to a search problem over permutations of strings of length w, in which the permutations have a particular property. We give a constructive proof of an upper bound on the number of such permutations. For an alphabet size of sigma (typically 4) the trivial bound is n! approximate to (n/e)(n), n = sigma(w). Our bound is roughly n(sigma log(sigma) n)(n). We relate this theoretical result to the exact motif discovery program, TsukubaBB, whose algorithm contains ideas which inspired the result. We describe a recent improvement to the TsukubaBB program which can give a speed up of nine or more and use a dataset of REB1 transcription factor binding sites to illustrate that exact methods can indeed be used in some practical situations.			horton-p@aist.go.jp; fujibuchi-wataru@aist.go.jp					AKUTSU T, 2000, P 4 ANN INT C COMP M, P1, DOI 10.1145/332306.332311; BAILEY TL, 1995, MACH LEARN, V21, P51, DOI 10.1023/A:1022617714621; Blekas K, 2003, BIOINFORMATICS, V19, P607, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/btg037; Frith M.C., 2004, NUCL ACIDS RES; Hertz GZ, 1999, BIOINFORMATICS, V15, P563, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/15.7.563; HERTZ GZ, 1990, COMPUT APPL BIOSCI, V6, P81; HORTON P, 2000, P 11 ANN S COMB PATT, P84; HORTON P, 2001, J COMPUT BIOL, V8, P249; Horton P, 1996, Pac Symp Biocomput, P368; JIAN Z, 1999, BIOINFORMATICS, V15, P607; LAWRENCE CE, 1993, SCIENCE, V262, P208, DOI 10.1126/science.8211139; LAWRENCE CE, 1990, PROTEINS, V7, P41, DOI 10.1002/prot.340070105; Ming Li, 2002, Journal of Computer and System Sciences, V65, DOI 10.1006/jcss.2002.1823; MING L, 1999, P 32 ANN ACM S THEOR, P425; Stormo GD, 2000, BIOINFORMATICS, V16, P16, DOI 10.1093/bioinformatics/16.1.16	15	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743	3-540-26201-6	LECT NOTES COMPUT SC			2005	3537						219	228				10	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BCO99	WOS:000230459400019

It is a method for parameter estimation in various problems involving missing data. However, it is a batch learning method and often requires significant computational resources. So we need to develop more elaborate methods to adapt the databases with a large number of records or large dimensionality. In this paper, we present a algorithm which significantly reduces the intensity of computation. The algorithm is based on partial E-steps which has the standard convergence guarantee of EM. It is a version of the incremental EM algorithm which cycles through data cases in blocks.

The idea is to extrapolate the third search point based on the previous two search points found by regular EM. As the convergence rate of regular EM becomes slower, the distance of the triple jump will be longer, and thus provide higher speedup for data sets where EM converges slowly. Experimental results show that the triple jump framework significantly outperforms EM and other acceleration methods of EM for a variety of probabilistic models, especially when the data set is sparse. The results also show that the triple jump framework is particularly effective for Cluster Models.

This paper proposes a Web-based text classification approach to train a text classifier without the pre-request of labeled training data. Under the assumption that each class of concern is associated with several relevant concept classes, the approach first applies a greedy EM algorithm to find a proper number of concept clusters for each class, via clustering the documents retrieved by sending the class name itself to Web search engines. It then retrieves more training data through the keywords generated from the clusters and set the initial parameters of the text classifier. It further refines the initial classifier by an augmented EM algorithm. Experimental results have shown the great potential of the proposed approach in creating text classifiers without the pre-request of labeled training data.

We investigate the performance of the two algorithms for GM's in image retrieval. The asymptotic likelihood approximation is used as a similarity criterion to compare GM's directly. The two algorithms result in very close retrieval performance. We demonstrate that the closeness comes from the close mutual approximation of the GM estimated parameter values and that the two algorithms have similar convergence speed. Our analysis shows that GMVQ has roughly half the computational complexity of EM.

Two important issues associated with an ensemble approach are: how to generate models to construct an ensemble, and how to combine them for classification. In this paper, we focus on the problem of model generation for heterogeneous data classification. If we could partition heterogeneous data into a number of homogeneous partitions, we will likely generate reliable and accurate classification models over the homogeneous partitions. We examine different ways of forming homogeneous subsets and propose a novel method that allows a data point to be assigned multiple times in order to generate homogeneous partitions for ensemble learning. We present the details of the new algorithm and empirical studies over the UCI benchmark datasets and datasets of image classification, and show that the proposed approach is effective for heterogeneous data classification.

Using a Bayesian problem formulation the regularization is applied through a prior distribution of the amplitudes. We investigate both a "super Gaussian" and a Student-t prior distribution. We derive maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators for the amplitudes, based on the "Space-Alternating Generalized Expectation-Maximization" (SAGE) method, that only uses FFT:s in each iteration. The behavior of the algorithms for different choices of regularization parameters are illustrated through simple one dimensional examples. and SAR imaging is illustrated through an example using MSTAR data.

Minimum description length (MDL) criteria for regression have received much attention in statistics and recently "gMDL" was shown to bridge AIC and BIC [Hansen and Yu 2001]. However, traditionally only the code length of the response variable has been considered in the MDL model selection literature. The microarray technology allows for the simultaneous monitoring of thousands of genes for each sample. The emergence of this technology is changing the game of regression modeling because of the existence of thousands of covariates or gene expressions while the sample size is usually less than a hundred. Certain preprocessing or organization of the gene expression vector is necessary and often carried out by clustering analysis. That is, the high-dimensional gene expression data can be used to study similarities of gene expression profiles across different samples to form a gene clustering. The clusters may be indicative of genetic pathways. Parallel to gene clustering is the important application of sample classification based on all or selected gene expressions. The gene clustering and sample classification are often undertaken separately, or in a directional manner (one as an aid for the other). However, such separation of these two tasks may occlude informative structure in the data. In this chapter, we review an algorithm developed by Jornsten and Yu [2003] for the simultaneous clustering of genes and subset selection of gene clusters for sample classification. The clustering and selection criterion is based on the MDL principle and developed first for linear regression models, and then applied to classification problems through optimal scoring. For the first time, an MDL code length is given for both explanatory variables (genes) and response variables (sample class labels). The final output of the algorithm is a sparse and interpretable classification rule based on cluster centroids or the closest genes to the centroids. One gene expression data set and two simulation studies are used to show the effectiveness of this algorithm. Gene expression data have recently received attention in the MDL literature. Tabus, Rissanen, and Astola [2003] focus on the classification problem, comparing different subsets of genes based on their ability to predict the class labels. Here, the full matrix of gene expression data is assumed known by both encoder and decoder, bypassing the need to model the structure of the explanatory variables. Discrete regression models are built from subsets of coarsely quantized expression values and evaluated using the normalized maximum likelihood (NML) code length. The quantization step simplifies the NML computation, a reduction that is similar in spirit to the exact (permutation) tests for logistic regression that appeared in the late 1980s [Hirji, Mehta, and Patel 1987]. Li and Zha [2002] also form predictive models of class labels, but begin by clustering the expression data. Their approach builds on the discriminant vector quantization (DVQ) encoding method and is loosely inspired by the MDL framework. Unlike Tabus et al. [2003], DVQ operates on both the space of explanatory variables and the class labels simultaneously. Coding is based on a normal mixture model, and a variant of the classical expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed for training (an algorithm that is similar to the so-called 'classification' EM). Beginning with Jornsten [2001], we have argued that simultaneous clustering and classification offers better insights into the nature of gene expression data. The DVQ method of Li and Zha [2002] is one embodiment of this idea. In this chapter, we illustrate our approach to the problem.

To do this, the activity images are first reconstructed from PET sinogram frames at each measurement time, and then the kinetic parameters are estimated by fitting a model to the reconstructed time-activity response of each voxel. However, this indirect approach to kinetic parameter estimation tends to reduce signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) because of the requirement that the sinogram data be divided into individual time frames. In 1985, Carson and Lange proposed,(1) but did not implement, a method based on the EM algorithm for direct parametric reconstruction. More recently, researchers have developed semi-direct methods which use spline-based reconstruction, or direct methods for estimation of kinetic parameters from image regions. However, direct voxel-wise parametric reconstruction has remained a challenge due to the unsolved complexities of inversion and required spatial regularization. In this work, we demonstrate an efficient method for direct voxel-wise reconstruction of kinetic parameters (as a parametric image) from all frames of the PET data. The direct parametric image reconstruction is formulated in a Bayesian framework, and uses the parametric iterative coordinate descent (PICD) algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem.(2) This PICD algorithm is computationally efficient and allows the physiologically important kinetic parameters to be spatially regularized. Our experimental simulations demonstrate that direct parametric reconstruction can substantially reduce estimation error of kinetic parameters as compared to indirect methods.

We also outline a post processing method, which can iteratively reduce the size of the model obtained by the single-pass algorithm, This will result in a model with fewer components, but with approximately the same representation accuracy than the result of the original model from the single-pass algorithm.

The receiver employs the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm so as to improve the performance of the approximated MAP detection, and applies adaptive algorithms such as the recursive least squares (RLS) and least mean square (LMS) algorithms to the channel estimation used in the EM algorithm in order to track a fast fading channel. For exploiting the space, time and frequency diversity, the low-density parity-check code (LDPC) is used as a channel coding with a built-in interleaver. Computer simulations under fast fading conditions show that the proposed receiver using the LMS algorithm can achieve better performance than the conventional minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) channel estimation with much less computational complexity, and that the receiver using the RLS algorithm outperforms the ones with either the MMSE or the LMS algorithm.

The theory recommends to estimate the parameters of model by the maximum likelihood method and to use "plug-in" approach for data clustering. Unfortunately, the calculation problem of the maximum likelihood estimate is not completely solved in multivariate case. This work proposes a new constructive a few stage procedure to solve this task. This procedure includes statistical distribution analysis of a large number of the univariate projections of observations, geometric clustering of a multivariate sample and application of EM algorithm. The results of the accuracy analysis of the proposed methods is made by means of Monte-Carlo simulation.

The sensors are capable of indicating only that the concentration has exceeded a randomly selected threshold and providing this information to a central hub. We consider the case when the dispersion occurs in a general wind velocity field. In this case, the dispersion is modelled by a PDE which in general does not have a closed form solution. We find the maximum likelihood estimate of the concentration as well as the time and location of the pollutant source. Frechet derivatives are used to optimize the cost function. The wind velocity field is estimated as a nuisance parameter.

For the model selection, it employs a novel agglomerative step together with MDL criterion. And, we present the result of comparative experiments between AIC, MDL and minimum message length (MML) used to determine a criterion for our algorithm. The robustness of using emerging patterns based on mixture models, as well as using the Gaussian mixture model for subspace clustering, was demonstrated on both synthetic and real data sets. In experiments, it also certified that a new agglomerative method that merges mostly correlated components with MDL consistently worked better than the one that removes weak weight components.

We consider asynchronous single-rate DS/CDMA over flat Rayleigh fading channels. The resulting receiver structure comprises partial Successive Interference-Cancellation (SIC), channel estimation, and soft-input/hard-output Maximum Likelihood Sequence Decoding (MLSD) for each user. Additionally, one obtains a set of noise-weighting coefficients that can be freely chosen within weak constraints. These coefficients determine the amount of feedback from the decoder output to the decoder input in the subsequent iteration, and thus, "how extrinsic" the decoder output values are. The noise-weighting coefficients strongly influence the system performance. Their optimization within the SAGE framework leads to extrinsic output values in most of the cases. The proposed receiver is evaluated by Monte-Carlo simulations, and it shows two major advantages: high load is supported and convergence is guaranteed.

The experimentally obtained detector response to point sources across FOV was fitted to a two-dimensional Gaussian function with its width (FWHM) varying linearly with the source-to-detector distance and with very weak sensitivity dependence on the emission angle. We obtained CBC SPECT scans of a physical point-source phantom, a Defrise phantom, and a female patient, and we investigated performance of our algorithm. To correctly simulate DDB and sensitivity, a blurring kernel with a radius of up to 10 elements had to be used for a 128 x 128 acquisition matrix, and volumetric ray tracing rather than line-element-based ray tracing has to be implemented. In the point-source phantom reconstruction we evaluated the uniformity of FWHM for the radial, tangential and longitudinal directions, and sensitivity vs. distance. An isotropic and stationary resolution was obtained at any location by OSEM with DDB and sensitivity modeling, only when volumetric ray tracing was used. We analyzed axial and transaxial profiles obtained for the Defrise phantom and evaluated the reconstructed breast SPECT patient images. The proposed fully-3D OSEM reconstruction algorithm with DBB and sensitivity modeling, and attenuation compensation with volumetric rays tracing is efficient and effective with significant resolution and sensitivity recovery.

The representation combines Isomap, a non-linear manifold learning algorithm, with Expectation Maximization, a statistical learning scheme. The representation is computed offline and results in a non-linear, non-Gaussian likelihood model relating visual observations such as color and texture to the underlying visual states. The likelihood model can be used online to instantiate likelihoods corresponding to observed visual features in real-time. The likelihoods are expressed as a Gaussian Mixture Model so as to permit convenient integration within existing nonlinear filtering algorithms. The resulting compactness of the representation is especially suitable to decentralized sensor networks.

The representation combines Isomap, a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm, with Expectation Maximization, a statistical learning scheme. The joint probability distribution of this representation is computed offline based on existing training data. The training phase of the algorithm results in a nonlinear and non-Gaussian likelihood model of natural features conditioned on the underlying visual states. This generative model can be used online to instantiate likelihoods corresponding to observed visual features in real-time. The instantiated likelihoods are expressed as a Gaussian Mixture Model and are conveniently integrated within existing non-linear filtering algorithms. Example applications based on real visual data from heterogenous, unstructured environments demonstrate the versatility of the generative models.

It is directly derived from observations on real data, and can be used in a fully unsupervised manner, with the EM algorithm. In this paper, the 2-mixture model is used in an "Unsupervised Spectral Subtraction" scheme that can be applied as a pre-processing step for any acoustic feature extraction scheme, such as MFCCs or PLP. The goal is to improve noise-robustness of the acoustic features. Experimental results on both OGI Numbers 95 and Aurora 2 tasks yielded a major improvement on all noise conditions, while retaining a similar performance on clean conditions.

In the proposed algorithm, the expectation Step intends to remove the inter-carrier interferences (ICI) due to RFO in the received signals. Then, the maximization step is utilized to estimate the required parameters (i.e. RFO, data symbols and channel state information) using the ICI canceled signals. Simulation results present that the proposed algorithm shows almost ideal performance as long as the normalized RFO value is within value is within 0.2.

No knowledge of such a priori information is needed to find an appropriate number of clusters. This paper introduces an elliptical clustering algorithm with incremental growth of clusters, which is derived from the batch EM algorithm with a decay factor and a novelty criterion. The proposed algorithm can start with no or a small number of clusters. Whenever unusual data is presented, the algorithm adds a new cluster and finally the number of clusters in the data is obtained after clustering. The usefulness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated for texture image segmentation and skin image segmentation.

Our approach is to treat those unobserved pixels as missing data and adopt the self-consistency principle to define a "best" wavelet estimate for the true image. We propose fast and effective algorithms for computing such self-consistent wavelet estimate. The practical performance of our proposal is evaluated via a simulation study. A possible application of this work is image inpainting.

Correspondingly, the abilities and skills are obtained by two types of learning via evidences or data from the world. Due to noises in observation and a finite size of samples, learning is statistical in nature, which faces two key challenges. One is finding appropriate mathematical representations to suit various dependence structures underlying world. The other is getting a good theory to guide learning such that dependence structures are not only learned into mathematical representations but also with an appropriate complexity that matches the size of samples (i.e., learning reliable structures of underlying world). This paper consists of part parts. The first two parts summarize typical dependence structures for tackling the challenge one and typical learning theories for tackling for tackling the challenge two. The third part introduces Bayesian Ying Yang (BYY) system as a general framework that unifies typical dependence structures and BYY harmony learning for the challenge two, with several favorable features. To illustrate this BYY learning, in the fourth part we further introduce fundamentals of independence subspaces and advances obtained from BYY harmony learning on typical independence subspaces, including PCA, MCA, DCA, ICA, FA, TFA, NFA, BFA, LMSER, as well as their temporal extensions. Finally, a concluding remark is made and new results of BYY learning in other learning areas are also briefly listed.

Most motif-discovering algorithms/software require the length of the motif as input. Motivated by the fact that the motif's length is usually unknown in practice, Styczynski et al. introduced the Extended (1,d)-Motif Problem (EMP), where the motifs length is not an input parameter. Unfortunately, the algorithm given by Styczynski et al. to solve EMP can take an unacceptably long time to run, e.g. over 3 months to discover a length-14 motif. This paper makes two main contributions. First, we eliminate another input parameter from EMP: the minimum number of binding sites in the DNA sequences. Fewer input parameters not only reduces the burden of the user, but also may give more realistic/robust results since restrictions on length or on the number of binding sites make little sense when the best motif may not be the longest nor have the largest number of binding sites. Second, we develop an efficient algorithm to solve our redefined problem. The algorithm is also a fast solution for EMP (without any sacrifice to accuracy) making EMP practical.

Early diagnosis and treatment is important because failure to diagnose and improper treatment can result in significant morbidity. In this paper, we designed and implemented a computer aided system for the diagnosis and treatment planning of this disease. With the design, the patient received CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan first. A mixture-based PV partial-volume algorithm was applied to perform bone segmentation on CT image, followed by three-dimensional (313) reconstruction and display of the segmented image, demonstrating the special relationship between the acetabulum and femurs for visual judgment. Several standard procedures, such as Salter procedure, Pemberton procedure and Femoral Shortening osteotomy, were simulated on the screen to rehearse a virtual treatment plan. Quantitative measurement of Acetabular Index (AI) and Femoral Neck Anteversion (FNA) were performed on the 3D image for evaluation of DDH and treatment plans. PC graphics-card GPU architecture was exploited to accelerate the 3D rendering and geometric manipulation. The prototype system was implemented on PC/Windows environment and is currently under clinical trial on patient datasets.

The algorithm provides a joint distortion-robustness design of the LUT based watermark. There are two key features in the algorithm: (1) a near minimum-distortion LUT with the maximum run of 2 is designed based on the statistical properties of the wavelet coefficients; (2) an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm based method is employed to model the statistical distribution of wavelet coefficients and select significant coefficients (coefficients with large magnitude) for watermark embedding. The experimental results show that images watermarked by the proposed algorithm have about 1.5-2.5dB peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) gain over the conventional odd-even embedding method, while the system presents great robustness. In the case of 0.2bpp (1/40) JPEG2000 compression, the proposed scheme can ensure a reasonably low bit error rate (BER).

In this paper new recursive forms of the accumulated second-order state moments which constitute the core of the joint state and parameter estimator are derived. The new recursions are in vector form and follow directly from the state smoothing formula as well as the properties of the Kronecker product. By loosening the optimal constraints, the new recursion forms lead to efficient suboptimal algorithms that are time-recursive. Convergence control of these recursive algorithms by exponential weighting is also considered.

The EM-IR algorithm can also be used when the data is incomplete. The major disadvantage of the EM-IR is its high demand on computation and slow reconstruction. To improve the performance, we developed a parallel EM on a Linux cluster composed of legacy (recycled) and heterogeneous PCs. The system, speed-up and efficiency from our parallel computations are presented. The study provides basic insight into how to conduct medical image reconstruction using junk PCs to simulate a heterogeneous parallel system.

In speaker recognition, the major problem is how to generate a set of the GMM for identification purposes based upon the training dada. Due to the hill-climbing characteristic of the expectation maximization (EM) method, it is sensitive to the initial model parameters and easy to lead to a sub-optimal model in practice. To resolve this problem, this paper proposes a new hybrid training method based on the global searching capability of genetic algorithms (GA) and the effectiveness of fuzzy approach to obtain GMMs with optimized model parameters. Experimental results based on PKU-SRSC database showed that this method could obtain more optimized GMMs and better results than the hybrid GA based on the EM re-estimation and the traditional EM method.

The tradition method of Hidden Markov Model applied to classification of brain MRI is slow to gain the optimal class and eigenvalue by iterating of EM algorithm times without number What is more, it is inevitable that there is noise in the MR image, which results the error of the classification. This paper produces approximative class and the eigenvalue of each class in wavelet space by properly wavelet decomposition, and selects parameter by iterated optimal algorithm, so that the algorithm this paper proposed not only enhance the veracity but reduce the complexity of the algorithm. These demonstrate that the classification method based on Wavelet-Domain Hidden Markov Mode is fast, accurate for volume rendering and results in more informative 3D rendering with more details.

Firstly, to investigate the merit of estimating probability density functions rather than level or classification estimations on a one-day-ahead forecasting the task of the silver time series. This is done by benchmarking the Gaussian mixture neural network model (as a probability distribution predictor) against two other neural network designs representing a level estimator (the Mulit-layer perceptron network [MLP]) and a classification model (Softmax cross entropy network model [SCE]). In addition, we also benchmark the results against standard forecasting models, namely a naive model, an autoregressive moving average model (ARMA) and a logistic regression model (LOGIT). The second purpose of this paper is to examine the possibilities of improving the trading performance of those models by applying confirmation filters and leverage. As it turns out, the three neural network models perform equally well generating a recognisable gain while ARMA benchmark model, on the other hand, seems to have picked up the right rhythm of mean reversion in the silver time series, leading to very good results. Only when using more sophisticated trading strategies and leverage, the neural network models show an ability to identify successfully trades with a high Sharpe ratio and outperform the ARMA model.

The 3D NCAT phantom with realistic In-111 ProstaScint (R) activity distribution was used in the study. Noise-free and noisy projections of the phantom obtained using a medium-energy general-purpose (MEGP) collimator were generated using Monte Carlo simulation methods. For each algorithm, the projection data were reconstructed with the compensations for attenuation, coillimator-detector response and scatter. Image quality was evaluated in terms of FWHM of a profile through a small blood vessel, normalized mean square error (NMSE), ensemble normalized standard deviation (NSDE) of a uniform region of interest (ROI) in the reconstructed image measured from 30 noise realizations, and regional NSD (NSDR) Of an ROI measure from 1 noise realization. The results indicated that, RBI-EM has superior performance than that of OS-EM when less than 4, views per subset were used and similar performance when 4 or more views per subset were used. Modified RAMLA provides similar image quality with a slower convergence rate than that of OS-EM. Using well-chosen parameters, RBI-MAP-EM provides increased noise smoothing with less loss. in resolution and error. We conclude that when compared with OS-EM, the RBI-EM and modified RAMLA have the same performance at a slower convergence rate, while the RBI-MAP-EM has superior performance and can potentially improve image quality.

Some other algorithms, however, do take into account the relationship between data objects, but they either integrate content and link features into a unified feature space or apply a hard clustering algorithm, making it difficult to fully utilize the correlated information over the heterogeneous Web objects. In this paper, we propose a novel unified probabilistic framework for iteratively clustering correlated heterogeneous data objects until it converges. Our approach introduces two latent clustering layers, which serve as two mixture probabilistic models of the features. In each clustering iteration we use EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm to estimate the parameters of the mixture model in one latent layer and propagate them to the other one. The experimental results show that our approach effectively combines the content and link features and improves the performance of the clustering.

Two new features are proposed to capture model surface orientation information. In the method, each model class is represented by four HMMs corresponding to four type features. During the training process, for each type of feature, the feature statistics of each model class and the spatial dynamics are learned by an HMM. During the classification process, characteristics of the test model are analyzed by the HMMs corresponding to each model class. The likelihood scores provided by the HMMs are calculated, and the highest weighted sum score provides the class identification of the test model. Furthermore, with unsupervised learning, each HMM and type weight are adapted with test models, which results in better modeling over time. Based on experiments, the proposed algorithm achieves much better performance than a baseline method and better performance than HMMs using only two features with fixed weights method.

Second connected component analysis is employed to construct text candidate region and classify part non-text regions. Third each text candidate region is verified with texture features derived from wavelet domain. Finally, the Expectation maximization algorithm is introduced to binarize text regions to prepare data for recognition. In contrast to previous approach, our algorithm combines both the efficiency of connected component based method and robustness of texture based analysis. Experimental results show that our algorithm is robust in text detection with respect to different character size, orientation, color and language and can provide reliable text binarization result.

Thus, to understand the essence of OD flow is essential to traffic engineering. Recently studies have show that the OD flows measured on the IP networks have small intrinsic dimension and OD flow timeseries can be decomposed to exhibit clear structures. Generally, however, OD flows are prohibitively expensive to be obtained by direct measurements so that researchers try to estimate them using statistical methods. From the link traffic data collected from a large scale IP backbone in China, we estimate the OD flows via traffic matrix estimation techniques. Using principal component analysis (PCA) on the estimated OD flows, we find that the estimates still possess the characteristics that have been found in directly measured OD flows. Also we compare the statistics obtained from our dataset to those obtained from US and Europe networks. And the discrepancies reveal the different complexities in the networks.

Preliminary experiments with random-generated graphs have suggested that weighting the quadratic cost function of Softassign with information coming from the computation of diffusion kernels on graphs attenuate the performance decay with increasing noise levels. Our experimental results show that this approach yields a useful similarity measure to cluster proteins with similar structure, to automatically find prototypical graphs representing families of proteins and also to classify proteins in terms of their distance to these prototypes. We also show that the role of kernel-based information is to smooth the obtained matching fields, which in turn results in noise-free prototype estimation.			malozano@dccia.ua.es; sco@dccia.ua.es					Berman HM, 2000, NUCLEIC ACIDS RES, V28, P235, DOI 10.1093/nar/28.1.235; Chung F.R.K., 1997, C BOARD MATH SCI, V92; CONNOLLY ML, 1983, J APPL CRYSTALLOGR, V16, P548, DOI 10.1107/S0021889883010985; Finch AM, 1998, NEURAL COMPUT, V10, P1873, DOI 10.1162/089976698300017188; Gardiner EJ, 2000, J CHEM INF COMP SCI, V40, P273, DOI 10.1021/ci990262o; Gold S, 1996, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V18, P377, DOI 10.1109/34.491619; Halperin I, 2002, PROTEINS, V47, P409, DOI 10.1002/prot.10115; HOLM L, 1993, J MOL BIOL, V233, P123, DOI 10.1006/jmbi.1993.1489; Kondor R.

Such approach consists of exploiting the information coming from diffusion kernels to embed the subgraph induced by the neighborhood of each vertex in an Euclidean manifold and then use entropic graphs for measuring the a-entropy of the resulting distribution. Our experiments with random-generated graphs with 50 nodes show that at low edge densities, where the effect of structural noise is higher, this approach outperforms the description of the subgraph only in terms of diffusion kernels. Furthermore, our structural recognition experiments show that the approach has a practical application. All experiments were performed by weighting the well-known quadratic cost function used in the Softassign algorithm.			malozano@dccia.ua.es; sco@dccia.ua.es					Bai X, 2004, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V3138, P198; Beardwood J., 1959, P CAMBRIDGE PHILOS S, V55, P299; Belkin M., 2002, NEURAL INFORMATION P, V14, P634; Bunke H, 2000, P INT C PATT REC ICP, V2, P2117; Bunke H, 1999, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V21, P917, DOI 10.1109/34.790431; Chung F.R.K., 1997, C BOARD MATH SCI, V92; Costa JA, 2004, IEEE T SIGNAL PROCES, V52, P2210, DOI 10.1109/TSP.2004.831130; Finch AM, 1998, NEURAL COMPUT, V10, P1873, DOI 10.1162/089976698300017188; Gold S, 1996, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V18, P377, DOI 10.1109/34.491619; Hero AO, 2002, IEEE SIGNAL PROC MAG, V19, P85, DOI 10.1109/MSP.2002.1028355; Jiang XY, 2001, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V23, P1144; Kondor R.I., 2002, ICML, P315; LAFFERTY J, 2004, CMU04101; Lozano MA, 2004, LECT NOTES ARTIF INT, V3315, P626; Lozano MA, 2004, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V3138, P76; Lozano MA, 2003, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V2683, P52; LOZANO MA, 2004, LNCS, V3287, P321; Luo B, 2001, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V23, P1120; Luo B, 2003, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V2626, P407; Pelillo M, 1999, NEURAL COMPUT, V11, P1933, DOI 10.1162/089976699300016034; Renyi A., 1961, P 4 BERK S MATH STAT, P547; Robles-Kelly A, 2003, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V2683, P517; SANFELIU A, 1983, IEEE T SYST MAN CYB, V13, P353; SERRATOSA F, 2003, PATTERN RECOGN, V23, P781; Smola AJ, 2003, LECT NOTES ARTIF INT, V2777, P144, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-45167-9_12; WILSON RC, 1997, IEEE T PATTERN ANAL, V19, P534	26	0	0	SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN	BERLIN	HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY	0302-9743	3-540-25270-3	LECT NOTES COMPUT SC			2005	3434						342	351				10	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods	Computer Science	BCF73	WOS:000229092500033

It works by first fitting a set with a Gaussian mixture, then evaluate an efficient kernel on the two fitted Gaussian mixtures. Furthermore, we show that this kernel can be extended to sets embedded in a feature space implicitly defined by another kernel, where Gaussian mixtures are fitted with the kernelized EM algorithm [6], and the kernel for Gaussian mixtures are modified to use the outputs from the kernelized EM. All computation depends on data only through their inner products as evaluations of the base kernel. The kernel is computable in closed form, and being able to work in a feature space improves its flexibility and applicability. Its performance is evaluated in experiments on both synthesized and real data.

But considerable patient discomfort can lead to patient motion, which will introduce the image artifacts and degrade resolution. If the patient motion can be detected, it is possible to compensate for the motion to reduce or eliminate the artifacts. In this paper a method based on visual-tracking-system (VTS) is presented to compensate for the patient motion during data acquisition. VTS will get the exact position and orientation that are independent of the SPECT system. During data acquisition each detected photon produces an event that is written to a file. Each event includes the photon location, energy and time. The list of events is adjusted by compensation algorithm to produce a corrected set of motion-free observations. In the compensation process, the projections can be repositioned and reconstructed with ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm. By comparing the corrected result and uncorrected result our compensation method can be assessed.

Two approaches were employed to improve the efficiency: (1) the communication cost was minimized via overlapping communication with computation and (2) the idle time of processes was reduced by auto load balancing.

While the technique can use labels from reliable cameras systems, the algorithm is powerful enough to function using ambiguous tracking data. The method requires no prior knowledge of the relative locations of the cameras and operates under very weak environmental assumptions. Our approach stochastically samples plausible agent trajectories based on a delay model that allows for transitions to and from sources and sinks in the environment. The technique demonstrates considerable robustness both to sensor error and non-trivial patterns of agent motion. The output of the method is a Markov model describing the behavior of agents in the system and the underlying traffic patterns. The concept is demonstrated with simulation data and verified with experiments conducted on a six camera sensor network.

Approaches merging partial 3D models in a hierarchical manner have proven the most effective to deal with large image sequences. One of the key building blocks of these hierarchical approaches is the alignment of two partial 3D models, which requires to express them in the same 3D coordinate frame by computing a 3D transformation. This problem has been well-studied for the cases of 3D models obtained with calibrated or uncalibrated pinhole cameras. We tackle the problem of aligning 3D models - sets of 3D points obtained using uncalibrated affine cameras. This requires to estimate 3D affine transformations between the models. We propose a factorization-based algorithm estimating simultaneously the aligning transformations and corrected points, exactly matching the estimated transformations, such that the reprojection error over all cameras is minimized. In the case of incomplete image data our algorithm uses an Expectation Maximization (EM) based scheme that alternates prediction of the missing data and estimation of the affine transformation. We experimentally compare our algorithm to other methods using simulated and real data.

Given a cloud-contaminated image of the sequence, each area of missina measurements is reconstructed by means of an ensemble of contextual linear predictors that reproduce the local spectro-temporal relationships between the considered image and an opportunely selected subset of the remaining temporal images. Each predictor of the ensemble is trained in an unsupervised way, over a local multitemporal region that is spectrally homogeneous in each temporal image of the selected partial sequence. In order to obtain such regions, each temporal image is locally classified by, means of an unsupervised classifier based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. To illustrate the performance of the proposed method, an experimental analysis on a sequence of three temporal images acquired by the Landsat-7 ETM+ sensor is reported.

This paper presents an automatic method for selecting the parameters of the Gaussian Redial Basis Function (GRBF) kernel which is one of the commonly used forms in SVM regression algorithms. The proposed method uses the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for the automatic selection. The SVM regression algorithm is used to solve two major problems in remote sensing image segmentation: the density estimation problem and the Markov Random Field modeling problem. The density estimation lis used for class conditional probabilities in Bayesian setups. The MRF is used for region modeling in boosting the Bayesian image segmentation. The proposed algorithms are integrated in a framework for remote sensing image segmentation. Experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithms using synthetic data set and hyperspectral data set illustrates the outstanding performance of the proposed algorithms.

Moreover, the soft outputs of the turbo decoders are used iteratively to improve the channel parameter estimation during the updating step, which is formally equivalent to one step of the expectation-maximisation algorithm. By means of computer simulations, we will show that the proposed receiver achieves performance comparable with the one obtained by systems, which suppose perfect knowledge of the channel parameters for medium to high system loads, in AWGN channel. Finally, the proposed receiver is also applied in HAPS (high altitude platform station) and satellite channel, for different values of the elevation angle, affording remarkable performance.

Using an initial estimate of the noise distribution. the algorithm updates the noise model on a frame synchronous basis. Using Polyak averaging we obtain a sequence of robust, frame-synchronous noise model estimates, and a minimum mean square error (MMSE) filter is used to denoise the cepstral coefficients. The algorithm is compared to a batch version which uses several iterations of the EM-algorithm over the complete utterance to estimate the noise model, and it is shown that the performance obtained using the averaging of the noise model is comparable to the batch performance.

A Gaussian mixture model is used to represent color distributions. Variational expectation-maximization (VEM) algorithm takes into account the uncertainty in the parameter estimation ensuring a lower bound on the approximation error. In the variational Bayesian approach we integrate over distributions of parameters. The processing task in this case consists of estimating the hyperparameters of these distributions. We propose a maximum log-likelihood initialization approach for the Variational Expectation-Maximization (VEM) algorithm. The proposed algorithm is applied to image segmentation using color clustering when representing the images in the L*u*v color coordinate system.

In the present article we give new results on the convergence of RAMLA (Row Action Maximum Likelihood Algorithm) [2], filling some important theoretical gaps. Furthermore, because RAMLA and OS-EM (Ordered Subsets - Expectation Maximization) [4] are the algorithms for statistical reconstruction currently being used in commercial emission tomography scanners, we present a comparison between them from the viewpoint of a specific imaging task. Our experiments show the importance of relaxation to improve image quality.

Beginning with the wide-area monitoring on the basis of medium-resolution satellite data for the pre-scanning of significant changes within the nuclear-related locations, the areas of interest could then be explicitly analyzed by change detection and analysis methods using high-resolution satellite data. The change pixels were detected by using the multivariate alteration detection (MAD) transformation, producing a set of mutually orthogonal difference images (the so-called MAD variates). The decision thresholds for the change pixels were set by applying a probability mixture model to the MAD variates based on an EM algorithm. By means of eCognition a second, object-oriented procedure was implemented in order to create an automated workflow for the multiscale extraction of the (change) objects and (change) features for the subsequent post-classification of the areas of interest. Regarding the necessity of automation for extensive monitoring tasks the processing aspects of standardization and transferability took the centre stage of the investigations.

Our goal is to understand how the restoration of edges at the (local) minimizers of the cost function is determined by the shape of the regularization term. This question is of paramount importance for a relevant choice of regularization term. We show that the differences between neighboring pixels in homogeneous regions are smaller than a small threshold while they are larger than a large threshold at edges: we can say that the former are shrunk while the latter are enhanced. This entails a natural classification of differences as smooth or edges. Furthermore, if the original signal or image is a scaled characteristic function of a subset, we show that the global minimizer is smooth everywhere if the contrast is low, whereas edges are correctly recovered at higher (finite) contrast. Explicit expressions are derived for the truncated quadratic and the "0-1" regularization function. It is seen that restoration using non-convex regularization is fundamentally different from edge-preserving convex regularization. Our theoretical results are illustrated using a numerical experiment.

In this paper we consider modeling IP traffic using a BMAP with a characteristic of short-term and long-term dynamics. Our BMAP is composed of the packet length and the arrival rate during a time interval. The rate matrices of a BMAP are estimated by the EM algorithm and the probability function of a BMAP/D/1 queue is analytically calculated by the spectral method. As criteria of fitness, we use the total bytes per time unit and the probability function of the queue length at departures for the single server with the constant service time. Comparing simurated and analytical results, we conclude that our model captures the property of IP traffic.

In contrast to standard pilot aided interpolation methods, the estimation of the channel in a given frequency bin without pilot symbols is posed as a Maximum Likelihood (NIL) with missing observations and is solved by the iterative EM algorithm. As a semi-blind estimation method, EM is insensitive to permutation and scaling of transmitted signals. To avoid this uncertainty, the initialization of the iterative optimization for each frequency bin is achieved using the model of the neighboring bin, provided that these bins satisfy thus introduced similarity condition. Hence, channel estimation is performed sequentially over all bins starting from the bin for which its model is estimated with a pilot sequence. The proposed method is tested successfully on MIMO-OFDM systems in realistic channel conditions.

Our motivating example is the honeybee dance: bees communicate the orientation and distance to food sources through the dance angles and waggle lengths of their stylized dances. Switching linear dynamic systems (SLDS) are a compelling way to model such complex motions. However SLDS does not provide a means to quantify, systematic variations in the motion. Previously, Wilson & Bobick presented parametric HMMs [2 1], an extension to HMMs with which they successfully interpreted human gestures. Inspired by their work, we similarly extend the standard SLDS model to obtain parametric SLDS. We introduce additional global parameters that represent systematic variations in the motion, and present general expectation-maximization (EM) methods for learning and inference. In the learning phase, P-SLDS learns canonical SLDS model from data. In the inference phase, P-SLDS simultaneously quantifies the global parameters and labels the data. We apply these methods to the automatic interpretation of honey-bee dances, and present both qualitative and quantitative experimental results on actual bee-tracks collected from noisy video data.

Expectation-maximization algorithms have had dramatic impacts on problems in estimation and detection theory, but their computational efficiency often limits their applicability. Given a bipartite graphical model for the data, if a set of hidden independent random variables can be associated with the edges, then a resulting expectation-maximization algorithm is message passing on this graph. The algorithms are computationally efficient in the same sense as other message passing algorithms. One example of such algorithms is the standard expectation-maximization algorithm for emission tomography. Another example for a signal in Gaussian noise yields a statistical interpretation to efficient algorithms for sparse linear inverse problems.

S	Page, DA; Himed, B; Davis, ME			IEEE	Page, DA; Himed, B; Davis, ME			Improving STAP performance in bistatic space-based radar systems using an efficient expectation-maximization technique	2005 IEEE International Radar, Conference Record	Radar Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	2005 IEEE Radar Conference	MAY 09-12, 2005	Arlington, VA	Natl Capital Area Council, IEEE Aerosp & Elect Syst Soc, RADAR Syst Panel, IEE		space-based radar; bistatic radar; STAP; expectation-maximization; knowledge-aided STAP		In this paper, we describe a space-time adaptive processing (STAP) approach for bistatic space-based radar (SBR) systems. A candidate SBR system employing a transmitter at medium earth orbit (MEO) and an airborne receiver is defined. A STAP configuration for performing wide area ground moving target indication (GMTI) is also specified. STAP performance is analyzed using simulated data in two different bistatic SBR geometries. Standard STAP performance degradation is shown to be a function of the relative severity of clutter non-stationarity in the two scenarios. To provide enhanced estimation of the clutter statistics, we apply an approach based on an efficient form of an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating covariance matrices in non-stationary interference. The STAP performance of the EM technique is compared to that of standard STAP processing and higher order Doppler warping. The EM approach is seen to produce a usable Doppler space fraction (USDF) that is significantly improved over the other techniques. It has several powerful features, including the ability to align non-linear angle-Doppler contours, adaptivity to interference without applying a fixed range-dependent transformation, and the ability to simultaneously compensate for different range dependencies in higher range and Doppler ambiguities. The EM STAP approach also naturally accommodates knowledge-aided STAP techniques that improve understanding of clutter reflectivity variations.

Linear and iterative reconstruction algorithms for a novel PET insert scanner	2005 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record, Vols 1-5	IEEE NUCLEAR SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM - CONFERENCE RECORD		English	Proceedings Paper	Nuclear Science Symposium/Medical Imaging Conference	OCT 23-29, 2005	Fajardo, PR	IEEE Nucl & Plasma Sci Soc, Brookhaven Natl Lab, CEA Saclay, DOE, CERN, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Lawrence Livermore Natl Lab, Stanford Linear Accelerator Ctr, Univ Calif Davis, Univ Washington			TOMOGRAPHY; EMISSION	Tai, et al. are developing insert devices for existing clinical PET scanners to improve the image resolution. Adding the insert inside the scanner leads to three types of coincidences: insert-insert, insert-scanner and scanner-scanner. The challenges in image reconstruction include development of a linear reconstruction algorithm for the insert-scanner coincidences, development of a linear reconstruction algorithm that incorporates all measurements, and development of an iterative (expectation-maximization) algorithm to form a maximum likelihood estimate of the image given all of the data. The data from the set of insert-insert coincidences and from the set of scanner-scanner coincidences each can be used in conventional linear reconstruction algorithms based on data from a ring of detectors. However, the geometry of an insert ring and a scanner ring together is analogous to the fan-beam geometry of fourth generation transmission tomography systems; this analogy leads to a new linear reconstruction algorithm for these data. The resulting algorithm was implemented on both simulated and experimental data, yielding promising results with few artifacts. Our development of an iterative algorithm is based on the standard expectation-maximization algorithm. The novelty of the iterative algorithm is in the incorporation of the details of the geometry, which is based in part on our characterization of the insert-scanner geometry.

Comparing to our standard 3D reconstruction algorithm with simple line integral model, this method resulted in improved resolution and noise behavior of phantom images. Reconstruction of clinical data is usually performed from rebinned projection data, resulting in downsampled patient image. Efficient algorithm implementation allows reconstruction of patient data from rebinned data in time close to clinically acceptable. Then numerical observer study to evaluate algorithms performance is feasible. We use channelized Hotelling observer to establish hot spot delectability in noisy images for each method. Patient-derived phantom was used in computer simulations when a few known location tumors of various size and contrasts were added to patient image. Number of iterations and postsmoothing amount, optimal for hot spot detectability, were also investigated.

Most, if not all, systems deployed assume the availability of complete and clean data for the purpose of intrusion detection. We contend that this assumption is not valid. Factors like noise in the audit data, mobility of the nodes and the large amount of network data generated by the network make it difficult to build a normal traffic profile of the network for the purpose of anomaly detection. From this perspective, we present an anomaly detection scheme, called SCAN (Stochastic Clustering Algorithm for Network anomaly detection), that has the capability to detect intrusions with high accuracy even when audit data is not complete. We use the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to cluster the incoming audit data and compute the missing values in the audit data. We improve the speed of convergence of the clustering process by using Bloom filters and data summaries. We evaluate SCAN using the 1999 DARPA/Lincoln Laboratory intrusion detection evaluation dataset.

The segmentation problem was formulated using maximum a posterior probability and Markov random riled (MAP-MRF) framework. A novel spatial Gaussian mixture model (SGMM) is used to represent the intensity probability distribution of each of the three brain tissues (WM, GM and CSF), and MRF is used to compute the prior probability. This method consists of a learning process based on expectation maximization algorithm (EM) to estimate the parameters of SGMM, and a classification algorithm based on iterated conditional modes (ICM) to perform the segmentation of the sequential brain images using the parameters obtained from the learning process. The results on the simulated and twenty in vivo MR brain volumes demonstrate the efficiency of this method. We also present the comparison results with other published methods.

This algorithm is capable of selecting the number of components of the model using the minimum description length (MDL) criterion. We combine EM and GA into a single procedure. The population-based stochastic search of the GA explores the search space more thoroughly than the EM method. Therefore, our algorithm enables to escape from local optimal solutions since the algorithm becomes less sensitive to its initialization. The GA-EM algorithm is elitist which maintains the monotonic convergence property of the EM algorithm. The experiments show that the GA-EM outperforms the EM method since: (i) We have obtained a better MDL score while using exactly the same initialization and termination condition for both algorithms. (ii) Our approach identifies the number of components which were used to generate the underlying data more often as the EM algorithm.

Although many motif detection programs have been developed so far, they still seem to be immature practically. In particular the choice of tunable parameters is often critical to success. Thus knowledge regarding which parameter settings are most appropriate for various types of target motifs is invaluable, but unfortunately has been scarce. In this paper, we report our parameter landscape analysis of two widely-used programs (the Gibbs Sampler (GS) and MEME). Our results show that GS is relatively sensitive to the changes of some parameter values while MEME is more stable. We present recommended parameter settings for GS optimized for four different motif lengths. Thus, running GS four times with these settings should significantly decrease the risk of overlooking subtle motifs.

However, this algorithm gives satisfactory approximations to the exact solution only for consistent data. For inconsistent problems (which is a real case in practice), the reconstruction is speckled with noise, and the convergence is not asymptotical. In a previous paper we made a systematic analysis, both theoretical and experimental, for this case by using an extension of the classical Kaczmarz's algorithm. But, although the results were much better and very promising comparing them with some classical and widely used projection algorithms, another difficulty still could not be eliminate, namely the exact solution of the discrete problem is not always enough accurate. This aspect is of course related to the mathematical modeling of the real problem (image), which gives us only a classical least-squares formulation. In this paper, we considered a penalized least-squares objective. The penalty term is defined with the Gibbs prior that incorporates nearest neighbor interactions among adjacent pixels to enforce an overall smoothness in the image. Then, we derived a version of the above mentioned extended Kaczmarz algorithm for this new penalized least-squares problem. Our synthetic experiments showed that this algorithm has not only a good noisy performance, but it also moderates parasite effects of the limited angular ray-coverage in borehole tomography. The effects are visible in the form of vertical smearings from inhomogeneous features in the image.

The advantage of list-mode processing is that it eliminates the storage of empty sinogram bins. However, a single back projection of all LORs is still necessary for calculating the sensitivity image. Since the detection sensitivity is dependent on the object attenuation and detector efficiency, the sensitivity image must be computed for each study. Exact computation of the sensitivity image can be a daunting task for modern scanners with a huge number of LORs. Thus, some fast approximate calculation is desirable. Here we use theoretical results that we have derived to analyze a Monte Carlo based backprojection approach for calculating the sensitivity image. We derive expressions for the total number of LORs required in the backprojection and the sampling distribution. Computer simulations show that the new sampling schemes can reduce reconstruction artifact compared	Univ Calif Davis, Dept Biomed Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA	Qi, JY (reprint author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Biomed Engn, Davis, CA 95616 USA.

Current motion correction algorithms generally lack the ability to compensate for non-rigid motions as well as perform poorly for frequent non-cyclical motions. In this paper, we derive from first principles a general list mode reconstruction algorithm that accounts for time-varying system responses. We further model the system response function in a way to incorporate the non-rigid motion. The resultant list mode reconstruction algorithm has the ability to compensate for frequent and non-rigid motions, with all detected events utilized. We also provide a histogram reconstruction algorithm that is tailored for gated PET acquisition with reduced usage of computational resource. This algorithm shows good motion compensation capability with computer simulated data and there is no obvious motion artifact visible on the reconstructed image.

The MRI images are modeled by Gaussian mixture model. This method, based on the statistical model, approximately finds the maximum a posteriori estimation of the segmentation and estimates the model parameters from the image data. The proposed strategy for segmentation is based on the EM and FCM algorithm. The prior model parameters are estimated via EM algorithm. Then, in order to obtain a good segmentation and speed up the convergence rate, initial estimates of the parameters were done by FCM algorithm. The proposed image segmentation methods have been tested using phantom simulated MRI data. The experimental results show the proposed method is effective and robust.

Some methods for missing value estimation are presented, such as K-nearest neighbor (KNN), the singular value decomposition (SVD), and Local Least Squares (LLS). In this paper, a new generalized method based on minor components is presented in estimation. It has been demonstrated that MC is the important measure of direction, and can characterize the structure of the data well. In the method, firstly missing values are estimated by row-average and k nearest neighbor genes are found. Secondly minor components are extracted for similar genes expression matrix by Adaptive minor component extraction (AMEX), and then missing value is estimated based on the extracted. MCs. When expectation maximization (EM) is applied to the method based on MC, robust estimations of the missing values are obtained. As a result, we compare MCimpute with the existed methods on two microarray expression data sets containing missing values, and the results show better performances for MCimpute.

However, incompleteness and high dimensionality of stored data are a problem. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) can be used prior to DTI as a dimension reduction technique to preserve the character of the original data by omitting non-essential data. In this study, data from 3949 breast cancer patients were analysed. Raw data were cleaned by running a set of logical rules. Missing values were replaced using the Expectation Maximization algorithm. After dimension reduction with CCA, DTI was employed to analyse the resulting dataset. The validity of the predictive model was confirmed by ten-fold cross validation and the effect of pre-processing was analysed by applying DTI to data without pre-processing. Replacing missing values and using CCA for data reduction dramatically reduced the size of the resulting tree and increased the accuracy of the prediction of breast cancer recurrence.

The model consists of a mixture of multinomial distributions over the word counts, each component corresponding to a different theme. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is the basic tool used for inference. After introducing the model and experimental framework (corpus and evaluation measures). we discuss the importance of initialization and illustrate the difficulty caused by the lack of supervision information. We propose some ideas to solve this problem, one of the most efficient method being based oil vocabulary reduction, and finally compare those heuristics with other inference processes, such as Gibbs Sampling.

This task can be difficult also for humans because many different but valid partitions may exist for the same collection. Moreover, the lack of information about categories makes it difficult to apply effective feature selection techniques to reduce the noise in the representation of texts. Despite these intrinsic difficulties, text clustering is an important task for Web search applications in which huge collections or quite long query result lists must be automatically organized. Semi-supervised clustering lies in between automatic categorization and auto-organization. It is assumed that the supervisor is not required to specify a set of classes, but only to provide a set of texts grouped by the criteria to be used to organize the collection. In this paper we present a novel algorithm for clustering text documents which exploits the EM algorithm together with a feature selection technique based on Information Gain. The experimental results show that only very few documents are needed to initialize the clusters and that the algorithm is able to properly extract the regularities hidden in a huge unlabeled collection.

The proposed technique is based on a decomposition determined by decoupling parameters which are estimated by maximum likelihood. The censorship considers that some outputs are missing, but classification intervals containing them are observed. Convergence of the algorithm is proved by showing that it can be framed as a GEM (Generalized Expectation-Maximization)-based training method. Hence, the possibility to adapt a GEM algorithm to deal with censored data without assuming known error variances is proved. The robustness of the algorithm is illustrated via a simulation example.

Furthermore, existing techniques for the automatic adjustment of this parameter are not totally satisfactory and are rarely used. In this paper we pursue the concept of Bayesian Adaptive Filtering (BAF) that we introduced earlier, based on modeling the optimal adptive filter coefficients as a stationary vector process, in particular a diagonal AR(l) model. Optimal adaptive filtering with such a state model becomes Kalman filtering. The AR(l) model parameters are determined with an adaptive version of the EM algorithm, which leads to linear prediction on reconstructed optimal filter correlations, and hence a meaningful approximation/estimation compromise. The resulting algorithm, of complexity O(N-2), is shown by simulations to have performance close to that of the Kalman filter with true model parameters. In this paper, we apply a component-wise EM approach to further reduce the complexity to being linear in the number of adaptive filtering coefficients. The good performance of the resulting algorithm is illustrated in simulations. The AR(l) state model can be further approximated by a random walk, leading to further simplified adaptive filter that can be interpreted an LMS algorithm with a step-size per filter tap.

Classifying learning resources according to domain specific concept hierarchies could address the problem of indexing and reusability. Manual classification is a tedious task and, as a result, automatic classifiers are in high demand. For this task we present an automated approach based on machine learning technique to exploit hierarchal knowledge in order to classify learning resources in a given hierarchy of concepts. We show by experimentation that using hierarchical information and content of unclassified documents provides better accuracy.

Estimation of density algorithms (EDAs) are evolutionary optimization techniques, which determine the sampling strategy by means of a parametric probabilistic density function estimated from the population. Real-coded Genetic Algorithm (RCGA) does not explicitly estimate any probabilistic distribution, however, the probabilistic model of the population is implicitly estimated by crossovers and the sampling strategy is determined by this implicit probabilistic model. Based on this understanding, we propose a novel density estimation algorithm by using crossovers as nonparametric kernels and apply this kernel density estimation to the Gaussian Mixture modeling. We show that the proposed method is superior in the robustness of the computation and in the accuracy of the estimation by the comparison of conventional EM estimation.

Popular existing solutions include Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, Otsu thresholding, K-sigma thresholding, and the recently proposed Generalized Principal Component Analysis (GPCA). We apply these algorithms to segmentation of noisy images with small foreground objects. Such images often arise in change detection applications such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). In our experiments none of the algorithms performed sufficient well when the total size of foreground regions was much smaller than the size of the background region. We propose a novel algorithm, called sGPCA, that can robustly estimate the intensity of small foreground objects in the presence of noise. The intensity estimate obtained can be used to determine an optimal threshold value or to initialize EM and Markov Random Field (MRF) based segmentation algorithms.

The applications of such a system range from human-computer interaction in virtual reality systems to auxiliary tools for deaf-mule to communicate with ordinary people through computer. A great deal of research is done so far but fewer researchers have extended it to Arabic Sign Language Recognition. In this paper we have presented a system that performs Vision Based Isolated Arabic Sign Language Recognition using Hidden Markov Models together with EM algorithm for parameters estimation. An approach to track hands in subsequent frames is proposed using a fuzzy object similarity measure based on a number of geometrical features of hands. Moreover, we have used the centroid of the signer's face to centralize the body coordinates instead of fixing the signer's position or using position tracker device. The overall accuracy of the recognition task is 98% over a dataset of 50 signs including single hand and two-handed signs.

Starting from local, low-level features computed at interest point locations, the method combines these primitives into high-level abstractions. Our appearance-based learning method uses local statistical analysis between features and Expectation-Maximization to identify and code spatial correlations. Spatial correlation is asserted when two features tend to occur at the same relative position of each other. This learning scheme results in a graphical model that constitutes a probabilistic representation of a flexible visual feature hierarchy. For feature detection, evidence is propagated using Belief Propagation. Each message is represented by a Gaussian mixture where each component represents a possible location of the feature. In experiments, the proposed approach demonstrates efficient learning and robust detection of object models in the presence of clutter and occlusion and under view point changes.

Especially, the incorporation of detector blurring within the modeling of the scanner response can significantly improve the image quality. However, the blurring modeling is accompanied by a reduction of the rate of convergence. Therefore, the statistical accuracy of the acquired data limits the improvements depending on the specific system sampling. We have developed a fully 3D MLEM-reconstruction software for a Siemens/CTI HR+ PET scanner including an appropriate modeling. Here, the true parameters of the detector resolution appear not adequate for the modeling, because strong artefacts in the images are observed. Therefore, we have adapted the parameters of the detector resolution model so that the artefacts disappeared, but that the image resolution was still better than without using the detector resolution model.

A more economical approach is to collect telephone speech and then restrict the application to operate at the telephone bandwidth. However, this generally results in suboptimal performance compared to a wideband recognition system. In this paper, we propose a novel EM algorithm in which wideband acoustic models are trained using a small amount of wideband speech augmented by a larger amount of narrowband speech. Experiments performed using wideband speech and telephone speech demonstrate that the proposed mixed-bandwidth training algorithm results in significant improvements in recognition accuracy over conventional training strategies when the amount of wideband data is limited.

One of its drawbacks is that it converges slowly in many cases. Inspired by the successful accelerated variants of bound optimisation algorithms such as Expectation Maximisation, we propose an accelerated version of the mean shift algorithm. The appealing property is that, compared with the standard mean shift algorithm, the number of iterations to convergence is significantly decreased. Additionally for the Gaussian kernel, no extra computation is introduced at each iteration. We empirically show on various data sets that the extended algorithm can provide a considerable speedup.

During the last few years, fuzzy set theory has been integrated into many association rule mining algorithms. However, one of the problems of these algorithms is. the requirement of the number of clusters and the membership functions a priori: In general, his number is unknown until the problem is solved. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes two algorithms to efficiently generate the number of clusters and the fuzzy membership functions from large databases. One approach is based on the expectation maximization concept and the other is by the combined use of the K-means clustering algorithm and validity index iteration. Using the data sets provided by ERUDIT and easily available from the Internet, this paper illustrates the advantages of the proposed approaches. A comparison of the two proposed approaches is also provided.

Our approach combines high quality factors (Qs) photonic microdisks with nonlinear properties of electro-optic (EO) material at the present of applied millimeter wave to achieve optical modulation. The high Q values and strong field densities associated. with WGMs in microdisk resonators result in the enhancement of the nonlinear interaction of optical fields with a material that exhibits coherent attributes, even with weak millimeter waves. The coupled mode theory (CMT) is applied to incorporate the nonlinearity of EO material in the optical analysis. In the simulations, two EO materials, LiNBO3 and GaAs, are considered and designed to realize the MMW photonic modulation. In addition, carefully design and analysis is taken by using rigorous electromagnetic (EM) algorithm to accurately determine EM field in the MMW resonator, which will provide maximum modulation.

The joint probability of neural spike can be represented using the log-linear model. From statistical-mechanical point of view, the loglinear model can be regarded as a multi-body interacted Ising spin model or the Boltzman machine with higher-order interactions. The estimation of higher-order correlation of neural firing corresponds to that of higher-order interations in this Ising spin system, and to the hyper-parameter estimation in the Bayesian inference. In this paper, we apply maximization of marginal likelihood (MML) method to this problem, and discuss the properties of MML analytically using statistical-mechanical method.

The algorithm organizes edge points into strokes and assigns a set of weights summing to one to each stroke. These weights represent the soft assignment of the stroke to each of the ACMs and depend on the distance between the stroke points and the ACM units. Both the weights and the ACMs energy minimization are computed using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.

In the cognitive radio approach, different groups of radio users may operate in the same spectrum region. The radio systems intelligently and dynamically change their transmission schemes during operation to co-exist. Therefore, a fundamental issue in cognitive radio is being able to assess and track users on a wireless channel. This problem occurs when the cognitive radio system is searching for friendly data or usable channels. The received and preprocessed signal typically turns out to be a Gaussian mixture random variable with common component variance. The task then is to quickly estimate and continue tracking the parameters of this mixture random variable from samples of data. Two efficient and easily-implemented methods for estimating all these parameters are developed, using a novel approach of fitting the cumulative distribution function (cdf) to the estimated cdf, and nonlinear, unconstrained optimization. The algorithm are demonstrated through simulation experiments. The algorithms presented here compare favourably with the general EM algorithm and are better suited for cognitive radio and wireless network surveillance applications.

Several automatic and semi-automatic particle detection algorithms have been developed along the years. We have developed a general technique designed to automatically identify the projection images of particles. The method is based on Markov random field modelling of the projected images and involves a preprocessing of electron micrographs followed by image segmentation and post processing. In this paper we discuss the basic ideas of the sequential algorithm and outline a parallel implementation of it.

The Variational Bayes (VB) procedure is used to restore conjugacy. The resulting Bayesian recursive identification procedure has many of the desirable computational properties of the classical RLS procedure. During each time-step, an iterative Variational EM (VEM) procedure is required to obtain the necessary moments. The procedure is used to reconstruct an outlier-corrupted AR process and a noisy speech segment. The VB scheme appears to offer improved performance over the related Quasi-Bayes (QB) scheme in the case of time-variant component weights.

Our main contribution is to present a maximum likelihood based method to blindly separate the brain activations in an fMRI experiment. Choosing the time frequency domain as the signal representation space, our method relies on the second order statistics and exploits the inter-source diversity. It is efficiently implemented by the EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm where the time courses of the brain activations are considered as the hidden variables. The estimation variance of the STFT (Short Time Fourier Transform) is reduced by averaging across time frequency sub-domains. The successful separation of the right and left visual cortex activations during a visual fMRI experiment, in a block design, and the extraction of only the relevant tasks corroborate the effectiveness of our proposed separating algorithm.

We compare the use of multivariate RMMs to multivariate Gaussian mixture models in the general case where the HMM is a dynamic model and for the special case where it has a single state and reduces to a static model. We evaluate the proposed method when used to model probability density of periodpgrams from real-life noise sources and white Gaussian noise, which we include for reference purposes.

One can derive an estimate of parameters from this distribution. Our approach differs from the Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood (ML) approaches. It gives an alternative to Bayesian inference when we don't want to define a prior over parameters and gives an alternative to the ML method when we want a better estimate of the distribution over hidden variables. As a practical implementation, we present a U-updating algorithm based on the mean field theory to approximate the distribution over hidden variables from the U-likelihood. This algorithm captures some of the correlations among hidden variables by estimating reaction terms, Those reaction terms are found to penalize the likelihood. We show that the U-updating algorithm becomes the EM algorithm as a special case in the large sample limit. The useful behavior of our method is confirmed for the case of mixture of Gaussians by comparing to the EM algorithm.

It was the general consideration that the adequate compensation of photon attenuation requires, that the emission data be measured at projection angles over 2 pi in the case of the attenuation medium is inhomogeneous. The reduction of the scanning angle in SPECT imaging may be desirable because it can reduce scanning time and thereby minimize patient-motion and other artifacts. In SPECT myocardial imaging emission data is measured historically at projection angles over pi from the right anterior oblique (RAO) to the left posterior oblique (LPO). This configuration results in better image contrast and, in some cases, betters spatial resolution. However, in this case the reconstructed image may suffer more severely from geometric distortion than 2 pi angular sampling. It has been proven recently in analytical computer simulation studies that the data function over 2 pi in SPECT with non-uniform attenuation contains redundant information; therefore the scanning angle theoretically can be reduced from 2 pi to pi without loss of information. In this study our goal was to investigate how the various short-scan SPECT scheme configurations works in a real myocardial SPECT imaging system with highly inhomogeneous attenuating medium using attenuation correction. The measured projection images were reconstructed using the Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization algorithm with attenuation correction.

The algorithm uses the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for channel estimation, together with a new complex-domain sphere decoding (SD) algorithm for near-optimal detection of data symbols. The proposed algorithm is tested on a MIMO communication system. Simulation results show that, even with a short training sequence, the algorithm provides a near optimal performance with a reasonable computational complexity. We also compare the computational complexity of the proposed sphere decoding approach with other techniques and show that it has a lower computational complexity without any performance penalty.

B	Tan, ZB		Zhang, D; Khoshgoftaar, TM; Shyu, ML		Tan, ZB			An equivalence based approach to dealing with uncertainty in maximum likelihood estimation	Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Information Reuse and Integration (IRI-2005)	AUG 15-17, 2005	Las Vegas, NV	IEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc				Sometimes it is difficult to obtain maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) directly-from available data in presence of uncertainty. In this paper we develop an approach to dealing with uncertainty by introducing equivalent quantities of unknown variables from which concerned interests can be estimated directly. From Expectation-Maximization (EM theory we treat the unknown variables as random variables and define their equivalent quantities as their mathematical expectations. To illustrate the concept of equivalence and its applications, we solve a specific MLE-problem: To estimate component reliability from uncertain system life data. Two types of uncertainty for components are taken into account: status masking and left censored life time. We define and obtain equivalent failure and equivalent test time for components under different uncertain conditions. An EM algorithm based on the derived equivalent quantities is formulated to estimate component reliability from uncertain system life data. Compared to other methods, our approach based on equivalent quantities can handle more complex uncertainty. In addition, the convergence of the iterative estimation processes has been mathematically proved.

The defense against Internet worms is largely an open problem. This paper investigates two important problems. Can a localized defense system detect new worms that were not seen before and, moreover, capture the attack packets? How to identify polymorphic worms from the normal background traffic? We have two major contributions here. The first contribution is the design of a novel double-honeypot system, which is able to automatically detect new worms and isolate the attack traffic. The second contribution is the proposal of a new type of position-aware distribution signatures (PADS), which fit in the gap between the traditional signatures and the anomaly-based systems. We propose two algorithms based on Expectation-Maximization (EM) and Gibbs Sampling for efficient computation of PADS from polymorphic worm samples. The new signature is capable of handling certain polymorphic worms. Our experiments show that the algorithms accurately separate new variants of the MSBlaster worm from the normal-traffic background.

The tonal and transient components identified using a small number of coefficients of the modified discrete cosine transform (.MDCT.) and the wavelet transform, respectively. Determinations of the significant MDCT and wavelet coefficients in the algorithm of Daudet and Torresani, referred as the D&T algorithm, ire achieved by thresholds. All MDCT coefficients are assumed to be independent as well as wavelet coefficients. However, the MDCT coefficients probably have statistical dependencies, namely the clustering, and persistence properties, and so do the wavelet coefficients. We propose a modification to the D&T algorithm, that can capture statistical dependencies by utilizing the hidden Markov model. The Viterbi and the Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) algorithms, used to find file optimal state distribution, are applied to determine the significant MDCT and wavelet coefficients automatically. The modified algorithm was used to encode 43 monosyllabic Consonant-Vowel-Consonant (CVC) words and 3 sentences. Results showed that the modified algorithm improves the coding efficiency by 37% compared with the threshold method of D&T algorithm when equal numbers of significant coefficients; are used.

But most of the blind deconvolution methods have to iterate a large amount of times and the result is also unsatisfactory. In this paper, a new blind deconvolution algorithm is proposed, which, consisting of two steps, is based on simultaneous estimating the specimen function and the parameters of the point-spread function (PSF). Firstly, it uses the expectation maximization algorithm (EM) to iterate the specimen function; secondly it uses the conjugate gradient method to estimate the parameters of the PSE The mathematical model ensures that all the constraints of the PSF are satisfied, and the maximum-likelihood approach ensures that the specimen is nonnegative. In this paper, the general Gauss function is used to be as the PSE In the experiment, it can successfully restore both the two-dimensional and three-dimensional images within limited times of iteration.

Feature vectors derived are employed in well-known stochastic classifiers, including nearest-neighborhood, single Gaussian and a Gaussian mixture with EM optimization. Classifiers' performances are evaluated by using cross-validation and bootstrapping techniques. It is shown that the various classifers perform equivalently and that the modified preprocessing configuration yields considerably improved results.

However non-uniform noise persists even when each sensor's pose is known, and the uncertain correspondence between detections from different views complicates easy "multiple view object detection." We present an algorithm based on Expectation/Maximization (EM) Clustering that permits a principled fusion of the views without requiring an explicit correspondence search. We demonstrate the use of this algorithm to improve mapping performance of robots in simulation and in the field.

Among sequences recognized by a given DNA-binding protein, different positions exhibit varying degrees of conservation. The reason is that base pairs that are more extensively contacted by the protein tend to be more conserved. This observation can be used in the discovery of transcription factor binding sites. Here we present a rigorous means to accomplish this. In particular, we constrain the order of the information (entropy) in the columns of the position specific weight matrix (PWM) which characterizes the motif being sought. We then show how to compute the maximum likelihood estimate of a PWM under such order restrictions. This computation is easily integrated with the EM algorithm or the Gibbs sampler to enhance performance in the search for motifs in unaligned sequences. We demonstrate our method on a well-known data set of binding sites of the transcription factor Crp in E. coli.

In this study, we evaluated whether the fast sampling of the time-activity curves (TACs) in regions of specific (striata) and non-specific (cerebellum) binding could allow for quantitative estimation of the binding potential (BP) in human I-123-FPCIT dopamine receptor studies. Numerical simulations and phantom studies showed that this TACs-based method estimates regional concentrations better than using the ROI contents taken on Expectation Maximization (EM) reconstructed images. Moreover, it allows for an estimation of the statistical uncertainty. In the phantom study, the TACs-based method reproduced the real target-to-background ratio within about 10%; the ratio evaluated on EM images underestimated the real value of about 45%. Indeed, partial volume effect (PVE) correction is naturally embedded in the method. The approach was also applied in a patient DATSCAN study. The TACs were used to describe the evolution of the specificto-nonspecific ratio (R) in time. The R values retrieved on EM images were about a 40% of the estimates obtained on TACs. The higher accuracy of TACs in measuring receptor density should allow for better clinical performance of receptor SPECT in Parkinson's disease. The drawback of the method resides in a higher sensibility to region segmentation errors with respect to the conventional procedure.

A sequence of known symbols with lower power is arithmetically added to the information symbols before modulation and transmission. The channel estimation is done exploiting the known superimposed data in the transmitted signal. Two iterative algorithms are considered in this paper: recursive least squares (RLS) and the expectation maximization (EM). Performance of the proposed algorithms is compared with a simple avergaing scheme and the LMS algorihm. For short data blocks RLS outperforms EM, but with large blocks EM is superior.

We propose an expectation maximization (EM) based unscented Kalman smoother (UKS) to simultaneously estimate parameters of system along with the equalized chaotic signal. The proposed method can be applied to both linear and nonlinear systems driven by chaotic signals. The performance of the proposed estimator is evaluated for identification of systems that occur frequently in communication systems. The estimation performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using computer simulations and shown to be better than conventional nonlinear system identification algorithms.

In this paper we describe a gossip-based implementation of an alternative algorithm for learning Gaussian mixtures in which components are added to the mixture one after another. Our new Greedy Gossip-based Gaussian mixture learning algorithm uses gossip-based parallel search, starting from multiple initial guesses, for finding good components to add to the mixture in each component allocation step. It can be executed on massive networks of small computing devices, converging to a solution exponentially faster than its centralized version, while reaching the same quality of generated models.

B	Walkowiak, T		Kwasnicka, H; Paprzycki, M		Walkowiak, T			Sequential classification of probabilistic independent feature vectors by mixture models	5th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications, Proceedings			English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications (ISDA 2005)	SEP 08-10, 2005	Wroclaw, POLAND	World Federat Soft Comp, European Soc Fuzzy Log & Technol, European Neural Network Soc, Warsaw Sch Social Psychol, Polish Minist Sci Res & Informat Technol				The paper presents methods of sequential classification with predefined classes. The classification is based on a sequence, assumed to be probabilistic independent, of feature vectors extracted from signal generated by the object. Each feature vector is a base for calculation of a probability density function for each predefined class. The density functions are estimated by the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and the t-Student mixture model. The model parameters are estimated by algorithms based on the expectation-maximization (EM) method. The estimated densities calculated for a sequence of feature vectors are inputs to analyzed classification rules. These rules are derived from Bayes decision theory with some heuristic modifications. The performance of the proposed rules was tested in an automatic, text independent, speaker identification task. Achieved results are presented.

One is called joint classification and feature optimization (JCFO), which imposes a sparse prior on the features, and optimizes the classifier and its predictors simultaneously via an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The other selects features by directly maximizing the hypothesis margin between targets and clutter. The results of feature selection and target discrimination are demonstrated using wideband electromagnetic induction data measured at data collected at the Aberdeen Proving Ground Standardized Test Site for UXO discrimination. It is shown that the classification performance is significantly improved by only including a compact set of relevant features.

In this work, SNR and contrast of brain images are optimized by TR and inversion recovery time TI in multi-spectrum MRI data sets. SI inhomogeneities are measured in vivo using a recently developed method allowing improved correction. The three-Gaussian distribution model is used to fit histograms of the images to find the initialization parameters for an Expectation-Maximization (EM) segmentation algorithm. Compared with other methods, the field map method provides better correction of SI inhomogeneities and excellent segmentation results.

Hyperspectral image spectroscopy is an emerging technique for geological investigations from airborne or orbital sensors. Many spacecraft carry spectroscopic equipment as wavelengths outside the visible light in the electromagnetic spectrum give much greater information about an object. The algorithm used is an extension to the standard Expectation Maximisation (EM). The incremental method allows us to learn and interpret the data as they become available. Two Bayesian network classifiers were tested: the Naive Bayes, and the Tree-Augmented-Naive Bayes structures. Our preliminary experiments show that incremental learning with unlabelled data can improve the accuracy of the classifier.

Hyperspectral image spectroscopy is an emerging technique for geological investigations from airborne or orbital sensors. Many spacecraft carry spectroscopic equipment as wavelengths outside the visible light in the electromagnetic spectrum give much greater information about an object. The algorithm presented combines the standard Expectation Maximisation (EM), which optimises parameters, with structure search for model selection. We use the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) score to learn the network structure. The procedure only converges to a local maxima, thus requiring a good initial graph structure. Two initial structures are used: the Naive Bayes, and the Tree-Augmented-Naive Bayes structures. Our preliminary experiments show that the former results in a structure that can correctly determine the presence and types of minerals with merely 13% accuracy while the latter results in a structure that has approximately 94% accuracy.

We incarnate Motion Engine with a new model NPHHMM, a hierarchical hidden Markov model with non-parametric output densities. Our work contributes in three aspects: (1) NPHHMM models both temporal and spatial characteristics of human motion precisely so to support recreation of new motion; (2) compared with first-order hidden Markov model, NPHHMM has longer memory for more accurate prediction; (3) the EM learning algorithm of NPHHMM incorporates output densities in non-parametric form, which provides a compact representation of prototypical poses without requirements of explicit compression or losing accuracy of body model by extracting the most significant dependencies between body joints. NPHHMM learned from captured 3D human motion can be used to generate a variety of realistic new motions, thus is useful for data-driven motion editing and synthesis, which is recently an active research area to relieve animators from intensive labor of manual work and to automate the production of character animation.

Virtual colonoscopy (VC) navigates through the colon model looking for polyps in a similar manner as the fiber optic colonoscopy does. We had built an ECC pipeline for the commercial VC system of Viatronix Inc. In this paper, we present an improved ECC method. It is based on a partial-volume image-segmentation framework, which is derived using the well-established statistical expectation-maximization algorithm. The presented ECC method was evaluated by both visual inspection on the cleansed colon lumens and computer-aided detection of polyps (CADpolyp) using 20 patient datasets. Compared to our previous ECC pipeline, this presented new method demonstrates improvement in both visual judgment and CADpolyp.

This approach also enables to compute the non-data-aided (NDA) bound, i.e. the CRB when the receiver only knows the symbol constellation. We explore various scenarios, including the case of a deterministic channel and the case of a random channel. Numerical evaluations of the CRB-based bounds are presented for different channels. In particular, the influence of the symbol-constellation size is highlighted. Finally, the performance of an estimator based on the expectation-maximization algorithm is shown to be very close to the proposed bounds.

Parameter estimation is one possible approach, where the applied scaling is estimated from the received signal at the decoder. This estimate can be used to correct the mismatch with respect to the quantization step assumed by the decoder prior to decoding. In this work we first review previous approaches utilizing parameter estimation as a means of combating the scaling attack on DC-DM. We then present a method for joint iterative decoding and maximum likelihood estimation of the scaling factor for this quantization-based method. The estimation method exploits the reliabilities provided by the near-optimal iterative decoding process in order to successively refine the estimate. The complexity of this problem is tackled using the expectation maximization algorithm. By performing estimation in cooperation with the decoding process, reliable estimation is possible at very low watermark-to-noise power ratios by using sufficiently low rate codes.

The simulation result shows that the algorithm can still converge to the case with given channel parameters when inserting fewer pilots, and the iteration number apparently decreases as the number of pilots increases. The proposed algorithm doesn't need the statistical characteristic of channels; at the same time, it can realize the trade-off between system performance and complexity by choosing the number of iteration times. The algorithm degenerates to a general EM algorithm when no pilot is used in channel estimation.

The EM(expectation-maximization)-MLSE receivers provide a decent solution for conquering the delay problem via detecting the same sequence iteratively at the expense of increasing the processing time. To accelerate the overall processing time for EM-MLSE receivers, we propose novel alpha-EM-MLSE designs which give a faster convergence speed than traditional EM-MLSE receivers under penalty of more complex mathemetical structures.

From the maximum likelihood criterion, we derive two blind rate detection algorithms: the first follows from a low SNR approximation of the likelihood function, while the second makes use of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We compare the proposed detectors with a cyclic correlation-based scheme from literature in terms of their rate detection error probability. The proposed ML-based algorithms turn out to substantially outperform the correlation-based algorithm.

The algorithm operates on coded signals and exploits the code properties by accepting soft information from the MAP decoder. Issues of convergence are addressed and we show how computational complexity may be reduced without any performance degradation. Simulation results are presented for convolutional and turbo codes, and are compared to performance results of conventional algorithms both in terms of mean square estimation error (MSEE) and BER. We show that code-aided delay estimation always improves the MSEE, but not necessarily the BER. On the other hand, code-aided frame synchronization is mandatory, in order to avoid either significant BER degradations or the need for very long pilot sequences.

The sensor network data are assumed to arise from a GMM. But several dimensions of some samples may not be available. Performing estimations in a series of subspaces, FEM is able to handle the incomplete data from sensor networks which have some malfunction sensors. Furthermore, FEM efficiently approximates the underlying distribution of sensor data by transferring limited parameters in each communication, which leads to the economization of power consumption. Both the experiments on synthetic dataset and real dataset demonstrate the performance of FEM in sensor network applications.

In conventional Compton camera systems, the image reconstruction is performed only in 2D or 3D spatial coordinates for a specific gamma-ray energy. In this paper, we describe a new energy-imaging integrated deconvolution algorithm in which a source pixel is defined in a combined spatial and energy space. Therefore, the reconstructed source distribution using this technique gives the original incident gamma-ray intensity and energy spectrum as a function of incident angle. By employing this energy-imaging integrated deconvolution algorithm, a Compton camera can provide the image at any specific energy, as well as the spectrum at any specific direction. Since the ML solution estimates the true incident gamm-ray intensity, the deconvolved energy spectrum at the source location is free of Compton continuum. To reconstruct truthfully the source distribution from the observation data, the accuracy of the system response function t(ij), i.e. the probability for a photon from source pixel j to be observed as event i, is the most crucial information. Because the large number of pixels in the energy imaging integrated space, and the very large number of possible measurement events, it is impossible to pre-calculate the system response function t(ij) by simulations. In this paper, an analytical approach to estimate the system response function for Compton camera systems is introduced to allow the calculation of the system response function during the reconstruction process. The energy-imaging integrated deconvolution algorithm is applied to a 3-dimensional position-sensitive CdZnTe gamma-ray imaging spectrometer.

State-space models describe dynamics that the observed measurements depend on some hidden state variables. Hidden state variables can capture effects that cannot be measured in gene expression profiling experiment, for example, genes that have not been included in the observation variables, levels of regulatory proteins or the effect of mRNA. System identification is achieved by EM algorithm that is based on the maximum likelihood method. We apply this method to a published yeast cell-cycle gene expression time-series data under the assumption that state variables and observation variables are generated by Gaussian white noise process, that produces the simplest and most reasonable model to explain of behaviors of the gene expression profiles.

In the approach, each motion primitive is modeled statistically from motion capture data using multiple regression hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM). HSMM is an extension of hidden Markov model (HAM), in which each state has an explicit state duration probability distribution, and multiple regression HSMM is the one whose mean parameter of probability distribution function is assumed to be given by a function of factors which affects human motion. In this paper, we introduce a training algorithm for the multiple regression HSMM, called factor adaptive training based on the EM algorithm and also describe a parameter generation algorithm from motion primitive HSMMs with prescribed values of factors. From experimental results, we show that the proposed technique can control walking movements in accordance with a change of the factors such as walking pace and stride length and can provide realistic human motion.

An adaptive Markov model-based method to cluster validation in image segmentation	2005 27th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, Vols 1-7	PROCEEDINGS OF ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY		English	Proceedings Paper	27th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society	AUG 31-SEP 03, 2005	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc, Chinese Acad Engn Sci			CRITERIA	The number of class should be detected as part of the parameter estimation procedure prior to image segmentation for segmentation algorithms. It is very important in theory and application for estimating the class number correctly. In this paper, an adaptive total energy criterion (ATEC) to cluster validation is proposed based on the Markov random field (MRF) in the image segmentation. The criterion is composed of two parts: one part is inner-energy, which describes the difference of data in the same class; another is inter-class energy, which describes the edge information. The correct class number can be obtained by minimizing the ATEC. The parameters are estimated by expectation maximum (EM) algorithm and maximum psedu-likelihood (MPL) algorithm. The complex computation is optimized by the mixture of simulated algorithm (SA) and iterated conditional mode (ICM). The experiments show that the class number can be automatically detected by adjusting the hyper-parameter in MRF. As a by-product, the segmentation can be obtained by the maximum a posteriori (MAP).

The work is motivated by the empirical experiments where the weights often follow certain probability density functions in protein sequence analysis using the bio-basis function neural network, an extension to radial basis function neural networks. An expectation-maximization learning algorithm is proposed for the estimation of the weights of the proposed Bayesian radial-basis function neural network and the simulation results show that the proposed novel radial basis function neural network performed the best among various algorithms.

Multi-View EM does feature split as Co-training and Co-EM, but it considers multi-view learning problems in the EM framework. The proposed algorithm has these impressing advantages comparing with other algorithms in Co-training setting: its convergence is theoretically guaranteed; it can easily deal with more two views learning problems. Experiments on WebKB data(1) demonstrated that Multi-View EM performed satisfactorily well compared with Co-EM, Co-training and standard EM.

As byproducts estimates of the azimuth spreads (ASs), elevation spreads (ESs), and the azimuth-elevation correlation coefficients (AECCs) of the SDSs can be computed from the estimates of the GAM parameters. These parameters determine with close accuracy the direction spreads [4] of SDSs. Simulation studies show that in a single-SDS scenario, the GAM-SAGE algorithm outperforms the Spread-ESPRIT technique, and both of them outperform the SAGE algorithm derived with the conventional specular-scatterer (SS) model (SS-SAGE) when the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is beyond a certain threshold which depends on the AS and ES of the SDS. In a two-SDS scenario with strong power unbalance between the SDSs, provided the direction spacing between the SDSs equals twice the intrinsic azimuth or elevation resolution of the array, the GAM-SAGE algorithm can estimate the nominal direction of the SDS with weakest power with tolerably small errors. The SS-SAGE algorithm returns high root mean squared estimation error (RMSEE) regardless of the direction separation. We also found that the AECC estimator needs to operate in high SNR in order for its bias and RMSEE to be tolerably small. The performance of the AECC estimator, as well as the AS and ES estimators can be improved by applying an array-size selection technique proposed in [5].

We propose an interacting multiple model-expectation maximization (IMM-EM) algorithm by incorporating different dynamic models for the target and using Markov random field (MRF) for data association. In this way we are able to track maneuvering and nonmaneuvering targets simultaneously in a single batch mode (sequential). Moreover, it can be used for real-time application. The proposed method overcomes the problem of data association by incorporating all validated measurements together using an EM algorithm and exploiting MRF It treats the data association problem as an incomplete data problem and measurement association as missing data. In the proposed method, all validated measurements are used to update the target state, and the probability density function (pdf) of observed data, given a target state and measurement association, is treated as a mixture pdf. This allows us to combine the likelihood of a measurement due to each model. The association process now incorporates IMM, and consequently, it is possible to track any arbitrary trajectory. We also consider two different cases for association of measurement to target: association of each measurement to the target is independent of each other; and association of a measurement influences an association of its neighbor measurement.

In this paper, we develop a hidden semantic concept discovery methodology to address effective semantics-intensive image database classification. Each image is segmented into regions and then a uniform and sparse region-based representation is obtained. With this representation a probabilistic model based on statistical-hidden-class assumptions of the image database is proposed. to which the Expectation-Maximization (EM) technique is applied to analyze semantic tic concepts hidden in the database. Two methods are proposed to make use of the semantic concepts discovered from the probabilistic model for unsupervised and supervised image database classifications, respectively. based on the automatically learned concept vectors. It is shown that the concept vectors are more reliable and robust and thus promising than the low level features through the theoretic analysis and the e experimental evaluations on a database of 10,000 general-purpose images.

In this paper, we present a new channel estimation and delay tracking method in a SAGE (Space Alternating Generalized Expectation maximization) framework The proposed method uses much fewer pilots with special positions that are related to the path number and path delays. The method considered not only the sample-spaced path delays but also the non-sample spaced path delays. The non-sample spaced delay is a more practical situation in wireless communications, and this situation will generate an error floor for the traditional channel estimation methods. When the path delay profile changes, a feedback channel is required to inform the transmitter to change the pilot pattern. Analytical results and simulations comparing to the low pass LS channel estimation are given at last.

This paper focuses on the segmentation of moving vehicles in dynamic scene. We analyses the psychology of human vision and present a framework for segmenting moving vehicles in the highway. The proposed framework consists of two parts. Firstly, we propose an adaptive background update method in which the background is updated according to the change of illumination conditions and thus can adapt to the change of illumination sensitively. Secondly, we construct a Gaussian motion model to segment moving vehicles, in which the motion vectors of the moving pixels are modeled as a Gaussian model and an on-line EM algorithm is used to update the model. The Gaussian distribution of the adaptive model is elevated to determine which moving vectors result from moving vehicles and which from other moving objects such as waving trees. Finally, the pixels with motion vector result from the moving vehicles are segmented. Experimental results of several typical scenes show that the proposed model can detect the moving vehicles correctly and is immune from influence of the moving objects caused by the waving trees and the vibration of camera.

Specifically, the channel under consideration is a binary symmetric channel with a crossover probability that changes a bounded number of times during the transmission of a codeword; the channel state information to be estimated consists of the crossover probabilities of the different segments and the location(s) of the transition point(s). To estimate the transition points, a technique developed for source coding of piecewise-stationary memoryless sources is adapted; then the Expectation-Maximization algorithm is used to estimate the crossover probabilities. This segmentation/estimation is carried out on the error sequence of the currently hypothesized code frame. Simulation results using turbo codes indicate that the proposed receiver performs almost as well as a receiver that has perfect knowledge of the channel.

These methods, including fuzzy k-means and expectation maximization, allow an object to be assigned to multi-clusters with different degrees of membership. However the memberships that result from fizzy clustering algorithms are difficult to analyze and visualize, and usually are converted to 0-1 memberships. In this paper, we propose a geometric framework to visualize fuzzy-clustered data. The scheme provides a geometric visualization by grouping the objects with similar cluster membership, and shows clear advantages over existing methods, demonstrating its capabilities for viewing and navigating inter-cluster relationships in a spatial manner.

Recently, mixture modelling has been used to extract information from expressed genes. It utilizes two separate steps to estimate the number of classes and model parameters, respectively, which however may be time-consuming and fall into sub-optimal solutions. In this paper, we therefore apply an one-step approach, namely Rival Penalized Expectation-Maximization (RPEM) algorithm, to microarray data analysis. The RPEM algorithm is capable of estimating the parameters of the normal mixture model, meanwhile determining the number of classes automatically. The numerical results have shown the effectiveness of this technique on real microarray data analysis.

The system includes a Generalized Sidelobe Canceller (GSC) beamformer followed by a recognizer with Vector Taylor Series (VTS) compensation. The GSC beamformer provides two outputs, allowing more information to be used in the recognizer. One is the enhanced target speech output.. the other is the reference noise output. VTS is used to compensate the effect of the residual noise in the GSC speech output, utilizing the GSC reference noise output. The compensation is done in a Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) sense. Moreover, an iteration procedure using Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is developed to refine the compensation parameters. Experimental results on MONC database showed that the new system significantly improved the speech recognition performance in the overlapping speech situations.

We implemented a single-program-multiple-data (SPMD) parallel 3-D OSEM reconstruction algorithm based on message passing interface (NIPI) and tested it with combinations of different number of calculating processors and different size of voxel grid in reconstruction (64 x 64 x 64 and 128 x 128 x 128). Performance of parallelization was evaluated in terms of the speedup factor and parallel efficiency. This parallel implementation methodology is expected to be helpful to make fully 3-D OSEM algorithms more feasible in clinical SPECT studies.

In this paper, we propose a new minimum cross-entropy (MXE) image reconstruction method for PET based on the total variation (TV) norm constraint. The use of TV is due to the fact that it can effectively reduce the noise in 2D images while preserving edges. In addition, a multiple level set method was incorporated into image reconstruction to identify the shape of the radioactive objects. It is important for some special applications where the shape of tumors should be identified. The initial emission rates which used by multiphase level set method were estimated by using discrete reconstruction method. The experimental results show that the proposed method is more effective.

J	Luo, XH; Boos, DD; Tamura, RN				Luo, XH; Boos, DD; Tamura, RN			Score tests for dose effect in the presence of non-responders	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						mixture model; likelihood ratio test; simple linear regression; EM algorithm; permutation test	MIXTURE-MODELS	When only a certain proportion of subjects respond to treatment ('responders') or may never experience an event of interest (thus 'cured'), mixture models often lead to increased understanding of the treatment or disease process. This paper focuses on hypothesis testing in a dose-response framework and shows that increased power is possible by using a mixture model where both the logit of the response rate and the response mean are linear functions of the dose level. Three score tests are developed for testing an overall effect and pen-nutation methods are used to control the type I error. Extensive simulations establish the power properties of the tests and show that our proposed score test has the best performance. The approach is illustrated by a multi-country clinical trial of rapid acting Intramuscular Olanzapine. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

The EM algorithm for the general mixture model is modified to accommodate the genetic constraints and is used to estimate genotype frequencies from the distribution of the SULT1A1 phenotype. A parametric bootstrap likelihood ratio test is considered as a testing method for the number of mixing components. The size and power of the test is then investigated and compared with the conventional chi-squared test. The relative risk associated with genotypes defined by this model is also investigated through the generalized linear model. This analysis revealed that a genotype with the highest mean value of SULT1A1 activity has greater impact on cancer risk than others. This result suggests that the phenotype with a higher SULT1A1 activity might be important in studying the association between the cancer risk and SULT1A1 activity.

J	Mayer, M				Mayer, M			Limitations of a two-step moment method for mapping linked multiple QTL	GENETICAL RESEARCH			English	Article							QUANTITATIVE TRAIT LOCI; EM ALGORITHM	As an alternative to multiple-interval mapping a two-step moment method was recently proposed to map linked multiple quantitative trait loci (QTLs). The advantage of this moment method was supposed to be its simplicity and computational efficiency, especially in detecting closely linked QTLs within a marker bracket, but also in mapping QTLs in different marker intervals. Using simulations it is shown that the two-step moment method may give poor results compared with multiple-interval mapping, irrespective of whether the QTLs are in the same or in different marker intervals, especially if linked QTLs are in repulsion. The criteria of comparison are number of identified QTLs.. likelihood ratio test statistics, means and empirical standard errors of the QTL position and QTL effects estimates, and the accuracy of the residual variance estimates. Further, the joint conditional probabilities of QTL genotypes for two putative QTLs within a marker interval were derived and compared with the unmodified approach ignoring the non-independence of the conditional probabilities.

J	Revuelta, J				Revuelta, J			Estimating ability and item-selection strategy in self-adapted testing: A latent class approach	JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL STATISTICS			English	Article						EM algorithm; latent class modeling; missing at random; self-adapted testing	MISSING DATA; CHOICE; MODELS	This article presents a psychometric model for estimating ability and item-selection strategies in self-adapted testing. In contrast to computer adaptive testing, in self-adapted testing the examinees are allowed to select the difficulty of the items. The item-selection strategy is defined as the distribution of difficulty conditional on the responses given to previous items. The article shows that missing responses in self-adapted testing are missing at random and can be ignored in the estimation of ability. However, the item-selection strategy cannot always be ignored in such an estimation. An EM algorithm is presented to estimate an examinee's ability and strategies, and a model fit is evaluated using Akaike's information criterion. The article includes an application with real data to illustrate how the model can be used in practice for evaluating hypotheses, estimating ability, and identifying strategies. In the example, four strategies were identified and related to examinees' ability. It was shown that individual examinees tended not to follow a consistent strategy throughout the test.

More precisely, we propose ways of discovering groups of pupils sharing the same writing strategies during their primary education and methods for the temporal modeling of these pupils' writing strategies. For this purpose, online acquisition of writing and drawing tests have been performed three times during a period of one year for the same pupils under the same experimental conditions. A first approach, based on clustering, is applied to highlight clusters on a set of dynamic primitives chosen by an expert in the field of child development psychology. Results are presented by means of a comparative study between features of each group and writing tests. An analysis of within and between-strategies migration of pupils over time is also conducted to highlight pupils who change (or fail to change) their writing strategies during this period of one year. A second approach is used to model the problem by means of a probabilistic graphical model, i.e. a bayesian network. Expert knowledge partially determines the bayesian network structure, in which the writing strategy is represented by a hidden variable whose cardinality is estimated by the results of the clustering approach. By considering that each writing test is represented by its own (local) strategy and that there exists a global strategy which deals with each local strategy, we propose a Global Hierarchical Model. The results of our hierarchical model structured using real data highlight, among others, two global strategies that correspond to normo-writer pupils and more advanced normo-writers. A longitudinal and temporal study of the evolution of the pupils in these strategies shows that these two strategies are consistent.

The model is robust because it allows for the possibilities of false and multiple edges, and may be efficiently estimated using an expectation-maximization technique with a minimum description length metric. The direct applicability of the model for the sequential edge linking algorithm is investigated and shown to improve edge detection for low signal-to-noise ratio cases. (C) 2004 SPIE and IST.

It is hypothesized that changes in relative localization of the apoptosis imaging agent Tc-99m Annexin before and after the administration of chemotherapy may be useful as an early indicator of the success of therapy. The objective of this study was to determine the minimum relative change in tumor localization that could be confidently determined as an increased localization. A modified version of the Data Spectrum Anthropomorphic Torso phantom, in which four spheres could be positioned in the lung region, was filled with organ concentrations of Tc-99m representative of those observed in clinical imaging of Tc-99m Annexin. Five acquisitions of an initial sphere to lung concentration, and at concentrations of 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 times the initial concentration, were acquired at clinically realistic count levels. The acquisitions were reconstructed by filtered backprojection, ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) without attenuation compensation (AC), and OSEM with AC. Permutation methodology was used to create multiple region-of-interest count ratios from the five noise realizations at each concentration and between the elevated and initial concentrations. The resulting distributions were approximated by Gaussians, which were then used to estimate the likelihood of Type 1 and Type 2 Errors. It was determined that for the cases investigated, greater than a 20 % to 30 % or more increase was needed to confidently determine that an increase in localization had occurred depending on sphere size and reconstruction strategy.

Sex hormones are implicated in the pathogenesis of SNSA. Cytochrome P450c17a (CYP17) is a key regulator of androgen biosynthesis, and a single nucleotide polymorphism. (SNP) in the 5'-untranslated region of the CYP17 gene (CYP17), -34C > T, is associated with variety of diseases. We have investigated the association between the CYP17 SNP and SNSA in Japanese males. Genomic DNA was extracted from 149 Japanese male SNSA patients and 380 controls. The CYP17 SNP was genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Allelic and genotypic frequencies of the SNP were compared between SNSA patients and controls, and within SNSA patients. We also computed haplotype frequencies using an expectation-maximization algorithm, analyzed the difference between SNSA and control groups, and examined the potential association of other known SNPs in the CYP17 gene. The frequency of the -34T allele was significantly increased in HLA-B27-negative SNSA, but not in total or HLA-B27-positive SNSA when compared to controls. The T allele was more prevalent in HLA-B27-negative SNSA than in HLA-B27-positive SNSA, and the T/T genotype was over-represented in HLA-B27-negative SNSA. Haplotype analysis did not demonstrate more significant association. The CYP17 SNP is associated with SNSA in HLA-B27-negative Japanese males. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Conventional differential detection, the most prevalent and most basic approach. suffers from a loss in performance when compared to coherent detection. As an alternative, use of the sequence estimate provided by space-time multiple-symbol differential detection (ST-MSDD) to initialize an iterative receiver based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed. The EM algorithm performs joint channel estimation and sequence detection. Simulation results based on BPSK modulation show that the EM-based receiver outperforms standard ST-MSDD receivers after just three iterations. The results in the paper demonstrate that the proposed EM-based coherent receiver, using a noncoherent first pass, offers a reasonable performance improvement over standard noncoherent receivers.

A haplotype map (HapMap), aimed at describing these variation patterns across the entire genome, has been recently developed by the International HapMap Consortium. In this article, we present a novel statistical model for directly characterizing specific sequence variants that are responsible for disease risk based on the haplotype structure provided by HapMap. Our model is developed in the maximum-likelihood context implemented with the EM algorithm. We perform simulation studies to investigate the statistical properties of this disease-sequencing model. A worked example from a human obesity study with 155 patients was used to validate this model. In this example, we found that patients carrying a haplotype constituted by allele Gly16 at codon 16 and allele Gln27 at codon 27 genotyped within the beta2AR candidate gene display significantly lower body mass index than patients carrying the other haplotypes.

J	Kabaoglu, N; Cirpan, HA; Paker, S				Kabaoglu, N; Cirpan, HA; Paker, S			EM based Stochastic maximum likelihood approach for localization of near-field sources in 3-D	FREQUENZ			English	Article						maximum Likelihood estimation; expectation; maximization algorithm; antenna arrays; localization of near-field sources in 3-D space	PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; ARRAY GEOMETRIES; DOA ESTIMATION; SIGNALS; ESPRIT; ALGORITHM; AZIMUTH; MUSIC	The goal of this paper is to estimate the locations of unknown sources in 3-D space from the data collected by a 2-D rectangular array. Various studies employing different estimation methods under near-field and far-field assumptions were presented in the past. In most of the previous studies, location estimations of sources at the same plane with the antenna array were carried out by using algorithms having constraints for various situations indeed. In this study, location estimations of sources that are placed at a different plane from the antenna array is given. In other words, locations of sources in 3-D space is estimated by using a 2-D rectangular array. Maximum likelihood (ML) method is chosen as the estimator since it has a better resolution performance than the conventional methods in the presence of less number and highly correlated source signal samples and low signal to noise ratio. Besides these superiorities, stability, asymptotic unbiasedness, asymptotic minimum variance properties as well as no restrictions on the antenna array are motivated the application of ML approach. Despite these advantages, ML estimator has computational complexity. However, this problem is tackled by the application of Expectation/Maximization (EM) iterative algorithm which converts the multidimensional search problem to one dimensional parallel search problems in order to prevent computational complexity. EM iterative algorithm is therefore adapted to the localization problem by the data (complete data) assumed to arrive to the sensors separately instead of observed data (incomplete data). Furthermore, performance of the proposed algorithm is tested by deriving Cramer-Rao bounds based on the concentrated likelihood approach. Finally, the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by some numerical simulations.

That is, PFC is presumably interacted with superior temporal (ST) neuron in order to extract indicator component representing the whole view of face or object, by maximizing the expectant value where attention modulation can be taken into account for distinguishing different faces. The PFC-ST network indicates to compute the abstraction of face/object information based on the expectation maximization algorithm since the voluntary movements of facial viewpoints must play an important role of integrating spatial and temporal property.

In this paper, we propose a new method of correcting for the truncation of TCT. Methods The truncated parts of the TCT projection data are corrected using quadratic functions, based on the properties that the integral of non-truncated TCT projection data is constant at any projection angle and the position of the centre of gravity is focused on a fixed point. The usefulness of our method was investigated in phantom and human studies using a 3-detector SPECT equipped with one cardiac fan beam collimator for TCT and two parallel beam collimators for SPECT. We used (TI)-T-201 as a tracer for SPECT and Tc-99m as an external source for TCT. Results The phantom and human studies showed that our method can adequately correct for the truncation of TCT data acquired using a fan beam collimator in a 3-detector SPECT, as long as there is no truncation in SPECT data. Conclusion Our method appears to be useful for improving the SPECT images obtained using simultaneous TCT/ SPECT acquisition in a 3-detector SPECT. However, further studies will be necessary to establish the clinical usefulness of this method. (C) 2004 Lippincott Williams Wilkins.

J	Hayashi, T				Hayashi, T			A discrete-time model of high-frequency stock returns	QUANTITATIVE FINANCE			English	Article							HIDDEN MARKOV-MODELS; SWITCHING MODELS; VOLATILITY; SERIES; REGIME	A model of intraday financial time series is developed. The model is a dynamic factor model consisting of two equations. First, a rate of return of a 'stock' in a single day is assumed to be generated by several common factors plus some additive error ('intraday equation'). Secondly, the joint distribution of those common factors is assumed to depend on the hidden state of the day, which fluctuates according to a Markov chain ('day-by-day equation'). Together the equations compose a hidden Markov model. We investigate properties of the model. Among them is a central limit theorem for cumulative returns, which agrees with the well-known empirical phenomenon in the stock markets that the distributions of longer-horizon returns are closer to the normal. We propose a two-step procedure consisting of the method of principal components and the EM algorithm to estimate the model parameters as well as the unobservable states. In addition, we propose a procedure for predicting intraday returns. Finally, the model is fitted to empirical data, the Standard&Poors 500 Index 5 min return data, to see if the model is capable of describing intraday movements of the index.

But in the heavy cluttered environment, there exists so called "incomplete data problem", due to the unknown state of the target and the sequence of measurements which originate from the target. Because the EM algorithm is an efficient means to solve the "incomplete data problem", a fast track initiation and termination approach applicable to engineering is presented, which combines the Sequential probabilistic ratio test (SPRT) with recursive Expectation maximization (EM). Here, track initiation and termination is modeled as a hypothesis testing problem. And aiming at the computational difficulty of the likelihood function due to the unknown target state and the sequence of measurements which originate from the target, the recursive EM-based formula of likelihood function is introduced. It gives an efficient solution to track initiation and termination by processing the measurement data sequentially, and its recursive form can meet the real-time demand.

J	Shojima, K; Toyoda, H				Shojima, K; Toyoda, H			Item parameter estimation when a test contains different item response models	JAPANESE JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY			Japanese	Article						item response theory; 3-parameter logistic model; graded response model; continuous response model; EM algorithm	EM ALGORITHM; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD	In Japan, tests typically consist of true-false questions, testlets, and essay questions. A dichotomous response model is most suitable for true-false questions; a graded response model (GRM) or a generalized partial credit model (GPCM), for testlets; and a continuous response model (CRM), for essay questions. When tests contain more than one type of question, these differences make it necessary to use the applicable item response model in order to estimate item parameters. In the present research, we propose an estimation method for such tests, and use actual data to show how it is a applied. The discussion describes practical applications of this method.

In this paper, two parameter estimation methods of nearly 1/f processes based on wavelets are proposed. The conventional method based on wavelet transform with EM algorithm does not give the reliable parameter estimation value when the data length is short. Moreover, the precise parameter value is not estimated when the spectrum gap exists in 1/f processes. First, in order to improve the accuracy of the estimation when the data length is short, a parameter estimation method based on wavelet transform with complementary sampling is proposed. Next, in order to reduce the effect of spectrum gap, a parameter estimation method based on wavelet packet with EM algorithm is proposed. Simulation results are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

In contrast, in emission tomography, there are two known families of convergent OS algorithms: methods that use relaxation parameters (Ahn and Fessler, 2003), and methods based on the incremental expectation maximization (EM) approach (Hsiao et al., 2002). This paper generalizes the incremental EM approach by introducing a general framework that we call "incremental optimization transfer." Like incremental EM methods, the proposed algorithms accelerate convergence speeds and ensure global convergence (to a stationary point) under mild regularity conditions without requiring inconvenient relaxation parameters. The general optimization transfer framework enables the use of a very broad family of non-EM surrogate functions. In particular, this paper provides the first convergent OS-type algorithm for transmission tomography. The general approach is applicable to both monoenergetic and polyenergetic transmission scans as well as to other image reconstruction problems. We propose a particular incremental optimization transfer method for (nonconcave) penalized-likelihood (PL) transmission image reconstruction by using separable paraboloidal surrogates (SPS). Results show that the new "transmission incremental optimization transfer (TRIOT)" algorithm is faster than nonincremental ordinary SPS and even OS-SPS yet is convergent.

The shapes axe represented using both geometrical and a symbolic primitives, that are encapsulated in a two layer hierarchical architecture. Each primitive is modelled so as to allow a degree of articulated freedom using a polar point distribution model that captures how the primitive movement varies over a training set. Each segment is assigned a symbolic label to distinguish its identity, and the overall shape is represented by a configuration of labels. We demonstrate how both the point-distribution model and the symbolic labels can be combined to perform recognition using a probabilistic hierarchical algorithm. This involves recovering the parameters of the point distribution model that minimise an alignment error, and recovering symbol configurations that minimise a structural error. We apply the recognition method to human pose recognition.

The new approach is based on global texture analysis, using high order statistic features, Gaussian classifier and a stochastic version of the EM algorithm. The font recognition is performed by taking the document as a simple image, where one or several types of fonts are present. The identification is not performed letter by letter as with conventional approaches. In the proposed method a window analysis is employed to obtain the features of the document, using fourth and third order moments. The new technique does not involve a study of local typography; therefore, it is content independent. A detailed study was performed with 8 types of fonts commonly used in the Spanish language. Each type of font can have four styles that lead, to 32 font combinations. The font recognition with clean images is 100% accurate.

The two 3-D image reconstruction algorithms were ordered subsets expectation maximization (3D-OSEM) and 3-D reprojection (3DRP). The two rebinning algorithms were Fourier rebinning (FORE) and single slice rebinning (SSRB). The 3-D projection data used for this work were acquired with a high-resolution PET scanner (MDAPET) with an intrinsic transaxial resolution of 2.8 mm. The scanner has 14 detector rings covering an axial field-of-view of 38.5 mm. We scanned three phantoms: (1) a uniform cylindrical phantom with inner diameter of 20.5 cm, (2) a 11.5 cm cylindrical phantom with four embedded small lesions with diameters of 3, 4, 5, and 6 mm, and (3) the 3-D Hoffman brain phantom with three embedded small lesion phantoms with diameters of 3, 5, and 8.6 mm. We evaluated the different reconstruction methods by comparing the noise variance of images, contrast recovery and contrast-noise trade-off, lesion detectability, and by visually inspecting images. We found that overall the 3D-OSEM algorithm followed by post filtering produced the best results. Even though the MDAPET camera has a relatively small maximum axial acceptance (+/-5 deg), the 3DRP algorithm produced slightly better images compared to the faster 2-D rebinning methods.

In practice, channel coding is needed in conjunction with this quantization- based scheme in order to approach the achievable rate limit. The most powerful coding methods use iterative decoding (turbo codes, LDPC), but they require knowledge of the channel model. Previous works on the subject have assumed the latter to be known by the decoder. We investigate here the possibility of undertaking blind iterative decoding, of DC-DM. using maximum likelihood estimation of the channel model within the decoding procedure. The unknown attack is assumed to be i.i.d. and additive. Before each iterative decoding step, a new optimal estimation of the attack model is made using the reliability information provided by the previous step. This new model is used for the next iterative decoding stage, and the procedure is repeated until convergence. We show that the iterative Expectation-Maximization algorithm is suitable for solving the problem posed by model estimation, as it can be conveniently intertwined with iterative decoding.

We approach the difficulty of computing the mutual information for noisy channels by using a variational approximation. The resulting IM algorithm is analagous to the EM algorithm, yet maximises mutual information, as opposed to likelihood. We apply the method to several practical examples, including linear compression, population encoding and CDMA.

J	Bee, M				Bee, M			Testing for redundancy in normal mixture analysis	COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						likelihood ratio test; mahalanobis distance; mixture of regressions; bootstrap	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; EM ALGORITHM	In this paper we deal with the problem of testing for redundancy of variables in a mixture of two p-variate normal populations. If the investigator is only interested in estimation of the parameters of the first q variables, the last p - q variables are said to be redundant when they can be safely discarded, i.e., when they carry no additional information about the parameters of interest. The main contribution of this work consists in finding the likelihood ratio test for this hypothesis. In general, the distribution of the test is nonstandard, so that bootstrap methods are employed to analyze its properties; as an illustration, the techniques are applied to a real-data problem in the field of quality control. However in a specific case, namely when the Mahalanobis distance is large, the usual chi(2) asymptotic approximation is appropriate; thus we study, by means of a simulation experiment, the relationship between the Mahalanobis distance and the limiting distribution of the test.

This method is based oil the Stochastic version of the Expectation Maximization (SEM) algorithm. Parameters of this mixture model are herein used to constrain the 3D reconstruction problem of scoliotic rib cage from a pair of planar and conventional calibrated radiographic images (postero-anterior with normal incidence (I-PA) and lateral (I-LAT)). More precisely, the proposed PPCA mixture model is herein robustly exploited for dimensionality reduction and to act a set of probabilistic prior models associated to each detected class of pathological deformations observed oil a representative training scoliotic rib cage population. By using all appropriate likelihood and for each considered class-conditional prior model. the proposed 3D reconstruction is stated as an energy function minimization problem. which is solved with a stochastic optimization algorithm. The optimal 3D reconstruction then Corresponds to the class of deformation and parameters leading,, to the minimal energy. This 3D method of reconstruction has been successfully tested oil several biplanar radiographic images. yielding very promising results.

It has been observed that the algorithms designed for Gaussian noise typically perform poor in presence of non-Gaussian noise. This paper discusses an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm using kernel density estimates to improve channel estimation in non-Gaussian noise environment. As a well known fact, expectation followed by maximization performed iteratively converges to local maxima for Gaussian mixtures. The noise probability density is assumed unknown at the receiver and is estimated by using kernel density estimator. Thereby combining EM with kernel density estimate provides a robust channel estimator for various non-Gaussian noise environments. The simulations for impulsive noise and cochannel interference with Gaussian noise confirms that a better estimate can he obtained by using the proposed technique as compared to the traditional least squares algorithm, which is considered optimal in the Gaussian noise environments.

One way of controlling the smoothing is to introduce, during the reconstruction process, a prior knowledge about the slice anatomy. In a previous work, we showed using numerical observers that anatomical priors can improve lesion detection accuracy in simulated Ga-67 images of the chest. The goal of this work is to expand and enhance our previous investigations by conducting human-observer localization receiver observer characteristics (LROC) studies and to compare the results to those of a multiclass channelized non-prewhitening (CNPW) model observer. Phantom images were created using the SIMIND Monte Carlo simulation software from the MCAT phantom. The lesion: background contrast was 27.5:1. The anatomical data employed were the structure boundaries from the original, noisefree slices of the MCAT phantom. Images were reconstructed using the DePierro MAP algorithm with surrogate functions. Images were also reconstructed with no priors using the RBI-EM algorithm, with 4 iterations and 4 projections per subset. Two weights (0.005 and 0.04) for the prior were tested. The following reconstruction scheme was used to reach convergence for the anatomical priors: The 120 projections were reconstructed successively with 4, 8, 24, 60, and 120 projections per subset with 1, 1, 1, 1, and finally 50 iterations respectively; the result of each reconstruction was used as an initial estimate for the next reconstruction.

In contrast to known approaches, the algorithm first generates a discretized representation of the observed data and then performs the fitting. In this way the algorithm is more efficient than other known EM-type methods. By an appropriate discretization, the main part as well as the tail of the distribution can be approximated sufficiently accurate.

The expectation maximization maximum likelihood (EMML) method as it occurs in emission tomography and the simultaneous multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique (SMART) are slow to converge on large data sets; accelerating convergence through the use of block-iterative or ordered subset versions of these algorithms is a topic of considerable interest. These block-iterative versions involve relaxation and normalization parameters the correct selection of which may not be obvious to all users. The algorithms are not faster merely by virtue of being block-iterative; the correct choice of the parameters is crucial. Through a detailed discussion of the theoretical foundations of these methods we come to a better understanding of the precise roles these parameters play.

The UWB propagation study and associated channel modelling of [1] suggest clustering occurs in both space and time for indoor wireless office/laboratory environments. Motivated by this study, a two-stage channel estimation scheme is proposed. First, coarse channel estimation is conducted to estimate the nominal location and dispersion of a cluster. Then, channel estimation efforts are concentrated around the nominal parameters to reduce the dimensionality of the estimation of the parameters associated with the different multipath components. Different strategies based on maximum-likelihood, least squares and expectation maximization are presented and compared in terms of estimation accuracy and complexity. The bit error rate of a Rake type receiver is simulated with the estimated channel parameters for a clustered multipath scenario.

Genotyping every individual is expensive, and techniques involving pooled DNA samples have been suggested. This strategy involves an inherent information loss because of pooling. Furthermore, the methods proposed so far do not make use of all the information contained in the pooled sample. In this work, we introduce a novel approach based on the Monte Carlo EM algorithm. An example is developed with half-sib families, an experimental design where DNA pooling is especially suited.

From a Bayesian point of view, classification should be done by integrating over the posterior distribution for the model parameters (including the number of components in the mixture) given previous observations. Although it is relatively easy to compute the value of the joint probability density of the observed data and a particular choice of model parameters, it is usually difficult to integrate over the whole distribution because of the high dimensionality of the parameter space. Most current methods using mixture models settle for finding a mode of the posterior distribution using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. But, much more can be learned about the posterior distribution. We explore the multi-state MCMC methods introduced by Skilling and show how these methods can be applied to Gaussian mixture models. In addition, we examine genetic algorithms, which are most often used as optimization algorithms. We show how these algorithms can be adapted to act as multi-state MCMC algorithms, as suggested by MacKay.

All of these applications share a common generative model, which describes how each observation is produced. By constraining the model parameters in different ways, we can support each of these applications. ICA requires the most restricted model, BSS employs a less restricted model, and PC uses the least restricted model. Thus, in a sense, the PC model contains the BSS model, which in turn contains the ICA model, The relationships between these methods provide important synergies which can be exploited to both speed training and to extend the applicability of the methods.

A fading channel is said to be mixed mode if the first path gain is Ricean distributed and the other path gains are Rayleigh. The proposed detection technique provides a non-exhaustive approach to achieve close to optimal performance by iteratively finding the maximum Likelihood (ML) estimate using symbol-by-symbol maximizations. It is shown that the EM-based scheme that uses a decorrelation matrix, yields diversity-like gains in case of BPSK or 4QAM DS-CDMA signaling for various spreading gains even if the multipath is unresolved and the channel is highly correlated and only known statistically. But, the performance of the EM algorithm may depend on the spreading codes, especially for small spreading gains, and in particular is better for spreading codes with a low correlation at the channel interpath delays. Comparison with Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) schemes that assume instantaneous knowledge of the channel, showed the superiority of the EM-based structure over one Single-sided tapped delay line MMSE (KS-MMSE) scheme and its very close performance to a Double-sided tapped delay line MMSE approach (KD-MMSE) although the EM-based structure does not know the channel.

In this study, the Gaussian, Poisson and gamma distributions are investigated to characterize duration models. The maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of gamma duration model is developed. To exploit the sequential learning, we adopt the Poisson duration model incorporated with gamma prior density, which belongs to the conjugate prior family. When the adaptation data are sequentially observed, the gamma posterior density is produced for twofold advantages. One is to determine the optimal quasi-Bayes (QB) duration parameter, which can be merged in HMM's for speech recognition. The other one is to build the updating mechanism of gamma prior statistics for sequential learning. EM algorithm is applied to fulfill parameter estimation. In the experiments, the proposed Bayesian approaches significantly improve the speech recognition performance of Mandarin broadcast news. The batch and sequential learning are investigated for MAP and QB duration models, respectively.

The algorithm requires a convenient representation of the discrete multipath fading channel based on the Karhunen-Loeve orthogonal expansion and estimates the complex channel parameters of each subcarriers iteratively using the Expectation Maximization(EM) method. In order to explore the performance, the closed-form expression for the average symbol error rate (SER) probability is derived for the zero-forcing equalizer. Furthermore, the MAP channel estimator's performance is studied based on the evaluation of the modified Cramer-Rao bound. Simulation results confirm our theoretical analysis, and illustrate that the proposed algorithm is capable of tracking fast fading and improving overall performance.

We describe a distributed algorithm for the evaluation of the average causal effect of treatment reception upon response. Our procedure applies the expectation-maximization algorithm across a graphical model of the system, using local message-passing techniques. The key collaborative step in the algorithm is simple message aggregation and averaging, which we perform over a tree network topology. Finally, for completeness purposes, we describe a simple framework for the construction and maintenance of the tree topology that provides a robust mechanism for executing the algorithm using spread-spectrum or ultra-wideband communication.

This widely used method suffers from two important drawbacks, namely it cannot estimate the true number of mixing components, and depends strongly on the initial parameter values. The Greedy EM algorithm is a recently proposed algorithm that tries to overcome these drawbacks for the density estimation task. The direct application of this method for the classification task is obvious, as long as we are interested in typical mixture models. In this work we propose a greedy learning method adapted for a generalized mixture model (called the Probabilistic RBF network) with the particular characteristic that it allows the sharing of the mixture components among all classes, in contrast to the convetional model that suggests mixture components describing only one class. The proposed algorithm starts with a single component and adds components sequentially, using a combination of global and local search. The addition of the new component is based on criteria for detecting a region in the data space that is crucial for the classification task. Experimental results using several well-known classification datasets indicate that the greedy method provides solutions of superior classification performance.

Two Landsat TM registered and corrected multi-spectral images, acquired on the same geographical area on 18 May 1996 and 21 May 1997, have been used. In the first comparison technique, for each pair of corresponding pixels, the spectral change vector has been computed its the squared difference in the features vectors at the two times. In the second method, the difference image hits been computed using, pixel by pixel, a chi square transformation. The third technique is based on the application of it Self-Organizing Map (SOM) neural network to clusterize the two mages before comparison. The three obtained difference images has been then analyzed by using it fully automatic thresholding method exploiting the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The experimental results obtained for the three difference images are comparable, showing it reliable robustness of the unsupervised approach, and only few change are detected on the analyzed scene. Moreover, the experimental results have been compared with a change detection I using a supervised technique, obtaining a good map computed by agreement between unsupervised and supervised results that confirms the reliability of the considered approach. The encouraging obtained results allow to use the so-computed percentage value of changes as probability of class transitions in input to a Bayesian supervised change detection method, as presented in a companion paper by the same authors. In this frame-work, the unsupervised approach may be used to support supervised techniques, providing land cover transitions that can be used as guess values.

While some of them are ad-hoc, others are derived in a systematic way. The latter can be divided into two different classes: phase estimators derived from the expectation-maximization (EM) principle and estimators that are approximations of the sum-product message passing algorithm. In this paper, the main differences and similarities between these two classes of phase estimation algorithms are outlined and their performance and complexity is compared. Furthermore, an alternative criterion for phase ambiguity resolution is presented and compared to an EM based approach proposed earlier.

In this research, images containing either ice and water or multiple ice classes are segmented. This paper proposes to use the image intensity to discriminate ice from water and to use texture features to separate different ice types. In order to seamlessly combine spatial relationship information in an ice image with various image features, a novel Bayesian segmentation approach is developed. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to segment both types of sea ice images and achieves an improvement over the standard MRF (Markov random field) based method, the finite Gamma mixture model and the K-means clustering method.

The scatter is included in the statistical model as an additive term and attenuation and detector response are included in the forward/backprojector. In the present implementation of MCS, a simple multiple window-based estimate is used for the initial iterations and in the later iterations the Monte Carlo estimate is used for several iterations before it is updated. For I-131, MCS was evaluated and compared with triple energy window (TEW) scatter compensation using simulation studies of a mathematical phantom and a clinically realistic voxel-phantom. Even after just two Monte Carlo runs, excellent agreement was found between the MCS estimate and the true scatter distribution. Accuracy and noise of the reconstructed images were superior with MCS compared to TEW. However, the improvement was not large, and in some cases may not justify the large computational requirements of MCS.

We develop an iterative blind calibration technique for such converters. In particular, an Expectation-Maximize (EM) algorithm is used to estimate the associated unknown gains and time-offsets, from which the calibrated signal is recontructed. Tradeoffs between the calibration time, reconstruction quality, and the oversampling factor are developed. The proposed algorithm can also be used in a variety of other applications, including problems of distributed sampling in sensor networks.

The direct application of the EM algorithm to a data set following designed experiments such as randomized. block designs, or factorial experiments, with missing observations may lead to the estimation of parametric functions that are not estimable. In this paper we present an adjustment of the EM algorithm for additive classification models that prevents the user from obtaining results which are not reliable. The adjustment consists in applying the R-process introduced by Birkes, Dodge and Seely (1976), that determines which are the estimable parametric functions. The observations and the parameters are then partitioned in a suitable way, and the maximum likelihood estimates for the estimable parametric functions are derived applying EM to each partition. The proposed algorithm is called REM; several numerical examples and one application are presented.

Recent results for video watermarking have pointed out that existing watermarking schemes were not secure i.e. hostile intelligence succeeds in removing the hidden watermarks. In particular, for a given secret key, many watermarking schemes embed watermarks which lie in the same low-dimensional subspace whatever the host data is. In this article, it will be shown that this subspace can be quite easily estimated with an efficient Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For storage convenience, an online Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm will be considered. Once this watermarking subspace has been estimated, an attacker only has to project incoming data onto the orthogonal of this subspace to remove the watermark.

An approach to learn concepts is by estimating mixture model for image databases using EM algorithm; however, this approach is impractical to be implemented for large databases due to the high dimensionality of the feature space. Based on the over-splitting nature of our EM algorithm and the Bayesian analysis of the multiple users' labelling information derived from their relevance feedbacks, we propose a probabilistic MDA to find the discriminating features, and integrate it with the EM framework. The experimental results on Corel images show the effectiveness of concept learning with the probabilistic MDA, and the improvement of the retrieval performance.

In contrast, recently proposed K-Harmonic Means (KHM) algorithm is more robust to the randomness of the initialization. However, KHM works best when the dimensionality of the data (N) is small (usually less than 8). Because the dimensionality of features that are used for many clustering problems in image/video and speech processing is large, the benefits of KHM cannot be exploited. Based upon this observation, this paper proposes a novel method to employ KHM for high-dimensional data so as to realize initialization-independent clustering. The proposed method employs efficient spectral clustering techniques whereby the affinity matrix of the data is decomposed into its eigenvectors and k (total number of clusters) eigenvectors corresponding to the k largest eigenvalues are retained. That is, we represent N-D data by k-D transformed data when k < N and propose to employ KHM over this k-D transformed data. The assumption of k < N indeed encompasses a large number of significant video processing and computer vision problems where the use of KHM was not beneficial before. We demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed algorithm for face clustering in the domains where the number of persons (k) is not large, such as anchorperson grouping, video-based speaker clustering in videoconferencing, and identity-based tracking in small office environments.

If the uptake rate is sufficient, these streaks may he significant enough to impair lesion detection. We have investigated various reconstruction methods in an effort to reduce this artifact. Pelvic SPECT imaging was simulated using the Zubal voxelized phantom, with provisions for a changing activity distribution within the bladder. Reconstructions were performed using filtered backprojection, ordered subset-expectation maximization and dynamic expectation maximization. Each method was first optimized for post-reconstruction smoothing parameters using a channelized, non-prewhitening (CNPW) numerical observer model. The numerical observer used is based on human observer LROC methodology whereby both a likely lesion location and a confidence rating is supplied by the observer for each image. Based on the results of the CNPW observer, a human LROC observer study was performed in order to assess the various reconstruction methods in terms of lesion detectability. Three human observers were used in this test. The results of this test indicate that filtered backprojection performs significantly worse than static OSEM iterative reconstruction with attenuation correction when assessed using the area under the LROC curve (A(LROC) = 0.47 vs 0.71). Results comparing OSEM with dEM indicate that the dEM algorithm is able to further reduce streak artifacts compared to OSEM, but this improvement was not reflected in improved ALROC scores. In fact, detectability actually decreased slightly when using dEM (A(LROC) = 0.71 vs 0.66), although this reduction was not seen to be statistically significant. It is possible that the slightly reduced performance of the dEM algorithm may be due, in part, to not performing an optimization in the number of reconstruction iterations as was performed for the OSEM method.

The goal is to segment multiple moving objects in the image based on their relative motion. This task can be complicated by the presence of lighting variations. Furthermore, a combination of multiple motions and complex lighting effects can lead to dramatic image variations that may not be adequately accounted for by a single motion-based segmentation algorithm. We propose to fuse the results of multiple motion segmentation algorithins to improve the system robustness. Our approach uses the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm as a fusion engine. It also uses Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to perform dimensionality reduction to improve the performance of the EM algorithm and reduce the proccessing burden. The performance of the proposed fusion algorithin has been demonstrated in the "smart airbag" application of monitoring occupants in a moving-antomobile to determine if they are too close to the instrument panel (airbag). Through fusion of the outputs of multiple algorithms we are able to reduce the percentage of pixels missed on the target by 35 %.

In this paper, we propose a novel 3D-RA vascular segmentation algorithm, which is fully automatic and very computationally efficient, based on the maximum intensity projections (MEP) of 3D-RA images. Validation results on 13 clinical 3D-RA datasets reveal that, according to the agreement between the segmentation results and the ground truth, our method (a) outperforms both the Maximum a posteriori-expectation maximization (MAP-EM)-based method and the MAP-Markov random field (MAP-MRF)-based segmentation method, and (b) works comparably to the optimal global thresholding method. Experimental results also show that our method can successfully segment major vascular structures in 3D-RA and produce a lower false positive rate than that of the MAP-EM-based and MAP-MRF-based methods.

This paper extends our prior work on vascular segmentation method for 3D-RA, which is based on maximum intensity projections (MIP). The method is fully automatic and computationally efficient. Experimental results on 12 3D-RA clinical data sets indicate that our method can produce segmentations of major vessels in the data sets, which are the current radiologists' primary interest in this work. Moreover, the segmentations obtained by our method exhibit a high degree of agreement to the ground truth segmentations and are comparable to those produced by the optimal global thresholding method.

This situation can arise in real world applications where the speech signal is being transmitted over an error prone channel where parts of the signal can be dropped. Typical speech systems based on Hidden Markov Models, cannot handle such data since HMMs rely on the assumption that observations are complete and made at regular intervals. In this paper we introduce the asynchronous HMM, a variant of the inhomogenous HMM commonly used in Bioinformatics, and show how it can be used to model irregularly or incompletely sampled data. A nested EM algorithm is presented in brief which can be used to learn the parameters of this asynchronous HMM. Evaluation on real world speech data that has been modified to simulate channel errors, shows that this model and its variants significantly outperforms the standard HMM and methods based on data interpolation.

The task was detection of Ga-67 tumors within the MCAT phantom. Projection data for the 93- and 185-keV gallium emissions were generated with an analytic projector modeling nonuniform attenuation and collimator response. The observer studies evaluated four reconstruction strategies: the filtered-backprojection (FBP) and ordered-subset expectation-maximization (OSEM) algorithms with 2D and 3D postfiltering. Attenuation correction was performed for all strategies. Two image-display formats were used in the studies. One was a single-slice format, with which the observer scored an image based on that image alone. The second was a multislice format presenting a central slice and 4 neighboring slices that were to be used to score the central slice. The human-observer data was drawn from studies performed by Wells et al. [TNS, 2000]. Multiclass versions of the nonprewhitening (NPW), channelized nonprewhitening (CNPW), and channelized Hotelling (CH) observers, capable of performing the tumor search task, were applied. The channelized observers were tested with 3 square profile channel models that were defined by the low-frequency cut-off rho(0). With either display format, the best agreement with the human-observer performance trends was had with the CH observer with rho(0) = 0.015 pixel(-1). However, quantitative agreement with the human performances will require incorporation of an internal-noise model.

FREERIDE is based upon the observation that the processing structure of a large number of data mining algorithms involves generalized reductions. FREERIDE offers a high-level interface and support both distributed memory and shared memory parallelization, besides efficient execution on disk-resident datasets. We show how the main processing loops in both the E and M steps of the EM algorithm essentially involve a generalized reduction, and therefore, the algorithm can be parallelized using FREERIDE.

In this paper, we present a novel partially supervised classification technique that faces this interesting practical and methodological problem. We have adopted a two-stage classification scheme based on an unsupervised approach, which allows us to introduce supervised information about the class of interest without an additional sample labeling. The first stage of the process consists in an initial clustering of the image using the Self-Organizing Map algorithm. The second stage consists in a partially supervised hierarchical joint of clusters. We modify the employed criterion of similarity by introducing fuzzy membership functions that make use of the supervised information. The method is tested on urban monitoring, where the objective is to produce an automatic classification of 'Urban/Non-Urban' by using optical and radar data (Landsat TM and 35-days interferometric pairs of ERS2 SAR). We compare classification accuracy of the proposed method to its parametric version, which uses the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. The good performance confirms the validity of the proposed approach: 90% classification accuracy using supervised information only in the coherence map.

It is based on applying the Maximum Likelihood (ML) principle not only over a known training sequence, but also over the unknown symbols. Performing the so-called Turbo equalization at reception we can obtain very accurate estimations of the a posteriori probabilities of these unknown symbols. These probabilities play a key role in the computation of the ML channel estimator. We also show how the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm can be used to solve the resulting channel estimation optimization problem. As a practical application we study how much can the training sequence length be reduced in a GSM system operating in subway environments.

Our goal is to study this behavior using the finite element method on serial sections of normal and glaucomatous monkey ONHs. Segmentation of the beam-like connective tissue of the ONH is particularly challenging due to the artifacts introduced in the acquisition procedure. We present a new algorithm for segmentation of beam-like structures, based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) method. The main difference with previous EM-based segmentation algorithms is that we employ an anisotropic Markov Random Field, which incorporates preferred directions based on the underlying image structure and coherence. Results on synthetic and ONH images show the ability of the algorithm to accurately segment these structures in presence of significant artifacts, and suggest its suitability to other medical imaging segmentation tasks.

We treat the frames in a sequence collectively as a single function of both space and time, and define a temporal prior to account for the temporal correlations in a sequence. This temporal prior is defined in a form of motion-compensation, aimed to follow the curved trajectories of the object motion through space-time. The image frames are then obtained through estimation using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed algorithm was evaluated using the 4D gated mathematical cardiac-torso (gMCAT) D1.01 phantom to simulate gated SPECT perfusion imaging with Tc99m. Our experimental results demonstrate that the use of motion compensation for reconstruction can lead to significant improvement in image quality and reconstruction accuracy.

The system is equipped with two detector heads, each consisting of a multi-anode photomultiplier tube coupled to a pixellated NaI(TI) crystal array. Images are reconstructed using an OS-EM algorithm. In this paper, we describe the associated volumetric system models that we have developed in support of both pinhole and parallel hole collimation. These models, which are precomputed and stored to disk prior to reconstruction, are based on simple inner-product computations and a region-growing like search defined by the conic view that each detector pixel has of the image voxels. We provide illustrative experimental results based on phantom and mouse data.	Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA	Gregor, J (reprint author), Univ Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.

A Monte-Carlo simulator was used to generate 2D PET list-mode data set acquisitions of a disk object. One of these list-mode sets was then used to create an ensemble of bootstrap list-mode sets. A randomly positioned signal (lesion) was introduced into half of the list-mode sets to create an ensemble of signal-present and signal-absent list-mode sets. These sets were then reconstructed using the OSEM list-mode algorithm. The CHO was computed from the ensemble of reconstructed images generated from the bootstrap data sets as well as from independent noisy data sets. The F-test and the student t-test found no significant difference (confidence level 5%) in the areas under the LROC curve generated using the independent noisy list-mode sets and the bootstrap list-mode sets for clinical count levels. It is also shown how bootstrap images can be used to implement a patient-specific, CHO-based stopping-rule criterion for ordered-subset expectation-maximization (OSEM) list-mode iterative reconstruction. An example of applying the CHO-based stopping-rule criterion for list-mode reconstruction of the MCAT phantom showed an optimal detectability index at iterations 7 using 2 subsets respectively. Results from this study suggest that the bootstrap approach can be used to conduct numerical observer studies with more realistic backgrounds by generating them from a patient study (with the introduction of simulated lesions), and allows the possibility of applying a patient-specific, CHO-based stopping-rule criterion for list-mode iterative reconstruction.

Under simplified camera models, the problem reduces to factorizing a measurement matrix into the product of two low rank matrices. Each element of the measurement matrix contains the position of a point in a particular image. When all elements are observed, the problem can be solved trivially using SVD, but in any realistic situation many elements of the matrix are missing and the ones that are observed have a, different directional uncertainty. Under these conditions, most existing factorization algorithms fail while human perception is relatively unchanged. In this paper we use the well known EM algorithm for factor analysis to perform factorization. This allows us to easily handle missing data and measurement uncertainty and more importantly allows us to place a prior on the temporal trajectory of the latent variables (the camera position). We show that incorporating this prior gives a significant improvement in performance in challenging image sequences.

Estimates of the path delay and the complex gain are updated jointly by combining the training sequence and the soft information provided by the MAP channel decoder. Initial estimates may be obtained through either a Data Aided or a Non Data Aided algorithm. We show through computer simulation that the iterative process between turbo detection and estimation leads to performances close to those obtained for Perfect Channel State Information in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER). On the other hand, the Mean Square Estimation Errors (MSEE) of path delay and the complex gain reach the classical Modified Cramer-Rao Bound. Comparisons with conventional estimation schemes are carried out.

This generalized decoder is applied to the problem of blind turbo equalization. Blind channel identification is formulated as an expectation maximization problem. The solution depends on first and second order statistics of the transmitted code bits. Marginal and pairwise joint probabilities computed by the generalized LDPC decoder are used to evaluate the first and second order statistics for channel identification. Channel estimates are used by a MAP equalizer. Information is exchanged between the MAP equalizer and the LDPC decoder in a turbo fashion. After each turbo iteration, the channel is re-estimated. Simulation results compare blind turbo equalization with channel informed turbo equalization.

However, these measurements need to be interpreted and processed to output performance metrics. Such parameters must summarise, describe and display performance conclusions about actual network activity in an understandable form. This can result in the provision of meaningful information to address applications in fault and performance management, hence providing input to network provisioning, traffic engineering and performance prediction activities. In this work we aim to produce a simple model to characterise network delay measurements using a combination of Weibull distributions, with all the aforementioned benefits. The parameters describing such model can be optimally found using a simple recursive procedure based on the Expectation-Maximisation algorithm. In addition, we present a self-sufficient procedure to implement our model and a large set of matching results to real GPS synchronised measurements taken across the Internet.

We propose a linear timing estimator which takes benefit from the soft information delivered by the turbo system at each iteration to compute the timing estimate. This estimator is then compared to a synchronizer based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm [1]. Performance of the proposed synchronizer is illustrated by simulation results and proves better than that of the EM-based counterpart regarding both the convergence speed and range.

It is a promising technique that can increase the throughput of adaptive modulation systems such as IEEE 802.11 and HIPERILAN systems. While a variety of approaches have been proposed for modulation classification, most of them rely on the unrealistic assumption that the channel is additive white Gaussian noise channel. This paper presents an algorithm using hybrid likelihood ratio test for BPSK and QPSK classification in multipath fading environment The unknown channel coefficients are first estimated blindly using the EM algorithm. The estimates are then used in likelihood ratio test for classification. Simulations show that the proposed classifier has high accuracy and is superior to the classifier that does not take the channel distortion into account. An added advantage of the proposed algorithm is that the maximum likelihood estimate of the channel coefficients can be used in equalization and data demodulation.

Here we extend the ECOSEM algorithm to an maximum a posteriori (MAP) reconstruction by including a smoothing separable surrogate prior, and this new MAP algorithm is called ECOSEM-MAP. The ECOSEM-MAP reconstruction is founded on an incremental EM approach and one can show that the ECOSEM-MAP converges to the MAP solution. Other related MAP algorithms, including BSREM and OS-SPS algorithms, are fast and convergent, but require a judicious choice of a user-specified relaxation schedule. ECOSEM-MAP itself uses a sequence of iteration-dependent parameters (very roughly similar to relaxation parameters) to control a tradeoff between a greedy, fast but non-convergent update and a slower but convergent update. These parameters, however, are computed automatically at each iteration and require no user specification. Our simulations show that ECOSEM-MAP is nearly as fast as BSREM.

The new framework enables us to concisely model the statistical dependencies and nonGaussian statistics encountered in real-world signals, and enables us to get a more reliable and local model using blocks. Wavelet Packet HMMs are designed with the intrinsic properties of wavelet transform and provide powerful yet tractable probabilistic signal models. In this paper, we propose a novel wavelet domain HMM using blocks to strike a delicate balance between improving spatial adaptability of contextual HMM (CHMM) and modeling a more reliable HMM. Each wavelet coefficient is modeled as a Gaussian mixture model, and the dependencies among wavelet coefficients in each subband are described by a context structure, then the structure is modified by, blocks which are connected areas in a scale conditioned on the same context. Before denoising a signal, efficient Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithms are developed for fitting the HMMs to observational signal data. Parameters of trained HMM are used to modify wavelet coefficients according to the rule of minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) of the signal. Then, reverse wavelet transformation is utilized to modified wavelet coefficients. Finally, experimental results are given. The results show that block hidden Markov model (BHMM) is a powerful yet simple tool in signal denoising.

Conventional pinhole SPECT imaging assumes ideal pinhole geometry. However, neglect of pinhole finite aperture could lead to unfavorable quality degradations, such as positioning bias and image distortion. In this work, we develop a system model in which the aperture width of a pinhole collimator is explicitly included. The system model describes the probability of a single photon from its emission to detection. The probability value is calculated based on the effective intersection area resulting from a simulated cone-beam light source emitting from the image voxel, passing through finite aperture, and reaching at detector's frontal face. The proposed model is also integrated with the ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm for fast 3D statistical image reconstruction. Monte-Carlo based phantom experiments are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed system model compared to the ideal pinhole model. Reconstructed image results demonstrate that the proposed model can improve image quality in terms of reducing location bias and maintaining better contrast recovery.

One possible approach to clustering such data is to assume that the data to be clustered arise from a finite mixture of populations. The mixture likelihood approach has been well developed and much used, especially for mixtures where the component distributions are multivariate normal. Hunt and Jorgensen [17] presented methodology that enabled the clustering of mixed categorical and continuous data using a mixture model approach. However many multivariate data sets encountered also contain unobserved or missing values. In this paper we demonstrate that the mixture approach to clustering can handle mixed categorical and continuous data where data are missing at random in the sense of Little and Rubin [20]. The methodology is illustrated by clustering two data sets.	Univ Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand	Hunt, L (reprint author), Univ Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand.

We employ an iterative expectation-maximization method, arriving at an algorithm which alternately performs a beamforming via a sample matrix inversion and a maximum-likelihood decoding. An analytical analysis of the sample errors after the beamforming provides insight into the procedure. A numerical study shows that with the number of iteration cycles increasing, the sample error squares decrease towards an analytical lower bound, and the error rates at the decoder output improve. Second, the iterative algorithm is employed for the reception of coded OFDM (orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing) signals subject to non-stationary CCI in both the time and frequency dimensions, as typically encountered in decentralized broad-band wireless networks with uncoordinated channel access. Results from computer simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm successfully mitigates the CCI, achieving gains of several decibels over conventional receiver techniques.

In this paper, we show that the noise amplification can be reduced by using a detector whose bin size is smaller than the image pixel size without applying any regularization methods or changing any other factors. We compare different detector system characteristics using SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) analysis, show the noise properties in each detector system through both simulation studies and physical phantom studies, and finally compare how the noise amplification affects the image quality in different detector systems. The ML-EM algorithm when used in conjunction with a smaller detector bin size has better convergent properties, reduces noise amplification, and produces better image quality.

The centers and variances of RBF networks are gradually updated to merge the basis unites by the supervised gradient descent of the error energy function. The algorithms are used to construct the RBF networks and to reduce the number of basis units. The experimental results show the validity of our method which gives a smaller number of basis units and obviously outperforms the conventional RBF learning technique.

Most current clustering methods of objects are not adapted when the data set is incomplete. And generally, these methods are used either by ignoring the objects with missing values or by substituting missing values by plausible values according to the nature of the data. In this paper, we focuss on unsupervised learning from incomplete categorical data and we study this problem under the mixture approach. First, we review a particular mixture model for complete categorical data and we describe the well-known EM algorithm. Then we extend it to the case where the data is incomplete. Simulation studies and numerical experiments on real data give encouraging results.

These two methods were used to develop an implementation of fully three-dimensional Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization iterative reconstruction for emission tomography (OSEM3D). It is, however, necessary to embed these computational kernels in an environment that supports efficient data movement and other infrastructural operations, such as process management. Here we briefly describe two particular components of the infrastructure: the I/O subsystem and the service demon. For the I/O subsystem, a fortuitous relationship between the traditional representation of the fully three-dimensional sinogram S-4DO(theta,Z,phi,r) and the distributed representation for Image Space Decomposition permits an efficient solution involving minimal data movement. The service demon is similar to others, but contains additional recovery-oriented mechanisms for minimizing mean time to repair. We conclude with performance benchmarks for fully 3D reconstruction for a scanner that produces a significant volume of data.

A model for multiple harmonic structures is constructed with a mixture of tied Gaussian mixtures, from which a single harmonic structure is modeled. Our algorithm enables estimation of both the number and the shape of the underlying harmonic structures, based on a maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters using EM algorithm and an information criterion. It operates without restriction on the number of mixed sounds and varieties of sound sources, and extracts accurate fundamental frequencies continuously with simple procedures in spectral domain. Experiments showed high performance of the algorithm for both simultaneous speech and polyphonic music.

It is also shown that this general framework achieves the same time complexity as that of the specialized algorithms. The efficiency is brought by sharing common (partial) paths in the derivation tree for a given goal, but such sharing is incomplete in the sense that it is not allowed to share the paths appearing in different derivation trees. In this paper, we introduce a general idea called 'inter-goal sharing' where different goals can share the common derivation paths. Inter-goal sharing achieves the full sharing of derivation paths and hence makes EM learning more compact and efficient in practical cases. Experimental results with both artificial and real linguistic data show that the proposed method runs 2-6 times more compactly and faster than the previous approach.

The deterministic annealing EM (DAEM) algorithm was once proposed to solve the problem, but the global optimality is not guaranteed because of a single-token search. Then, the multi-thread DAEM (m-DAEM) algorithm was proposed by incorporating a multiple-token search with solution quality improvement with a heavy computing cost. Later, another variant of m-DAEM (E-DAEM) was proposed by introducing threshold-based dynamic annealing with more quality improvement for an adequate threshold epsilon; however, finding such epsilon is not easy. This paper proposes a new variant of EM, called epsilon-EM, by incorporating a multiple-token search together with threshold-based bifurcation. Our experiments using Gaussian mixture estimation problems showed that the epsilon-EM finds excellent solutions with relatively small computing cost, and the threshold epsilon plays a key role in reducing computing cost.

Pixels are represented as complex covariance matrices, which demand dissimilarity measures that can capture the phase relationships between the polar components of the returns. Four dissimilarity measures are compared to judge their efficacy to separate complex covariances within the fuzzy clustering process. When these four measures are used to classify a POLSAR image, the measures that are based upon the Wishart distribution outperform the standard metrics because they better represent the total information contained in the polarimetric data. The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is applied to a mixture of complex Wishart distributions to classify the image. Its performance matches the FCM clustering results Yielding a tentative conclusion that the Wishart distribution model is more important than the clustering mechanism itself.

EM (Expectation-Maximization) and gradient-based algorithms are the two best known. techniques to estimate these parameters. Although the theoretical properties of these two frameworks are well-studied, it remains an open question as to when and whether EM is to be preferred over gradients. We will answer this question empirically. More specifically, we first adapt scaled conjugate gradients well-known from neural network learning. This accelerated conjugate gradient avoids the time consuming line search of more traditional methods. Secondly, we empirically compare scaled conjugate gradients with EM. The experiments show that accelerated conjugate gradients are competitive with EM. Although, in general EM is the domain independent method of choice, gradient-based methods can be superior.

Hence it is particularly attractive for low-count data in emission tomography. A LM likelihood and convergent EM algorithm for LM reconstruction was presented in (Parra et al., TMI, v17, 1998). Faster ordered subset (OS) reconstruction algorithms for LM 3-D PET were presented in (Reader et al., Phys. Med. Bio., v43, 1998). However, these OS algorithms are not globally convergent and they also do not include regularization using convex priors which can be beneficial in emission tomographic reconstruction. LM-OSEM algorithms incorporating regularization via inter-iteration filtering were presented in (Levkovilz et al., TMI, v20, 2001), but these are again not globally convergent. Convergent preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithms for spatio-temporal list-mode reconstruction incorporating regularization were presented in (Nichols, et al.., TMI, v21, 2002), but these do not use OS for speed-up. in this work, we present a globally convergent and regularized ordered-subset algorithm for LM reconstruction. Our algorithm is derived using an incremental EM approach. We demonstrate the speed-up of our LM OS algorithm (vs. a non-OS version) for a SPECT simulation.

Also we propose an implementation method of the face recognition systems to improve robustness by training the GMM which is made by modeling the local features of the face images statistically, using an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The calculation burden is decreased using the flatness measure, and this improvement leads to the possibility of the real time face recognition. Experimental results show that the best rate of the face recognition is 100 % for the cases of higher mixture and higher feature vector dimensions, though the rates depend much on the degree of mixture. We prove that the flatness measure is a useful pre-processing in the GMM-based face recognition systems by showing the improvement in performance by about 9 % when the flatness measure is used even for the lower feature vector dimensions. 2-D DCT coefficients are used for the face feature vectors, and the experiments are carried out on the Olivetti Research Laboratory (ORL) face database.

For this, we propose three models: First, we incorporate syntactic information such as part of speech into the word-based lexical alignment. Based on this model, we propose the second model which finds phrasal correspondence in the parallel corpus. Phrasal mapping through chunk-based shallow parsing enables to settle mismatch of meaningful units in the two languages. Lastly, we develop a two-level alignment model by combining these two models in order to construct both the word and phrase-based translation model. Model parameters are automatically estimated from a set of bilingual sentence pairs by applying the EM algorithm. Experiments show that the structural relationship helps construct a better translation model for structurally different languages like Korean and English.

The scanner composed of two rings of six detector blocks arranged in a hexagonal shape with an inner radius of 88 mm. Each detector consists of a four-layer array of 32x32 scintillator crystals each measuring 1.44x1.44x4.5 mm(3) and a 256ch flat panel position sensitive photomultiplier tube (FP-PS-PMT). The FP-PS-PMT has a large effective area of 49x49 mm(2) and multi anodes of 16x16ch, which can be read out in parallel. We simulated the scanner for various parameters of the number of DOI channels and the length of crystal. Simulated data were reconstructed using the maximum likelihood expectation maximization with accurate system modeling. The trade-off results between background noise and spatial resolution shows that only shortening the length of crystal does not improve the trade-off at all, and that four-layer DOI information improves uniformity of spatial resolution in the whole FOV. Monte Carlo simulations were also performed using the EGS4 code to measure absolute sensitivity and count rate capability with a small cylindrical phantom. We also evaluated the impact of critical design parameters on the noise equivalent count rate (NECR) and LOR errors caused by inter-crystal Compton scatters. Simulation results show that this scanner can achieve high sensitivity and high NECR, which can be further improved by using an appropriate anode segmentation of the FP-PS-PMT.

That is, PFC is presumably interacted with superior temporal (ST) neuron in order to extract indicator component representing the whole view of face or object, by maximizing the expectant value where attention modulation can be taken into account for distinguishing different faces. The PFC-ST network indicates to compute the abstraction of face/object information based on the expectation maximization algorithm since the voluntary movements of facial viewpoints must play an important role of integrating spatial and temporal property.

For inference and learning in the model, we formulate an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm where Rao-Blackwellized Particle filtering is used in the E step. The use of stereo views of the scene is a strong source of disambiguating evidence and allows rapid convergence of the algorithm. The update equations have an appealing form and as a side result, we give a generative probabilistic interpretation for the Sum of Squared Differences (SSD) metric known from the field of Stereo Vision.

We investigated a suitable modification of MLEM and OSEM algorithms needed to reduce HSA. Patients with suspicious breast lesions were administered 10 mCi of Tc99m sestamibi and SPECT scans with patients in prone position with uncompressed breasts were acquired. In addition, to simulate breast lesions, some patients were imaged with a number of breast skin markers each containing 1 mu Ci of Tc-99m. We modified MLEM and OSEM algorithms by removing from the backprojection step the rays that traverse the periphery of the support region on the way to a detector bin when their path length trough this region is shorter than some preset critical length. Such very short paths result in a very low projection counts contributed to the detector bin and this in turn gives rise to a overestimation of the activity in the peripheral voxels in the backprojection step, thus creating HSA. We analyzed the breast-lesion contrast and suppression of HSA in the images reconstructed using conventional and modified MLEM and OSEM algorithms vs. critical path length (CPL). For CPL >= 0.01 pixel size, we observed improved breast-lesion contrast and lower noise in the images reconstructed, and a very significant reduction of HSA in the maximum intensity projection (MIP) images.

SPECT scans were performed using a Defrise phantom filled with 0.9 mu Ci/ml of Tc-99m and a dual-head gamma camera equipped with one cone-beam (CBC, f = 70 cm) and one parallel-beam collimator (PBC). Images were reconstructed using a fully-3D approach with resolution and attenuation modeling and an ordered-subsets version of a maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization algorithm (MLEM). Three grouping patterns of subsets were applied: consecutive, orthogonal, and uniform. In contrast to PBC SPECT, we observe that, in CBC SPECT, the reconstruction grouping pattern of the subsets is very important for the image quality obtained. Only when the projection data grouped into a subset were selected as uniformly as possible from all the acquired views, were the image quality and the noise in the images very close to results obtained using MLEM. However, we note that, for both CBC and PBC SPECT, the loglikelihood for a given iteration is practically the same for different grouping patterns of subsets.

It takes the mean and shape of syllable pitch contour as two modeling units and considers some major affecting factors that control their variations. By using the EM algorithm to estimate all parameters of the pitch mean and shape models from a speech database, we can decide the best tone sequences pronounced in all utterance of the database. Experimental results showed that it outperformed the VQ classification method which suffers from the interferences resulted from neighboring syllables and from the global prosodic phrase pattern.

Our method first computes for each surface point the surface curvature distribution by applying the Principal Component Analysis on local neighborhoods with different sizes. Then we model in the four dimensional space the joint distribution of surface curvature and position features as a mixture of Gaussians using the Expectation Maximization algorithm. Central to our method is the extension of the scale-space theory from the 2D domain into the three-dimensional space to allow feature analysis and classification at different scales. Our algorithm operates directly on points requiring no vertex connectivity information. We demonstrate and discuss the performance of our framework on a collection of point sampled 3D objects.

Proposed methodology for correction of respiratory effects involves the use of gated frames, which are however of low signal to noise ratio. Therefore a method accounting for respiratory motion effects without affecting the statistical quality of the reconstructed images is necessary. We have implemented a rigid-body transformation of list mode data for the correction of respiratory motion over the thorax. The study was performed using datasets of the NCAT phantom at different points throughout the respiratory cycle. List mode data based PET simulated frames were produced by combining the NCAT datasets with a Monte Carlo simulation. Transformation parameters accounting for respiratory motion were estimated according to an affine registration and were subsequently applied on the original list mode data. The corrected and uncorrected list mode datasets were subsequently reconstructed using the One-pass list mode EM (OPL-EM) algorithm. Comparison of corrected and uncorrected respiratory motion average frames suggests that an affine transformation in the list mode data prior to reconstruction can produce significant improvements in accounting for respiratory motion artefacts in the lungs and heart. However, the application of a common set of transformation parameters across the imaging field of view does not significantly correct the respiratory effects on organs such as the stomach, liver or spleen.

Sequence-based structural homology prediction methods are an important means for prioritizing unknown proteins for structure determination. However, an important challenge remains: two highly dissimilar sequences can have similar folds - how can we detect this rapidly, in the context of structural genomics? High-throughput NMR experiments, coupled with novel algorithms for data analysis, can address this challenge. We report an automated procedure, called HD, for detecting 3D structural homologies from sparse, unassigned protein NMR data. Our method identifies 3D models in a protein structural database whose geometries best fit the unassigned experimental NMR data. HD does not use, and is thus not limited by sequence homology. The method can also be used to confirm or refute structural predictions made by other techniques such as protein threading or homology modelling. The algorithm runs in O(pn + pn(5/2) log (cn) + p log p) time, where p is the number of proteins in the database, n is the number of residues in the target protein and c is the maximum edge weight in an integer-weighted bipartite graph. Our experiments on real NMR data from 3 different proteins against a database of 4,500 representative folds demonstrate that the method identifies closely related protein folds, including sub-domains of larger proteins, with as little as 10-30% sequence homology between the target protein (or sub-domain) and the computed model. In particular we report no false-negatives or false-positives despite significant percentages of missing experimental data.

However, it may lead to a poor performance or inconsistency. This paper analytically shows that performance of a GMM can be improved in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence with a committee of GMMs with different initial parameters.

B	Lee, LJ; Attias, H; Deng, L; Fieguth, P			IEEE	Lee, LJ; Attias, H; Deng, L; Fieguth, P			A multimodal variational approach to learning and inference in switching state space models	2004 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH, AND SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOL V, PROCEEDINGS: DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SIGNAL PROCESSING SYSTEMS INDUSTRY TECHNOLOGY TRACKS MACHINE LEARNING FOR SIGNAL PROCESSING MULTIMEDIA SIGNAL PROCESSING SIGNAL PROCESSING FOR EDUCATION			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing	MAY 17-21, 2004	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE Signal Proc Soc, IEEE				An important general model for discrete-time signal processing is the switching state space (SSS) model, which generalizes the hidden Markov model and the Gaussian state space model. Inference and parameter estimation in this model are known to be computationally intractable. This paper presents a powerful new approximation to the SSS model. The approximation is based on a variational technique that preserves the multimodal nature of the continuous state posterior distribution. Furthermore, by incorporating a windowing technique, the resulting EM algorithm has complexity that is just linear in the length of the time series. An alternative Viterbi decoding with frame-based likelihood is also presented which is crucial for the speech application that originally motivates this work. Our experiments focus on demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithm by extensive simulations. A typical example in speech processing is also included to show the potential of this approach for practical applications.

We generated 144 phantoms over a cardiac cycle modeling a typical Tc-99m Sestamibi study. The cardiac cycle was divided into different gating schemes (8, 12, 16, and 24 gates) by summing combinations of these phantoms. For each gate, we generated projection data using an analytical projector that included the effects of attenuation, collimator-detector response and scatter, and reconstructed using different image reconstruction methods including FBP, OS-EM (with and without attenuation, scatter, and collimator-detector response corrections), and a 4D MAP-RBI-EM algorithm. The amount of motion blur (measured by mean square error) and percentage fluctuation of the reconstructed images were evaluated as measures for temporal resolution and noise level. The ejection fraction was also calculated to further evaluate the different gating schemes and reconstruction methods. The results show a dramatic improvement in temporal resolution in gated versus ungated images. The level of noise was found to increase significantly with an increase in the number of gates. Using a smaller number of gates was found to have a higher variation in estimating the ejection fraction. For each gating scheme, FBP and OS-EM without correction were found to have the poorest temporal resolution and the highest level of image noise while OS-EM with corrections was found to significantly improve temporal resolution and reduce image noise. We conclude that the 4D NCAT phantom is a useful tool in the study of optimal gating schemes and 4D image reconstruction methods for improved gated myocardial SPECT.

The anode is pixellated into an 11 x 11 array to provide position sensitivity in two dimensions. The third coordinate is determined from the observed timing of signals in the detector. The, position resolution is approximately 1.2 nun in each dimension. The energy resolution is about 2% for two-pixel events at 662 keV. Images are reconstructed via list-mode maximum likelihood (ML). A new weighting method for ML reconstruction is proposed in which the contributions of small-uncertainty sequences are enhanced relative to sequences with large uncertainties. The new reconstruction method is compared with traditional ML techniques for measured imaging data.

In our previous paper, we introduced a recursive likelihood computation algorithm for PSM recognition and can perform Viterbi-style training. In this paper, we extend the recurrsive likelihood computation into a fast forward-backward PSM training algorithm that maximizes PSM likelihood. In addition, we introduce an improved PSM, dynamic multi-region PSM, that allows a data-driven alignment between observations and the segment trajectory. The dynamic multi-region PSM model outperforms HMM and traditional PSM in both phone classification and phone recognition tasks on the TIMIT corpus.

Our group is developing a novel tomographic dual modality system that will provide 3D structural and functional information of the breast. Because of constraints on the gantry geometry and acquisition time, only a limited number of views on one side of the breast can be acquired. In addition, the scatter and attenuation of gamma rays by breast tissue is a major problem for the reconstruction. We present an expectation-maximization (EM) method which naturally takes into account all the factors of noise, limited views, scatter. and attenuation. In a preliminary phantom study our quantification technique obtained results agreeing well with the ground truth.

The MR data is modeled as a stochastic process with an inherent effect of smoothly varying intensity or bias field. Unlike the conventional hard segmentation methods with a unique label for each voxel, a new PV model is developed in which the percentage of each voxel belonging to each class is considered in establishing the maximum a posteriori (MAP) framework. A new Markov random field (MRF) model is built to reflect the spatial information for the tissue mixture. The MAP solution is calculated by the iterative expectation-maximization (EM) strategy that interleaves PV segmentation with estimations of class parameters and bias field distribution.

The rate function in each voxel is modeled as an inhomogeneous Poisson process whose rate function can be reconstructed using a cubic B-spline basis. The rate functions are then estimated by maximizing the objective function formed by the sum of the likelihood of arrival times and spatial and temporal smoothness penalties. We rst provide a computable bound for the norms of the optimal temporal basis function coef cients, and based on this bound we construct an incremental gradient algorithm that converges to the solution. Fully four-dimensional simulations demonstrate the convergence Of the algorithm for a high count dataset on a 4-ring scanner.

The aim of conventional hard segmentation methods is to assign a unique label to each voxel. However, due to the limited spatial resolution of medical imaging equipment and the complex anatomic structure of soft tissues, a single voxel in a medical image may be composed of several tissue types, which is called partial volume (PV) effect. Using the hard segmentation methods, the PV effect can substantially decrease the accuracy of quantitative measurements and the quality of visualizing different tissues. In this paper, instead of labeling each voxel with a unique label or tissue type, the percentage of different tissues within each voxel, which we call a mixture, was considered in establishing an image segmentation framework of maximum a posterior (MAP) probability. A new Markov random field (MRF) model was used to reflect the spatial information for the tissue mixture. Parameters of each tissue class were estimated through the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm during the MAP tissue mixture segmentation. The MAP-EM mixture segmentation methodology was tested by digital phantom MR and patient CT images with PV effect evaluation. Results demonstrated that a hard segmentation method would loss a significant amount of details along the tissue boundaries, while the presented new PV segmentation method can dramatically improve the performance of preserving the details.

The main challenge in medical image reconstruction is how to establish an economical and efficient computing system that can be used to perform. fast image reconstructions. In this paper, we present a distributed computing system that is based on P2P technologies; and demonstrate how the design and implementation of this system addresses the challenge through a case study of an iterative EM medical image reconstruction algorithm. Computational experiments are designed to study the performance of the EM algorithm using the system. In the aggregate, this study provides an insights into the large-scale computation of iterative medical image reconstruction in a Grid environment.

J	Liao, TFT				Liao, TFT			Estimating household structure in ancient China by using historical data: a latent class analysis of partially missing patterns	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY			English	Article						EM algorithm; household structure; latent class analysis; missing data; population register	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; NONRESPONSE; MARRIAGE; MODELS; ENGLAND; JAPAN	Social data often contain missing information. The problem is inevitably severe when analysing historical data. Conventionally, researchers analyse complete records only. Listwise deletion not only reduces the effective sample size but also may result in biased estimation, depending on the missingness mechanism. We analyse household types by using population registers from ancient China (618-907 AD) by comparing a simple classification, a latent class model of the complete data and a latent class model of the complete and partially missing data assuming four types of ignorable and non-ignorable missingness mechanisms. The findings show that either a frequency classification or a latent class analysis using the complete records only yielded biased estimates and incorrect conclusions in the presence of partially missing data of a non-ignorable mechanism. Although simply assuming ignorable or non-ignorable missing data produced consistently similarly higher estimates of the proportion of complex households, a specification of the relationship between the latent variable and the degree of missingness by a row effect uniform association model helped to capture the missingness mechanism better and improved the model fit.

However, most of the improvements of wavelet domain HMMs only focus on how to impose an additional dependency structure on the original wavelet domain HMMs to capture the additional dependencies among wavelet coefficients. Besides this, existing methods do not fully consider the effects of noise in high frequency subbands of wavelet transforms, some simple algorithms of wavelet domain HMMs, such as dividing the subband of wavelet coefficients into blocks, cannot be carried on smoothly in noisy image. In this paper, we give a more general framework to simplify wavelet domain HMM using templates. The new model enables us to concisely share the statistics in real-world noisy image using a more reasonable way and enables us to get a simple, local and reliable model using templates. Templates are constructed in the subband of scaling coefficients in order to reduce the effects of image noises and provide powerful yet tractable probabilistic image, models. Before we process images using wavelet domain HMMS, the estimation of parameters for the HMMs must be obtained by the EM training algorithm that shares statistics according to the templates. Finally, to demonstrate the utility of new models, we give an example for image denoising using templates and wavelet-domain HMMs.	Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China	Liao, ZW (reprint author), Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

In this work, we focus mostly on the development and initial assessment of a new approach, named Localised Mixture of Support Vector Machine Experts (L-MSVME), that defines an SVM-based extension of localised ME models. Mixture models will then be used both to express prior belief in the existence of more than one process in the data generation model, and to provide an efficient method for increasing modelling power. An algorithm based on the maximum likelihood criteria (EM) was considered for training, and we demonstrate that it is possible to train each ME expert through an SVM perspective. This process also allows the decoupled training of gating and expert networks. Simulation results were then considered for performance assessment.

The effectiveness of these methods is limited by their global nature. Recent efforts have focused on relaxing global restrictions in order to identify subsets of data that are concentrated on lower dimensional subspaces. In this paper, we propose an adaptive local dimension reduction method, called the Degenerate Expectation-Maximization Algorithm (DEM). This method is based on the finite mixture model. We demonstrate that the DEM yields significantly better results than the local PCA (LPCA) and other related methods in a variety of synthetic and real datasets. The DEM algorithm can be used in various applications ranging from clustering to information retrieval.

Four pairs of R4SSH and parallel-hole collimators with the same spatial resolutions of 0.7cm, 0.9cm, 1.1cm and 1.3cm at 16.5cm, 16.8cm, 17.0cm and 17.1cm respectively, which are the distances to the centers of the common volume-of-view (CVOV) of the R4SSH collimators, were used. Monte Carlo simulated noise-free and noisy planar SM and R4SSH projection images of the left breast were obtained from the 4-D NCAT phantom. The breast was placed within the CVOV of the R4SSH collimator and 14cm from the LEHR collimator. A 0.78cm diameter lesion with a lesion/background activity ratio of 9:1 was placed in the lateral, central and medial region of the breast The R4SSH projection data were reconstructed using a 3D iterative OSEM method. Image quality was evaluated in terms of lesion contrast and FWHM, background noise level and contrast-to-noisy ratio (CNR). The results indicated that, for each collimator pair, the lesion contrast increases and FWHM of lesion decreases in the R4SSH SPECT images while the noise level increases with iteration number. When compared to the planar SM images obtained with equal acquisition time, the R4SSH SPECT images have higher noise level and poorer spatial resolution but significantly higher lesion contrast especially for the medial lesions. Using appropriate iteration number, R4SSH SPECT images can provide higher CNR for medial and even central lesions, but lower CNR for lateral lesions. We conclude that RMSSH SPECT can potentially provide improved image quality as compared to planar SM.

The registered images are firstly decomposed by discrete wavelet frame. Secondly since the fusion of the lowest frequency band is crucial to the final result, they are fused effectively by EM algorithm. The high frequency bands are fused by selection method involving the informative importance measure. Then the fused image is achieved by the discrete wavelet frame invert transform. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the discrete wavelet transform and the existing image fusion methods.

Given partial, noisy, image-derived measurements on the cardiac kinematics, prior works on model-based motion estimation have often adopted deterministic constraining models of mathematical or mechanical nature. In this paper, we present a novel estimation framework for motion analysis under stochastic uncertainties. The main novelty is that the statistical properties of the model parameters, system disturbances, and measurement errors are not treated as constant but rather spatio-temporally varying. An expectation-maximization (EM) framework, in both space and time domains, is used to automatically adjust the model and data related matrices in order to better fit a given measurement data set, and thus provides more accurate tissue motion estimates. Physiologically meaningful displacement fields and strain maps have been obtained from in vivo cardiac magnetic resonance phase contrast image sequences.

The algorithm does not require the knowledge of hop patterns and hop rates of the users, hence it enables robust FH wireless ad hoc networking in a noncooperative environment.

A linear dynamical model with mixture Gaussian output is proposed for the Internet traffic input stream, and a linear dynamical system with mixture lognormal output is developed to model the TCP connection durations. In the proposed models, a sum of independent AR(1) processes is used to approximate the autocorrelation of the real data, and a Gaussian mixture or lognormal mixture is used to fit the marginal distribution. As a result, the output processes can capture the correlation and the marginal distribution simultaneously Making use of the fact that at each iteration the parameter increment of the EM algorithm has a positive projection on the gradient of the likelihood, a stochastic approximation-based recursive EM algorithm is proposed to fit the traffic marginal distribution. A cross-validation criterion is used for the model selection. To illustrate the usefulness of the proposed models, several experimental results are provided.

In many real world applications appropriate preprocessing transformations of high dimensional input data can increase overall performance of algorithms. Feature extraction tries to find a compact description of the interesting features of the data. This can be useful for visualization of higher dimensional data in two or three dimensions or for data compression. It can also be applied as a preprocessing step that enables reducing the dimension of the data to be handled by a subsequent model. In this paper, we mainly concentrate on kernel PCA for feature selection in a higher dimensional feature space. We first introduce the usefulness of EM algorithm for standard PCA. We then present the kernel PCA. Kernel PCA is a nonlinear extension of PCA based on the kernel transformation (Scholkopf, Smola, and Muller 1997). It requires the eigenvalue decomposition of a so-called kernel matrix of size N x N. In this contribution we propose an expectation maximization approach for performing kernel principal component analysis. Moreover we will introduce an online algorithm of EM for PCA. We show this to be a computationally efficient method especially when the number of data points is large. The information criteria of Bozdogan together with others are used to decide the number of eigenvalues.

Rock texture segmentation is a challenging task since the texture is often nonhomogenous. In this contribution, the new EM (Expectation-Maximization) Rock Textures segmentation framework EMRT is proposed. EMRT has two phases, in the first phase the image is divided into small patches then color and texture features are extracted for each patch. We perform EM clustering of the features and then map the clusters back to the image domain to construct segmented image or subimages. The cost function of EM clustering is based on Maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation to fit the feature data to a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). In the second phase we use edge detection techniques and morphological operations on each subimage for refinement to define the final segments. A qualitative comparison of EMRT with the traditional approaches such as Fuzzy C-mean, and Kmeans on a database of rock images is presented. We proved that the EMRT provides the highest quality segmentation compared with the other approaches.

This novel framework includes: (a) A semantic-senstive video content representation framework via principal video shots to enhance the quality of features (i.e., the ability of the selected low-level multimodal perceptual features to discriminate among various semantic video concepts); (b) A semantic video concept interpretation framework via flexible mixture model to bridge the semantic gap between the semantic video concepts and the low-level multimodal perceptual features; (c) A novel concept learning technique to integrate unlabeled samples with labeled samples for more accurate classifier training. Experimental results on semantic medical video classification are also presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework.

There have been proposed several extensions of the original noise-free linear ICA, e.g., noisy ICA or nonlinear ICA. There are few studies dealing with both noisy and nonlinear situations, however, because of the difficulty in integral calculation of the likelihood. In this study, we approximate the integral by a Taylor expansion and a Laplace approximation. The derived algorithm formulated as an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm generalizes several of existing ICA algorithms. We also obtain an optimal step size for our EM algorithm and discuss the reason why various noisy linear ICA algorithms based on maximum likelihood estimation are unsuccessful in being the noise-free linear ICA in the noiseless limit.

However, since it requires multiple database scans, applying the EM algorithm to large databases is not realistic. In this paper we propose a variant of the EM algorithm which requires only one database scan and works within a confined memory space. The algorithm is based on a generalization of the EM algorithm proposed for learning of hierarchical mixture models. A notable advantage of our algorithm over existing variants of the EM algorithm for large databases lies in its simplicity. Our algorithm preserves the theoretical clearness of the EM algorithm.

However, the ground truth map representing this prior knowledge usually does not really describe all the land cover typologies in the image and the generation of a complete training set represents a time-consuming, difficult and expensive task. This problem may play a relevant role in remote sensing data analysis, since it affects the classification performances of supervised classifiers, which erroneously assign each sample drawn from an unknown class to one of the known classes. In the present paper, a classification strategy is proposed, which allows the identification of samples drawn from unknown classes, through the application. of a suitable Bayesian decision rule. The proposed approach is based on support vector machines (SVMs) for the estimation of probability density, functions and on a recursive procedure to generate prior probabilities estimates for both known and unknown classes. For experimental purposes, both a synthetic data set and two real data sets are employed.

The methodology FRECT (Fourier regularized computed tomography) allows not only for a priori analysis of the stability of the reconstruction process but also for an exact definition of the resolution in the slices. Its natural regularization parameter, namely the cutoff frequency nu of the filter underlying the definition of the FRECT solution, can be calibrated by estimating the condition number for a range of values of nu. We first outline the methodology FRECT. We then discuss the numerical strategies which can be implemented in order to estimate the condition numbers of large matrices. Finally, we present a few results obtained in the context of SPECT reconstructions, and discuss the possibility to determine automatically the best possible cutoff frequency from the analysis of the stability.

We propose the evaluation of mechatronic systems reliability using censored data for operating field for different technologies, e.g. mechanics, electronics, and software. For ultra reliable system for which we have little data, we use an estimation method, Stochastic Expectation Maximization (SEM), to increase the evaluation accuracy. The SEM method is used to estimate the reliability parameters with better accuracy than with maximization likelihood method.

MAP-approach heavily depends on Gibbs hyper-parameter for noise free reconstruction. Choosing a correct hyperparameter is difficult and time consuming task. Recently proposed median root prior (MRP) algorithm is a good alternative, but are prone to step like streaking effect. In this research work, a fuzzy logic based approach is proposed to overcome these shortcomings. Unlike traditional potential function, a fuzzy potential is used for modeling inter pixel interaction. Two basic operations viz. edge detection and fuzzy smoothing are performed sequentially during each iteration. The first operation is employed for the detection of edges (if present) in all the eight directions of a 3 x 3 neighborhood window. The second operation uses this edge information to perform fuzzy smoothing. Due to recursive nature of the reconstruction algorithm, both these operations are employed iteratively to reduce heavy noise produced due to dimensional instability [10]. simulated experimental results are obtained to show the feasibility of the proposed approach. These algorithms are also compared with other approaches such as, MAP and MRP by numerical measures and visual inspection. Algorithm evaluation shows promising results.

Jump Markov Linear Gaussian (JMLG) models are linear systems whose parameters evolve with time according to a Markov chain. We tested the JMLG model for both simulated nonlinear systems and real level-tank processes. Experimental tests were implemented and the observations were registered. The model parameters were learned in two stages. First, parametric identification was computed based on the Least Squares Estimation algorithm. Then. a refining procedure was carried out based on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. The resulting JMLG model was found to successfully represent the dynamic behavior of the process.

A feasible solution to this problem based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm has been recently proposed in the context of space-time block-coded OFDM. The resulting detector operates iteratively and exploits knowledge of the channel statistics and the operating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this work we address the problem of estimating the above quantities in a recursive fashion. Simulations indicate that the EM detector employing the estimated SNR and channel statistics has better performance than other existing schemes that operate in a mismatched mode. Also, the performance loss with respect to a system with perfect channel knowledge is negligible at SNR values of practical interest.

This paper deals with the problem of parametric probability density function (PDF) estimation in the context of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) amplitude data analysis. Several theoretical and heuristic models for the PDFs of SAR data have been proposed in the literature, that have been proved to be effective for different land-cover typologies, thus making the choice of a single optimal SAR parametric PDF a hard task. In this paper, an innovative estimation algorithm is described, that faces such a problem by adopting a finite mixture model (FMM) for the amplitude PDE, with mixture components belonging to a given dictionary of SAR-specific PDFs. The method automatically integrates the procedures of selection of the optimal model for each component, of parameter estimation, and of optimization of the number of components by combining the Stochastic Expectation Maximization (SEM) iterative methodology with the recently developed "method-of-log-cumulants" (MoLC) for parametric PDF estimation. Experimental results on several real SAR images are reported, showing that the proposed method accurately models the statistics of SAR amplitude data.

We make use of local planar surface elements called patchlets. Patchlets have 3D position, orientation and size parameters. As well, they have positional confidence measures based on the stereo sensor model. Patchlet orientations (i.e., surface normals) provide important additional dimensionality that reduces the ambiguity of segmentation-by-clustering. Patchlet size allows the use of continuity or coverage constraints when segmenting bounded surfaces from depth images. We use a region-growing approach to identify the number of surfaces that exist in a stereo image and obtain an initial estimate of the surface parameters. We refine segmentation using a maximum likelihood clustering approach that is optimised with Expectation-Maximisation. Confidence measures on the patchlet parameters allow proper weighting of patchlet contributions to the solution. We provide experimental results of the segmentation on complex outdoor scenes.

Recently, we have proposed a new mixture model called a block mixture model that addresses this situation. Our model allows one to embed simultaneous clustering of objects and variables through a mixture approach. We use maximum likelihood (ML) to implement the method, and have developed a new EM algorithm to estimate the parameters of this model. This requires an approximation of the likelihood and we propose an alternating-optimization algorithm, which is compared to another version of EM based on an interpretation given by Neal and Hinton. The comparison is performed through numerical experiments on simulated binary data.

Each image is represented in the L*u*v color coordinate system before being segmented by the variational algorithm. The model chosen to describe the color images is a Gaussian mixture model. The parameter estimation uses variational learning by taking into account the uncertainty in parameter estimation. In the variational Bayesian approach we integrate over distributions of parameters. We propose a triaximum log-likelihood initialization approach for the Variational Expectation-Maximization (VEM) algorithm and we apply it to color image segmentation.

Adaptation to the prevailing channel conditions can be based either on the instantaneous values of the channel parameters or on the second order statistics of the radio channel. Instead of different adaptation schemes, we present in this paper a novel joint estimator for the carrier frequency offset, fading rate and relative power levels of different multipath components of the frequency-selective fading channel which can then be exploited by various tranceiver adaptation schemes. Specifically, we model the multipath fading channel in the presence of frequency offset with a complex bandpass autoregressive (AR) model and show how the estimated values for the frequency offset, fading rate and power levels can be easily extracted from the estimated AR coefficients obtained via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In general, the frequency offset, fading rate and power levels can be different for different multipath signal components due to different scattering environments and therefore it is important that they can be estimated separately. A main advantage of the presented joint estimator is that it has a capability of performing equally well for all scattering environments and it has a low implementation complexity, but vet it can provide very accurate estimates even in the high mobility channel conditions.

In this paper we handle clustering as a constrained minimization of a Bregman divergence. Theoretical results show benefits resembling those of boosting algorithms, and bring new modified weighted versions of clustering algorithms such as k-means, expectation-maximization (EM) and k-harmonic means. Experiments display the quality of the results obtained, and corroborate the advantages that subtle data reweightings may indeed bring to clustering.

It is a well known fact that split quantization is inferior to unconstrained quantization, due to the independent treatment of sub vectors. Here, we quantify lower bounds for the split loss, and suggest conditional quantization of splits as a method to reduce the losses. The investigation is based on information theoretic estimates of performance, rather than on the performance of actual quantization schemes. Simulations for a 10-dimensional LSF source point at a loss of around 8 bits if scalar quantization is performed, and a loss of approximately 2 bits for a 2-split quantization, both compared to 10 dimensional vector quantization. Furthermore, the results suggest that these losses can be considerably reduced using conditional quantization, down to as low as 0 to 2 bits.

In (Olsson and Hansen, 2004), a novel probabilistic blind source separator was introduced that is based solely on the time-varying second-order statistics of the sources. The algorithm, known as 'KaBSS', employs a Gaussian linear model for the mixture, i.e. AR models for the sources, linear mixing filters and a white Gaussian noise model. Using an EM algorithm, which invokes the Kalman smoother in the E-step, all model parameters are estimated and the exact posterior probability of the sources conditioned on the observations is obtained. The log-likelihood of the parameters is computed exactly in the process, which allows for model evidence comparison assisted by the BIC approximation. This is used to determine the activity pattern of two speakers in a convolutive mixture of speech signals.

The maximum likelihood estimate of the attenuation function is sought. Using convex optimization methods, maximizing the log-likelihood functional is equivalent to a double minimization of I-divergence, one of the minimizations being over the attenuation function. Restricting the minimization over the attenuation function to a coarse grid component forms the basis for a multigrid algorithm that is guaranteed to monotonically decrease the I-divergence at every iteration on every scale.

In this paper we consider the problem of classifying BGP level prefix flows into a small set of homogeneous classes. We argue that a simple two states Hidden Markov Model (HMM), even if not sufficient for describing a flow, is sufficient to distinguish between flows and to help in classifying them to homogeneous classes. We propose a classification method based on modelling windows of flows observations using Hidden Markov Model and classifying them based on parameters of the model. We use a classical EM algorithm for estimating all model parameters as well as the flow membership probabilities - the probability that a flow belongs to any given class. One of our key contributions is a new and relatively fast method for Internet flow classification. The method is fast as it can classify flows over 30 minutes, i.e. it needs only 6 report generated at a 5 mins intervals (as is usually done for SNMP reports) opening way for an online classification and monitoring of flows. We show that our method is powerful in that it is capable of examining macroscopic flows while simultaneously making fine distinctions between different traffic classes. We demonstrate that our scheme can address issues with flows being close to class boundaries and the inherent dynamic behaviour of Internet flows.

Object initialization is achieved through novel seed selection which is adaptively activated, depending on the quality of tracking, to select the best possible frames along the temporal direction for object detection. EM algorithm is then employed to robustly segment and detect multiple objects in a selected frame.

Previously we showed that using a 20-cm-focal length cone-beam collimator paired with a 40-cm-focal length fan-beam collimator increases sensitivity dramatically near the center of the brain. In this study, we evaluated the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for various lesion locations when using short focusing collimators of different focal length. A spherical lesion was placed at each of several possible locations in an ellipsoidal phantom. The focal length was varied from 18 to 23 cm, so that the focal point was always inside the brain for a 15-cm radius of rotation. We calculated the SNR for estimation of activity concentration based on the Cramer-Rao lower bound on variance. For centrally located lesions, the SNR gain compared to a low-energy-high-resolution collimator ranged from 2.5 (f=23 cm) to 3.6 (f=18 cm). For peripheral lesions, the gain ranged from 1.7 to 1.8. We also reconstructed images of the Zubal brain phantom for simulated I-123-Altropane studies. Images were reconstructed from noisy projection data using the OS-EM algorithm. Based on image comparisons and SNR calculations, we concluded that the combination of a cone-beam collimator with focal point inside the brain and a fan-beam collimator (f=40cm), outperforms any other conventional collimators in sensitivity. Furthermore, mismatch between the center of the patient's head and the center of rotation was found not to reduce the sensitivity significantly.

People unremittingly try to find high quality, more effective method. The 2-D discrete wavelet transform, as a powerful and effective approach. have got preferable production in image analyzing and image processing. However routine method focus on the assumption that the wavelet coefficients are independent and jointly gaussian. In fact. most real-world images, are not always gaussian distributed, there are underlying relationships and rules among these wavelet coefficients on both the same scale and the inter-scale. In this paper, we first reveal the dependencies among these coefficients through the wavelet-domain HAW's. then estimate the model parameters using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithms. The classification can be first realized through maximum likely method in each band, and then combine with the classification results of the three sub-bands from the 2-D wavelet transform and also integrate the classification results of different scale. These approaches offer improved segmentation accuracy.

The use of modular networks was motivated by the nature of the 'cells system' that may be viewed as a highly complex network of metabolic reactions organised in modular pathways. The proposed hybrid modelling technique is validated experimentally with a laboratory scale Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) production process. The main results show that the embedded modular network. if trained with the EM algorithm, is able to organise itself in modules that have correspondence to the underlying biological pathways. In the particular case of the PHA process discussed, the network learned to discriminate between acetate and internal reserves respiration, with the smaller network modules developing expertise in describing the reaction kinetics of the one or other metabolic state.

We start by extracting a set of continuous, phase aligned spatio-temporal curves from trajectories of random points tracked over several cycles of locomotion in a monocular video sequence. We analyze a PCA representation of a set of cyclic curves, pointing out properties of the representation which can be used for spatio-temporal alignment in tracking and recognition tasks. We model the curve distribution density by a mixture of Gaussians using expectation-maximization algorithm. For recognition, we use maximum a posteriori estimate combined with linear data adaptation. We tested the algorithms on CMU MoBo database with favourable results for the recognition of people "by walking" from monocular video sequences captured from the side view.

The learning procedure automatically clusters video frames into video scenes and objects. The learning algorithm is based on a hierarchical, on-line EM algorithm. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used for rapid computations in E and M step of the EM algorithm. We use the model to: 1. perform video clustering by grouping similar (up to translation and scale) video frames into clusters; 2. robustly stabilize video by inferring translation and scale intensity for each frame. We believe that video scene modeling of this kind is essential to bridge the "semantic gap" in video understanding. We illustrate this with several excellent results, both in terms of speed and accuracy.

Tissue classification is formulated as an estimation problem based on an imaging model. Prior models are used within the estimation problem to compensate for noise and intensity inhomogeneity artifacts. From this framework, approaches based on K-means clustering, clustering via the expectation-maximization algorithm, and fuzzy clustering can be derived. The performance of the different types of approaches are evaluated using both simulated and real neuroimaging data.

We derive theoretical expressions for the general form of preconditioned gradient algorithms with line searches. The results are applicable to a wide range of iterative reconstruction problems, such as emission tomography, transmission tomography, and image restoration. A unique contribution of this paper comparing to our previous work [1] is that the line search is explicitly modeled and we do not use the approximation that the gradient of the objective function is zero.

It eliminates the storage of empty sinogram bins. However, a single back projection of all LORs is still necessary for the pre-calculation of a sensitivity image. Since the detection sensitivity is dependent on the object attenuation and detector efficiency, it must be computed for each study. Exact computation of the sensitivity image can be a daunting task for modern scanners with huge numbers of LORs. Thus, some fast approximate calculation may be desirable. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the error propagation from the sensitivity image into the reconstructed image. The theoretical analysis is based on the fixed point condition of the list mode reconstruction. The non-negativity constraint is modeled using the Kuhn-Tucker condition. With certain assumptions and the first order Taylor series approximation, we derive a closed form expression for the error in the reconstructed image as a function of the error in the sensitivity image. The result provides insights on what kind of error might be allowable in the sensitivity image. Computer simulations show that the theoretical results are in good agreement with the measured results.

However, the penalty functions (or image priors) are often heuristically designed to encourage smoothness in reconstructed images. This paper presents a method to design the penalty function to improve lesion detection. We factorize the penalty function into pairwise potentials. Using the theoretical expressions that we have developed for evaluating lesion delectability, we are able to find the optimum weights of the pairwise potentials to achieve the maximum lesion detectability based on the numerical observers that are correlated to human performance.

In this paper, we stud), data mining techniques applied to intelligent textual information processing in distributed environments, including text classification. information extraction (IE) and topic detection and tracking (TDT). These intelligent processing techniques will improve the quality and efficiency of information resource management and utilization. Their statistical models and computational algorithms challenge the researches in data mining and distributed/parallel computing. When successfully applied, they will help enhance and benefit applications in IT, digital library, and information retrieval. Specifically, we study the distributed computing of the following algorithms: naive Bayes classifier combined with expectation-maximization (EM) for text classification, hidden Markov model for information extraction, and deterministic annealing with EM for topic detection and tracking. We also study the performances of the proposed algorithms and experiment on the improvements.

This effect occurs due to a higher probability of inter-crystal penetration with higher angles of radiation incident on crystal fronts. Depth-of-interaction (DOI) encoding is known to improve this problem, but has not reached complete space-invariance. In this work, a space-variant PSF has been incorporated into the system matrix of a list-mode EM algorithm. Furthermore, in an effort to further extend generality and accuracy of the model, anisotropicity of the PSF has also been considered: finite resolution effects at any position in the FOV are allowed to have distinct values along the axial and the two transaxial directions, and are allowed to degrade differently with increasing distance from the center of the FOV. The spatial distribution of image resolution has been measured and fit using exponential and inverse-Gaussian functions. It is shown that the proposed modeling of the PSF, compared to space-invariant and isotropic modeling, improves resolution recovery across the FOV.

The first step of the convergent algorithm is exactly equivalent (unlike the histogrammode case) to the regular subsetized list-mode EM algorithm, while the second and final step takes the form of additive updates in image space. A hybrid algorithm based on the ordinary and the convergent algorithms is also proposed, and is shown to combine the advantages of the two algorithms: it is able to reach a higher image quality in fewer iterations while maintaining the convergent behavior, making the hybrid approach a good alternative to the ordinary subsetized list-mode EM algorithm. Reconstructions using various LOR-driven projection techniques (Siddon method, trilinear and bilinear interpolation) were considered and it was demonstrated that in terms of FWHM, the Siddon technique is inferior to the other two algorithms, with the bilinear interpolation technique performing nearly similarly as the trilinear while being considerably faster.

In the present study, we show that the regularization penalty that was used is closely related to a diffusion scheme used for Gaussian filtering. For a given value of the regularization parameter, the amount of smoothing is independent from the patient attenuation map, and it is mathematically related to the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of a Gaussian filter. A second regularized least square criterion is then derived for which regularization also behaves as a diffusion scheme. The new penalty is then shown to be also applicable to the weighted least square criterion, and to the Poisson maximum likelihood criterion for PET data (i.e. without attenuation) solved by the EM algorithm. For all these criteria, the regularization strength can thus be set as the FWHM of a Gaussian filter.

Applying a novel transformation to the received signal, this binary ST modulation with second-order transmit-diversity, is shown to be equivalent to QPSK with second-order receive-diversity. This equivalent representation allows us to apply a low complexity detection technique specifically designed for receive-diversity namely, scalar multiple-symbol differential detection (MSDD). To further increase receiver performance, we apply the expectation-maximizatiom (EM) algorithm, which performs joint channel estimation and sequence detection. With receiver complexity proportional to the observation window length, our receiver can achieve the performance of a coherent maximal ratio combining receiver in as few as a single EM-receiver iteration, Provided that the window size of the initial, MSDD is sufficiently, long. We also find that an EM-based iterative receiver initiated by selection-diversity scalar-MSDD has significantly better performance and convergence properties than those initiated by conventional ST differential detection.

Aim of this work was to assess the influence of data rebinning and reconstruction on lesion detectability and quantification for a high-resolution 3D PET/CT system, in order to optimize 3D PET/CT oncological protocols. Oncological F-18-FDG PET studies were Monte Carlo (MC) simulated, varying lesion size (LS), lesion-to-background ratio (LBR), statistics, and including or not attenuation and scatter effects. Single slice rebinned (SSR), Fourier rebinned (FORE) and Fully 3D sinograms were considered. 2D/3D Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization (OSEM) reconstruction was applied. Human observers evaluated images in terms of clinical parameters characteristic of lesion detectability and quantification: lesion number, LS, and LBR. By comparison with the known activity map (input for MC simulations), identified lesions were classified as true and false positive (TP, FP), and % errors on LS and on LBR were calculated. The results show that 2D rebinning allow more lesions to be identified than Fully 3D, but SSR induces more FP than FORE. Quantitatively, smaller errors on LBR and on LS were found using FORE rebinning and Fully 3D, respectively. Our findings suggest that FORE+2D OSEM is more suitable for lesion detectability and quantification, Fully 3D OSEM is better for lesion spatial characterization.

We use some hypothetical VNTR systems as well as some summarized results from real systems in [11 to calculate inferences from simulated VNTR data. We compare a proposed approach, for calculating the identity index when several VNTR loci are tested, with the conventional approach of the product rule. The conventional approach is based on the assumption of independent of alleles both within and across VNTR loci. This general approach allows for the dependence of alleles and is based on a concept of a 2-stage mixture that applies to the EM and SEM algorithms. We hope to show improved inferences via this approach.

Several iterative decoding strategies consisting of pilot symbol assisted demodulation and turbo decoding are proposed. It is shown that at a system rate of 0.9 bits per channel use, the SNR required to achieve a BER of 10(-4) is only about 2 dB away from the imperfect CSI capacity lower bound. The channel estimation error variance is demonstrated to be close to the theoretical limit set by the Modified Cramer-Rao bound. The simulation results coincide with the trends dictated by recent information theoretic analysis and demonstrate the effect that the inaccuracy of the channel estimation has on the performance of the iterative decoding scheme.

Several studies showed that these network features may be correlated and present a certain degree of memory such as bursty losses and delays. The memory and the statistical dependence between losses and temporal delays suggest that the channel may be well modeled by a Hidden Markov Model with appropriate hidden variables that capture the current state of the network. In this paper we propose an Input/Output Hidden Markov Model that, trained with a modified version of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, shows excellent performance in modeling typical channel behaviors in a set of real packet links. The work extends to case of variable inter-departure time the previous proposed Hidden Markov Model that well characterizes losses and delays of packets from a periodic source.

Acceleration is provided using Fisher Scoring (FS) optimization in the M step. Only a small number FS iteration is required for each M step. Our proposed algorithm reaches to the local minima in few steps whereas conventional EM needs more iteration. We also estimate the regularization parameter in the same single structure. Thanks to the FS optimization, it is possible to avoid complicated second derivative of the log-likelihood function by using only the gradient values.

A new formulation on simultaneous recursive image and blur parameter identification and image restoration is given in a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) framework. This technique incorporates optimal Kalman smoothing equations for Maximum Likelihood (ML) parameter identification and state estimation. Because of the computationally heavy processing of smoothing, we use filtering approximation of the Kalman instead of Kalman Smoothing.

In order to achieve good performance, the receiver has to accurately estimate the channel impulse response. The idea is to iteratively improve the initial channel estimate, obtained using training sequences, by exploiting the soft decisions provided by the decoders. To do this, we propose to use the EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm and to include it into our iterative receiver. Assuming that the receiver knows the channel statistics, we propose to iteratively estimate the channel according to the MAP (Maximum a Posteriori) criterion using the EM algorithm. Simulation results show that this yields a significant improvement in performance.

This paper outlines two approaches for deriving a function which can be used to assign to each cell in the study area a value representing the posterior probability that the cell contains a deposit of the sought-after mineral. One approach is based on estimating probability density functions (pdfs); the second uses multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Results are provided from applying these approaches to geoscientific datasets covering a region in North Western Victoria, Australia. The results demonstrate that while both the Bayesian approach and the MLP approach yield similar results when the number of input dimensions is small, the Bayesian approach rapidly becomes unstable as the number of input dimensions increases, with the resulting maps displaying high sensitivity to the number of mixtures used to model the distributions. However, despite the fact that Bayesian assigned values cannot be interpreted as posterior probabilities in high dimensional input spaces, the pixel favorability rankings produced by the two methods is similar.

The 3D method, expectation-maximization (E-M), was used to estimate the probability distributions of various tissue classes in the image. Evolution of the lesion over time is assumed to follow a hidden markov model (HMM), where the state of the system is expressed as lesion or non-lesion independently for each voxel in the image. Synthetic images based on a Gaussian mixture model were used to simulate a 4D image data set with exponential lesion growth. A comparison was made between use of the E-M algorithm alone, run independently on each image in the time series, and the E-M plus HMM temporal approach. The combination of techniques showed improvement in sensitivity and specificity of lesion detection.

In MIMO systems, the channel estimation is important to distinguish transmit signals from multiple transmit antennas. The Space-Alternating Generalized Expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm is known to be good for the channel estimation and the data detection. However, the SAGE algorithm has not been applied to MIMO systems. In this paper, we propose a SAGE algorithm for the channel estimation and data detection in MIMO systems. In addition, we propose a simplified SAGE algorithm for the channel estimation and the data detection with tracking the channel variation in MIMO systems. In the simplified SAGE algorithm, we divide a transmit frame into some subblocks and apply the SAGE algorithm to each subblock, and we use the channel estimates in the previous subblock as the initial channel estimates in the current subblock. According to the division of the transmit frame, the computational complexity is decreased. In addition, the simplified SAGE algorithm can track the channel variation by using the channel estimates transferred between the subblocks.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of this method in terms of a defect detection task using a mathematical Channelized Hoteling Observer (CHO) study. In this study we also optimized the iteration number in reconstruction of Tl distributions. A population of male and female NCAT phantoms were used to realistically model variation in patients. Both defect-free and defect-present data of Tc and Tl were simulated using the SimSET/PHG codes and our newly developed and validated angular response function (ARF) method to mimic simultaneous acquisition and separate acquisition. Poisson noise was modeled at clinically, realistic levels. The Tl data were reconstructed using filtered backprojection (FBP) and ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithms for up to 20 iterations with and without the model-based crosstalk compensation (MBC). CHO methodology and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were applied to short axis Tl images to obtain ROC curves and area under ROC curves (AUC). The AUC values were compared with those from separately acquired data reconstructed using FBP and OSEM algorithms. The results show that a relatively small number of iteration (similar to3) is optimal for the post-reconstruction filtering cutoff frequency of 0.16 pixel(-1), used in this study. Also, the AUC values obtained with the MBC were significantly better than those without crosstalk compensation and those with the FBP reconstruction method applied to the separately acquired data.

In this paper the EM algorithm is applied to each class projected over the features in order to obtain an estimation of the class probability density function. A matrix of weights per class and feature is then obtained, where it collects the level of relevance of each feature for the different classes. We show different ways to extract this information and compare the behavior of the ranking of relevance obtained applying the naive Bayes and K-NN classifiers.

The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is used in the channel estimation process, while a BCJR algorithm for multiple antenna systems is used for both data detection, over the channel trellis, and decoding, over the space-time code trellis. Noise variance estimation is also performed by the receiver. Simulation results showing the diversity gain over MIMO flat fading channels are presented.
