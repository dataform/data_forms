The first one considers a supertrellis to perform data detection and decoding in a jointly manner, while the second system utilizes separate trellises for these two tasks. We compare the two schemes in terms of bit error rate and computational effort. Our results show that, in many cases, the supertrellis approach for combined detection and decoding can be a better compromise solution than the separate system.

Although a model of the clean speech can incorporate prior knowledge into the feature enhancement process, this model no longer yields an accurate fit if a different microphone is used. To cure the resulting performance degradation, we merge a new iterative EM-algorithm to estimate the channel, and the MBFE-algorithm to remove non-stationary additive noise. In the latter, the parameters of a shifted clean speech HMM and a noise HMM are first combined by a Vector Taylor Series approximation and then the state-conditional MMSE-estimates of the clean speech are calculated. Recognition experiments confirmed the superior performance on the Aurora4 recognition task. An average relative reduction in WER of 12% and 2.8% on the clean and multi condition training respectively, was obtained compared to the Advanced Front-End standard.

An inhomogeneous hidden Markov random field is adopted in this algorithm to model the label scale variability as a prior probability. An EM algorithm is developed to estimate parameters for both the prior probability and likelihood probability. The image segmentation is established by a MAP estimator. Different images are tested to verify our algorithm. And comparisons with other segmentation algorithms are made. The segmentation results show our algorithm has better performance than others.

Assuming that failure times follow a Weibull distribution, we propose a likelihood-based method for estimating the parameters of failure time distribution and p, the proportion of the defective products in the population. The estimation algorithm is described through an application to an actual data set of this method.

Two particular cases of CSE are examined-SDD (Soft-Decision Directed) and EM (Expectation-Maximization) based one. Both have capabilities for exploiting the iteratively improved backward measure from the decoding network, however both exhibit different properties and provide different possibilities for iteration scenarios. An example application with simple serially concatenated code with QPSK mapping in AWGN channel with phase rotation is investigated to demonstrate differences between the algorithms in terms of MSE, ambiguity resolution, and convergence behavior.

The result is a nonparametric-based identification technique that can be applied in any case with iid noise that outperforms estimators in this case, including the popular LS method and a recently-developed (and limited) version of the MEE. Performance-wise, the MEE method is comparable to the Expectation-Maximization (EM) method. Its application to FIR system identification produces a very efficient implementation of this technique.

We propose the use of an integrated machine learning architecture, with automated planning-scheduling and resource management capabilities that can be used for a variety of autonomous sensing applications with very limited computing, power, and bandwidth resources. We lay out general solutions for efficient processing in a multi-tiered (three-tier) machine learning framework that is suited for remote, mobile sensing systems. Novel dimensionality reduction techniques that are designed for classification are used to compress each individual sensor data and pass only relevant information to the mobile multisensor fusion module (second-tier). Statistical classifiers that are capable of handling missing/partial sensory data due to sensor failure or power loss are used to detect critical events and pass the information to the third tier (central server) for manual analysis and/or analysis by advanced pattern recognition techniques. Genetic optimisation algorithms are used to control the system in the presence of dynamic events, and also ensure that system requirements (i.e. minimum life of the system) are met. This tight integration of control optimisation and machine learning algorithms results in a highly efficient sensor network with intelligent decision making capabilities.

In such cases, a substantial scatter subtraction is performed followed by amplification of the remaining data (to correct for attenuation), which results in noisy reconstructions. More recent methods used with iterative reconstruction include the attenuation in the system model in conjunction with either pre-scatter subtraction or a separate addition of the scatter component after each application of the forward model. This work compares these more conventional approaches to including attenuation and scatter within the EM algorithm with a fully unified scatter and attenuation model - whereby all attenuation and scattering effects are included within the system matrix. For this case all acquired data are used and regarded as information by the reconstruction algorithm. This work indicates that for a large attenuating medium there are notable differences between the four ways of including attenuation and scatter within the reconstruction - fully pre-correction of the data is inferior compare to all the other methods. For the case of simple shift-invariant Gaussian model of scatter - subtraction, additive and unified model methods shows similar variance-bias characteristics. Multiple realisations of simulated data sets have been used to compare the performance of this model with other methods.

The EM algorithm is remarkable because of its simplicity, generality and convergence. However, such good characteristics of the EM algorithm may lead to less attention to the validity of the MLE problem. Though we can always have solutions when applying the EM algorithm, the solutions may not be meaningful when the MLE problem itself is inappropriate in the first place. In this paper, we demonstrate through case studies that the MLE problem can be inappropriate and the results of the EM algorithm can be misleading. As examples, we estimate the failure probability of two components with masked system test data. We apply both the conventional MLE approach and the EM algorithm. Their results are compared. We show that the process of applying conventional approach may easily expose the inappropriateness of the MLE problem while the EM algorithm may not. We conclude that we should check the validity of the data and corresponding MLE problem before we apply the EM algorithm.

In this paper, we present a new tag tracking method based on Bayesian statistical approach. our method works on the basis of tracking with the active grid model, it builds the Markov Random Field (MRF) model according to the prediction of the position of the grid node, and classifies the nodes into two categories considering whether they are in the left ventricle using the EM algorithm. then, different prior distribution and likelihood function are designed for different sorts. The iterated conditional modes (ICM) are utilized to maximize the posterior estimate. The method was validated on several sequences of cardiac systole MRI images. Experiment shows that the method can accurately track the SPAMM tag lines without manually outlining the myocardium, and the grid model can keep its topology during tracking process.

Discriminant-EM (DEM) proposed a semi-supervised learning framework which takes both labeled and unlabeled data to learn classifiers. This paper extends the linear D-EM to nonlinear kernel algorithm, KDEM and evaluates KDEM on both benchmark image databases and synthetic data. Various comparisons with other state-of-the-art teaming techniques are investigated.

We do this by incorporating an auxiliary outlier component (a uniform density to any of the data points) into the mixture model which allows us to fit just one data cluster by "ignoring" the rest of the clusters. Once a model is fitted we remove from consideration in a probabilistic fashion all the data explained by this model and then repeat the operation. This process can be viewed as fitting a mixture model using a constrained EM algorithm. A natural stopping criterion is to stop adding components once the outlier component fits no data (or just real background clutter). We also apply the algorithm to train J-component mixtures of Gaussians and show results real data.

We show that non-stationarity and non-Gaussianity can be exploited by modeling the distribution of the sources using Gaussian Mixture Model. The Maximum Likelihood estimator is utilized in order to derive two novel source separation techniques. Both methods are based on estimation of the sensors distribution parameters via the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for GMM parameter estimation. In the first method, the separation matrix is estimated by applying simultaneous joint diagonalization of the estimated GMM covariance matrices. In the second proposed method, the separation matrix is estimated by applying singular value decomposition of a weighted sum of the estimated GMM covariance matrices. The performances of the two proposed methods are evaluated and compared to existing blind source separation techniques. The results show superior performances of the proposed methods in terms of Interference-to-Signal Ratio.

The scanner consisted of two 20 cm (transaxial) x 15 cm (axial) planar detectors with 3x3x10 mm(3) LGSO elements mounted on a rotating gantry with adjustable detector radii. A 36 cm x 21 cm oval phantom, 40 cm long, with a centered 2.2 cm sphere and 1.3 cm neighboring spheres was used for tests with the spheres at 20:1, 10:1, and 5:1 concentrations relative to the background. Data were acquired with the detectors in a fixed anteirior-posterior orientation as well as orbiting the body in limited and full arcs. Images were reconstructed with a fully 3D ML-EM algorithm (in most cases with limited angles.) For the fixed detector position, coronal views showed the larger sphere and the lateral small sphere for the 20:1 and 10:1 concentrations. Transaxial images showed many artifacts in the limited-angle cases. For the orbiting detector data, transaxial image quality improved as the number of angles increased. Significant artifacts were still present, however. The system works satisfactorily, even with limited views, for detection of high-uptake lesions. Further characterization of uptake requires fuller angular sampling.

The EM algorithm proposed in this paper differs from the existing training algorithm, which is called the Baum-Welch algorithm, and guarantees that the likelihood is always increased by updating the parameters. The approximate algorithm has the advantage that it can be applied to problems in which observation of the training sentence and training of the parameters proceed in parallel. These algorithms and their derivations are simplified, compared to the existing training algorithm, by using stochastic context-free grammar. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The former makes that every kernel has an equal probability of generating data points. The differential log-likelihood is an unbiased metric with which to judge the quality of the density estimate. We apply these principles to kernel-based topographic map formation based on log-likelihood maximization. We restrict ourselves to Gaussian kernels and homogeneous, homoscedastic mixings. We show that the negative log-likelihood equals the quantization error of the map, up to a scale factor.

Nuclear cardiac scans are a standard of care for patients with suspected coronary artery occlusions and can assess perfusion and other physiological functions via the injection of radiotracers. In addition, correlated acquisition of nuclear images with electrocardiogram (ECG) signals can provide myocardial dynamics, which can be used to assess the wall motion of the heart. We have implemented this nuclear cardiology technique into a microSPECT/CT system, which provides sub-millimeter resolution in SPELT and co-registered high resolution CT anatomical maps. Radionuclide detection is synchronized with the R-wave of the cardiac cycle and separated into 16 time bins using an ECG monitor and triggering device for gating. Images were acquired with a 12.5x12.5 cm(2) small field of view pixilated NaI(Tl) detector, using a pinhole collimator. In this pilot study, rats (N=5) were injected with Tc-99m-Sestamibi, a tracer of myocardium, and anesthetized for imaging. Reconstructed 4-D images (3D plus timing) were computed using an Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization (OSEM) algorithm. The measured perfusion, wall motion, and ejection fractions for the rats matched well with results reported by other researchers using alternative methods. This capability will provide a new and powerful tool to preclinical researchers for assessing cardiac function.

(2002) propose a practical approach to multiple-subject functional MRI data analyses which uses the EM algorithm to estimate the between-subject variance component at each voxel. The main result of this article is a demonstration that the much more efficient Newton-Raphson algorithm can be reliably used for these calculations. This result follows from an extension of a simple algorithm proposed by Mandel and Paule (1970) for the one-way unbalanced ANOVA model, two variants of which have been shown to be equivalent to modified ML and REML, in which the "modification" is that the within-subject variances as treated as known.

The method exhibits very low encoding and decoding complexities thanks to the use of a concatenated LDGM code as the channel encoder and a modified sphere detector for bit likelihood computation. Simulation results showed that it was possible to achieve a performace near the capacity limits over perfect-interleaved, fast fading rayleigh channels with perfect channel state information (CSI) available at the reception. In this work we extend these results to the more practical situation where the fading is quasi-static and the channel is estimated at the receiver. The channel estimation method investigated in this work is based on the Maximum Likelihood principle and makes use of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.

The system is driven by chaotic signals and a robust EM based estimator is formulated to estimate the system parameters and the driving chaotic signal. It is shown through numerical simulations that the proposed EM semi blind estimation technique outperforms other conventional techniques such as minimum non linear prediction error (MNPE) method and that based on extended Kalman filter (EKF). Also the proposed estimator is applied in the equalization of chaos based communication to illustrate the performance improvement.

The paper presents a procedure for misfire diagnosis that exploits a multichannel sound signal from accelerometers mounted on the surface of an automotive engine. The EM algorithm is used to decompose the measured sound into individual components associated with single combustions. For these simplified scenarios, a statistical test based on the shape of the reconstructed in-cylinder pressure is devised. Measurement data collected from a four cylinder test bed engine is used to validate the proposed approach and show its superiority to the single-channel solution.

Key ideas are twofold. First, we estimate a probability density function (PDF) of black pixels for each category using mixture models of Gaussian distribution functions and the EM algorithm. Second, we determine optimal, global affine transformation that maximizes a normalized cross-correlation value between a GAT-superimposed input pattern and the above-mentioned PDF by the successive iteration method. Experiments using the handwritten numeral database IPTP CDROM1B show that the entropy of optimally GAT-superimposed test samples decreases substantially by more than 20%. We discuss the enhanced normalization ability and the computational complexity of the proposed method.

The usual method of implementing the image reconstruction involves separating the acquired data out into lower-count discrete time frames, resulting in increased image noise. This paper presents two further developments for one-pass 4D list-mode expectation-maximization (EM) reconstruction, which has already demonstrated enhanced reconstruction quality for image sequences compared to conventional strategies, as well as significantly reducing reconstruction time. The technique, which is an extension of one-pass 3D list-mode EM, filters a previously reconstructed frame, which is then used as a starting image for the following frame, thus including prior object information. A new approach to post-reconstruction smoothing is also proposed, which in some cases is able to reduce noise without loss of resolution. Using measured quad-HIDAC data from a moving point source and a specially designed liquid flow experiment, and a rat scan, the two approaches are compared to the uniform image initialization method in terms of spatial and temporal resolution, noise, and accuracy of time-activity curves. Preliminary results, using resolution recovery, indicate the potential of achieving ultra-high spatial resolution with good temporal resolution, arising from improving the use of otherwise wasted prior information.

Unlike the conventional hard classification with a unique label for each voxel, our method models a mixture to estimate the partial volumes (PV) of multiple tissue types within a voxel. A new Markov random field (MRF) model is proposed to reflect the spatial information of tissue mixtures. A mixture classification algorithm is performed by the maximum a posterior (MAP) criterion, where the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is utilized to estimate model parameters. The presented method is evaluated by clinical MR image datasets.

A huge body of time-course gene expression data has been and will continuously be produced by microarray experiments. Such gene expression data contains important information and has been proven useful in medical diagnosis, treatment, and drug design. The challenge now is how to analyze such data to obtain the inherent information. Cluster analysis has played an important role in analyzing time-course gene expression data. However, most clustering techniques do not take into consideration the inherent time dependence (dynamics) of time-course gene expression patterns. Accounting for the inherent dynamics of such data in cluster analysis should lead to higher quality clustering. This paper presents a model-based clustering method for time-course gene expression data. The presented method uses Markov chain models (MCMs) to account for the inherent dynamics of time-course gene expression patterns and assumes that expression patterns in the same cluster were generated by the same MCM. For the given number of clusters, the presented method computes cluster models using an EM algorithm and an assignment of genes to these models that maximizes their posterior probabilities. Further, this study employs the average adjusted Rand index (AARI) to evaluate the quality of clustering. The improved performance of the presented method is demonstrated by comparing to the k-means method on a publicly available dataset.

A low-complexity sliding-window scheme is proposed for channel tracking based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and a noncoherent maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) multi-user detector. By exploiting features of discrete random phase ambiguities of channel estimates using the EM algorithm, the proposed scheme can track channel phase even if the channel is in a deep fade. In conjunction with iterative soft interference cancellation, the proposed detector can achieve near single user system performance with polynomial complexity in the number of users.

Based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, a group of recursive stochastic filters is derived for blind channel estimation, using the maximum likelihood and minimum mean squared error criteria. In conjunction with the BCJR algorithm, it is shown that the recursive procedure for joint channel estimation and maximum a posteriori symbol detection can be represented as a message-passing scheme on a factor graph. The graphical model not only provides a generalized implementation architecture for existing training-based schemes, it also greatly reduces the complexity of existing algorithms for blind channel tracking.

A low-complexity Kalman-like filter is developed for blind channel tracking using the recursive expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) symbol detection method. The recursive EM algorithm yields channel estimates with discrete valued phase ambiguities. By exploiting the statistical properties of the EM-based blind estimators as well as the robustness of noncoherent MAP detection to phase errors, a method to resolve the phase ambiguity problem even in the presence of a deep fading environment is proposed. Based on the proposed blind channel estimator and phase corrector, an iterative structure is introduced for joint channel estimation, symbol detection and soft multiple access interference cancellation.

A receiver, based on the EM algorithm, is derived. This receiver iterates between detection and estimation. We illustrate how initial estimates may be obtained and how convergence problems may be avoided. Through computer simulations the performance of the proposed receiver is investigated, both in terms of frame error rate (FER) and estimation error variance. We show that exploiting code properties for estimation purposes allows to reduce the length of training sequences, and thus results in an increase in spectral efficiency.

Generally, IR systems obtain retrieval information through parsing natural language queries and formalize the queries based on this information. As queries contain few terms, the problem of word mismatch emerges frequently. In this paper, we explore the correlation between question and answer (CQA) by conducting unsupervised machine learning on FAQs (frequently asked questions) via a probabilistic latent semantic analysis model (PLSA). Meanwhile, in order to investigate its effect on IR, we also design an inference network in which the correlation was employed. Experimental results show that our inference net, by taking advantages of CQA, outperforms traditional vector space based tfidf models in information retrieval.

It starts iteratively splitting from a single Gaussian model, then iteratively merging clusters. After convergence of the last stage, the clustering model is selected via a modified BIC and used to gain an initial segmentation, followed by a region merge step to achieve final segmentation.

The SAGE algorithm searches for the ML solution iteratively by resolving the interference among signals from different transmit antennas. To improve the probability of convergence to the ML solution, multiple initial points are used. The List-BLAST algorithm, which exhausts the constellation points in the first layers of a BLAST detection scheme, is shown to be an excellent way to generate initial points. The complexity of the proposed detection scheme is compared with that of the sphere detection scheme, and it is shown to have a number of implementation advantages.

Previous EM techniques for joint channel estimation and symbol detection had computational complexity exponentially proportional to channel model order. In this paper, we derive an efficient Iterative Weighted Least Mean Squared (IWLMS) algorithm based on EM for blind equalization. Our new IWLMS algorithm, greatly outperforms the popular blind equalization method based on the constant-modulas criteria according to Monte Carlo experiments.

This approach is based on an image formation model in which the sensor images are described as the true scene corrupted by additive non-Gaussian distortion. A hidden Markov model (HMM) is fitted to the wavelet transforms of the sensor images to describe the correlations between the coefficients across wavelet decomposition scales. A set of iterative equations was developed using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the model parameters and produce the fused images. We demonstrated the efficiency of this approach by applying this method to visual and radiometric images in concealed weapon detection (CWD) cases and night vision applications.

Switching regression model is well known and can be found in most texts on multivariate statistics. A family of fuzzy c-regression models (FCRM), recently, is used to study this model. However, FCRM, as a promising technique for switching regression parameter estimation and clustering, still has drawback of slow (or not enough fast) convergence in some cases. In this article, a new algorithm, called Fast FCRM (FFCRM) algorithm is proposed by improving the FCRM for convergence speed. FFCRM, with an additional probability threshold to accelerate convergence, converges much more rapidly than FCRM, and produces high-quality estimates. Two small simulation experiments illustrate the above points.

We treat the frames in a sequence collectively as a single function of both space and time, and define a temporal prior to account for the temporal correlations in a sequence. This temporal prior is defined in a form of motion-compensation, aimed to follow the curved trajectories of the object motion through space-time. The image frames are then obtained through estimation using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed algorithm was evaluated using the 4D gated mathematical cardiac-torso (gMCAT) D1.01 phantom to simulate gated SPECT perfusion imaging with Tc-99m. Our experimental results demonstrate that the use of motion compensation for reconstruction can lead to significant improvement in image quality and reconstruction accuracy.

Multi-View EM does feature split as Co-training and Co-EM, two successful semi-supervised learning algorithms in text learning tasks, but it considers multi-view learning problem in the framework of EM algorithm. The Multi-View EM algorithm has these impressing advantages comparing with Co-training and Co-EM: its convergence is theoretically guaranteed; it can deal with multiple views instead of only two views. We utilize it for color image segmentation and discuss the phenomenon that different weights for color view and coordinate view will lead to different segmentation results.

The detector unit consists of 8x8 crystal blocks with 4 layers of 2x2 Gd2SiO5:Ce (GSO) arrays coupled to a 52 mm square position sensitive photomultiplier tube (PS-PMT). Each scintillation event is mapped in a two-dimensional (2D) distribution through the relative ratio of the output signals of the PS-PMT. To facilitate high spatial resolution imaging, accurate crystal identification is needed. A statistical model based on the approach of a mixture Gaussian model (MGM) is introduced for crystal identification. In the MGM, a cluster center and range attributed to individual peaks in the 2D distribution are defined. The MGM method is applied two times, once for the cluster centers and once for determination of the range. These results are used to generate a Look-Up-Table (LUT). This method successfully identifies 288 crystal elements composing 36 crystal blocks.

This calls for adaptive data representations keeping as much relevant information as possible while keeping the representation as small as possible. Typically, the gathered data can be high-dimensional vectors with different types of attributes, e.g. continuous, binary and categorical data. In this paper we present - as a first step - a probabilistic latent-variable model, which is capable of fusing high-dimensional heterogenous data into a unified low-dimensional continuous space, and thus brings great benefits for multivariate data analysis, visualization and dimensionality reduction. We adopt a variational approximation to the likelihood of observed data and describe an EM algorithm to fit the model. The advantages of the proposed model are illustrated on toy data and used on real-world painting image data for both visualization and recommendation.

The measurements were conducted in the 5 GHz band using a virtual cross antenna array at the receiver. A frequency domain space alternating generalized expectation maximization (FD-SAGE) algorithm is employed to estimate the multipath components. The clusters of the multipaths are then manually identified. For each measured location, 4-5 clusters are identified and the processed results show that the cluster AS ranges 5.6degrees-36.5degrees. Furthermore, we investigate the tap AS for each cluster. It is found that for the channels with 100 MHz bandwidth, the instantaneous tap AS ranges 0degrees-43degrees and the average tap AS of each cluster is just few degrees less than the AS of that cluster. The difference between the average tap AS and the cluster AS becomes smaller for less channel bandwidth.

We have hypothesized that this blurring is due to incompleteness of projection data acquired by a single circular pinhole orbit. And we have developed a pinhole SPECT system with two circular orbits which satisfy Tuy's condition so as to provide complete data for 3D pinhole SPECT reconstruction within the whole field-of-view (FOV); a dedicated 3D ordered subsets expectation maximization (3D-OSEM) reconstruction method for two-orbit data. This study is aimed at evaluating accuracy and impact of this system. In this system, not the camera but the object rotates and the two orbits are 90degrees and 45degrees relative to object's axis. Experiments using a multiple-disk phantom filled with Tc-99m solution and a mouse bone scan using Tc-99m-labeled HMDP agent were carried out. The Feldkamp's filtered back-projection (FBP) method and the 3D-OSEM method were applied to these data sets. The axial blurring was apparent on images reconstructed by FBP for single-orbit data, while the 3D-OSEM using two-orbit data dramatically improved the resolution homogeneity and statistical noise property, and also demonstrated considerably better image quality in the mouse scan.

It is an important model for business analysis. Bayesian network learning methods have been applied to business analysis where data privacy is not considered. However, how to learn a Bayesian network over private data presents a much greater challenge. In this paper, we develop an approach to tackle the problem of Bayesian network induction on private data which may contain missing values. The basic idea of our proposed approach is that we combine randomization technique with Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The purpose of using randomization is to disguise the raw data. EM algorithm is applied for missing values in the private data set. We also present a method to conduct Bayesian network construction, which is one of data mining computations, from the disguised data.

In this paper, a Bayesian network is originally used to model the causal relationship of time series of traffic flows among a chosen link and its adjacent links in a road network. Then, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), whose parameters are estimated through Competitive Expectation Maximization (CEM) algorithm, is applied to approximate the joint probability distribution of all nodes in the constructed Bayesian network. Finally, traffic flow forecasting of the current link is performed under the rule of Minimum Mean Square Error (M.M.S.E.). To further improve the forecasting performance, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is also adopted before carrying out the CEM algorithm.

However, it suffers from the limited angle tomographic reconstruction. Consequently, the quality of the reconstructed images is significantly degraded. We present a practical and effective scheme to eliminate limited angle problem inherent to the proposed Compton imaging probe by using auxiliary data to augment the incomplete tomographic data acquired from the probe alone. We give a mathematical formulation for the proposed scheme and describe its implementation. The proposed scheme fits seamlessly into the framework of the list-mode maximum likelihood expectation maximization reconstruction algorithm, yielding superior reconstructions. Our preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Each image in the database is segmented to regions associated with homogenous color, texture, and shape features. By employing Self-Organization Map learning, a uniform and sparse region-based representation is obtained. With this representation a probabilistic model based on the statistical-hidden-class assumptions of the image database is developed, to which Expectation-Maximization technique is applied to analyze semantic concepts hidden in the database. An elaborated retrieval algorithm is designed to support the probabilistic model. The semantic similarity is measured through integrating the posterior probabilities of the transformed query image, as well as a constructed negative vector to the discovered semantic concepts. The proposed approach has a solid statistical foundation and the experimental evaluations on a database of 10,000 general-purposed images demonstrate its promise of the retrieval effectiveness.

A common approach is to generate solutions of varying number of components (via the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm) and then select the best model in the sense of a cost such as the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). A recent alternative uses component-wise EM (CEM) and, further, integrates model selection within CEM. Both approaches are susceptible to finding poor solutions, the first due to initialization sensitivity of EM and the second due to the sequential (greedy) nature of CEM. Deterministic annealing for clustering (DA) and mixture modeling (DAEM) provide potential for avoiding local optima. However, these methods do not encompass model selection. We propose a new technique with positive attributes of all these methods: it integrates learning and model selection, performs batch optimization over components, and has the character of DA, with the optimization performed over a sequence of decreasing temperatures. Unlike standard DA, with the partition entropy reduced as the temperature is lowered, our approach reduces entropy of binary random variables that express whether each component is active or inactive. At low temperature, the method achieves explicit model order selection. Experiments demonstrate favorable performance of our method, compared with several alternatives. We also give an interesting stochastic generative model interpretation for our method.

In this paper, the fuzzy set theory was employed into the reconstruction procedure. The observations of emission counts were viewed as Poisson random variables with fuzzy mean values. And the fuzziness of these mean values was modelled through choosing an appropriate fuzzy membership function with several adjustable parameters. Coupled with this fuzzy method, the new fuzzy penalized likelihood expectation maximization (FPL-EM) method was proposed for PET image reconstruction. Simulation results showed that the proposed method might perform better in both the image quality and the convergence rate compared with the classical maximum likelihood expectation-maximization (ML-EM).

In this paper, a row-action alternative to the SAGE algorithm (RASAGE) is proposed; it processes the projection data sequentially. In order to speed up the convergence rate, we process the projection lines using a special order in such a way that the sequential projection lines are independent between them. Relaxation parameter is also used to adjust the projection data update level. Comparison of RASAGE with SAGE algorithm shows that the former method converges faster than the latter.

It was demonstrated that the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm is superior to the EMML due to the following facts: (1) The hidden data spaces can be appropriately chosen and then be used in SAGE algorithm to speed up the convergence rate. (2) SAGE algorithm updates the parameters sequentially which makes its M-step to be treated more easily. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that combines the RBI algorithm with SAGE algorithm. The convergence property of RBI-SAGE is discussed, and the image quality is assessed with mean absolute error and chi-square error. The experimental results show that the proposed method is more effective than the SAGE algorithm even if the projection data includes statistic noise.

Unlike conventional maximum likelihood-expectation maximization (MLEM), this method intends to introduce the fuzzy set principle to MLEM algorithm. In this work, the non-cognitive uncertainty of the observed projection data are described by their probability density function; whereas the cognitive uncertainty of a random variable can be described by the membership function for its fuzziness. The mean of the observed projection data are regard as fuzzy random variables because of the complexity of system. The fuzzy random variable can be represented by a triangular membership function. We establish a joint probability density function that includes the effects of both fuzziness and randomness. The maximum likelihood approach is used to estimate the image vector. The order subset (OS), rescaled block-iterative (RBI), and row-action (RA) techniques are applied to our PET reconstructed method to speed up the convergence rate and to decrease the iteration numbers.

To achieve this, this paper introduces a new approach for the clustering of web documents, which is called Maximal Frequent Item-set(MFI) approach. Iterative clustering algorithms, such as K-means and Expectation-Maximization(EM), are sensitive to their initial conditions. MFI approach firstly locates the center points of high density clusters precisely. These center points then are used as initial points for the K-means algorithm. Our experimental results tested on 3 web document sets show that our MFI approach outperforms the other methods we compared in most cases, particularly in the case of large number of categories in web document sets.

The method is developed based on the results from information geometry; specifically, the alternating projections theorem first proved by Csiszar [1]. It is demonstrated that the proposed method has similar performance compared to a recently reported method based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm [2]. Since the IGID method has an analytical solution, the proposed algorithm can be implemented much faster while while having a similar performance. The method can be considered as a generalization of all the methods developed based on the EM algorithm.

J	Tan, CM; Beach, MA; Nix, A				Tan, CM; Beach, MA; Nix, A			Multipath parameters estimation with a reduced complexity unitary-SAGE algorithm	EUROPEAN TRANSACTIONS ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th Conference on European Personal Mobile Communications	APR 22-25, 2003	GLASGOW, SCOTLAND					Estimating multipath parameters from multi-dimensional measurement data using maximum-likeli hood methods can be a very time-consuming process due to the iterative nature of these algorithms. Although the Space-Alternating Generalized Expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm has a higher convergence speed compared to the classical Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, it can still be computational/intensive. Since most of the computations of the SAGE algorithm are concentrated in the maximization step (M-step), we propose a new implementation of this algorithm, namely the Unitary-SAGE (U-SAGE) algorithm, where the entire M-step in every iteration is evaluated in the real-valued domain. This helps to reduce the processing time and memory requirements of the classical SAGE algorithm since all computations of the M-step are performed using efficient matrix manipulation. Here, we present the general implementation of the U-SAGE algorithm in the frequency domain when applied in both the element-space (ES) and the newly developed beamspace (BS) domains. We show that the convergence characteristics and accuracy of the newly proposed U-SAGE algorithm is similar to the classical SAGE algorithm, but with a significant reduction in overall computation time and memory usage.

J	Geng, Z; He, YB; Wang, XL; Zhao, Q				Geng, Z; He, YB; Wang, XL; Zhao, Q			Bayesian method for learning graphical models with incompletely categorical data	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Bayesian learning; graphical model; Hyper Markov law; incomplete data; posterior mean	CONTINGENCY-TABLES; EXPERT-SYSTEMS; MISSING DATA; PROBABILITIES	A Bayesian method for learning probabilities under graphical models with incompletely categorical data is discussed, a partial-augmentation formula and a recursive formula of posterior means for graphical models are proposed. Instead of augmenting incompletely observed data to complete data, this partial-augmentation formula only partially augments incomplete data such that augmented data have a monotone data pattern. This recursive formula describes how posterior means are updated by using incomplete data one at a time. Based on this recursive formula, the EM algorithm can be applied to calculate approximate posterior means. This approximate method can be easily applied to Bayesian learning for graphical models.

J	Hojo, H				Hojo, H			A marginal maximum likelihood method for the vector threshold model to analyze dichotomous choice data	JAPANESE PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						dichotomous choice data; vector model; unfolding model; multidimensional scaling; EM algorithm	EM ALGORITHM; RANKING DATA	At least two types of models, the vector model and the unfolding model can be used for the analysis of dichotomous choice data taken from, for example, the pick any/n method. The previous vector threshold models have a difficulty with estimation of the nuisance parameters such as the individual vectors and thresholds. This paper proposes a new probabilistic vector threshold model, where, unlike the former vector models, the angle that defines an individual vector is a random variable, and where the marginal maximum likelihood estimation method using the expectation-maximization algorithm is adopted to avoid incidental parameters. The paper also attempts to discuss which of the two models is more appropriate to account for dichotomous choice data. Two sets of dichotomous choice data are analyzed by the model.

J	Lee, SJ				Lee, SJ			Ordered subsets Bayesian tomographic reconstruction using 2-D smoothing splines as priors	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Bayesian tomography; ordered subsets; Gibbs priors; hyperparameters	IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION; EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; EM ALGORITHM; GIBBS PRIORS; PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; RANDOM-FIELDS; DISTRIBUTIONS	The ordered subsets expectation maximization (OS-EM) algorithm has enjoyed considerable interest for accelerating the swell-known EM algorithm for emission tomography. The OS principle has also been applied to several regularized EM algorithms, such as nonquadratic convex minimization-based maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithms. However, most of these methods have not been as practical as OS-EM due to their complex optimization methods and difficulties in hyperparatneter estimation. We note here that, by relaxing the requirement of imposing sharp edges and using instead useful quadratic spline priors, solutions are much easier to compute, and hyperparameter calculation becomes less of a problem. In this work, we use two-dimensional smoothing splines as priors and apply a method of iterated conditional modes for the optimization. In this case, step sizes or line-search algorithms necessary for gradient-based descent methods are avoided. We also accelerate the resulting algorithm using the OS approach and propose a principled way of scaling smoothing parameters to retain the strength of smoothing for different subset numbers. Our experimental results show that the OS approach applied to our quadratic MAP algorithms provides a considerable acceleration while retaining the advantages of quadratic spline priors.

This learning task can pose unpleasant problems if the dataset to learn from contains imprecise information in the form of sets of alternatives instead of precise values. In this paper we study an approach to cope with these problems, which is not based on probability theory as the more common approaches like, e.g., expectation maximization, but uses possibility theory as the underlying calculus of a graphical model. Since the search methods employed in a learning algorithm are relatively independent of the underlying uncertainty or imprecision calculus, we focus on evaluation measures (or scoring functions).

The procedure requires us at each step to interpolate the grouped data and is similar to the EM algorithm with normal errors. The expectation step has been replaced by a median-based step which avoids doing awkward integration with general errors and, also, we have substituted for the maximisation step, a natural one which only coincides with it when the errors are normally distributed. With these modifications, we have proved that the iterative estimating algorithm converges to a point which is unique and non-dependent on the starting values. Finally, our final estimate, being a Huber type M-estimator, may enjoy good stochastic asymptotic proper-ties which have also been investigated in detail. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Wang, R; Blostein, SD				Wang, R; Blostein, SD			Multi-user multi-antenna CDMA receivers for asynchronous multipath fading channels	EUROPEAN TRANSACTIONS ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							ALGORITHM	In this paper, we investigate joint channel estimation and signal detection approaches for a multi-user CDMA uplink with a base-station antenna array over asynchronous multipath fading channels. Based on the space alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm, we develop an iterative multiuser receiver to jointly estimate channel response vectors and bit sequences for all the active users at known fractional time delays, and a BER lower bound is derived. A simplified bit detection method is then proposed for multi-rate CDMA systems. Simulation results show that the new iterative receiver performs equally well for both high- and low-rate users, and the BER performance is close to that of the BER lower bound.

Specifically, the parameters in the system matrix are expanded in wavelet series and estimated via the Kalman Filter and the EM algorithm. In particular this approach is used for switching models. Two applications are given, one to the problem of detecting the paths of targets using an array of sensors, and the other to a series of daily spreads between two Brazilian bonds.

Therefore, quantitative characterization of microcrack populations is of interest. In this contribution, a practical and efficient methodology is presented for estimation of three-dimensional bivariate size-orientation distribution of microcracks. The methodology is based on the stereological relationship developed earlier, which involves statistical sampling of microcrack traces observed in the vertical metallographic sections. The practical application of the procedure is demonstrated via estimation of three-dimensional bivariate size-orientation distribution of microcracks in the constituent intermetallic particles in Al-Mg and Al-Mg-Si base alloys under uniaxial tensile and compressive loading conditions. The data clearly reveal the effects of loading condition (tension vs. compression) on the microcrack distributions. (C) 2003 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

For 60 years, the implementation of this theory to analogue data is a failure because the measurement noise is drastically amplified. 1970 : Hounsifeld applies Radon's theory to digital data and builds the first x-ray CT scanner. His approach is generalized to many imaging modalities (nuclear medicine, MRI). 2000 : 2D x-ray digital detectors make it possible to develop volumetric x-ray CT and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is recognized as a major diagnostic tool in Oncology. For these purposes, fully 3D reconstruction algorithms are developed. This paper explains the technological and clinical interest of a fully 3D approach and the need to digitally process data to optimally use information. We focus on the relationship between the nature of data, the detector technology and available reconstruction methods.

A new family of regularization methods for reconstruction, based on a thresholding procedure in wavelet and wavelet packet (WP) decompositions, is studied. This approach is based on the fact that the, decompositions provide a near-diagonalization of the inverse Radon transform and of prior information in medical images. A WP decomposition is adaptively chosen for the specific image to be restored. Corresponding algorithms have been developed for both two-dimensional and full three-dimensional reconstruction. These procedures are fast, noniterative, and flexible.

First, the number of components has to be specified apriori. Also, the Expectation Maximization is sensitive to initialization. In this paper, we present a new stochastic technique for estimating the mixture parameters. Parzen Window is used to estimate a discrete estimate of the PDF of the given data. Stochastic Learning Automata is then used to select the mixture parameters that minimize the distance between the discrete estimate of the PDF and the estimate of the Expectation Maximization. The validity of the proposed approach is verified using bivariate simulation data.

To avoid this difficulty, we propose a latent variable model for metric unfolding, in which subject points are regarded as normally-distributed random variables, whereas stimulus ones are treated as unknown fixed parameters. Marginal likelihood, defined by integrating out subject points, is maximized over stimulus point parameters, using an EM algorithm. After stimulus points are obtained, subject points are given by Bayes posterior means. The proposed method recovered true points well in a simulation study and showed better fitting to real data than factor analysis. Finally, its relations to other unfolding methods are discussed.

The approach is a hierarchical one which mixes geometric and symbolic information in a three-layer architecture. Each curve primitive is represented using a point-distribution model which describes how its shape varies over a set of training data. We assign stroke labels to the primitives and these indicate to which class they belong. Shapes are decomposed into an arrangement of primitives and the global shape representation has two components. The first of these is a second point distribution model that is used to represent the geometric arrangement of the curve centre-points. The second component is a string of stroke labels that represents the symbolic arrangement of strokes. Hence each shape can be represented by a set of centre-point deformation parameters and a dictionary of permissible stroke label configurations. The hierarchy is a two-level architecture in which the curve models reside at the nonterminal lower level of the tree. The top level represents the curve arrangements allowed by the dictionary of permissible stroke combinations. The aim in recognition is to minimise the cross entropy between the probability distributions for geometric alignment errors and curve label errors. We show how the stroke parameters, shape-alignment parameters and stroke labels may be recovered by applying the expectation maximization EM algorithm to the utility measure. We apply the resulting shape-recognition method to Arabic character recognition.

The algorithm is inspired by the expectation-maximization algorithm, and it utilizes the IEEE standard 1057 for single tone parameter estimation. In the derivation of the algorithm it is assumed that the number of tones are known and that the frequencies are well separated The algorithm is evaluated using data consisting of multiple real-valued tones. The performance of the frequency estimator is studied and compared with the asymptotic Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). It is shown that the algorithm produces statistically efficient frequency estimates at high signal to noise ratios, that is the variance of the estimates reaches the CRB. Finally, it is shown that the algorithm can produce efficient estimates independent of the number of tones in the input signal.

These techniques are evaluated for frequency dispersive, frequency nondispersive, time varying, and time invariant channels. DVB-T parameters are taken as reference. It has been observed that one needs an effective subcarrier synchronization measure in order to combat degrading effects of dispersive, time varying channels. Because of this reason, we propose new receiver structures to solve synchronization problems for such channels. In the proposed receiver structure, PLL trackers for subcarriers synchronization are used. The PLL's are operated by using an Expectation-Maximization(EM) based phase offset estimation algorithm. According to the performance evaluations made by computer simulations, the proposed receivers improve the system performance on a large scale.

We propose to use probabilistic neural networks in order to perform Bayesian classification.

The approximate ratio of the activity concentration in the lesions to the surrounding brain gray matter was ranging from 1.5 to 10. We used the high-resolution MDAPET, a prototype 3D-PET camera, to scan the phantoms. This camera is a multi-ring scanner with an intrinsic transaxial resolution of 2.8 mm. For practicality, to minimize the number of imaging sessions to be taken, data for the hot lesion phantoms and the normal warm Hoffman brain phantom were taken separately. Then, before performing image reconstruction, the two sets of the sinograms data were selectively combined to generate the sinograms data for the desired SUVs. When the lesions data were taken, the lesions were placed inside the Hoffman brain phantom filled only with water to provide the attenuation and scatter effects. We observed a slight improvement in lesion detectability for the 5 mm lesion located near the center of image for attenuation corrected over non-attenuation corrected sinograms when images were reconstructed with the 3D-reprojection algorithm and also images visually looked better. Images reconstructed with 3-D OSEM followed by post-filtering show slight improvement in lesion detection over 3DRP.

The approach relies on decomposing the speech signal into two components: the first component captures the mapping between formants and acoustic observations, while the second component is intended to capture the residual in the signal. We build the mapping by quantizing the formant space and creating a predictor codebook. Formant tracking is achieved by: 1) EM training of the parameters of the residual component, and 2) searching the predictor codebook for the best formant values. We explore both MAP and MMSE methods for performing formant tracking with the proposed approach. Furthermore, we impose first order continuity constraints on formant trajectories, and use Viterbi search to perform formant tracking. We present formant tracking results on data from the Switchboard corpus.	Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA USA	Bazzi, I (reprint author), Microsoft Res, 1 Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA USA.

This method constructs and optimizes a lower bound on the marginal likelihood using variational calculus, resulting in an iterative algorithm which generalizes the EM algorithm by maintaining posterior distributions over both latent variables and parameters. We define the family of conjugate-exponential models-which includes finite mixtures of exponential family models, factor analysis, hidden Markov models, linear state-space models, and other models of interest-for which this bound on the marginal likelihood can be computed very simply through a modification of the standard EM algorithm. In particular, we focus on applying these bounds to the problem of scoring discrete directed graphical model structures (Bayesian networks). Extensive simulations comparing the variational bounds to the usual approach based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and to a sampling-based gold standard method known as Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) show that variational bounds substantially outperform BIC in finding the Correct model structure at relatively little computational cost, while approaching the performance of the much more costly AIS procedure. Using AIS allows us to provide the first serious case study of the tightness of variational bounds. We also analyze the performance of AIS through a variety of criteria, and outline directions in which this work can be extended.

Acoustic range measurements for long baseline navigation are not normally distributed, a situation that erodes the robustness and precision of estimation techniques. A mixed-distribution model captures the combination of direct-path, multipath, and spurious returns common for acoustic localization in limited-range survey. Expectation-Maximization concurrently identifies the parameters of the model and characterizes the observations, converging on a model for homogeneous instrumented environments. The resulting representation aids autonomous navigation for precision applications.	MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA	Bingham, B (reprint author), MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.

Main assumptions of this class are: 1) space-invariant blur and additive white Gaussian noise; 2) prior given by a linear (finite of infinite) decomposition of Gaussian densities. Many heavy-tailed priors on wavelet coefficients of natural images admit this decomposition. To compute the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate, we propose a generalized expectation maximization (GEM) algorithm where the missing variables axe the Gaussian modes. The maximization step of the EM algorithm is approximated by a stationary second order iterative method. The result is a GEM algorithm of O(N log N) computational complexity. In comparison with state-of-the-art methods, the proposed algorithm either outperforms or equals them, with low computational complexity.

In this paper we propose a microarray image analysis framework that provides a new method that automatically addresses each spot area in the image. Then, a new unsupervised clustering method is used which is based on a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and the minimum description length (MDL) criterion, that allows the automatic spot area segmentation and the image artifacts isolation and correction to obtain more accurate spot quantitative values. Experimental results demonstrates the advantages of the proposed scheme in efficiently analysing microarrays.

It corresponds to ME where the experts are linear regressions and the gating network is a Gaussian classifier. The underlying regressors distribution can be considered to be Gaussian, so that the joint distribution is a Gaussian mixture. This provides a powerful speed-up of the EM algorithm for localised ME. Conversely, when studying Gaussian mixtures with specific constraints, one can use the standard EM algorithm for mixture of experts to carry out maximum likelihood estimation. Some constrained models are useful, and the corresponding modifications to apply to the EM algorithm are described.

The clustering metric used is the normalized cross-correlation, also known as similarity. The main advantage of this metric over the more-traditional Euclidean distance, is that it depends on the signal's shape rather than its amplitude. Under an assumption of an exponential probability model that has several desirable properties, the expectation-maximization (EM) framework is used to derive two iterative clustering algorithms. In numerical experiments based on a simulated dynamic PET brain study, the proposed method achieved better performance than several existing clustering methods.

The anatomical data used here are simulated CT slices of the chest. The edges of the organs and/or lesions can be easily delineated from these slices. Phantom images are created using the SIMIND Monte Carlo simulation software and the mathematical cardiac-torso phantom. Images are reconstructed using MAP-EM algorithm and the detection tasks are performed using numerical observers. Four strategies were investigated. Strategy S1: no prior, the reconstructed images are only filtered using a 3D Gaussian filter post rescaled block iterative reconstruction; Strategy S2: anatomical prior employed where lesions are present in the projection data and in the anatomical data; Strategy S3: anatomical prior employed where lesions are present in the projection data but not in the anatomical data; Strategy S4: anatomical prior employed where lesions are not present in the projection data but only in the anatomical data. Two contrasts lesion/background were used, 12/1 and 22.5/1. Three values for beta, the weight of the prior term, were under investigation: 0.005, 0.02, 0.04. We find that for the prior weights we have investigated (beta=0.005, 0.02 and 0.04), and for contrasts lesion/background of 12/1 and 22.5/1, strategy S2 yields better results than S1, especially at the low contrast S3 yields results similar to S1. Strategy S4 yields results similar to S2. Thus it appears that use of the edge information for possible lesions seen in anatomical data may not be a problem in terms of creating false lesions in the emission slices.

However, when carrying out Kalman smoothing, the computational cost and the data storage requirements are two specific problems. In this paper, a dual-filter-based smoother is proposed and used in the framework of speech enhancement. Our approach comprises a forward-in-time Kalman filter and a backward-in-time Kalman filter. Both filters are based on their respective forward-in-time linear prediction (LP) model and backward-in-time LP model. This method does not require a large storage space as a standard Kalman smoother does. The algorithm is evaluated by considering a speech signal embedded in a white Gaussian noise. Simulation Results show that the proposed algorithm provides a higher improvement of signal to noise ratio (SNR) than the Kalman filtering.

To account for the effects on the time delay estimates due to acoustic propagation in uncertain underwater environments, the time delay measurement errors between pairs of sensors are modelled using Gaussian mixture distributions. The target is assumed to be moving linearly with constant velocity and depth. The proposed approach utilises an iterative maximum likelihood optimisation technique based on the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm, where, in each iteration a nonlinear least squares technique is used to compute the target model parameter estimates.

This paper presents an unified Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that can estimate the haplotype frequency and reconstruct the haplotypes using tightly linked marker phenotype data from nuclear families with both parents, with only one parent, or without parents. Through simulation studies, we compare the accuracy of the haplotype reconstruction and the estimation of haplotype frequencies by using unrelated individuals, nuclear families with both parents, nuclear families with only one parent, and nuclear families without parents. We demonstrate that the accuracy can be greatly improved when both parents or one parent information are included. Without parents, if the number of sibling is larger than two, the accuracy can also be improved.

The tasks were left-ventricular myocardial perfusion lesion detection, with simulated projection data reconstructed using ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) without attenuation and scatter correction (ASC) (ROC study one), and with experimental phantom data reconstructed using OSEM with ASC (ROC study two). Both simulated and experimental data modeled female and male anatomy. The projections were setup to simulate equal time dual-head anterior 180degrees and triple-head 360degrees scans. The multi-slice lesion detectability indices for the CHO-HO were calculated and compared to the A(z)'s for the human observers. Multiple Channel setups for the CHO were investigated. Positive correlations were found between these results for some channel setups. Further investigation of channel models is needed to improve performance correlation with human observers.

It describes the contrast function of Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm by an approximate one with a designable error term. Through adaptively minimizing a specific error term meanwhile maximizing the approximate contrast function, the EMM automatically penalizes all rivals during the competitive learning. Subsequently, the EMM not only includes the Rival Penalized Competitive Learning algorithm (Xu et al. 1993) and its Type A form (Xu 1997) with the new variants developed, but also provides a better alternative way to optimize the EM contrast function with at least two advantages: (1) faster model parameter learning speed, and (2) automatic model-complexity selection capability. We present the general learning procedures of the EMM, and demonstrate its outstanding performance in comparison with the EM.

These cases involve damage detection and assessment of beam-column connection failures of the test structure using simulated ambient vibration data that is generated from the benchmark model which has randomly chosen structural parameter values. The two-step approach involves modal identification followed by damage assessment that uses the identified pre- and post-damage modal parameters based on a Bayesian updating methodology. An Expectation-Maximization algorithm is proposed to find the most probable values of the structural parameters. The results of analysis show that the probabilistic approach is able to successfully detect and assess damage locations for the full-sensor and the partial-sensor cases.

Joint probability tables are decomposed into lower dimensional probability components and their mixtures. The maximum likelihood parameters of the mixture models are trained by the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm and quantized to one byte integers. Probability elements that mixture models do not estimate reliably are kept separately. Experimental results with on-line handwritten UNIPEN uppercase and lowercase characters show that the total memory size of an on-line scanning N-tuple recognizer is reduced from 12.3MB to 0.66MB bytes, while the recognition rate drops from 91.64% to 91.13% for uppercase characters and from 88.44% to 87.31% for lowercase characters. The N-gram character language model was compressed from 73.6MB to 0.58MB with minimal reduction in performance.

A recursive procedure based on the recursive EM algorithm is derived to find the ML estimates. Recursive EM is a stochastic approximation procedure with a gain matrix derived from the augmented data. Under mild conditions estimates generated by such procedure are characterized by strong consistency and asymptotic normality. Because of the simple structure of the augmented data, the proposed algorithm has a simple implementation. Numerical results show that the proposed approach performs well for various parameter sets.

Recursive EM is a stochastic approximation procedure for finding the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate. Favorite features of recursive EM include strong consistency, asymptotic normality and simple implementation. However, the convergence rate associated with recursive EM is not optimal. To obtain a good convergence rate without losing the advantage of simple implementation, we propose an adaptive procedure to determine the step size at each recursion. More importantly, this approach provides a guideline for automatic design of the step size. Feasibility of REMA in practical application is demonstrated by its application to the direction finding problem. Numerical results show that the proposed method leads to satisfying convergence behavior in various scenarios.

Published hidden Markov modeling of speech uses multiple Gaussian distributions to cover the spread of the speech distribution caused by the noises, which distracts the modeling of speech event itself and and possibly sacrifices the performance on clean speech. We extend GMHMM by allowing state emission parameters to change as function of an environment-dependent continuous variable. At the recognition time, a set of HMMS specific to the given the environment is instantiated and used for recognition. Variable parameter (VP) HMM with parameters modeled as a polynomial function of the environment variable is developed. Parameter estimation based on EM-algorithm is given. With the same number of mixtures, VPHMM reduces WER by 40% compared to conventional multi-condition training.

The algorithm treats the sensor measurements as independent observations of a mixture model, and the assignment of each measurement as an independent realisation of the mixing process. A result of this is that data association between tracks and measurements is performed independently for each measurement. If the mixing proportions of the models are unknown, then the PMHT estimates them, assuming them to be time independent. For most applications, the mixing proportions will not be time independent, but rather change smoothly with time. The PMHT with Hysteresis provides a state model for the mixing proportions, allowing the PMHT to model them as random processes with arbitrary statistics.								Benes V.

The MAP algorithm with the prior information based on the Maximum Entropy (MENT) concept is presented in this work The MENT method is known as a powerful tool for solving tomography problems. Introduction of prior information entails the necessity of choosing an appropriate regularization parameter. The effectiveness of a reconstruction method depends strongly on the choice of a good parameter. In practice optimal regularization parameters are often found empirically: one needs to test a large number of parameters in order to find a reasonable good one. This paper intends to make some further contribution to the subject in developing some practical regularization parameter choice strategies in SPECT. The method for selecting an optimal regularization parameter based on the theory of a 'laminar ensemble' is studied. This statistical method has an excellent theoretical basis. Numerical tests have shown, that there is a tradeoff between the resolution and noise level of the image that changes with iteration. The regularization parameter enables us to operate the tradeoff. This nice property seems especially useful and important in real applications as it provides a feasible and stable numerical resolution. The optimal regularization parameter was defined at each iteration step automatically without requiring the user to select it. The adaptive chi-square criterion was used to control and stop the iteration process. The MAP-MENT algorithm has been tested using the 3D heart phantom. The important aim of the work was to evaluate the potential of the algorithm in the defect detection. The defect was modeled as a small region of decreased count density. In numerical experiments we investigated the convergence properties of the algorithm. Comparison to Maximum-Likelihood-based (OS EM) algorithm was performed.

Often, data collected from distinct directions are assumed to represent independent observations. This assumption is not valid for all data collection scenarios. A range of models can be developed that allow for successively more complex dependencies between measured data, up to deterministic computational electromagnetic models, in which observations from different orientations have a known relationship. We consider models for the autocovariance functions of nonstationary processes defined on a circular domain that fall between these two extremes. We adopt a model of covariance as a linear combination of periodic basis functions and address maximum-likelihood estimation of the coefficients by the method of expectation-maximization (EM). Finally, we apply these estimation methods to SAR image data and demonstrate the results as they apply to target recognition.

Image deconvolution exploits the well known sparsity of the wavelet coefficients, described by heavy-tailed priors. The present approach admits any prior given by a linear (finite of infinite) combination of Gaussian densities. To compute the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate, we propose a generalized expectation maximization (GEM) algorithm where the missing variables are the Gaussian modes. The maximization step of the EM algorithm is approximated by a stationary second order iterative method. The result is a GEM algorithm of O(N log N) computational complexity. In comparison with state-of-the-art methods, the proposed algorithm either outperforms or equals them, with low computational complexity.

It has already proven to be a useful method for image reconstruction ( [1]-[5] for the Compton-Camera). ITEM is a fast (compared to other statistical methods) and intrinsically 3D-friendly (for its low demands on memory) algorithm. Therefore it is a good candidate for a reconstruction method for computed-tomography (CT)-data. Being a statistical method, it is possible with ITEM to model the underlying physics of the imaging system better than with an analytical backprojection method like filtered backprojection (FB) and so that better images with the same data set can be obtained. Two implementations of ITEM for CT-data and the resulting images achieved with both methods are presented. Finally the results are compared with standard (FB) techniques. ITEM (algorithm as well as all of its implementations) is published under the terms of GNU/GPL [6].

The aim of this work was to evaluate the impact of the acquisition mode (2D vs 3D) on lesion detectability in WB FDG-PET studies for different lesion and patient sizes. Forty eight bed positions were acquired in thirty six patients, each in both 2D and 3D mode, 1-4 hours post-injection (740 MBq). Three spheres (1 cm, 1.3 cm and 1.6 cm diameter) containing FDG were also imaged separately in air, at ten different locations corresponding to possible lesion sites in the 48 bed positions, also each in both 2D and 3D (480 targets per condition). Each bed position was acquired for 7min in 2D and 6min in 3D and corrected for randoms. Sphere sinograms were attenuated using the exact 2D or 3D attenuation map of the patient, after scaling 2D and 3D sinograms with identical factors to ensure marginal delectability. The resulting volumes were corrected for scatter and reconstructed using ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM) in 2D and Fourier rebinning (FORE)+OSEM in 3D. Next, 2D and 3D acquisition modes were compared on the basis of performance of a three-channel Hotelling observer (CHO) which incorporated internal noise in detecting the presence of a sphere of unknown size on an anatomic background. 3D imaging yielded better lesion detectability than 2D (p<0.025, two-tailed paired t-test) in patients of typical size (Body Mass Index < 33). However 2D imaging yielded better lesion detectability than 3D in large patients (BMI > 34) as 3D performance significantly deteriorated in large patients (P<0.05). Finally, 2D and 3D yielded similar results for different lesion sizes.	Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA	El Fakhri, G (reprint author), Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA.

The observed image process G is considered as a composite of two random process: a high level process G(h), which represents the regions (or classes) that form the observed image; and a low level process G(l), which describes the statistical characteristics of each region (or class). The representation G = (G(h), G(l)) has been widely used in the image processing literature in the past two decades. In this paper, we consider the low level process G(l) as mixture of normal distributions, and we use the ExpectationMaximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the mean, the variance, and proportion for each distribution. A popular model for the high level process G h has been the Gibbs-Markov random field (GMRF) model. We introduce a novel unsupervised approach to estimate the parameters of a GMRF model. In this approach, we estimate the model parameters that maximize the posteriori probability of each pixel in a given image. The MAP estimate is obtained using a combination of genetic search and deterministic optimization using the iterated conditional mode (ICM) approach of Besag. The desired estimate of the GMRF parameters is the one corresponding to the MAP estimate. The approach has been applied on real images (Spiral CT slices) and provides satisfactory results.

The first approach employs a genetic algorithm (GA) in order to arrive at the closest synthesized image that resembles the original "observed" image. The Second approach is used to estimate the parameters of Gaussian Markov random field. Given an image formed of a number of classes, an initial class density is assumed and the parameters of the densities are estimated using the EM approach. Convergence to the true distribution is tested using the Levy distance. The segmentation of classes is performed iteratively using the ICM algorithm and a genetic algorithm (GA) search approach that provides the maximum a posteriori probability of pixel classification. During the iterations, the GA approach is used to select the clique potentials of the Gibbs-Markov models used for the observed image. The algorithm stops when a fitness function, equivalent to the maximum a posteriori probability, does not change. The approach has been tested on synthetic and real images and is shown to provide satisfactory results.

The observed image process G is considered as a composite of two random process: a high level process X, which represents the regions (or classes) that form the observed image; and a low level process Y, which describes the statistical characteristics of each region (or class). The representation G = (X, Y) has been widely used in the image processing literature in the past two decades. In this paper we will show bow to use Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to get accurate model for the low level image by using mixture of normal distribution. The main idea of the proposed algorithm is as follow: first, we will use the EM algorithm to get the most dominance mixtures in the given density (Empirical density), and then we will assume that the absolute error between the empirical density and the estimated density is another density and we will use the EM algorithm to estimates the number of mixtures in this error and the parameters for each mixtures. Then the estimated density for the absolute error is added or subtracted from the estimated density according to the sign(error). Convergence to the true distribution is tested using the Levy distance. A popular model for the high level process X has been the Gibbs-Markov random field (GMRF) model. In this paper we will use the same approach which described in [1] to estimate the parameters of GMRF. The approach has been applied on real images (Spiral CT slices) and provides satisfactory results.

The major drawback of this procedure is limited count statistics, due to time and dose considerations. It is well known that emission data also contains information about the attenuation distribution. In order to utilize this information, we have developed an attenuation map reconstruction method, which incorporates both emission and transmission data. The method is based on an existing transmission ML-EM algorithm, and the aim is to improve the photon statistics and reduce the noise in the final image. The method was evaluated using simulated data, and the results show that this new method can result in attenuation maps with a lower noise level and a more uniform noise distribution, as compared to using transmission data only.

The trial provided temporal and full azimuth view of both channels in the UMTS(1) Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA) Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) bands simultaneously via the use of a Uniform Circular Patch Array (UCPA). Extraction of the multipath components (MPC's) parameter was performed via a newly developed 2D Hybrid-Space Space-Alternating Generalized Expectation-Maximization (HS-SAGE) algorithm. Typical propagation mechanisms observed are described as seen from the respective sample Azimuth-Delay Power Spectrum (ADPS). The similarity of both duplex channels are verified. In addition, second order statistics of delay and azimuth parameters are presented where large azimuth parameters are presented where large azimuth spreads independent of mobile terminal orientation were observed.

Our system determines the identity of the user from a temporal sequence of audio and visual observations obtained from the acoustic speech and the shape of the mouth, respectively. The multi modal observation sequences are then modeled using a set of CHMMs, one for each phoneme-viseme pair and for each person in the database. The use of CHMMs in our system is justified by the capacity of this model to describe the natural audio and visual state asynchrony as well as their conditional dependency over time. To train a CHMM we first train a speaker independent model using expectation-maximization (EM), and then we build a speaker dependent model using maximum a posteriori (MAP) training. Experimental results on XM2VTS database show that our system improves the accuracy of audio-only or video-only speaker identification at all levels of acoustic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from 0 to 30db.

But the performance for such type of approaches decays when the foreground and background bear color similarities. To overcome this kind of deficiency, we present a tracking scheme based on the integration of expectation maximization (EM) and weighted color histograms. EM algorithm is used to model the background and to detect moving objects. To track the object more reliably, color histogram serves as an additional feature during the tracking process. Here we present an active search method based on the significance of color histogram bins to efficiently keep tracking object of interest within an adaptive search window. To avoid the possible pitfalls and to make the tracking process robust to shadows and illumination change, we propose an object tracking scheme based on the object chromacity in terms of hue and saturation; and also to achieve real-time requirement, we employ an adaptive target search window from the assessment of tracking speed. A demonstration of the proposed scheme will be presented.

Both human and numerical observers were employed for the task of Ga-67 tumor detection in simulated chest images. Projection data from a mathematical phantom were generated with the SIMIND Monte Carlo program. Reconstructions using De Pierro's modified-EM algorithm [1] with the 3D quadratic and Huber penalty functions were performed. Iterative corrections for nonuniform attenuation, collimator response, and in-patient scatter were included. The LROC studies with these images provided an initial validation of a channelized nonprewhitening (CNPW) numerical observer that explicitly performs the tumor search task, and at the same time demonstrated the usefulness of frequency-selective channels for modeling human detection-task performance. Results drawn from the CNPW observer indicate that for the range of iterations tested, relatively low levels of noise regularization are desirable in the penalized-likelihood images.

The main reason is the lack of suitable objective methods to evaluate the lesion. The severity of the disease is scored by doctors just through their visual examination. In this work, a system to take accurate images of dermatological lesions has been developed. Mathematical methods can be applied to these images to obtain values that summarize the lesion and help to track its evolution. The system is composed of two elements. A precise image acquisition equipment and a statistical procedure to extract the lesions from the images. The system is tested on patients with the dermatological disease psoriasis. Temporal series of images are taken for each patient and the lesions are automatically extracted. Results indicate that to the images obtained are a good source for obtaining derived variables to track the lesion.

Simultaneously modeling the two distortion sources has been a great challenge for robust speech recognition. A method, called JAC, that Jointly compensates both Additive and Convolutive distortions is presented. It uses two log-spectral domain components in speech acoustic models to represent additive and convolutive distortions. The method adapts HMM mean vectors with a noise estimate and a channel estimate. The noise estimate is calculated from the pre-utterance pause and the channel estimate is calculated using an EM algorithm from speech utterances produced in the distortion environment. Evaluated on a noisy speech database recorded in-vehicle with a hands-free distant microphone in several driving conditions, the algorithm reduces recognition word error rate in typical operation conditions by an order of magnitude.

We treat the frames in a sequence collectively as a single function of both space and time, and define a temporal prior to account for the temporal correlations in a sequence. This temporal prior is defined in a form of motion-compensation, aimed to follow the curved trajectories of the object motion through space-time. The image frames are then obtained through estimation using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed algorithm was evaluated extensively using the 4D gated mathematical cardiac-torso (gMCAT) D1.01 phantom to simulate gated SPECT perfusion imaging with Tc99m. Our experimental results demonstrate that the use of motion compensation for reconstruction can lead to significant improvement in image quality and reconstruction accuracy.

We here use high rate quantization theory to develop a variation of an information theoretic extremal property for Gaussian sources and its extension to Gauss mixtures. This extends a method originally used for LPC speech vector quantization to provide a clustering approach to the design of Gauss mixture models. The theory provides formulas relating minimum discrimination information (MDI) selection of Gaussian components of a Gauss mixture and the mean squared error resulting when the MDI criterion is used in an optimized robust classified vector quantizer. It also provides motivation for the use of Gauss mixture models for robust compression systems for random vectors with estimated second order moments but unknown distributions.

A unique key feature of the proposed framework is the analysis of the image-sequence input as a single entity as opposed to a sequence of separate frames. The extracted space-time regions allow for the detection and identification of disease events and processes, such as the appearance and progression of lesions. According to the proposed methodology, coherent space-time regions in the feature space, and corresponding coherent segments in the video content are extracted by unsupervised clustering via Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM). The parameters of the GMM are determined via the maximum likelihood principle and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The clustering of the image sequence yields a collection of regions (blobs) in a four-dimensional feature space (including intensity, position (x,y), and time). Regions corresponding to MS lesions are automatically identified based on criteria regarding the mean intensity and the size variability over time. The proposed methodology was applied to a registered sequence of 24 T2-weighted MR images acquired from an MS, patient over a period of approximately a year. Examples of preliminary qualitative results are shown.

J	Hamon, A; Iovleff, S				Hamon, A; Iovleff, S			Three stochastic versions of the EM algorithm for estimating longitudinal Rasch model	COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						Rasch model; stochastic algorithm; longitudinal binary data	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; INCOMPLETE DATA; MONTE-CARLO; CONVERGENCE	The Rasch model is a latent variable model which is widely used for the analysis of psychological data and recently for the study of quality of life data in medicine. In this article we propose an extension of the Rasch model to the case of repeated measurements of quality of life. The complex form of the likelihood function implies that it is impossible to find directly estimates. The classical EM algorithm is not a practical solution in the present context. So we propose to use three stochastic versions of the EM: the MCEM, SEM algorithms and a new algorithm we call SGEM. Some theoretical properties of these three algorithms are exposed. Illustrations with simulated and real data are given.

Recursive processing requires some kind of sufficient statistic for representing the information collected up to a certain time step. For this purpose, the probability density functions of the state are especially well suited. Once they are available, almost any type of point estimate, e.g. mean, mode, or median, can be derived. In the case of continuous states, however, the exact probability density functions characterizing the state estimate are in general either not feasible or not well suited for recursive processing. Hence, approximations of the true densities are generally inevitable, where Gaussian mixture approximations are convenient for a number of reasons. However, calculating appropriate mixture parameters that minimize a global measure of deviation from the true density is a tough optimization task. Here, we propose a new approximation method that minimizes the squared integral deviation between the true density and its mixture approximation. Rather than trying to solve the original problem, it is converted into a corresponding system of explicit ordinary first-order differential equations. This system of differential equations is then solved over a finite "time" interval, which is an efficient way of calculating the desired optimal parameter values. We focus on the measurement update in the important case of vector states and scalar measurements. In addition, approximation densities with separable kernels are assumed. It will be shown, that if the measurement nonlinearities are also separable, the required multidimensional integrals can be reduced to the product of one-dimensional integrals. For several important types of measurement functions including polynomial measurement nonlinearities, closed-form analytic expressions for the coefficients of the system of differential equations are available.

In the algorithm, a novel UWB signal model which is an extention of the conventional wideband signal model is employed in order to estimate the UWB channel with SAGE algorithm. The algorithm divides the measured data into individual ray paths and estimates the directions of arrival, propagation time, and the variation of the amplitude and phase during the propagation for each signal. The measurement campaign in indoor environment was conducted and it was shown that the algorithm could correctly extract the inherent propagation phenomena of the channel. The estimation result can be very useful for the design and analysis of UWB communication system, especially for the evaluation of waveform distortion and multipath effect.

Psychophysical experiments have pinpointed a number of specific human behaviors that may contribute to accurate speech recognition, but previous attempts to incorporate such behaviors into automatic speech recognition have often failed because the resulting models could not be easily trained from data. This paper describes Bayesian learning methods for computational models of human speech perception. Specifically, the linked computational models proposed in this paper seek to imitate the following human behaviors: independence of distinctive feature errors, perceptual magnet effect, the vowel sequence illusion, sensitivity to energy onsets and offsets, and redundant use of asynchronous acoustic correlates. The proposed models differ from many previous computational psychological models in that the desired behavior is learned from data, using a constrained optimization algorithm (the EM algorithm), rather than being coded into the model as a series of fixed rules.

These signals are usually small in amplitude and are embedded in background electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. To analyze them the most common method used is to perform a simple averaging of time aligned ERP segments. However, this method assumes that the ERP signal will not change from segment to segment. In reality, this assumption is not true since the ERP may reflect the activity of cognitive mechanisms in the brain that may change over time. The failure to satisfy this assumption will result in loss of information after the averaging. Here we describe a method to analyze a single segment ERP in noise using the Wavelet Transform and the Hidden Markov Tree model. The goal is to reduce the noise content in the signal.

A 3D acquisition of a low activity cylinder was performed upon an EXACT3D PET scanner followed by a multi-trial single plane simulation based upon this scan, taking into account randoms, scatter and attenuation. These were reconstructed using different implementations of Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximisation, including the simple case of fully precorrected data and also using a separate randoms estimate with the Shifted Poisson and Prompts approaches. The effect of estimating the mean of randoms from the noisy delayed randoms with a Maximum Likelihood technique was also investigated.

A common method for segmentation of moving regions in image sequences involves "background subtraction", namely, thresholding the error between an estimate of the image without moving objects and the current image. The numerous approaches to this problem differ in the type of background model used and the procedure used to update the model. One possible approach to this problem is to model the attributes of the pixels. In order to segment a larger image in reasonable time and obtain better results, an algorithm of segmenting background based on temporal spatial information of pixels is proposed in this paper. Firstly, adaptive pixel models are modeled to describe the recent history of color at each observed pixel. Then each pixel is classified,as background or foreground according to pixel models and the spatial relation between pixels. Finally, parameters of pixel models are updated using on-tine EM algorithm. Experimental results show that our approach is suitable for segmenting foreground from background in dynamic environments.

Such a model does not accurately reflect the statistics of co-channel interference, a dominant source of signal disturbance that limits the capacity of most cellular networks. Consequently, the performance of receivers designed based on the Gaussian model is often far from optimum in a heavily loaded network. In this paper, we explore the potential of suppressing interference in channel estimation by using a non-Gaussian noise model of the signal disturbance. An EM-based, iterative algorithm is derived for jointly estimating the channel response and the parameters that characterize the non-Gaussian noise model. As an example, we also consider a special case where the non-Gaussian model has a constant envelope characteristic. Using the GSM/EDGE air interface, we demonstrate that significant performance gains can be obtained with the proposed channel estimation algorithm when a dominant GMSK-modulated interference exists. The proposed algorithm can also be used in combination with equalizers designed for non-Gaussian noise models to provide further performance gains.

We first develop a model for such a system with two transmits and one or two receive antennas. Different receiver algorithms are proposed including maximum ratio combining (MRC), minimum mean square error (MMSE), parallel interference cancellation (PIC), and interference cancellation based on expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Performance of these different receivers is illustrated by numerical results in a system with 5MHz bandwidth at 2.5 GHz over some of ITU channel models. It is shown that STBC MC-CDMA with two-transmit one-receive antenna has better performance than single-input single-output (SISO) MC-CDMA system. And the performance can be further highly improved by adding an extra receive antenna.

It is combination of the well known EM algorithm and a recently proposed vector quantization method called LBG-U. By using LBG-U to initialize the centers of the mixture components we were able to achieve better density estimates than with randomly initialized centers or with centers initialized by traditional LBG (a.k.a. batch k-Means). The empirical study performed two (of three) investigated data sets also indicated that the variance of the results for the new method is significantly lower than for the other two methods. Therefore our novel approach makes estimations from different initializations more consistent.

Motion can be found as differences in successive scans. The main challenge in doing so from a mobile platform is to distinguish differences originating from the platforms own motion from those caused by objects moving in the robot's vicinity. We tackle this combining localization and data association based on an a-priori obtained map. Localization and data association is done using the EM-algorithm. Elements, which are not in the map are singled out as outliers. Subtracting them over time provides motion information. To reduce the complexity of each iteration step we chose a feature-based environment model, which reduces the computations required to a fraction. We use simulations to test our method against a known ground-truth. Results based on real-world data from the exhibition Robotics @Expo.02 are used to evaluate the proposed method under real-world conditions in highly dynamic situations with several hundred visitors per hour.

The problem of coinciding partials and interference among them in general is mitigated by the constraints on the "weak" partials on the stronger ones of the same harmonic source. A useful scheme to determine the weakness of a partial is proposed.

The problem of coinciding partials and interference among them in general is mitigated by the constraints on the "weak" partials on the stronger ones of the same harmonic source. A useful scheme to determine the weakness of a partial is proposed. The constrained iteration is shown to give more accurate estimates of the sinusoidal parameters which results in good source separation even in most cases of highly overlapping spectra.

For projection space decomposition (PSD), the forward projection is completely parallel, but backprojection requires a slow image synchronization. For image space decomposition (ISD), the communication associated with forward projection :an be overlapped with calculation, and the communication associated with backprojection is more efficient. To compare these methods, an implementation of 3D OSEM for three PET scanners is developed that runs on an experimental, 9-node, 18-processor cluster computer. For selected benchmarks, both methods exhibit speedups in excess of for 9 nodes, and comparable performance for the tested range of cluster sizes.

The main idea is to decompose the image into homogeneous and non-homogeneous blocks and then compress them using BTC or VQ. This block classification is achieved using an image segmentation based on the EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm. The use of the EM algorithm results in a good robust segmentation with well behaved boundaries. The segmented image is then used to specify whether BTC or VQ is used to encode a block by assessing if it contains all pixels from a homogeneous or non-homogeneous region. BTC provides a simple and effective method for coding blocks which contain a lot of information or distinct edges due to its two-level quantizer. However, its lowest attainable bit rate is limited and it often introduces blocking effect in homogeneous regions. VQ on the other hand is more efficient due to a multilevel quantizer and thus results in better compression ratios. However, it does not retain any spatial information about the edges, resulting in stair casing effects. Previous attempts to combine both techniques into a hybrid algorithm only make use of simple measures such as image variance. Results for medical images show that this approach yields significant improvements over traditional BTC or VQ coding when used alone.

The x-ray system comprises a commercially available micro-focus x-ray tube and a CCD-based x-ray camera. X-ray transmission measurements are performed based on cone-beam geometry. Individual projections are acquired by rotating the animal about a vertical axis in front of the CCD detector. A high-resolution CT image is obtained after reconstruction using an ordered subsets-expectation maximization (OS-EM) reconstruction algorithm. The SPECT system utilizes a compact semiconductor camera module previously developed in our group. The module is mounted perpendicular to the x-ray tube/CCD combination. It consists of a 64 x 64 pixellated CdZnTe detector and a parallel-hole tungsten collimator. The field of view is 1 square inch. Planar projections for SPECT reconstruction are obtained by rotating the animal in front of the detector. Gamma-ray and x-ray images are presented of phantoms and mice. Procedures for merging the anatomical and functional images are discussed.

Many important types of tissue have characteristic enhancement patterns; for example, in magnetic resonance (MR) mammography, malignancies exhibit a characteristic "wash out" temporal pattern, while in MR angiography, arteries, veins and parenchyma each have their own distinctive temporal signature. In such image sequences, there are substantial changes in intensities; however, this change is due primarily to the contrast agent rather than the motion of scene elements. As a result, the task of segmenting contrast-enhanced images poses interesting new challenges for computer vision. In this paper, we propose a new image segmentation algorithm for image sequences with contrast enhancement, using a model-based time series analysis of individual pixels. We use energy minimization via graph cuts to efficiently ensure spatial coherence. The energy is minimized in an expectation-maximization fashion that alternates between segmenting the image into a number of non-overlapping regions and finding the temporal profile parameters which best describe the behavior of each region. Preliminary experiments on MR mammography and MR angiography studies show the algorithm's ability to find an accurate segmentation.

This study presents a new approach to estimate accurately the true tissue tracer activity within the grey matter tissue compartment. The methodology is. based on the availability of additional anatomical side information and on the assumption that activity concentration within the white matter tissue compartment is constant. Starting from an initial estimate for the white matter activity and for the grey matter activity, the true tracer activity within. the grey matter tissue compartment is estimated by a ML-EM-algorithm. During the updating step the constant activity concentration within the white matter compartment is modelled in the forward projection in order to reconstruct the true activity distribution within the grey tissue compartment, hence reducing partial volume averaging. On his turn, the estimate for the constant activity in the white matter tissue compartment is updated based on the new estimated activity distribution in the grey matter tissue compartment. We have tested this methodology by means of computer simulations. A T1-weighted MR brainscan of a patient was segmented into white matter, grey matter and cerebrospinal fluid, using the segmentation package of the SPM-software (Statistical Parametric Mapping). The segmented grey and white matter were used to simulate a SPELT acquisition; modelling the noise and the distance dependant detector response:: Scatter and attenuation were ignored. Following the above described strategy, simulations have shown it is possible to reconstruct the true activity distribution for the grey matter tissue compartment (activity/tissue volume), assuming constant activity in the white matter tissue compartment.

Quite often in real world applications, the signals to be estimated contain unknown parameters which need to be determined. Herein, we develop and analyze non-recursive and recursive methods, which can deal with combined state and parameter estimation for nonlinear partially-observed stochastic systems. For the non-recursive method, we obtain the unknown parameters through solving a system of non-singular finite order linear equations. For the recursive method, we generalize the least squares method and develop a particle prediction error identification algorithm so that it can be applied to general nonlinear stochastic systems. We use the branching particle filter to do the signal state estimation and implement simulations for both methods.

At modeling time, a generative model of local descriptors is learned from sample images using the EM algorithm. The EM framework allows the incorporation of unsegmented multi-texture images into the training set. The second modeling step consists of gathering co-occurrence statistics of neighboring descriptors. At recognition time, initial probabilities computed from the generative model are refined using a relaxation step that incorporates cooccurrence statistics. Performance is evaluated on images of an indoor scene and pictures of wild animals.

One natural way for color image segmentation is to do pixels clustering in color space. GMM has been applied for this task. However, practice has shown that GMM doesn't perform this task well in original color space. Our basic idea is to solve the segmentation in a nonlinear feature space obtained by kernel methods. The scheme is that we propose an extension of EM algorithm for GMM by involving one kernel feature extraction step, which is called K-EM. With the technique based on Monte Carlo sampling and mapping, K-EM not only speeds up kernel step, but also automatically extracts good features for clustering in a nonlinear way. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm has satisfactory performance. The contribution of this paper could be summarized into two points: one is that we introduced kernel methods to solve real computer vision problem, the other is that we proposed an efficient scheme for kernel methods applied in large scale problems.

However, since iterative reconstructions typically are comprised of repeatedly projecting and backprojecting the data, the computational load required for reconstructing an image highly depends on the performance of the projector-backprojector pair used in the algorithm. In this work we compare quantitative performance of representative methods for implementing projector-backprojector pairs-ray-tracing methods, rotation-based methods, and pixel-driven methods. To reduce the overall cost for the projection-backprojection operations for each method, we investigate how previously computed results can be reused so that the number of redundant calculations can be minimized. Our experimental results demonstrate that, while the rotation based methods can be useful for simplifying the correction of important physical factors, the computational cost to achieve good accuracy is considerably higher than that of the ray-tracing methods.

However, models with nonlinear relationships are often encountered in social and behavioral sciences. In this article, an EM type algorithm is developed for maximum likelihood estimation of a general nonlinear structural equation model. To avoid computation of the complicated multiple integrals involved, the E-step is completed by a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The M-step can be completed efficiently by simple conditional maximization. Convergence is monitored by bridging sample and standard errors estimates are obtained via Louis's formula. The methodology is illustrated with a real example.

When this joint differential entropy is parameterized on the dimension of this parameter vector, then, based on Jaynes' Principle, minimizing maximum joint differential entropy over the dimension of parameter vector provides means for detecting the number of parameters from the observed data. By linking the dimension of parameter vector to the image regions, a minimizing maximum entropy (MME) criterion for detecting the number of image regions in the image characterized by Finite Normal Mixture (FNM) is developed. The results obtained by applying MME to the simulated and real phantom images demonstrate that MME works consistently with other information theoretic criteria such as AIC and MDL, and also possesses its own meanings.

The former is based on statistical properties and stochastic models of the image and the latter utilizes geometric and topological models. In this study, Markov random field (MRF) theory / model based image segmentation and Fuzzy Connectedness (FC) theory / Fuzzy connected object delineation are chosen as the representatives for these two approaches, respectively. The comparative study is focused on their theoretical foundations and main operative procedures. The MRF is defined on a lattice and the associated neighborhood system and is based on the Markov property. The FC method is defined on a fuzzy digital space and is based on fuzzy relations. Locally, MRF is characterized by potentials of cliques, and FC is described by fuzzy adjacency and affinity relations. Globally, MRF is characterized by Gibbs distribution, and FC is described by fuzzy connectedness. The task of MRF model based image segmentation is to seek a realization of the embedded MRF through a two-level operation: partitioning and labeling. The task of FC object delineation is to extract a fuzzy object from a given scene, through a two-step operation: recognition and delineation. Theoretical foundations which underly statistical and structural approaches and the principles of the main operative procedures in image segmentation by these two approaches demonstrate more similarities than differences between them. Two approaches can also complement each other, particularly in seed selection, scale formation, affinity and object membership function design for FC and neighbor set selection and clique potential design for MRF.

We consider a data set containing all names and locations of about 58,000 lakes in Finland. Using computational techniques, we address two major onomastic themes. First, we address the existence of local dependencies or repulsion between occurrences of names. For this, we derive a simple form of spatial association rules. The results partially validate and partially contradict results obtained by traditional onomastic techniques. Second, we consider the existence of relatively homogeneous spatial regions with respect to the distributions of place names. Using mixture modeling, we conduct a global analysis of the data set. The clusterings of regions are spatially connected, and correspond quite well with the results obtained by other techniques; there are, however, interesting differences with previous hypotheses.

The method performs intensity-based tissue classification using multispectral magnetic resonance (MR) images based on a stochastic model. With the existence of white Gaussian noise and spatially invariant blurring in acquired MR images, a Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) domain Wiener filter is applied for an accurate noise reduction and resolution restoration on blurred and noisy images to minimize the partial volume effect (PVE), which is a major limiting factor for the quantitative analysis. Following that, we utilize a Markov random field Gibbs model to integrate the local spatial information into the established expectation-maximization model-fitting algorithm. Each voxel is then classified by a mixture-based maximum a posterior (MAP) criterion, indicating its probabilities of belonging to each class, i.e., each voxel is labeled as a mixel with different tissue percentages, leading to further minimization of the PVE. The volumes of WM, GM and CSF are extracted from the mixture-based segmentation and the corresponding brain atrophies are computed. In this study, we have investigated the accuracy and repeatability of the algorithm with inclusion of noise analysis and point spread function for image resolution enhancement. Experimental results on both phantom and healthy volunteer studies are presented.

It considers a sequence of feature vectors as one single composite token in training or testing. In contrast to the traditional EM algorithm, this algorithm is derived from a discriminative objective, aiming at directly minimizing the recognition error. Compared to the gradient-descent algorithms for discriminative training, this algorithm invokes a mild assumption which leads to closed-form formulas for re-estimation, rather than relying on gradient search, without sacrificing the algorithmic rigor. As such, it is in general much faster than a descent based algorithm and does not need to determine the learning rate or step size. Our experiment shows that the proposed algorithm reduces error rate by 14.65, 66.46, and 100.00% for 1, 5, and 10 seconds of testing data respectively, in a speaker identification application.

Unlike the conventional FBP- (filtered backprojection) and EM- (expectation maximization) type algorithms, we utilize as much system response information as we can during the reconstruction process. This information can be pre-measured during the calibration process and stored in the computer. By selecting different sampling schemes for the point response measurement, different system kernel matrices are obtained. Reconstruction utilizing these kernels generates a set of reconstructed images of the same source. Based on these reconstructed images and their corresponding sampling schemes, we are able to achieve a high resolution final image that best represents the object. Because a uniform attenuation, resolution variation and some other effects are included during the formation of the system kernel matrices, the reconstruction from the acquired projection data also compensates for all these effects correctly.

Each wavelet coefficient is modeled as a Guanssian Mixture model, and the dependencies among wavelet coefficients in each subband are described by a context structure, then the structure is modified by blocks which are connected areas in a scale conditioned on the same context. Before denoising signal, efficient Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithms are developed for fitting the HMMs to observational signal data. Parameters of trained HMM are used to modify wavelet coefficients according to the rule of minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) of signal. Then, reverse wavelet transformation is utilized to modify wavelet coefficients. Finally, experimental results are given. The results show Block hidden Markov model (BHMM) is a powerful yet simple tool in signal denoising.

In order to find the parameters of the proposed Bayesian model we present a new generalization of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm based on the variational approximation methodology. The proposed variational-based algorithm for BID can be derived in closed form and can be implemented in the discrete Fourier domain. Thus, it is very efficient even for very large images. We demonstrate with numerical experiments that the algorithm which was derived by the variational methodology yields promising improvements as compared to previous Bayesian algorithms for BID. Furthermore, the methodology presented here is very general with potential applications to other Bayesian models for this and other imaging problems.

Most mapping algorithms rely on a static world assumption, which cannot model non-stationary objects (chairs, desks,...). This paper describes an extension to the well-known occupancy grid mapping technique [5,10] for learning models of non-stationary objects. Our approach uses a map differencing technique to extract snapshots of non-stationary objects. It then employs the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to learn models of these objects, and to solve the data association problem that arises when objects are seen at different places at different points in time. A Bayesian version of Occam's razor is applied to determine the number of different objects in the model. Experimental results obtained in two different indoor environments illustrate that our approach robustly solves the data association problem, and generates accurate models of environments with non-stationary objects.

HRAD overcomes the limitation in resolution of the conventional Atomic Decomposition, and is utilized as the initial estimate for EM. EM with HRAD outperforms other existing methods, such as single HRAD, conventional AD, and conventional AD plus EM. The Cramer-Rao Bound is used as a benchmark in the comparison, and shows the efficiency of the suggested method for high signal-to-noise ratio. The signals are modeled as chirplets.

The algorithm is based on the 4D extension of the expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm. The EM algorithm uses a 4D probabilistic cardiac atlas to estimate the initial model parameters and to integrate spatially-varying a-priori information into the classification process. It provides space and time-varying probability maps for the left and right ventricle, the myocardium, and background structures such as the liver, stomach, lungs and skin. The segmentation algorithm also incorporates spatial and temporal contextual information by using 4D Markov Random Fields (MRF). After the classification, the largest connected component of each structure is used as a global connectivity filter that improves the results significantly, especially for the myocardium. Validation against manual segmentations and computation of the correlation between manual and automatic segmentation on 249 3D volumes were calculated. Results show that the procedure can successfully segment the left ventricle (LV) (r=0.96), myocardium (r=0.92) and right ventricle (RV) (r=0.92).

Though similar in structure, the EBF network differs from the well-known radial basis function (RBF) network by incorporating full covariance matrices and uses the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the basis functions. Since remotely sensed data often take on mixture-density distributions in the feature space, the proposed network not only possesses the advantage of the RBF mechanism but also utilizes the EM algorithm to compute the maximum likelihood estimates of the mean vectors and covariance matrices of a Gaussian mixture distribution in the training phase. Experimental results show that the EM-based EBF network is faster in training, more accurate, and simpler in structure.

We investigate this approach and focus on the application of space-time block codes (STBC) and space-frequency block codes (SFBC) in OFDM systems. We compare the performance of maximum likelihood (ML), zero forcing (ZF) and conventional detection algorithms. We show that ZF provides a good trade-off between computational complexity and performance. The problem of channel estimation in STBC-OFDM and SFBC-OFDM system is also studied, including the derivation of the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Since knowledge of the channel is required to coherently decode STBC-OFDM and SFBC-OFDM, we propose an iterative channel estimation algorithm based on the EM algorithm that requires very few pilot symbols. The CRLB can be achieved by the channel estimation algorithm.

In this paper we propose an enhanced channel estimation algorithm that combines the EM-based algorithms proposed previously and a Least Squares polynomial fitting (LSPF) approach. The combined algorithm can efficiently estimate the channel response of an OFDM system operating in an environment with multipath fading and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The algorithm can improve the channel estimate obtained from the EM-based algorithms by polynomial fitting. Simulation results show that the bit error rate (BER) as well as the mean square error (MSE) of the channel can be improved by the algorithm. In particular, with these additional computations and demodulation delay, the MSE can be made smaller than the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB).

Classifiers are selected sequentially on-line based on a context specific (data driven) formulation of classifier optimality. A finite subset of a large (or infinite) set of classifiers is used for classification resulting not only in a computational saving, but a boost in classification performance. Experiments were carried out using single class binary classifiers on multi-class classification problems. Classifier outputs are combined using a Bayesian approach and results show a significant improvement in classification accuracy over the AdaBoost.MH method.

We describe and demonstrate the effectiveness of a method for the issue of predicting protein-protein interactions, using a stochastic model as model for combining the data of protein-protein interactions with existing knowledge of proteins. In this paper we consider a classification of proteins as the knowledge, and in a normally available classification of proteins, a protein falls into multiple classes. Focusing on this property of protein classes, we use the class of proteins as a latent variable in the stochastic model and estimate the model parameters with both the interaction data and protein classes using time-efficient EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm. We evaluate the method with the experiment using actual protein-protein interactions and a classification of proteins, and experimental results have shown that the method significantly outperformed other methods tested in our experiments.

This work proposes a method to address the modeling and correction of scatter in PET studies when using the 3-D list-mode expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The rationale of this technique is to directly incorporate an estimated scatter function into the system model of the 3-D list-mode EM algorithm. In this initial work, the scatter model assumes that the scatter distribution can be described by a convolution of the true activity estimate with a scatter kernel. For small-volume studies acquired with the quad-HIDAC, it is expected that convolution with a shift-invariant scatter kernel will he adequate to describe the broad scatter distributions encountered. It is anticipated that the method proposed here will offer an improvement upon techniques that use subtraction of the scatter background estimate.

We consider the use of normal mixture models to cluster data sets of continuous multivariate data, concentrating on some of the associated computational issues. A robust version of this approach to clustering is obtained by modelling the data by a mixture of t distributions (Peel and McLachlan, 2000). The normal and t mixture models can be fitted by maximum likelihood via the EM algorithm, as implemented in the EMMIX software of the authors. We report some recent results of McLachlan and Ng (2000) on speeding up the fitting process by an an incremental version of the EM algorithm. The problem of clustering high-dimensional data by use of the mixture of factor analyzers model (McLachlan and Peel, 2000b) is also considered. This approach enables a normal mixture model to be fitted to data which have high dimension relative to the number of data points to be clustered.

We are now constructing a prototype SPECT system with three such detectors mounted on a rotating gantry. Each detector comprises a 12 cm diameter circular array of NaI(TI) crystals, each 1x1x5 mm(3) on a 1.25 mm pitch. Each crystal array is coupled to a Hamamatsu R3292 12.7 cm diameter PS-PMT. Signals from the three detectors are read out by a custom subtractive resistive circuit and multiplexed. Data are acquired by a National Instruments PCI-6110E board running on a Macintosh dual processor G4 computer under Kmax software control. Images are reconstructed using a 3D iterative MAP-EM algorithm based on a multi-pinhole forward and back projector. The trade-off between contrast and variance was studied by simulation for a number of multi-pinhole configurations. We also performed initial planar imaging studies on one of the detectors. Our results indicate that spatial resolution approaching 1 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) can be achieved with a single pinhole aperture, while improved contrast and variance may result from using optimized multi-pinhole apertures.

It consists of a series of novel methods which utilize theory from image processing, deformable models and finite elements. Our framework consists of several steps. In the first step we use Gabor Filter banks and deformable models for the automatic segmentation of tagging lines and cardiac boundaries. The extracted tagging lines and boundaries are then used as input to a volumetric deformable model for the heart's motion estimation analysis. In this step we first extract parameters that can determine the difference between a normal and a pathologic heart motion. Second, using an Expectation-Maximization methodology (EM) we are able to determine a given heart's stress-strain relationship and fiber orientation. Our hypothesis is that the 3D shape and motion analysis of the heart will allow the faster and timely diagnosis of heart disease compared to traditional 2D methods.

These works assume each unlabeled sample originates from one of the (known) classes. Here, we consider the scenario in which unlabeled points may belong either to known/predefined or to heretofore undiscovered classes. There are several practical situations where such data may arise. We propose a novel statistical mixture model which views as observed data not only the feature vector and the class label, but also the fact of label presence/absence for each point. Two types of mixture components are posited to explain label presence/absence. "Predefined" components generate both labeled and unlabeled points and assume labels are missing at random. "Non-predefined" components only generate unlabeled points - thus, in localized regions, they capture data subsets that are exclusively unlabeled. Such subsets may represent an outlier distribution, or new classes. The components' predefined/non-predefined natures are data-driven. learned along with the other parameters via an algorithm based on expectation-maximization (EM). There are three natural applications: 1) robust classifier design, given a mixed training set with outliers; 2) classification with rejections; 3) identification of the unlabeled points (and their representative components) that originate from unknown classes, i.e. new class discovery.

These works assume each unlabeled sample originates from one of the (known) classes. Here, we consider the scenario in which unlabeled points may belong either to known/predefined or to heretofore undiscovered classes. There are several practical situations where such data may arise. We earlier proposed a novel statistical mixture model to fit this mixed data. Here we review this method and also introduce an alternative model. Our fundamental strategy is to view as observed data not only the feature vector and the class label, but also the fact of label presence/absence for each point. Two types of mixture components are posited to explain label presence/absence. "Predefined" components generate both labeled and unlabeled points and assume labels are missing at random.

The effectiveness of our models in discovering purely unlabeled data components (potential new classes) is evaluated both on synthetic and real data sets. Although each of our models has its own advantages, our original model is found to achieve the best class discovery results.

In this approach, we estimate the number of classes in a data set as well as the parameters of each class. This approach doesn't require training samples. A scene is modeled as a realization of a random field formed of a mixture distribution. We employ an EM algorithm to estimate the parameters of this mixture. The algorithm iterates to estimate the proper number of classes that compose the scene, and also the parameters of these classes. Theoretically, the algorithm can be applied for arbitrary forms of distributions for the classes in the scene, either parametric or non parametric. This paper focuses on the parametric estimation case. The approach has been applied to synthetic and real world multispectral data and provided quite encouraging results compared to other classical classification approaches.

The first algorithm uses the Support Vector Machines (SVM) as a multi-dimensional density estimator. This algorithm is a supervised one in the sense that it needs in advance, the specification of the number of classes and a training sample for each class. The second algorithm employs the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, in an unsupervised way, for estimating the number of classes and the parameters of each class in the data set. Performance comparison of the presented algorithms shows that the SVM- based classifier outperforms those based on Gaussian-based and Parzen window algorithms. We also show that the EM based classifier provides comparable results to Gaussian-based and Parzen window-based while it is an unsupervised algorithm.

Reconstruction produced by ML-algorithm has been found noisy because it does not make use of available prior knowledge. Bayesian estimation provides such a platform for the inclusion of prior knowledge in the reconstruction procedure. But modeling a prior distribution is a cumbersome task and needs a lot of insight. In this work, we have proposed a conditional entropy maximization algorithm for PET modality, which is a generalization of maximum likelihood algorithm. We have imposed self-normalization condition for the determination of prior distribution. It is found that as prior distribution tends to uniform distribution, the conditional entropy maximization algorithm reduces to maximum likelihood algorithm. Simulated experimental results have shown that images reconstructed using maximum entropy algorithm are qualitatively better than those generated by ML-algorithm.

The power of Bayesian estimation lies in its ability to incorporate the prior distribution knowledge, enabling better reconstruction. Proper specification of clique potentials in Bayesian estimation plays a crucial role in the reconstruction process by favors the presence of desired characteristics in the image lattice like nearest neighbor interactions and homogeneity. Homogenous Markov random fields have been successfully used for modeling Such interactions. Though, reconstruction produced by such models are far more efficient, they often require large iterations for producing an approximate reconstruction. To deal with this problem, we have extended the Bayesian estimation in order to support sharp reconstruction. We propose to use sharp potential in Bayesian estimation once an approximate reconstruction is available using homogenous potentials in Bayesian domain The advantage of the proposed potential is its ability to recognize correlated nearest neighbors. The proposed reconstruction is a hybrid of both smooth and sharp potential in Bayesian framework and hence it is termed as hybrid reconstruction. Simulated experiments have shown that the proposed hybrid estimation method produces superior and sharp reconstruction as compared to the reconstruction produced by other Bayesian estimation methods.

The paper describes the first steps towards an adaptable robotic platform, capable of learning behaviours. This involves learning a new low-level behaviour 'on the fly' and integrating it into the existing set of behaviours. The first task selected for the robot to learn is obstacle avoidance. The paper will introduce an innovative and structured method of building knowledge acquired during robotic explorations. The aim is to make direct use of sensory information to construct abstractions of 'perceptions' and build strategies based on constructed knowledge to solve simple navigation tasks.

We present a unified probabilistic framework for motif discovery that incorporates evolutionary information. We treat aligned DNA sequence as a mixture of evolutionary models, for motif and background, and, following the example of the MEME program, provide an algorithm to estimate the parameters by Expectation-Maximization. We examine a variety of evolutionary models and show that our approach can take advantage of phylogenic information to avoid false positives and discover motifs upstream of groups of characterized target genes. We compare our method to traditional motif finding on only conserved regions. An implementation will be made available at http://rana.lbl.gov.

A first motion detection gives us regions with several segmentation problems due to bad acquisition conditions. The tracking step, which has to manage all these problems, is realized with the EM algorithm (Expectation Maximization). It uses a kinematic model: we suppose a rectilinear and uniform apparent motion, this hypothesis seems very restrictive but remains locally accurate in most of applications. Good results are obtained with this approach on several sequences, without any initialization.

Moreover, texture image patches when translated, rotated or scaled lie in low dimensional subspaces of the high-dimensional space spanned by the grey values. These two aspects make the mixture of local subspace models worth consideration for segmenting this type of images. In recent years a number of mixtures of local PCA models have been proposed. Most of these models require the user to set the number of subspaces and subspace dimensionalities. To make the model autonomous, we propose a greedy EM algorithm to find a suboptimal number of subspaces, besides using a global retained variance ratio to estimate for each subspace the dimensionality that retains the given variability ratio. We provide experimental results for testing the proposed method on texture segmentation.

Detection of these drives is usually performed using bivariate or multivariate measurements. We investigate the possibility of detecting these drives from single motor unit recordings. A computational model of the surface electromyogram was used to examine the variability of the instantaneous firing rate intervals of synchronised motor unit trains. The model generated distributions of this variability suggest that they arise from a mixture of two separate Gaussian distributions. A constrained version of the expectation-maximization algorithm is used to determine the component density means which are related to the descending drive frequencies. This algorithm is tested against a variety of drive frequencies and drive strengths.

However, such a system does not always generate them correctly. As a result, human instructors have to check the generated questions and remove the errors. In this paper, we propose a technique for removing errors in the generated questions. The technique uses EM algorithm in order to estimate the generated accuracy (probability of correct answer) of each question. In the experiment using our E-learning system which generates grammatical questions from English corpus, we can remove errors in the questions.

We evaluated fully-4D reconstruction techniques as well as conventional frame-by-frame reconstruction approaches and their ability to provide consistent striatal binding ratios for both normal and patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We also used the Zubal brain phantom to compare the different reconstruction strategies. A 3-headed Picker-3000 SPECT system fitted with low-energy ultra-high resolution fan-beam collimators acquired 10 frames of dynamic SPECT data in 4-min acquisitions over a period of 40 minutes. Each set of 128 x 128 projections were acquired at 120 angles over 360degrees. The dynamic data sequence was using two conventional frame-by-frame reconstruction methods namely, filtered back-projection (FBP) with multiplicative Chang attenuation correction (AC) and re-scaled block-iterative expectation-maximization (RBI-EM) with uniform AC. We also considered two fully-4D reconstructions methods, the KL-EM that exploits the Karhunen-Loeve transform (or principal component analysis) and a dynamic expectation maximization algorithm or DSPECT that incorporates dynamic inequality constraints in the reconstructed object voxel activity over time. Both 4D methods were implemented with uniform AC. From the results, it is clear that both the 4D methods are more robust in handling the lowcount dynamic data. However, derived parameters such as the binding ratio might be more insensitive to noise, although in the patient study FBP binding ratios differed greatly from that of the other reconstruction strategies.

A recent Monte-Carlo study has also shown that for scatter correction (SC) in particular, selection of an appropriate strategy can impact cardiac uniformity. The spatial domain based effective source scatter estimation (ESSE) technique was shown to provide more robust performance in improving cardiac uniformity than the triple-energy window (TEW) method which is our current clinical standard for SC. In this work, we investigate if further improvements in observer performance could be obtained by using the ESSE method of SC instead of the currently used TEW SC, in combination with attenuation correction (AC) and resolution compensation (RC). We evaluated the effectiveness of the ESSE method to provide additional improvements in image quality objectively by using human-observer ROC studies on clinically acquired patient acquisitions. Results indicate that both ESSE and TEW SC in combination with AC and RC provide significantly higher detection accuracy than FBP for the overall detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) as well as in localizing perfusion defects in the LAD and LCx territories. Comparing, the two implementations of SC evaluated in this study, we note that ESSE method provides a significant improvement over TEW correction in the LAD territory. ESSE SC also provides small improvements in detection accuracy over the TEW method for the overall detection of CAD as well as in the detection of perfusion defects in the LCx and RCA territories. This indicates that SC implemented with the ESSE method has the potential to further improve the detection accuracy of images corrected for attenuation, scatter and resolution.

This paper proposes a new methodology for hyperparameter initialization in the Variational Bayes (VB) algorithm. We employ a dual expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm as the initialization stage in the VB-based learning. In the first stage, the EM algorithm is used on the given data set while the second EM algorithm is applied on distributions of parameters resulted from several runs of the first stage EM. The graphical model case study considered in this paper consists of a mixture of Gaussians. Appropriate conjugate prior distributions are considered for modelling the parameters.

The proposed algorithm employs a hierarchical learning strategy for estimating a set of hyperparameters and the number of Gaussian mixture components. A dual EM algorithm is employed as the initialization stage in the VEM-based learning. In the first stage the EM algorithm is applied on the given data set while the second stage EM is used on distributions of parameters resulted from several runs of the first stage EM. Appropriate maximum log-likelihood estimators are considered for all the parameter distributions involved.

This method employs the Expectation-Maximization Viterbi algorithm (EMVA) developed in [1] for blind channel estimation and signal detection. In our previous work [1]-[4], the Viterbi algorithm (VA) is used to implement the E-phase of an expectation-maximization (EM) iteration for a HMM which describes the noise corrupted output of a deterministic finite state machine (FSM) driven by the transmitted data. To apply the EMVA to Ricean fading channels, we extend the HAM to a class of random FSMs associated with a deterministic finite-state trellis, to which the VA is applicable. As a result, the EMVA can be used to obtain a blind maximum-likelihood estimate of unknown parameters. Simulation results show that the EMVA estimates accurately the channel specular part and exhibits a near-optimum error rate performance, as if all parameters were known.

The method we employ is based on the expectation maximization Viterbi algorithm (EMVA) [1][2][3]. The EMVA is applicable to transmission schemes that can be modeled as a finite state machine (FSM), whose noisy output sequence is thus a hidden Markov chain. The GMSK signal transmitted via an inter-symbol interference (ISI) channel is just one particular instance of a hidden Markov model [2][3][4]. Our channel identification procedure makes full use of the known training bits available in each GSM frame and thereby results in a semi-blind EMVA (SbEMVA). For a static ISI channel, simulation results indicate that the SbEMVA is near-optimal in error performance. For a Ricean fading ISI channel with a spread factor of 0.01, a K-factor of 5, and at a BER of 10(-3), we find that the SbEMVA is about 4 dB better than the ML receiver that uses the channel estimate obtained from just the training data.

Our method employs the expectation-maximization Viterbi algorithm (EMVA) [1] capable of joint channel identification and signal estimation for transmission systems that admit a hidden Markov model description. By modelling the observed signal as a finite-state hidden Markov process, it is possible to use the Viterbi algorithm (VA) to execute the M-phase of the expectation-maximization iteration. When the parameter estimate converges to a stationary point, the best survivor of the VA is selected as the ML estimate of the transmitted sequence. Simulations show that the EMVA performs almost as well as the ML detector based on exact channel knowledge and that it is near-far resistant in the presence of large power disparities among users. We then devise an EMVA-based quasi-maximum-likelihood successive cancellation (QML-SC) method which reduces the trellis complexity by first ignoring weak users, equalizing the stronger users, subtracting off their contributions from the observed signal, equalizing and cancelling the weak users, and repeating the procedure until convergence. Though not near-far resistant, the QML-SC method tends to resist the near-far effect for a wide range of power disparities.

Even noisy corpora can provide useful translation resources not otherwise available though. Many investigations have used statistical methods to find word correspondences. Often such methods suffer from overgeneration, so to correct this we filter relevant translation candidates using a lexical post-process. This dictionary lookup is so effective in fact that it brings into question the value of the statistical methods. Using a dictionary lookup against all combinations of phrase pairs as a baseline, we compare three statistical methods and report the results. The three methods are (1) Mutual Information; (2) Expectation Maximization over word co-occurrence frequencies; and (3) EM over word alignments in every sentence. We also apply the dictionary lookup as a postprocess, to tackle overgeneration.

However, the statistics of the fading channel is usually unknown and, therefore, have to be somehow estimated from the received signal. In this paper, we will show how the frequency selective fading channel can be described by the means of autoregressive moving average (ARMA) parametric models and how the model parameters can be efficiently estimated via the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and its extensions. Moreover, we will derive computationally attractive recursive estimators for the ARMA channel parameters.

It is shown how maximum-likelihood estimation of those synchronization parameters can be implemented by means of the iterative expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm [1]. Then we show that the EM algorithm iterations can be combined with those of a turbo receiver. This leads to a general theoretical framework for turbo synchronization. The soft decision-directed ad-hoc algorithm proposed in [2] for carrier phase recovery turns out to be a particular instance of this implementation. The proposed mathematical framework is illustrated by simulations reported for the particular case of carrier phase estimation combined with iterative demodulation and decoding [3].

It is assumed that each node in the network senses an environment that can be described as a mixture of some elementary conditions. The measurements are thus statistically modeled with a mixture of Gaussians, each Gaussian component corresponding to one of the elementary conditions. A distributed EM algorithm is developed for estimating the Gaussian components, which are common to the environment and sensor network as a whole, as well as the mixing probabilities which may vary from node to node. The algorithm produces an estimate (in terms of a Gaussian mixture approximation) of the density of the sensor data without requiring the data to be transmitted to and processed at a central location. Alternatively, the algorithm can be viewed as an distributed processing strategy for clustering the sensor data into components corresponding to predominant environmental features sensed by the network. The convergence of the distributed EM algorithm is discussed, and simulations demonstrate the potential of this approach to sensor network data analysis.

In the presence of long, non minimum-phase, source wavelets, strong interference of the reflectors contributions make the wavelet estimation and deconvolution procedure from recorded data complicated. In this paper, we address this problem in a two steps approach. First, a robust but truncated estimate of the wavelet is performed using a standard maximum likelihood approach. Then improved wavelet estimation is achieved by fitting an ARMA model to the initial MA wavelet by using the Prony algorithm. The algorithmic problem of wavelet initialization is also addressed. Simulation results and real data experiments show the significant improvement brought by this approach.

J	Okamura, H; Watanabe, Y; Dohi, T; Osaki, S				Okamura, H; Watanabe, Y; Dohi, T; Osaki, S			An estimation of software reliability models based on EM algorithm	ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATIONS IN JAPAN PART III-FUNDAMENTAL ELECTRONIC SCIENCE			English	Article						software reliability model; NHPP; generalized order statistics model; maximum likelihood method; EM algorithm	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; GROWTH	In this paper, a new estimation. method is proposed for the model parameters of a software reliability model based on the EM (Expectation-Maximization) principle. The debugging of the software including finite faults can be described by a generalized order statistics model. The generalized order statistics model is expressed by a nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) and the maximum likelihood method can usually be used for estimation of model parameters. However, since in this method the simultaneous logarithmic likelihood equation is numerically solved, it is not always effective from the viewpoints of algorithm stability and computation effort. The EM algorithm proposed here is a simple iteration method, which consists of several updating equations. The algorithm can accurately and stably obtain the maximum likelihood estimates. In this paper, specific EM algorithms are also derived for the cases where the occurrence of a software failure follows the exponential distribution, second-order Erlang distribution, Rayleigh distribution, Pareto distribution, and log normal distribution. Further, by using real data, the EM algorithm is compared with the method based on the simultaneous logarithmic likelihood equation in terms of the stability of the solution.

J	Ozawa, N; Aoki, T; Kato, N; Nemoto, Y				Ozawa, N; Aoki, T; Kato, N; Nemoto, Y			An automatic cloud region classification of satellite image by using clustering in local area	ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATIONS IN JAPAN PART II-ELECTRONICS			English	Article						clustering; region classification; remote sensing	LIKELIHOOD	This paper proposes a technique for automatically classifying cloud regions in satellite images. The proposed technique uses visible images and brightness temperature images to automatically classify cloud and noncloud regions. The authors assume that dividing the image into small regions (local regions) enables the feature vector distribution of each category within a local region to be approximated by using a Gaussian distribution, and they divide the distribution into two clusters. In addition, they introduce the "degree of coincidence" for judging whether or not it is appropriate to use each cluster for subsequent category classification and use the mean vectors of clusters that satisfy the degree of coincidence and the EM algorithm to perform classification. By using the degree of coincidence, the authors show that the vector distribution within the feature space becomes distinct and that clustering can be suitably performed. A feature of the proposed technique is that it aims to distribute feature vectors continuously so that they link each category. By considering the straight lines linking each category and using only those straight lines that are close to the mean vectors of each category, threshold values are determined dynamically for each image. Finally, the authors apply the proposed algorithm to NOAA and Himawari (GMS) images. Good classification results are obtained compared with results that were obtained manually by specialists.

A novel deterministic annealing EM and mean field theory are used to estimate the posterior probability of each pixel and the parameters of the Gaussian mixture model which represents the multi-colored objects statistically. Image segmentation is carried out by clustering each pixel into the most probable component Gaussian.

The paper describes a probabilistic model that can explain incomplete data referring to partitions of the original set of categories. We overcome the model's lack of identifiability by assuming a missingness at random censoring mechanism. On the basis of the subsequent statistical model the results required to fit further non-informative censoring models by maximum likelihood methodology are obtained. This preliminary analysis opens the way to the analysis of structural models for Poisson expected rates. The paper describes how to test the fit of structural models for the Poisson rates, whether taken individually or simultaneously with special censoring models. Then, the maximum likelihood methodology is specialized to the analysis of strictly linear and log-linear models in such a way that its computational implementation opens up for any count table. The methods developed throughout the work are illustrated with a breast cancer data set.

B	Pavlov, D		Wu, XD; Tuzhilin, A; Shavlik, J		Pavlov, D			Sequence modeling with mixtures of conditional maximum entropy distributions	THIRD IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd IEEE International Conference on Data Mining	NOV 19-22, 2003	MELBOURNE, FL	IEEE Comp Soc TCCI, IEEE Comp Soc TCPAMI				We present a novel approach to modeling sequences using mixtures of conditional maximum entropy (maxent) distributions. Our method generalizes the mixture of first-order Markov models by including the "long-term" dependencies in model components. The "long-term" dependencies are represented by the frequently used in the natural language processing (NLP) domain probabilistic triggers or rules (such as "A occurred k positions back" double right arrow "the current symbol is B" with probability, P). The maxent framework is then used to create a coherent global probabilistic model from all selected triggers. In this paper we enhance this formalism by using probabilistic mixtures with maxent models as components, thus representing hidden or unobserved effects in the data. We demonstrate how our mixture of conditional maxent models can be learned from data using the generalized EM algorithm that scales linearly in the dimensions of the data and the number of mixture components. We present empirical results on the simulated and real-world data sets and demonstrate that the proposed approach enables us to create better quality models than the mixtures of first-order Markov models and resist overfitting and curse of dimensionality that would inevitably present themselves for the higher order Markov models.

Although the EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm yields the maximum-likelihood solution it has many problems: (i) it requires a careful initialization of the parameters; (ii) the optimal number of kernels in the mixture may be unknown beforehand. We propose a criterion based on the entropy of the pdf (probability density function) associated to each kernel to measure the quality of a given mixture model, and a modification of the classical EM algorithm to find the optimal number of kernels in the mixture. We test this method with synthetic and real data and compare the results with those obtained with the classical EM with a fixed number of kernels.

The methods are outlined for the case of the growth kinetics of the Saccharomyces cerevisae yeast. The S. cerevisae yeast is able to grow through 3 different pathways. The main results show that a ME network with 3 linear expert modules was able to discriminate between the 3 pathways. The network was trained with the Expectation Maximisation method. A Gaussian gating system produced three input space partitions, one for each of the pathways. The 3 expert modules developed expertise in describing the kinetics of each of the pathways.

In such models, one considers that the hidden process X = (X-1,...,X-n) we look for is a Markov chain, and the distribution p(y\x) of the observed process Y = (Y-1,...,Y-n), conditional on X, is given by p(y\x) = Pi(i=1)(n) p(y(i)\x(i)). The "a posteriori" distribution p(x\y) of X given Y = y is then a Markov chain distribution, which makes possible the use of different Bayesian restoration methods. Furthermore, all parameters can be estimated by the general "Expectation-Maximization" algorithm, which renders Bayesian restoration unsupervised. This paper is devoted to an extension of the HMC model to a "Triplet Markov Chain" (TMC) model, in which a third auxiliary process U is introduced and the triplet (X,U,Y) is considered as a Markov chain. Then a more general model is obtained, in which X can still be restored from Y = y. Moreover, the model parameters can be estimated with Expectation-Maximization (EM) or Iterative Conditional Estimation (ICE), making the TMC based restoration methods unsupervised. We present a short simulation study of image segmentation, where the bi- dimensional set of pixels is transformed into a mono-dimensional set via a Hilbert-Peano scan, that shows that using TMC can improve the results obtained with HMC.

Disparity maps provide the same type of information as range based sensors (distance to objects) and thus, they are likely to be less :sensitive to changes of illumination than plain images, that are the source of information generally used in appearance-based localization. The main drawback of disparity maps is that they can include very noisy depth values: points for which the algorithms can not determine reliable depth information. These noisy values have to be discarded resulting in missing values. The presence of missing values makes Principal Component Analysis (the standard method used to compress images in the appearance-based framework) unfeasible. We describe a novel Expectation-Maximization algorithm to determine the principal components of a data set including missing values and we apply it to disparity maps. The results we present show that disparity maps are a valid alternative to increase the robustness of appearance-based localization.

Furthermore, we also determine the accuracy of diagnosing CAD using polar map quantitation with a unified normal database. We studied 102 individuals who either underwent X-ray angiography (57) or were determined to be in a low risk group (less than 5% likely) to have CAD (45). The low likelihood group was identified using standard criteria. Both groups underwent stress testing (physical or pharmacological) before imaging commenced. A Philips Medical Systems Prism 3000 (Philips Medical Systems, Cleveland Ohio) SPECT camera was used for all acquisitions. The standard FBP reconstruction with no attenuation or scatter compensation was performed on the emission data using the 180degrees data from RAO to LAO, and a Butterworth pre-filter of order 5 and cutoff of 0.25 1/pixel. Emission data were also reconstructed through 360degrees using an ordered-subset expectation-maximization (OSEM) algorithm. In our implementation, we used 15 subsets of four angles each and one iteration employing attenuation compensation (AC) alone, and in combination with scatter compensation (SC). Resolution compensation was included with the previous compensation methods (RC) using 5 iteration of OSEM. Three-dimensional post-reconstruction Gaussian filtering was done using a sigma of 0.75 pixels. As expected, FBP do poorly with a unified normal database when inferior and anterior regions are affected. The three methods that included compensation for attenuation were highly susceptible to extra-cardiac activity, influencing the maximum count in the polar map and change diagnoses of normal into CAD. This was evident in the areas under the ROC curves for all methods.

The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to classify the vehicles in the images as' either being passenger cars or some other bigger vehicles, cars versus non-cars. The vehicle classification algorithm uses training sets of 100-frame video sequences. The car group is comprised of passenger cars and light trucks. The non-car group is comprised of heavy single trucks as well as 3-axle and more combination trucks. We use the properties of their dimensional,distribution and the probability of their appearance to identify the vehicle group.

Change detection from PCA shows however a main difficulty, that is, result interpretation. In this paper, a new PCA method is developed, namely MB-PCA (Multi-Block PCA), in order to overcome this problem. Experimental results demonstrate the interest of the approach as a new way to use PCA.	GEODES, Inst Rech Dev, Bondy, France	Qiu, B (reprint author), GEODES, Inst Rech Dev, Bondy, France.

Model based classification is used for the analysis of metallic substrates while a segmentation of the image is required to distinguish between paint and substrate or between paint and rust for the analysis of paint coatings. A unified framework based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is presented to solve both analyses. The EM algorithm is used both as a colour-based identification method for measuring cleanness properties of the substrate's surface, and also as a colour-based segmentation method for extracting the paint regions of the coating's surface. An initialisation method and a pre-processing step are proposed to avoid false segmentations. Experimental results on real samples show more repeatability and accuracy than the results obtained by human visual inspection. Each analysis has been visually illustrated with a representative example.

In order to exploit these relatively cheap and abundant unlabeled data we present a family of algorithms called lambdaMEEM. Using these algorithms, we train an appearance-based people detection model. In contrast to approaches that rely on a large number of manually labeled training points, we use a partially labeled data set to capture appearance variation. One can both avoid the tedium of additional manual labeling and obtain improved detection performance by augmenting a labeled training set with unlabeled data. Further, enlarging the original training set with new unlabeled points enables the update of detection models after deployment without human intervention. To support these claims we show people detection results, and compare our performance to a purely generative Expectation Maximization-based approach to learning over partially labeled data.

We adapt and expand the principal curve algorithm to develop a non-parametric approach called Cluster-linked Principal Curves (CLPC) that locally approximates the structure and scatter in a distribution of data points. The iterative algorithm is based on Expectation-Maximization (E-M) principle. The projections of data points on the principal curve or arc lengths are capable of characterizing the data in fewer dimensions and with greater accuracy than PCA. The distribution of arc lengths is used for gauging stationarity and reversibility, and monitoring. For illustration we use the embeddings formed from chaotic gas pressure time series measurements collected before an electrified capillary nozzle that injects bubbles into a liquid-filled column.

The approach is of particular significance to EM algorithm implementations which otherwise only use basic system models, such as those which calculate the system matrix elements on the fly rather than using pre-calculated values. The first convolution is applied to a copy of the image estimate prior to forward projecting this copy. The second is performed on the backprojected correction image prior to its use to multiplicatively update the original (not convolved) image estimate. The inclusion of resolution-modeling convolution at these two stages corresponds to extending the system transfer matrix, and the EM algorithm gradually recovers the modeled resolution with each update. The approach does not constitute regularization in any way, but rather the improved system modeling results in both enhanced resolution and lower noise, and there is often no need for regularization - other than to limit the number of iterations. Tests have been performed with simulated list-mode data and also with measured phantom and patient projection data from a GE Advance PET scanner, for both [(18)]-FDG and [I-124]-NaI. The method demonstrates improved image quality in all cases when compared to the conventional FBP and EM methods presently used for clinical data (which do not include resolution modeling). The benefits of this approach for I-124 (which has a low positron yield and a large positron range, usually resulting in noisier and poorer resolution images) are particularly noticeable.

Given an input or observed image (probably degraded by one or more unknown processes), and a source image exhibiting the general patch (group of pixels) properties expected in the input image (before degradation), we seek to infer the original image and the process that affected it to produce the observed image. The foundation of our approach is to transform known image patches with desired statistics to patches found in the input image using a finite set of filters or transformations. These transformations are unknown; thus they also must be estimated. We cast this problem as an approximate probabilistic inference problem and show how it can be approached using belief propagation-and expectation maximization. Experimental results for joint image restoration and filter estimation are presented.

Several studies showed that these network features may be correlated and present a certain degree of memory such as bursty losses and delays. The memory and the statistical dependence between losses and temporal delays suggest that the channel may be well modelled by a Dynamic Bayesian Network with an appropriate hidden variable that captures the current state of the network.

Such data are also called binned data. This paper addresses the problem of clustering binned data using mixture models. A specific EM algorithm has been proposed by Cadez et al.([2]) to deal with these data. This algorithm has the disadvantage of being computationally expensive. In this paper, a classification version of this algorithm is proposed, which is much faster. The two approaches are compared using simulated data. The simulation results show that both algorithms generate comparable solutions in terms of resulting partition if the histogram is accurate enough.

If the DF-DD feedback filter is properly optimized, a performance similar to that of more complex, recently reported schemes based on multiple-symbol detection [1] and expectation maximization (EM) [2] can be achieved. However, it is also shown that an error floor is unavoidable. In contrast to previously proposed receivers for channels with phase noise, the DF-DD receiver can be made robust against unknown frequency offsets by introducing a simple linear constraint.

The channels at the training bauds are estimated using the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm. while the channels at the data bauds are estimated based on the method that the time-varying channel can be modelled as the linear combination of several time-invariant "Doppler channels". Computer simulations show that this estimator outperforms the decision-directed tracking in rapid fading channels and the performance of this method call be improved by iteration.

That is, images and spectra become "blurry," and features of interest in them are lost. We have devised a method to resolve this dilemma by exploiting the benefits of micro-actuators with nanometer positioning accuracy. Inspired from the diversity method in radar and satellite communications, "integrated computational imaging with optical diversity" or ICIOD (pronounced "Hesiod") is premised on the fact that resolution improves if a measurement is repeated by several systems with different transfer functions. In ICIOD, diversity is realized by MEMS actuators that mechanically modify the optical response of a diffraction grating. The individual low-resolution measurements are combined using flavors of the regularized pseudo-inverse method (e.g. Wiener filtering or expectation maximization.) In this paper, we describe in detail a case study of ICIOD for a potential compact (shirt-button sized) spectrometer and its core component, the analog tunable grating.

Like other concurrent mapping and localization (CML) tasks, odometric uncertainty poses the problem of introducing distortions into the map which are difficult to correct without costly on-line or post-processing algorithms. Our problem is further compounded by the implicit nature of the visual map representation, which is designed to accommodate a wide variety of visual phenomena without assuming a particular imaging platform, thereby precluding the inference of scene geometry. Such a representation presents a requirement for a relatively dense sampling of observations of the environment in order to produce reliable models. Our goal is to develop an on-line policy for exploring an unknown environment which minimizes map distortion while maximizing coverage. We do not depend on costly post-hoc expectation maximization approaches to improve the output, but rather employ extended Kalman filter (EKF) methods to localize each observation once, and rely on the exploration policy to ensure that sufficient information is available to localize the successive observations. We present an experimental analysis of a variety of exploratory policies, in both simulated and real environments, and demonstrate that with an effective policy an accurate map can be constructed.

Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) is a memory and compute intensive process, giving rise to area and latency concerns in the way of its implementation for real-time efficient embedded systems. The training schemes for computing the speaker models, such as the expectation maximization are highly iterative and contribute significantly to the overall complexity in the implementation of the system. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of the LBG and the K-means algorithm to realize compute efficient training method. Models trained with the LBG algorithm achieves as much as 99.88% of EM accuracy, whilst K-means achieves as much as 99.91% of EM accuracy. Moreover, the EM computational complexity is almost twice that of LBG or K-means. Thus, using LBG and K-means algorithms for training Gaussian mixture speaker models for text-independent speaker verification, we show that, that they deliver comparable performance as the EM algorithm at significantly reduced computational complexity. Thus making them an ideal choice for low-cost applications.

The proposed system takes as input, color images of stained peripheral blood smears and identi-fies the class of each of the White Blood Cells (WBC), in order to determine the count of cells in each class. The pro-cess involves segmentation, feature extraction and classifica-tion. WBC segmentation is a two-step process carried out on the HSV-equivalent of the image, using K-Means clus-tering followed by EM-algorithm. Features extracted from the segmented cytoplasm and nucleus, are motivated by the visual cues of shape, color and texture. Various classifiers have been explored on different combinations of feature sets. The results presented here are based on trials conducted with normal cells. For training the classifiers, a library set of 50 patterns, with about 10 samples from each class, is used. The test data, disjoint form the training set, consists of 34 patterns, fairly represented by every class. The best classification ac-curacy of 97% is obtained using Neural networks, followed by 94% using SVM.

Collimator design was studied as follows. A desired object resolution was specified for a pixellated detector with a given crystal size and intrinsic spatial resolution and for a given object-to-collimator distance. Using analytic formulas, pinhole and parallel hole collimator parameters were calculated that satisfy this object resolution with optimal geometric sensitivity. Analyses were performed for 15 cm x 20 cm field of view detectors with crystal elements 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 nun on a side and 140 keV incident photons. The sensitivity for a given object resolution was greater for pinhole collimation at smaller distances, as expected. The object distance at which the pinhole and parallel hole sensitivity curves cross each other is important. The crossover distances increased with larger crystal size for a constant object resolution and increased as the desired object resolution decreases for a constant crystal size. For example, for 4 mm object resolution these distances were 5.5 cm, 6.5 cm and 8 cm for the 1 mm, 2 mm and 3 mm crystal detectors, respectively. The results suggest a strategy of parallel hole collimation for whole breast imaging and pinhole collimation for imaging focal uptake. This could be accomplished with a dual detector system with a different collimator type on each head or a single head system equipped with two collimators and a rapid switching mechanism. Multipinhole collimators have the potential to increase sensitivity yet maintain high image resolution. An experimental SPECT phantom study with a four-pinhole collimator was acquired with a pixellated detector. The iterative maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (MLEM) reconstruction of a hot sphere in a warm cylinder showed the potential of multipinhole collimation to improve sensitivity for tomographic pinhole scintimammography.

However, when collecting data under an identification experiment it may not be possible to avoid noise when measuring the input. The use of the errors-in-variable model to describe the data in this case is more appropriate. However, learning based on maximum likelihood estimation is far from straightforward because of the high number of unknown parameters. In this paper, to overcome the problems associated to the estimation with high number of unknown parameters, the nonlinear errors-in-variable estimation problem is treated under a Bayesian formulation. In order to compute the necessary maximum a posteriori estimate we use the restoration maximization algorithms where the true but unknown training inputs are treated as hidden variables. In order to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm a modified version of the stochastic EM algorithm is proposed. A simulation example on learning a nonlinear parametric function and an example on learning feedforward neural networks are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed learning method.

It has been shown that the maximum likelihood (ML) detector can achieve spatial, temporal and frequency diversity in such channels. However, it assumes the channel parameters are known perfectly at the receiver. Moreover, as the ML detector complexity grows exponentially with the number of channel laps (channel order), estimation of the channel order must be performed to reduce unnecessary computations. In [1], we proposed an iterative receiver derived from the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which performs channel order, channel gain and sequence estimation. The conditional model order estimator is employed for channel order estimation and is shown to have good performance. In this paper, we have 3 major contributions in improving the performance of this receiver. 1) a generalized CME criterion for MIMO systems, 2) a modified CME criterion for MMSE based EM receiver, and 3) an order estimate adjustment scheme to avoid overestimation. Simulation results show that the new modifications improve the order estimate significantly; hence reducing unnecessary computation due to overestimation.

Previously, we computed the ensemble CHO SNR using a method for approximating the channelized covariance of OS reconstruction, which requires knowledge of the noise-free projection data. Here, we use a "plug-in" approach, in which noisy data is used in place of the noise-free data in the aforementioned channelized covariance approximation. Additionally, we evaluated the use of smoothing of the noisy projections before use in the covariance calculation. The task was detection of a 10% contrast Gaussian signal within a slice of the MCAT phantom. Simulated projections of the MCAT phantom were scaled and Poisson noise was added to create 100 noisy signal-absent data sets. Simulated projections of the scaled signal were then added to the noisy background projections to create 100 noisy signal-present data set. These noisy data sets were then used to generate 100 estimates of the ensemble CHO SNR for reconstructions at various iterates. For comparison purposes, the same calculation was repeated with the noise-free data. The results, reported as plots of the average CHO SNR generated in this fashion, along with 95% confidence intervals, demonstrate that this approach works very well, and would allow optimization of imaging systems and reconstruction methods using a more accurate object model (i.e., real patient data).

Negative projection values, which are possible after these subtractive corrections, are either truncated at zero counts or accommodated by adding an offset to the projection data, and to the corresponding forward-projected values, during the algorithm. These methods are effective due to the relatively low scatter and random fractions of most 2D PET acquisitions. In 3D PET data, particularly in acquisitions in the body, the scatter and random fractions are much higher. As a result, the OS-EM algorithm may not be the most appropriate for reconstruction for rebinned 3D PET data. We have implemented an ordered-subsets version of the weighted least-squares expectation maximization (WLS-EM) algorithm, or WLS-OS-EM, which is based on a Gaussian approximation to the statistics of the rebinned data. The weights used in the algorithm are based on the attenuation correction factors applied to the data. WLS-OS-EM exhibits faster, and more consistent, convergence than ML-OS-EM for projection data sets with substantial negative projection values created by subtractive data corrections.

The first method [5,6] consists in automatically calculating a face color model by using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm in the Hue Saturation (HS) subspace. Pixels with the color of the face are used by the EM algorithm to find the location of the face(s). The second method consists in using the histogram backprojection method for calculating the face color probability for every pixel in the image [7-11], the location of the face(s) being then determined from this information.

Engineering is often set in contradistinction with science; art is sometimes considered different from science. Why, then, juxtapose the words in the title: psychometric, engineering, and art? Because an important aspect of quantitative psychology is problem-solving, and engineering solves problems. And an essential aspect of a good solution is beauty-hence, art. In overview and with examples, this presentation describes activities that are quantitative psychology as engineering and art-that is, as design. Extended illustrations involve systems for scoring tests in realistic contexts. Allusions are made to other examples that extend the conception of quantitative psychology as engineering and art across a wider range of psychometric activities.

After demodulating variations in spectral envelope, energy and pitch, the method involves applying a bank of Kalman filters to separate the harmonic and non-harmonic components of the signal. This approach relies on a state-space representation of the composite signal, and provides a way to accurately estimate the harmonic component without the large delay required by a linear phase comb filter. However it also requires prior knowledge of the variance of the unvoiced component and the state transition parameters. We present a novel method to accurately determine these parameters based on a variant of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Modifications for dealing with unvoiced segments and voicing onset are also described.	Motorola Labs, Botany, NSW, Australia	Thomson, M (reprint author), Motorola Labs, Botany, NSW, Australia.

In breast imaging, this dual-modality system may be useful for (1) improving delectability of low contrast lesions with x-ray CT imaging, (2) emission quantification using the transmission images, and (3) better interpretation of the reconstructed emission data by facilitating objective region selection. Each imaging component needs independent development, optimization and characterization. The prototype SPECT component using a NaI(Tl) based gamma camera has been built and initially evaluated with small, low contrast breast lesions; resolution and sampling issues are under investigation with the arbitrary orbits possible with the hemispherical positioning capability. This emission component has been demonstrated to be a novel and viable approach to dedicated mammotomography with high lesion signal-to-noise and contrast. Geometrical feasibility studies are investigated herein for transmission mammotomography. The studies use the emission gamma camera with 2x2x6 mm(3) crystals with and without detector collimation, with single photon Tc-99m 140 keV sources for the pendant breast geometry. Transmission data are acquired with simple vertical axis of rotation (with 0degrees polar tilt, 360degrees azimuthal acquisition). Phantom measurements are made with acrylic/air mini-rod and mini-tube resolution phantoms, and an anthropomorphic breast phantom containing 0.6 and 1.0 cm diameter water-filled, acrylic lesions. All data were reconstructed with ordered subsets expectation maximization. Initial transmission images are also shown with a recently acquired digital flat-panel x-ray detector illuminated with a nuclear source. This detector is intended for use in the final design of the dedicated x-ray transmission instrument.

We present a novel recursive Bayesian estimation algorithm that combines an importance sampling based measurement update step with a bank of Sigma-Point Kalman Filters for the time-update and proposal distribution generation. The posterior state density is represented by a Gaussian mixture model that is recovered from the weighted particle set of the measurement update step by means of a weighted EM algorithm. This step replaces the resampling stage needed by most particle filters and mitigates the "sample depletion" problem. We show that this new approach has an improved estimation performance and reduced computational complexity compared to other related algorithms.

With very high bandwidth (600 MHz), a large room has been measured at 1.8 GHz with a moving antenna, forming a synthetic aperture. Afterwards, the transformation from the transfer function in the frequency-domain to the time-domain received signal, with the training sequence included, will be explained. On these data, the Space Alternating Generalised Expectation maximisation (SAGE) Algorithm will be applied to extract with high resolution the Direction of Arrival (DOA) parameters, in this case the time delay, the azimuth angle and the complex amplitude for every significant path.

The new pressure trace model proposed yields accurate approximations with a minimal number of parameters. When combined with the EM algorithm, a processing scheme results that provides fast pressure estimates and efficiently exploits the information contained in the sound signal. Experimental results with real measurement data show the potential of the reconstructed signal to perform misfire detection and closed-loop spark ignition timing tasks.

The paper presents a method to diagnose misfire based on the analysis of structure-borne sound. The EM algorithm combined with a parametric pressure model is used to decompose the sound signal in individual components associated with single combustions. This fact leads to a simple statistical test to detect misfires by evaluating the shape of the reconstructed pressure. Experimental results with real measurement data at different engine operating points show that the method can compete with already existing approaches.

This paper presents a methodology for spatio-temporal (4D) list-mode image reconstruction with this scanner. The technique is developed from the 3D list-mode based expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Using measured data from both a cylindrical phantom and a mouse study, approaches to reconstructing dynamic image sequences were developed, evaluated and compared in terms of resolution and noise, and different types of time-activity curve were produced and evaluated. The effect of altering the various reconstruction parameters is considered, including the effect of post-reconstruction smoothing, and the image initialization for each time frame, reconstruction. Based on these results, it is possible to achieve high image quality with good temporal resolution, arising from the excellent spatial resolution and noise properties characteristic of static quad-HIDAC imaging.

However, traditional GMM can't perform clustering well on data set with complex structure such as images. In this paper, kernel trick, successfully used by SVM and kernel PCA, is introduced into EM algorithm for solving parameter estimation of GMM, which is so called kernel GMM (kGMM). The basic idea of kernel GMM is to apply kernel based GMM in feature space instead of in input data space. In order to avoid the curse of dimension, the proposed kGMM also embeds a step to automatically select discriminative features in feature space. kGMM is employed for the task of image binarization. Result shows that the proposed approach is feasible.

In this study, the effects of number and placement of camera positions in RMSSH SPECT for cardiac imaging were studied, to achieve the best possible reconstruction image quality with minimal image artifacts. Both simulation and phantom experiments were performed. A modified SIMIND Monte-Carlo code and the realistic 3D NURBS-based Cardiac-Torso (NCAT) phantom were used in simulation studies. A GE 400AC/T camera equipped with a 4-segment slant-hole collimator with a 32.5degrees slant-angle and a Data Spectrum anthropomorphic torso phantom with cardiac insert were used in phantom experiments. Ectomography (single camera position) and RMSSH (two to three camera positions) projection data of the heart were simulated and acquired from different camera positions, and then reconstructed using an iterative OS-EM algorithm for comparison. For incomplete angle RMSSH SPECT of the heart, Ectomography gives noticeable image artifacts and distortions at any camera position. RMSSH SPECT images obtained using two camera positions 90degrees apart show significant improvements as compared with only one camera position used in Ectomography, and those placed symmetrically with respect to the long axis of the heart give the best image quality. For complete angle RMSSH SPECT acquisition of the heart using three camera positions, all combinations of camera positions that satisfy Orlov's condition show similar images that are of higher quality and quantitative accuracy than that from incomplete angle acquisitions. We conclude that the number and placement of camera positions in cardiac RMSSH SPECT should be chosen carefully for best reconstructed image and quantitative accuracy.

Previous studies have shown that the tool has not only significantly reduced the grammar development effort but also yielded grammars of better qualities. However, the tool requires extra human involvement when ambiguities exist in the process of grammar rule induction. In this paper we present an algorithm that is able to automatically resolve the segmentation ambiguities, hence acquire the language expressions for the concepts involved. Preliminary experiment results show that the Expectation-Maximization algorithm we investigated has not only eliminated the human involvement in ambiguity resolution but also improved the overall spoken language understanding accuracy.

A low-complexity sliding-window scheme based on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is developed for joint blind maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) multi-user detection (MUD) and stochastic maximum likelihood (ML) channel estimation in a dispersive fading channel. With multistage soft interference cancellation, MAI can be efficiently suppressed. Together with an initial value prediction method for algorithm initialization at each window, the proposed scheme can track fading channels on the fly with no phase ambiguities even when channel gains are close to zero.

First, we use EM algorithm to estimate the distribution of input image data and the number of mixture components is automatically determined by MML criterion. Then the segmentation is carried out by clustering each pixel into appropriate component according to maximum likelihood (ML) criterion. The advantage of our method lies in its ability of less relying on initialization and segmenting images in a totally unsupervised manner. Experimental results show that our segmentation method can obtain better results than other methods.

The motivation relies on the observation that conventional single model is usually incapable to reconstruct the piecewise dynamic properly because a piecewise map is non-differentiable. In our approach, multiple radial basis function (RBF) neural nets are used to model the dynamic in different partition intervals. Switching between different intervals could be estimated by a nonlinear gate model. In particular, an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is employed to train the MM-RBF. Compared to the conventional approach, the proposed MM is shown to greatly improve the reconstruction performance for piecewise chaotic dynamic. We further apply it to combat channel distortions in an analog chaotic spread spectrum (SS) system. It is found that the proposed method has satisfactory equalization performance even when channel effect is strong.

In this paper, we use Gaussian mixture model to represent the user's target distribution, which can further narrow down the gap between high-level semantic and low-level features. Furthermore, we present a novel approach to estimate the distribution parameters based on the expectation maximization algorithm. Because current image retrieval systems are incapable of capturing user's inconsistent intentions, we propose a framework to resolve user's conflict feedback. Experimental results show that our system can gradually improve its retrieval performance through accumulated user interactions.

An image consisting of different textures can be considered as a realization of a collection of two interacting random process-the hidden region label process and the observation process. A novel Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) model is proposed to describe the fill-in of regions at each scale and a multi-level logistic (MLL) MU model with particular cliques is used to characterize the intrascale and interscale context dependencies.. According to sequential maximum a posterior (SMAP) estimate, expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is adopted to estimate the parameters of GMRF and to label each pixel iteratively from coarse to fine level.

Image reconstruction methods with accurate modeling of the system response functions have been successfully used to improve PET image quality. It is, however, difficult to apply these methods to the DOI-PET system because the dimension of DOI-PET data increases in proportion to the square of the number of DOI layers. In this paper, we propose a compressed imaging system model for DOI-PET image reconstruction, in order to reduce computational cost with keeping image quality. The basic idea of the proposed method is that the DOI-PET system is highly redundant. First, DOI-PET data are transformed into compact data so that data bins of which sensitivity functions highly correlate are combined. Then image reconstruction methods based on accurate system modeling, such as the maximum likelihood expectation maximization (ML-EM), are applied. The proposed method was applied to simulated data for the DOI-PET operated in 2D mode. Then the trade-off between the background noise and the spatial resolution was investigated. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed method followed by ML-EM reduces computational cost effectively with keeping the advantages of the accurate system modeling and DOI information.

Researchers have proposed many methods using space and data partitioning for exact similarity searches. However, traditional indexing methods perform poorly and will degrade to simple sequential scans at high dimensionality - that is so-called "curse of dimensionality". Recently, several filtering approaches based on vector approximation (VA) were proposed and showed promising performance. In fact, existing VA-based methods assume independent distribution of dataset and utilize scalar quantizer to partition each dimension of data space. In real databases, however, images are from different categories and often clustered. In this paper, a novel indexing method using vector quantization is proposed. This approach introduces a vector quantizer to partition data space. It assumes a Gaussian mixture distribution and estimates this distribution through Expectation-Maximization (EM) method. Experiments on a large database of 275,465 images demonstrated a remarkable improvement of retrieval efficiency.

However, the shift-variance of real wavelet transforms degrades the accuracy of the WHMMs. To overcome this problem, we propose a hidden Markov model based on the dual-tree complex wavelet transform that is approximately shift-invariant. Context information is used in this model to indicate the local correlation among wavelet coefficients. According to different visual attributes, several contexts based on frequency, orientation and scale are applied to capture both intrascale and interscale dependencies. The parameters of this model are estimated by an EM algorithm. Applications to image denoising are presented. The denoising performance is among the best state-of-the-art techniques, and outperforms models which are based on real discrete wavelet transforms (DWTs).

Experiments on two data sets (the USPS data set and the breast cancer data set in UCI repository) show that our algorithm efficiently queries informative points near the decision boundaries into a secondary pool and prevents learner's separating hyperplane's position from changing suddenly during the learning procedure.

This contribution presents theoretical and simulation results describing the performance of the scheme for DF estimation when it is applied in combination with channel sounding using switched multiple-element Tx and Rx antennas. It is shown that the maximum absolute DF that can be estimated equals half the switching rate rather than half the measurement cycle rate as commonly believed. The switching rate is the rate with which the pairs of Tx and Rx elements are switched, while the measurement cycle rate is the rate with which any fixed pair of Tx and Rx elements is switched. The ratio of the former rate by the latter is larger than or equal to the product of the numbers of Tx and Rx elements. Hence, the scheme allows for DF estimation in a range much larger than commonly believed. Monte-Carlo simulations also show that above a certain signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) threshold depending on the characteristics of the TDM mode, the estimator performs close to optimum. The results make it possible to link the parameter setting of the TDM mode to the operational SNR range for individual waves to be estimated.

The motivating application is the determination of the 3-D structure of small spherical viruses from cryo electron microscopy images. The algorithm is a maximum likelihood estimator which is computed by expectation maximization (EM). Due to the structure of the statistical model, the maximization step of EM c an be easily computed but the expectation step requires 5-D numerical quadrature. The computational burden of the quadratures necessitates parallel computation and three different implementations of two different types of parallelism have been developed using pthreads (for shared memory processors) and MPI (for distributed memory processors). An example applying one of the MPI implementations, running on a 32 node PC cluster, to experimental images of Flock House Virus with comparison to the x-ray crystal diffraction structure of the virus is described.

A two component Gaussian mixture model is developed to describe the statitistical characteristics of images in the wavelet domain. The model parameters are obtained by an EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm and then employed to construct the indexing feature space for CBIR. The new method is applied on the Brodatz image database to demonstrate its performance. The preliminary experimental results indicate that the composed indexing feature space through the statistical approach is very effective in representing image features and provides a high retrieval rate in CBIR. Compared with other CBIR feature extraction methods, the new method achieves comparable retrieval performance with less number of features in the feature space, which means the new method is more computationally efficient.

We develop techniques to compute the probability density function (pdf) of the extrinsic information at the output of the multiuser detector. We show that the output pdf can be modeled as symmetric Gaussian for synchronous CDMA in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and as a mixture of symmetric Gaussian densities for asynchronous CDMA system over fading channel. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm can be used to compute the parameters of this mixture. Using these techniques, we are able to accurately compute the thresholds for LDPC codes and design good irregular LDPC codes. Simulation results are in good agreement with the computed thresholds and the designed irregular LDPC codes outperform regular ones significantly.

We propose a sequential probabilistic multiple hypotheses tracking (PMHT) based algorithm using interacting multiple model (IMM), namely IMM-PMHT algorithm. Inclusion of IMM enables to track any arbitrary trajectory without any, apriori information about the target dynamics. IMM allows us to incorporate different dynamic models for the targets and PMHT helps to avoid the uncertainty about the measurement origin. It operates in an iterative mode using expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The proposed algorithm uses only measurement association as missing data, which simplifies E-step and M-step. It is computationally more efficient, and an important characteristic of our proposed algorithm is that it operates in a single batch model, i.e. sequential, and hence can be used for real time tracking.

Past methods enhanced recognition by using multiple frame averaging, image interpolation and lexicon correction, but recognition using multi-modality language models has not been explored. In this paper, we present a formal Bayesian framework for videotext recognition by combining multiple knowledge using mixture models, and describe a learning approach based on Expectation-Maximization (EM). In order to handle unseen words, a back-off smoothing approach derived from the Bayesian model is also presented. We exploited a prototype that fuses the model from closed caption and that from the British National Corpus. The model from closed caption is based on a unique time distance distribution model of videotext words and closed caption words. Our method achieves a significant performance gain, with word recognition rate of 76.8% and character recognition rate of 86.7%. A proposed post processing method also improves videotext detection significantly, with precision at 91.8% and recall at 95.6%.

The autocorrelation structure of video stream is modeled by two AutoRegress (AR) processes. We also take the correlation in GOP (Group of Picture) into account. According to the size of I frame, the size of B frame and P frame in the same GOP are determined by a lognormal distribution. As for the marginal distribution of the MPEG video stream, we use normal mixture distribution to fit it, and the parameters of normal mixture distribution are estimated through an Expecting Maximum (EM) algorithm. At last, the accuracy of the proposed model is validated with simulation experiments and the application of this model in network QoS (Quality of Service) evaluation.

The automated creation of Bayesian networks can be separated into two tasks. Structure learning, which consists of creating the structure of the Bayesian networks from the collected data and parameter learning, which consists of calculating the numerical parameters for a given structure. A Voting EM algorithm which is based EM be discussed and applied in the online parameter learning in flood decision supporting Bayesian networks in this paper. Both EM and Voting EM algorithm are applied in flood decision Bayesian networks to compare their performance. The result indicates that the Voting EM can be used in the online learning for Bayesian network parameter and it also has more precisely than general EM algorithm.

The list-mode EM algorithm requires projecting every list-mode event from and into a large FOV with a large number of sub-millimeter voxels, and so substantial computing time is spent on back-projection and forward-projection operations. This paper presents an improved ray-tracing method, which extends the previously used projection algorithm, known as the Siddon algorithm, for a FOV with an irregularly bounded set of voxels instead of the traditional cubic array. This method can remove redundant projection operations in regions where no activity is present. This leads to typically a factor of 5 speed up compared to the conventional Siddon algorithm, and up to a factor of 2 speed up compared to the incremental approach.

According to the assumption that the high dimensional acoustic feature vector of the LSF (Line Spectrum Frequency) of the speech signal is probably embedded in a low dimensional space, a two dimensional vector is used to represent the continuous state vector in this model. The parameters of the model are initialized by PPCA (probabilistic principle component analysis) and first order vector auto-regression, and are re-estimated by the EM algorithm. We show that this model can be used to classify vowels, nasals, frication and silence by an approximate Viterbi inference.

Image is considered as a mixture of multi-variant normal densities and the number of densities is assumed to know. In order to obtain the parameters of densities, deterministic annealing EM algorithm is introduced. In DAEM algorithm, the EM process is reformulated as the problem of minimizing the thermodynamic free energy by, using a statistical mechanics analogy. Thus, The DAEM algorithm can overcome the local maximize problem of general EM algorithm. The proposed method is successfully applied to image segmentation experiments.

It is a decision part for establishing the records of the new targets and terminating the unwanted records of the inexistent targets. A new approach for track initiation and termination in cluttered environment is presented, which combines the sequential probabilistic ratio test (SPRT) and expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Aiming at the computational difficulty of the likelihood function due to the unknown target state, the recursive EM-based formula of likelihood function is introduced, by which the temporary tracks can be confirmed or rejected, and the confirmed tracks can be terminated effectively and realtime. The simulation results show that the proposed method performs well.

The problem is formulated as a hierarchical latent variable model which is clipped to ignore classes not of interest. The model is trained using a multistage EM (msEM) algorithm. The msEM algorithm maximizes the likelihood of the joint distribution of the data and latent variables, under the constraint that the distribution of each layer is fixed in successive stages. We demonstrate that with very few positive examples, the algorithm performs better than training all layers in a single stage. We also show that the latter is equivalent to training a single layer model with corresponding parameters. The performance of the algorithm was verified on several real-world information extraction tasks.

Each of them is of research interest as an independent component. In this paper, we describe a driver face tracking method using a semi-parameter probability density estimation method Assuming that an initial face location is outputted by a certain reliable face location module, our tracking method starts with an estimation of a two-component Gaussian Mixture Model as the initial face pixel gray value distribution using an iterative EM algorithm. Then, the estimated Gaussian Mixture is used to locate the face in the next image frame. Also this-Mixture model is updated by a recursive EM algorithm using pixel gray values from the tracked face,. and the updated model is to be used to locate the face in the next image. We illustrate this method through experiments on the video sequence captured by IR-sensitive camera.

We particularly focus on reducing the number of the channel update iterations and the complexity of each iteration. A low-complexity time-frequency channel estimator is proposed that tracks the channel variation within one code window and predicts the channel for the next window. The channel estimator can use simple hard decisions or more computationally intensive "soft" decisions, in which case the estimator is derived from an expectation-maximization (EM) principle. Simulation results are provided under a varying number of channel updates that use hard or soft decisions. As an example, a very simple hard decision based receiver for a rate-1/2 turbo coded 16QAM OFDM system performs within 1 dB of a pilot-based receiver at 500 Hz Doppler, after three channel iterations that are interlaced with eight max-log-MAP decoding iterations. The proposed techniques can significantly reduce pilot symbol overhead with minimal performance degradation.

The model parameters include process and measurement matrices or functions as well as the corresponding noise statistics. However, there are situations where the model parameters are not known a priori or are known only partially (i.e.. with some uncertainty). Moreover. there are situations where the measurement is biased. In these scenarios, standard estimation algorithms like the Kalman filter and the extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which assume perfect knowledge of the model parameters, are not accurate. In this paper, the problem with uncertain model parameters is considered as a special case of maximum likelihood estimation with incomplete-data, for which a standard solution called the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm exists. In this paper a new extension to the EM algorithm is proposed to solve the more general problem of joint state estimation and model parameter identification for nonlinear systems with possibly non-Gaussian noise. In the expectation (E) step, it is shown that the best variational distribution over the state variables is the conditional posterior distribution of states given all the available measurements and inputs. Therefore, a particular type of particle filter is used to estimate and update the posterior distribution. In the maximization (M) step the nonlinear measurement process parameters are approximated using a nonlinear regression method for adjusting the parameters of a mixture of Gaussians (MofG). The proposed algorithm is used to solve a nonlinear bearing-only tracking problem similar to the one reported recently(8) with uncertain measurement process. It is shown that the algorithm is capable of accurately tracking the state vector while identifying, the unknown measurement dvnamics. Simulation results show the advantages of the new technique over standard algorithms like the EKF whose performance degrades rapidly in the presence of uncertain models.

Expectation maximisation modelling of the spatial information in combination with the statistical modelling are compared to expectation maximisation modelling based on single grey-level values. The developed segmentation results are used for two specific applications which are registration of mammographic images and mammographic risk assessment.

Despite its popularity for computing ML estimates in unrestricted problems and the need for simplified computations for problems with equality and inequality restrictions, there have been few applications of the algorithm to restricted ML estimation. The EM algorithm is presented for restricted ML estimation and provides its applications to the probit model under equality and inequality restrictions using two small data sets.

An extruded distribution is an M-dimensional manifold in the parameter space of the component distribution. Representations of that manifold are "continuous mixture models". We present a method for forming one-dimensional continuous Gaussian mixture models of sampled extruded Gaussian distributions via ridges of goodness-of-fit. Using Monte Carlo simulations and ROC analysis, we explore the utility of a variety of binning techniques and goodness-of-fit functions. We demonstrate that extruded Gaussian distributions are more accurately and consistently represented by continuous Gaussian mixture models than by finite Gaussian mixture models formed via maximum likelihood expectation maximization.

J	Moszynski, M				Moszynski, M			Indirect methods of fish target strength estimation in absolute and logarithmic domain	ACTA ACUSTICA UNITED WITH ACUSTICA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th European Conference on Underwater Acoustics (ECUA 2002)	JUN 24-27, 2002	GDANSK, POLAND					The problem of indirect fish target strength estimation from data collected using single-beam system is based on transforming probability density function (PDF) of measured fish echo level into fish target strength PDF estimate. However, when estimating fish biomass the backscattering cross-section estimates are rather used for transforming echo voltages or echo integration outputs into fish density estimates. This implies, that rather nonlogarithmic magnitudes should be used during echo data processing. The paper presents the results of estimation conducted on sample survey data and processed as well as in a logarithmic domain of fish target strength as in an absolute domain of backscattering cross-section. As the inverse problem, which has to be solved in the estimation procedure, in absolute domain is more ill-conditioned than its counterparts in logarithmic domain, the Adaptive Expectation Maximization and Smoothing (AEMS) inverse method is used. Additionally the results of transforming tar-et strength PDF into backscattering cross-section PDF is compared with results obtained using direct processing in an absolute domain.

The algorithm performs iterative sequence estimation assuming quadrature amplitude modulation signals in a frequency non-selective fading channel. The iteration begins using periodically inserted pilot symbols, and it was observed that the algorithm converges mostly within two iterations. The bit error rate performances of the proposed algorithm are evaluated using computer simulation. The results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than conventional schemes.

In fast fading scenarios, temporal variations of the channel cause significant performance degradation even with the Rake receiver. We use a previously introduced time-frequency (TF) Rake receiver based on a canonical formulation of the channel and signals to simultaneously combat fading and multipath effects. This receiver uses the Doppler spread caused by rapid time-varying channel as another means of diversity In dealing with multiaccess interference and as an attempt to avoid the prohibitive computational complexity of the optimum maximum-likelihood (NIL) detector, we use the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to derive an approximate NIL detector. The new detector turns out to have an iterative structure very similar to the well-known multistage detector with some extra parameters. At the two extreme values of these parameters, the EM detector reduces to either one-shot TF Rake or generalized multistage detector. For the intermediate values of the parameters, it combines the two estimates to obtain a better decision for the bits of the users. Because of using the EM algorithm, this detector has better convergence properties than the multistage detector; the bit estimates always converge, and if an appropriate initial vector is used, they converge to the global maximizer of the likelihood function. As a result, the new detector provides significantly improved performance while maintaining the low complexity of the multistage detector. Our simulation results confirm the expected performance improvements compared to the base case of the TF Rake as well as the multistage detector used with the TF Rake.

Such features make it difficult to classify pixels into ice and water. Accordingly, it becomes a challenge to determine the true size and boundaries of ice floes in an SAR image of polar ice. In this paper, we develop a simple statistical procedure which classifies pixels of an image by eliminating the effects of shadow-like features. Methodology developed in this paper is illustrated using some noisy SAR images of ice floes in the Arctic sea.

The fundamental problem with this approach is that the number of mixtures required to adequately describe the data is not known in advance. In our previous work [1], we described an algorithm, termed Predictive Validation, which attempted to automatically select the number of components. The aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of the various parameters in our model selection method in order to develop it into an operational tool. In this paper, we demonstrate the successful application of model validation to three applications in which the selected models are used for supervised classification, unsupervised classification and outlier detection tasks.

J	Moszynski, M				Moszynski, M			Fish target strength estimation using multiple echo statistics	ACOUSTICAL PHYSICS			English	Article								When fish strength is estimated indirectly from the sounder echo amplitudes, the inverse techniques of solving the so-called "single-beam integral equation" are quite satisfactorily used. This approach needs prior knowledge of the beam pattern PDF, as it represents the kernel of the integral equation to be solved and is usually calculated under the assumption of a uniform spatial distribution of fish. However, it may be shown that in some cases this assumption is not necessarily justified. For instance, when the density of fish increases, one receives multiple echoes from the same single fish in successive transmissions, which results in observing so-called fish echo traces. Typically used fish counting methods are either simple direct echo counting statistics or fish traces statistics [1]. Increased fish concentration is not only the reason of multiple echo formation resulting in the fish traces in consecutive pings. As it is easily seen from the geometry of the phenomenon, even a relatively low-density fish aggregation forms multiple echoes and, hence, fish traces if the vessel (or fish) relative speed is low enough and the beam pattern angular width (sampling volume) is large enough. In some situations, the uniform assumption works properly only for the cases of large numbers of samples. Taking into account this phenomenon, the accuracy of the solution can be improved by including the fish traces counting statistics in calculating the beam pattern PDR In this paper, two different models of fish traces statistics are investigated: one assuming the vessel movement with stationary fish and the other with a stationary vessel and moving fish. Both approaches are modeled numerically and verified experimentally using the data obtained from a dual-beam system. The comparison of both approaches, i.e., for single echo traces and multiple echoes, is carried out using Windowed Singular Value Decomposition (WSVD) and Expectation Maximization and Smoothing (EMS) inverse techniques of fish target strength estimation in both the absolute domain (backscattering length estimation) and the logarithmic domain (target strength estimation).

J	Sergeev, AS; Agapova, RK				Sergeev, AS; Agapova, RK			The use of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of gametic frequencies of multilocus polymorphic codominant systems based on sampled population data	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS			English	Article								Estimation of gametic frequencies in multilocus polymorphic systems based on the numerical distribution of multilocus genotypes in a population sample ("analysis without pedigrees") is difficult because some gametes are not recognized in the data obtained. Even in the case of codominant systems, where all alleles can be recognized by genotypes, so that direct estimation of the frequencies of genes (alleles) is possible ("complete data"), estimation of the frequencies of multilocus gametes based on the data on multilocus genotypes is sometimes impossible, whether population data or even family data are used for studying genotypic segregation or analysis of linkage ("incomplete data"). Such "incomplete data" are analyzed based on the corresponding genetic models using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In this study, the EM algorithm based on the random-marriage model for a nonsubdivided population was used to estimate gametic frequencies. The EM algorithm used in the study does not set any limitations on the number of loci and the number of alleles of each locus. Locus and alleles are identified by numeration making possible to arrange loops. In each combination of alleles for a given combination of tit out of L loci (L is the total number of loci studied), all alleles are assigned value 1, and the remaining alleles are assigned value 0. The sum of zeros and unities for each gamete is its gametic value (h), and the sum of the gametic values of the gametes that form a given genotype is the genotypic value (g) of this genotype. Then, gametes with the same It are united into a single class, which reduces the number of the estimated parameters. In a general case of m loci, this procedure yields m + 1 classes of gametes and 2m + 1 classes of genotypes with genotypic values g = 0, 1, 2, ..., 2m. The unknown frequencies of the m + 1 classes of gametes can be represented as functions of the gametic frequencies whose maximum likelihood estimations (MLEs) have been obtained in all previous EM procedures and the only unknown frequency (P-m(m)) that is to be estimated in the given EM procedure. At the expectation step, the expected frequencies (F-m(g) of the genotypes with genotypic values g are expressed in terms of the products of the frequencies of m + 1 classes of gametes. The data on genotypes are the numbers (n(g)) of individuals with genotypic values g = 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 2m. The maximization step is the maximization of the logarithm of the likelihood function (LLF) for n(g) values. Thus, the EM algorithm is reduced, in each case, to solution of only one equation with one unknown parameter with the use of the n(g) values, i.e., the numbers of individuals after the corresponding regrouping of the data on the individuals' genotypes. Treatment of the data obtained by Kurbatova on the MNSs and Rhesus systems with alleles C, C-w, c, D, d, E, e with the use of Weir's EM algorithm and the EM algorithm suggested in this study yielded similar results. However, the MLEs of the parameters obtained with the use of either algorithm often converged to a wrong solution: the sum of the frequencies of all gametes (4 and 12 gametes for MNSs and Rhesus, respectively) was not equal to 1.0 even if the global maximum of LLF was reached for each of them (as it was for MNSs with the use of Weir's EM algorithm), with each parameter falling within admissible limits (e.g., 0, min(P-N, P-s) for P-Ns). The chi(2) function is suggested to be used as a goodness-of-fit function for the distribution of genotypes in a sample in order to select acceptable solutions. However, the minimum of this function only guarantee the acceptability of solutions if all limitations on the parameters are met: the sum of estimations of gametic frequencies is 1.0, each frequency falls within the admissible limits, and the "gametic algebra" is complied with (none of the frequencies is negative).

It uses statistical modeling for both object and background to obtain a more robust pressure model. The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to model the data into a Mixture of Gaussians (MoG). Bayesian theory is then employed as a decision making mechanism.

These approaches are based on ML and Bayesian impulse restoration (IR). For the ML approach, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm followed by non-linear filtering that highlights impulses is used. For the Bayesian approach, a novel prior that captures the impulsive nature of the desired solution is proposed and an extension of the EM algorithm is used to find the solution. The localization receiver operating characteristics (LROC) curve is used to quantify the performance of the proposed algorithms. Numerical experiments of an extensive Monte-Carlo study are presented. These experiments demonstrate that the proposed ML-IR approach is superior to traditional likelihood ratio detection approaches for this problem. Furthermore, they also demonstrate that the proposed Bayesian-IR framework outperformes its ML counterpart.

The criterion is based on a probabilistic interpretation of the minimum classification error (MCE) training and on a modified objective function. A sequential expectation-maximization (EM) based algorithm is derived for optimizing the proposed criterion as an alternative to the well known generalized probabilistic descent (GPD) algorithm. Several variants of the training algorithm are also suggested. The superiority of all variants is shown on a oral/nasal vowel classification task and on a speech/music discrimination task in broadcast news, compared to a maximum likelihood-based system.

Both of them are globally convergent to the unique solution, easily incorporate convex penalty functions, and are parallelizable-updating all voxels (or pixels) simultaneously. They belong to a class of relaxed ordered subsets algorithms. We modify the scaling function of the existing BSREM (De Pierro and Yamagishi, 01) so that we can prove global convergence without previously imposed assumptions. We also introduce a diminishing relaxation parameter into the existing OS-SPS (Erdogan and Fessler, 99) to achieve global convergence. We also modify the penalized-likelihood function to enable the algorithms to cover a zero-background-event case. Simulation results show that the algorithms are both globally convergent and fast.

This paper presents a low-complexity iterative algorithm for combined blind and semi-blind channel estimation and soft decoding in coded OFDM systems. Channel estimation is performed in the time domain using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to take advantage of the channel-length constraint and the extra observation offered by the cyclic-prefix. The proposed technique converges within a single OFDM symbol and, therefore, has a minimum latency and is suitable for fast time-varying channels.

It proves to be useful for understanding and suggesting significant criteria. With Gaussian clustering models, for instance, the parametrization of the variance matrix of a cluster in terms of its eigenvalue decomposition allows to propose many general clustering criteria from the simplest (k-means criterion) to the most complex. Mixture models can also deal with very different situations such as quantitative data, binary data, spatial data, missing data, partially classified samples, order constraints on clusters or outliers.

We are formulating the problem in a statistical learning framework and propose an Expectation-Maximization algorithm for its solution. In addition we also present a faster, iterative histogram based method for estimating the background of the signal in small size windows. The two methods can be combined with regression techniques to correct the baseline in all regions of the chromatogram and are shown to work well even in areas of low SNR. By improving the separation of clusters, baseline correction actions reduce the classification errors when using the BEM base-caller [1] developed in our group.

While contemporary clinical SPECT scanners are limited to a horizontal axis of rotation about the patient, the compact ASET system overcomes physical proximity limitations of clinical scanners and allows for fully 3D movement in an inverted hemisphere about the breast through combined variable radius of rotation (ROR), polar and azimuthal angular positioning. With these three degrees of freedom, the ASET can traverse orbits that satisfy Orlov's sampling criterion while maintaining a small ROR, necessary to minimize resolution degradation. One class of orbits consisting of combinations of simple circular orbits and up to 601 arcs that can be implemented for the ASET system includes tilted parallel beam (TPB), circle-plus-arc, incomplete moustache, incomplete circular orbit, and spiral-plus-arcs. Each collects sufficient or nearly sufficient data for activity reconstruction of the pendant breast volume. Initial ordered subsets expectation maximization reconstructed ASET data acquired with the TPB orbit at various tilt angles yields insufficiently sampled images, since TPB at polar tilt angles > 0degrees does not satisfy Orlov's criteria. Artifacts present in these images are partly due to cardiac and hepatic contamination and also incomplete sampling, which the more complete orbits are designed to overcome. Each orbit is evaluated for image quality, including sampling and resolution characterization with cold disk and cold rod phantoms, and quantitated SNR and contrast of small lesions located in a breast with additional torso backgrounds.

The only cues used for object segmentation are the motion vectors which are sparse in MPEG. A method for automatically estimating the number of objects and extracting independently moving video objects using motion vectors is presented here. First, the motion vectors are accumulated over few frames to enhance the motion information, which are further spatially interpolated to get a dense motion vectors. The final segmentation from the dense motion vectors is obtained by applying Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. A block based affine clustering method is proposed for determining the number of appropriate motion models to be used for the EM step. Finally, the segmented objects are temporally tracked to obtain the video objects. This work has been carried out in the context of the emerging MPEG-4 standard which aims at interactivity at object level.

In this paper we propose a system to extract the features from compressed MPEG video based on the motion vector information. The global features like motion activity and camera motion parameters are extracted from the decoded motion vectors and the object features such as speed, area and trajectory are obtained after the object segmentation stage. The number of objects in a given video shot is determined by the proposed K-means clustering algorithm and the object segmentation is done by applying EM algorithm.

For this study, we used the inter-update Metz filtered OSEM (IMF-OSEM) algorithm, which has been developed by PARAPET project. The IMF-OSEM is an implementation of the OSEM algorithm with some additional capabilities such as inter-update filtering and random permutation of the subsets in each iteration. The projection data were acquired with the high-resolution PET camera developed at MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDAPET). This prototype camera, which is a multiring scanner with no septa, has a transaxial resolution of 2.8 mm that allows a better evaluation of the algorithm. We scanned three phantoms: a cylindrical uniform phantom, a cylindrical phantom with four small lesions, and the Hoffman brain phantom. The evaluation of the OSEM algorithm was performed by computing the noise level of the reconstructed images of the uniform phantom and by studying the contrast recovery for the hot lesions in warm background and also by visual inspection of images especially for the Hoffman brain phantom. In addition, the effects of post filtering and filtering during the reconstruction process have been evaluated. We observed that for the high statistics data, a good compromise between contrast recovery and noise level was achieved between 20 to 40 iterations for plain OSEM algorithm. By visually inspecting the images of Hoffman brain phantom and hot lesions, we observed that plain-OSEM algorithm, especially when followed by post-filtering, could also reasonably reproduce the phantom's structure. We also found that inter-update filtering has the potential to reach a noise level and contrast comparable to those from plain-OSEM at a smaller iteration number; however, it also has a higher tendency to develop noise artifacts.

The algorithm uses a parametrized statistical model which combines simple models of video and audio. Using unobserved variables, the model describes the process that generates the observed data. Hence, it is able to capture and exploit the statistical structure of the audio and video data, as well as their mutual dependencies. The model parameters are estimated by the EM algorithm; object templates are learned and automatic calibration is performed as part of this procedure, Tracking is done by Bayesian inference of the object location using the model. Successful performance is demonstrated on real multimedia clips.

As people move through their environments, they do not move randomly. Instead, they often engage in typical motion patterns, related to specific locations that they might be interested in approaching and specific trajectories that they might follow in doing so. Knowledge about such patterns may enable a mobile robot to develop improved people following and obstacle avoidance skills. This paper proposes an algorithm that learns collections of typical trajectories that characterize a person's motion patterns. Data, recorded by mobile robots equipped with laser range finders, is clustered into different types of motion using the popular expectation maximization algorithm, while simultaneously learning multiple motion patterns. Experimental results, obtained using data collected in a domestic residence and in an office building, illustrate that highly predictive models of human motion patterns can be learned.

This paper proposes an algorithm that learns collections of typical trajectories that characterize a person's motion patterns. Data, recorded by mobile robots equipped with laser range finders, is clustered into different types of motion using the popular expectation maximization algorithm, while simultaneously teaming multiple motion patterns. Experimental results, obtained using data collected in a domestic residence and in an office building, illustrate that highly predictive models of human motion patterns can be learned.

Virtually all existing environment mapping algorithms rely on a static world assumption, rendering them inapplicable to environments where things (chairs, desks,...) move. A natural goal of robotics research, thus, is to learn models of nonstationary objects, and determine where they are at any point in time. This paper proposes an extension to the well-known occupancy grid mapping technique. Our approach uses a straightforward map differencing technique to detect changes in an environment over time. It employs the expectation maximization algorithm to learn models of non-stationary objects, and to determine the location of such objects in individual occupancy grid maps built at different points in time. By combining data from multiple maps when learning object models, the resulting models have higher fidelity than could be obtained from any single map. A Bayesian complexity measure is applied to determine the number of different objects in the model, making it possible to apply the approach to situations where not all objects are present at all times in the map.

IEEE Signal Processing Sco, Engn Med & Biol Soc			EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; EM ALGORITHM	In this paper we investigate a mesh-modeling approach for multi-modality image reconstruction. In the proposed approach a mesh model uses information obtained from an anatomical MR image to aid in reconstruction of PET images. The aim is to improve spatial resolution and quantitative accuracy of the PET image by using anatomical boundary information from the MR image. The mesh approach accomplishes this by using spatially adaptive spatial sampling and smoothing in the PET reconstruction. Our preliminary results demonstrate that this mesh-based approach to multi-modality PET reconstruction can achieve good results at low computational cost.

The clustering metric used is the normalized cross-correlation, also known as similarity, instead of the traditionally used Euclidean distance. The main advantage of this metric is that it depends on the signal shape rather than its amplitude. Under an assumption of an exponential probability model that has several desirable properties, the expectation-maximization (EM) framework is used to derive two iterative clustering algorithms. Numerical experiments are presented using simulated data in a dynamic positron emission topography study of the brain. Initial results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better performance than several existing clustering methods.

In particular, a novel method is proposed, which is based on the use of radial basis function (RBF) neural networks. The proposed method is composed of three main steps: i) the statistical terms involved in the compound classification rule are estimated separately on each single image by using the available training set and a standard procedure for the training of RBF neural networks; ii) the joint class probabilities are roughly initialised according to a simple estimation procedure; iii) the estimation of all parameters of the networks are iteratively improved by formulating the estimation process in terms of expectation-maximisation algorithm. The main advantages of the proposed approach with respect to our previous work on this topic are the following: i) to jointly perform and optimise the estimation process of all the required statistical terms; ii) to use both labelled and unlabeled samples in the estimation of all the required statistical terms (this is made possible by the use of a specific RBF architecture); iii) to better model the temporal correlation between classes in multitemporal images by replacing the class conditional independence assumption with a less restrictive one. Experiments, carried out on a multitemporal remote-sensing data set, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed automatic approach.

We propose to apply the Maxim-am Likelihood (ML) principle in order to compute the coefficients of a multidimensional Decision-Feedback Equalizer (DFE) that generalizes the classical DFE structure to the MIMO case. The equalizer coefficients are numerically computed by means of the Space Alternating Generalized Expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm. This algorithm is known to present local convergence problems due to the existence of multiple maxima in the likelihood function. To avoid this limitation, we suggest to incorporate a small number of a priori known symbols into the transmitted data. Since the aim of these symbols is not to improve performance but just to avoid misconvergence, we term the resulting equalizer as semiblind.

Firstly, a sample set of 1, 120,000 skin pixels from a number of ethnic groups is selected and represented in the chromaticity space. In the following, parameter estimation for both the single gaussian and seven (with 2 to 8 gaussian components) gaussian mixture models is performed. For the mixture models, learning is carried out via the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm. In order to compare performances achieved by the 8 different models, we apply to each model a test set of 800 images - none from the training set. True skin regions, representing the ground truth, are manually selected, and false positive and true positive rates are computed for each value of a specific threshold. Finally, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves are plotted for each model, which make it possible to analyze and compare their relative performances. Results obtained show that, for medium to high true positive rates, mixture models (with 2 to 8 components) outperform the single gaussian model. Nevertheless, for low false positive rates, all the models behave similarly.

[10, 11] based on the maximum entropy principle. They obtain the association probabilities at a given average variance. The corresponding Lagrange multiplier is inversely related to the "temperature" and is used to control the annealing process. In this article we propose an adaptive annealing schedule where the Lagrange multiplier is treated as an unknown parameter and is estimated by an expectation-maximization step. This technique is applied to using support vector regression (SVR) for switching dynamics. We also give some preliminary results on Traveling Salesman Problems (TSP).

Five fill-in methods, viz. cubic smoothing spline interpolation, EM (Expectation maximization), regularized EM, average EM, and average regularized EM, are simultaneously employed in a first step for reconstructing the missing values of time-series data. A set of complete data from each individual fill-in method is used to train a finite impulse response (FIR) neural network to predict e time series. The outputs from individual network are combined by a selective ensemble method in the second step. Experimental results show that the prediction made by the proposed method is more accurate than those predicted by neural networks without a fill-in process or by a single H-in process.

The first step is composed of several fill-in methods for preprocessing the missing value of time-series and the outcome are the complete time-series data. The second step is composed of the several individual multilayer perceptrons (MLP) whose their outputs are combined by the Generalized Ensemble Method. There are five fill-in methods that are explored: cubic smoothing spline interpolation, and four imputation methods: EM (expectation maximization), regularized EM, average EM, average regularized EM. Mackey-Glass chaotic time-series and sunspots data are used for evaluating our approach. The experimental results show that the prediction accuracy of FI-GEM networks are much better than individual neural networks.

In the context of image processing (especially positron emission tomography), all data points are nonnegative and it is expected that both basis images and factors are nonnegative in order to obtain reasonable results. Recently the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) was introduced [6]. It was demonstrated that the NMF gave parts-based representation [6] and was useful in dynamic PET image analysis [9]. In this paper we present a sequential EM algorithm for rectified subspace analysis (subspace in nonnegativity constraint) and apply it to dynamic PET image analysis. Experimental results show that our proposed method is useful in dynamic PET image analysis.

The method is based on Maximum A-Posteriori probability concepts and combines Maximum Likelihood direction finding techniques with Kabnan Filter theory. Implicit data association is given by a Nonlinear Programming scheme that simplifies w the solution of a constrained optimization problem. Assuming Markov Motion and random Gaussian signals and noise, diverse kinematic scenarios for both synthetic and real data sets were investigated. Full data batch, semi-sequential and fully sequential variants were developed in element space, beamspace and windowed element space. ne method was found to work well down to a signal-to-noise ratio of - 10 dB, and for highly dynamic scenari. os. An alternating projection method was used for contact state initialization and signal enumeration.

The EM and SAGE algorithms are well known numerical methods for locating modes of likelihood functions. The complicated multi-dimensional search for finding ML DOA estimates can be simplified to one dimensional search by EM and SAGE. Computational efficiency can be further improved by the fast EM and SAGE algorithms which use smaller search spaces than those used by EM and SAGE. Experimental results show that the SAGE algorithm converges faster than the EM algorithm in most cases. Without losing estimation accuracy, the fast EM and SAGE algorithms lead to a significant reduction in computational time.

The recursive EM algorithm is a stochastic approximation procedure with a special gain matrix. Under proper conditions, this procedure leads to strong consistency and asymptotic normality. Using a stochastic signal model, we have derived the recursive EM algorithm to find ML DOA estimates. In contrast to existing methods of finding ML estimates, the proposed method provides a quick update of tile estimate as a new data enters. In addition, it can be applied to both narrow band and wideband signals. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm performs well for closely located sources and low SNRs. This demonstrates the potential of the suggested algorithm in real time processing.

The time-varying DOAs are described by a linear polynomial. Based on the recursive EM algorithm, we developed a recursive procedure to estimate the coefficients of the corresponding polynomial. Because of the simple structure of augmented data, the resulted recursion has a very simple implementation. Compared to the recursive algorithm developed by Frenkel and Feder, our approach has the advantage of being insensitive to signal variations. In addition, extension to the wideband case is straitforward. Simulation results show that closely spaced signals can be successfully tracked by the proposed method.

Two approaches are presented: first, using the transducers directly to model the process, and secondly using them to define a similarity measure, related to the Fisher kernel method (Jaakkola and Haussler, 1998), and then using a Memory-Based Learning (MBL) technique. These are evaluated and compared on data sets from English, German, Slovene and Arabic.

The particular characteristic of this model is that it allows the sharing of the Gaussian components of the mixture models among all classes, in the same spirit that the hidden units of a classification RBF network feed all output units. Training of the PRBF network is a likelihood maximization procedure based on the Expectation - Maximization (EM) algorithm. In this work, we propose a Bayesian regularization approach for training the PRBF network that takes into account the existence of ovelapping among classes in the region where a Gaussian component has been placed. We also propose a fast and iterative training procedure (based on the EM algorithm) to adjust the component parameters. Experimental results on well-known classification data sets indicate that the proposed method leads to superior generalization performance compared to the original PRBF network with the same number of kernels.

J	Dahlhaus, D				Dahlhaus, D			Model order estimation for joint demodulation in DS-CDMA systems	AEU-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						multiuser detection; multipath propagation; bearing estimation; SAGE algorithm; near-far effect	ALGORITHM	An iterative algorithm for estimating the number of relevant transmission paths characterized by the model order vector L in the uplink of a direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) system is presented. Estimates of simple lower bounds on the probability of correct one-shot symbol estimates are formulated as a function of bit-error rate estimates of all users and maximized w.r.t. L. The joint demodulation for a given value L is accomplished using a combination of a space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm for channel parameter estimation and a multistage detector. Simulation results indicate that the model order is estimated correctly even in situations with considerably different signal power levels.

To this end we assume that each user may transmit at one out of S available data-rates. Thus, we devise and assess a novel multiuser receiver based on the Space Alternating Generalized Expectation maximization (SAGE) algorithm. Interestingly the,resulting algorithm has an acceptable computational complexity and; in general outperforms several linear multirate receivers.

We present an EM algorithm to compute Maximum Likelihood estimates of both the separating filters and the source density parameters, whereas in the state-of-the-art separating filters are usually estimated with gradient descent techniques. The use of the EM algorithm, as opposed to the usual gradient descent techniques, does not require the empirical tuning of a learning rate and thus can be expected to provide a more stable convergence. Besides, we show how multichannel autoregressive spectral estimation techniques can be used in order to properly initialize the EM algorithm. We demonstrate the efficiency of our EM algorithm together with the proposed initialization scheme by reporting on simulations with artificial mixtures.

IEEE Comp Soc TC PAMI				Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA) have long been used for the appearance-based hand posture recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel PCA/MDA scheme for hand posture recognition. The scheme is represented by two layers of nodes (classes). The first layer of nodes acts as a crude classification using PCA and each input pattern will be given a likelihood of being in the nodes of this layer. Then MDA is applied locally to the postures in each node of the first layer to give a precise classification of the postures. Each precise class is a node in the second layer. For training, unsupervised classification at the first layer can be obtained using Expectation-Maximization (EM). For better training results, a feedback from each node in the second layer is introduced in the EM process. The experiments on a 100-sign vocabulary show a significant improvement from 57.0% to 63.5%, compared with the global MDA. If combined with HMM for movement modeling, about 93.5% recognition rate is achieved for testing data.

In most interesting cases, however, full global optimization is not feasible and local search techniques are used to discover reasonable solutions. Unfortunately, the quality of the local maxima reached depends on initialization and is often weaker than the global maximum. In this paper, we present a simple approach for combining global search with local optimization to discover improved hypotheses in general machine learning problems. The main idea is to escape local maxima by perturbing the training data to create plausible new ascent directions, rather than perturbing hypotheses directly. Specifically, we consider example-reweighting strategies that are reminiscent of boosting and other ensemble learning methods, but applied in a different way with a different goal: to produce a single hypothesis that achieves a good score on training and test data. To evaluate the performance of our algorithms we consider a number of problems in learning Bayesian networks from data, including discrete training problems (structure search), continuous training problems (parametric EM, non-linear logistic regression), and mixed training problems (Structural EM) on both synthetic and real-world data. In each case, we obtain state of the art performance on both training and test data.

As a result, it is possible that reconstructed image quality will be adversely affected. With these additional scattered photons, the effect of using more complex reconstruction strategies such as 3D detector response compensation (DRC) and attenuation correction (AC) is unclear. Through a combination of numerical Channelized Hotelling Observers (CHO) and human localization receiver operating characteristics (LROC) studies, an assessment is made of the degree to which tumour detection is affected in iterative SPECT reconstructions when scattered photons are included in the projection data. Decreased tumour detectability was observed when scattered photons are present in Ga-67 projection data compared to primary photon only reconstructions. This decrease has been found to be statistically significant at the p < 10(-6) level for both the human LROC and numerical observer studies. Furthermore, using numerical observer measurements, the addition of either AC or 3D DRC into the image reconstructiuon procedure is seen to improve lesion detectability compared to no compensation, but maximum lesion detectability occurs when both 3D DRC and AC are included.

The observed image is assumed to be a convolved and noisy version of the original image to be estimated. The restoration process is supported on prior knowledge about the original image, expressed in the wavelet coefficients, taking advantage of the sparsity of wavelet representations. Although similar formulations have been considered before, the resulting optimization problems have been computationally demanding and require offline tuning. The EM algorithm herein proposed combines the efficient image/signal representation offered by the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with the diagonalization of the convolution operator provided by the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The result is a very efficient iterative algorithm that requires O(N log N) operations per iteration. Moreover, by using a recently proposed parameter-free wavelet-domain prior, and by including the estimation of the noise variance in the EM steps, the resulting algorithm is fully data-adaptive.

The observed image is assumed to be a convolved (e.g., blurred) and noisy version of the original image. Regularization is achieved by using a complexity penalty/prior in the wavelet domain, taking advantage of the well known sparsity of wavelet representations. The EM algorithm herein proposed combines the efficient image representation offered by the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with the diagonalization of the convolution operator in the discrete Fourier domain. The algorithm alternates between an FFT-based E-step and a DWT-based M-step, resulting in a very efficient iterative process requiring 0 (N log N) operations per iteration (where N stands for the numper of pixels). The algorithm, which also estimates the noise variance, is called WAFER, standing for Wavelet and Fourier EM Restoration. The conditions for convergence of the proposed algorithm are also presented.

A key feature of our investigation is the use of an empirical system kernel determined from scans of line source phantoms. This kernel is incorporated into the forward operator of EM and the Bayesian reconstruction algorithms. Our results indicate that, particularly when an accurate system kernel is used, Bayesian methods can significantly improve reconstruction quality over FBP and EM.

We first introduce the expectation-maximization algorithm and its general convergence properties. We also give a variation of the expectation-maximization algorithm for Gaussian mixtures. We then prove that the expectation-maximization algorithm becomes a compact mapping in certain neighborhood of a consistent solution when a measure of the average overlap of Gaussian in the mixtures is small enough while the sample size is large enough. We further obtain and prove the condition of the correct convergence of it. And finally, we demonstrate the theoretical results by the simulation.

The specific task was detection and localization of Ga-67 tumors in simulated images of the thorax, and a Tc-99m transmission source was modeled in the data acquisition. Reconstructions with the rescaled block-iterative (RBI) expectation-maximization algorithm included corrections for nonuniform attenuation and collimator response, but not scatter. A combination of channelized Hotelling observer (CHO) ROC and human observer localization ROC (LROC) studies were conducted. The CHO was used to optimize the number of RBI iterations and the post-reconstruction filtering level for reconstruction strategies based on Phi is an element of {20,30,40,60,90,120} angles. The LROC study compared these optimized strategies. No significant differences in human detection-task performance were found for Phi greater than or equal to 30. This finding is attributed largely to collimator effects, the presence of uncorrected scatter in the data, and the post-filtering of the reconstructed images.

The channel is assumed to introduce dispersion in both the spatial and temporal dimensions. The channel estimator is obtained by applying the Maximum Likelihood principle not only over a known pilot sequence, as it is done in the classical Least-Squares approaches, but over all the symbols (both known and unknown) in a data frame. Since this results in an optimization problem without closed-form solution, we utilize an iterative. method, the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, to calculate the solution. The resulting channel estimator is particularly suitable to be used in a Turbo equalizing structure because it gets benefit from the a posteriori probabilities about the transmitted symbols computed at each decoding iteration of the Turbo process.

The current trend is to calculate the tissue attenuation map prior to inversion by performing a transmission scan in parallel with the SPECT session. Inverting the transmission data provides the attenuation coefficient distribution, and iterative reconstruction methods like the Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (ML-EM) algorithm are then used to reconstruct the unknown emission source. Here we consider an alternative way to attack the SPECT reconstruction problem, which consists in estimating the attenuation map from the emission data only. This leads to an inverse mathematical problem, which could no longer be solved by the notorious iterative procedures. Instead, an optimization-based approach is used.

The first method, ConTraSPECT, was developed by Welch et al. and finds the uniform elliptical attenuation distribution most consistent with the measured data. In a second more classical approach, the attenuation map is supposed to be uniform on the contour of the body. For both methods varying attenuation coefficients were tested and the attenuation maps obtained were included in a Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (ML-EM) algorithm. Both methods were tested using both simulated and experimentally acquired data. The simulated data were generated for a particular slice of the Mathematical Cardiac Torso (MCAT) phantom with its non uniform attenuation map. Data with additive Poisson-distributed noise were simulated. Scatter was not simulated. The experimental data were acquired using the Radiology Support Device striatal phantom. In conclusion we observed that the contour method worked for the purpose of relative quantification as long as the constant attenuation coefficient was carefully chosen. In contrast, ConTraSPECT seemed even suitable for absolute quantification, since it was more robust with respect to variations in the choice of the attenuation coefficient.

The distribution of the luminance of each image pixel is modeled as a random variable, which is approximated by a "mixture of Gaussians model". After recovering 3-D motion, a reference image is segmented into a fixed number of regions, each characterized by a distinct affine depth model with three parameters. The estimated depth parameters and segmentation masks are iteratively estimated using an Expectation-Maximization algorithm, similar to that proposed in [1]. In addition, the proposed algorithm is extended for cases where more than two images are available.

In this paper, we present a method combining spatial and temporal properties of features to classify different gait patterns. These features are angle data coming from gait kinematics. Mixture models are used to approximate the spatial distribution of features while stationary Markov chains describe the temporal relation within the mixture models. EM algorithm is implemented to compute parameters of mixture models and Markov chain models. The experiment result shows that combination between spatial properties and temporal properties gives a good way to gait analysis.

IEEE Signal Processing Sco, Engn Med & Biol Soc				A method for registering pairs of digital opthalmic images of the retina is presented using anatomical features as control points present in both images. In general, the matching between control points is unknown, however. An automated algorithm is used to determine the matching pairs of control points in the two images as follows. Using two control points from each image, rigid global transform (RGT) coefficients were calculated for all possible combinations of control point pairs. The set of RGT coefficients was then exhaustively searched and the cluster of coefficients associated with the matched control point pairs identified. This cluster was identified by calculating the Euclidean distance between each set of RGT coefficients and its Rth nearest neighbor and then using the EM algorithm to identify matched pairs of control points. Once control point pairs were established, registration of the two images was achieved by using linear regression to optimize the bilinear or 2nd order polynomial Two examples of registration are shown. The first is an example of cross-modal image registration using an optical image and a fluorescien angiogram of an eye. The second examples shows an example of the registration of two images of an infant eye captured thirteen days apart.

IEEE Signal Processing Sco, Engn Med & Biol Soc			EM ALGORITHM	We investigate a new, fast and provably convergent MAP reconstruction algorithm for emission tomography. The new algorithm, termed C-OSEM has its origin in the alternating algorithm derivation of the well known EM algorithm for emission tomography. In this re-derivation, the complete data explicitly enters the objective function as an unknown variable. While the entire complete data gets updated in each iteration of EM, in C-OSEM the complete data is updated only along ordered subsets. C-OSEM has a straightforward extension to the MAP case especially when using convex, smoothing priors. Unlike RAMLA and BSREM, C-OSEM does not require relaxation parameters to be set at each iteration. We derive the MAP C-OSEM algorithm using the separable surrogate method and anecdotally compare performance with MAP EM and BSREM.

By employing the unitary discrete sine transform (DST), the spatial state-space representation of the noisy blurred image is completely decoupled into a bank of one-dimensional real state-space subsystems, which to be identified. Then, the maximum likelihood estimation technique using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is developed to jointly identify the blurring functions, the image model parameters and the noise variances. The computational efficiency is implemented by incorporating the conventional Kalman smoothed estimators. The original image is restored by the inverse DST of transformed image estimates. It is shown by the experimental result that the restoration effect due to the proposed method is superior to that by the recently proposed DFT-based method.

First, we introduce the linear and kernel-based biased discriminant analysis, or BiasMap, to fit the unique nature of relevance feedback as a small sample biased classification problem. Secondly, a WARF (word association via relevance feedback) formula is presented for learning keyword relations during the process of relevance feedback. We also introduce our new user interface for CBIR, ImageGrouper, which is designed to support more sophisticated user feedbacks and annotations. Finally, we use the D-EM (Discriminant-EM) algorithm as a way of exploiting unlabeled data in CBIR and offer some insights as to when unlabeled data will help.

Its structure is very similar to the Parallel Interference Cancellation (PIC) receiver but with better convergence properties. Our simulation results show significant performance gains over conventional and PIC receivers.

Our approach uses two description levels for the segmentation mechanism. The first one, the pixel level, performs the extraction of every point in movement, forming, as result, connected regions. For this stage, a new Adaptive Reference Image (ARI) algorithm is described, based on a derivative approach. This choice presents a robust method facing changes in illumination. The second level, the region level, is driven by the contents of a model set. This high level object description, defined by geometric attributes and a motion model let us associate the ARI process with the handle objects. This stage sets this up as a Bayesian model formulation. The identification and updating process is done by a modified Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This step establishes the relationship between regions (the ARI process output) and the Object Models (OM's). For each correspondence, the EM procedure is started, updating every attribute of the object description. This framework defines a complete unsupervised tracking procedure, robust regarding occlusions, over or subsegmentations and background brightness variations. Several real traffic examples are included at the end of the paper.

A data summarization or sampling procedure is an essential step of most scalable algorithms. It forms a compact representation of the data. Based on it, traditional clustering algorithms can process large data sets efficiently. However, there is little work on how to effectively perform cluster analysis on data summaries. From the principle of the general expectation- maximization algorithm, we propose a model-based clustering algorithm to make better use of these data summaries in this paper. The proposed EMACF (Expectation-Maximization Algorithm on Clustering Features) algorithm employs data summary features including weight, mean, and variance explicitly. We prove that EMACF converges to a local maximum likelihood value. The computation time of EMACF is linear with the number of data summaries instead of the number of data items, and thus can be integrated with any efficient data summarization procedure to construct a scalable clustering algorithm.

The experimental results show that gEMACF can generate more accurate results than other scalable clustering algorithms. The experimental results also indicate that gEMACF can run two order of magnitude faster than the traditional expectation-maximization algorithm with little loss of accuracy.

The reconstruction of intracerebral vessels from few projections by means of Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) - Expectation Maximization (EM) gives very slow convergence. The proposed algorithm reconstructs images in two stages. In the first stage a rough estimated image is reconstructed by the MAP-EM method with a Gibbs prior. Then the last image in the first iteration sequence (ex. after 15 iterations) is used for the second penalty function in the second reconstruction sequence. This penalty function can accelerate the convergence of image reconstruction for the MAP-EM method. In this penalty function we considered the connectivity of vessels between adjacent slices. The idea is based on the assumption that a blood vessel is a line consisting of at least three voxels that have almost the same voxel values. We evaluated the proposed method by using a simulation phantom and an experiment phantom made with a curved wire. The number of projection views used was five (RAO 60, 30, LAO 60, 30 and 0 deg.). The quality of the image was evaluated by the profiles of reconstructed three-dimensional images. These profiles showed the improvement in voxel values at low voxel-value areas with the proposed method. The results showed that the proposed method was useful for the reconstruction of vessels with few projections.

Hence, the design of efficient and accurate text classification systems is of interest. In this paper, we explore a framework, in which we improve the performance of a base classifier, by clustering unlabeled data with labeled data using probabilistic and fuzzy approaches. We have used Expectation Maximization and Semi-Supervised Fuzzy C-Means for clustering the unlabeled data with labeled data. The Naive Bayes Classifier was the base classifier utilizing both the original labeled data and then additional data labeled through clustering. Utilizing unlabeled data from semi-supervised fuzzy clustering results in an improved classifier.

The uniqueness of our idea in comparison with other similar methods is the concept. of the virtual PDF (probability distribution function) that models signal mixing on the sensor In this paper we derive the virtual PDF based on positivity constraint, unity constraint, and randomness assumption, and we then build it into the mixture density model. In order to learn parameters of this model from data using EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm, the key point is to derive the approximation of the virtual PDF using its cumulants. Finally we illustrate experimental results on synthetic data to show the unique decision boundary obtained from our method.

The constraints arising from parallel and orthogonal lines and planes can be efficiently exploited at various stages of vision processing pipeline. In this paper we propose an approach for estimation of vanishing points by exploiting the constraints of structured man-made environments, where the majority of lines is aligned with the principal orthogonal directions of the world coordinate frame. We combine efficient image processing techniques used in the line detection and initialization stage with simultaneous grouping and estimation of vanishing directions using expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Since we assume uncalibrated camera the estimated vanishing points can be used towards partial camera calibration and estimation (if the relative orientation of the camera with respect to the scene. The presented approach is computationally efficient and has been verified extensively by experiments.

In order to truly detect functional activation areas, it is necessary to eliminate the effects of physiological movements of subject (i.e., gross head motion, pulsatile blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow) from fMRI time series data. In this paper, we propose a method for eliminating artifacts due to not only rigid-body motion such as gross head motion, but also non-rigid-body motion like the deformation caused by the pulsatile blood and CSF flow. The proposed method estimates subject movements by using gradient methods which can detect subpixel optical flow. Our method estimates the subject movements on a "pixel-by-pixel" basis, and achieves the accurate estimation of both rigid-body and non-rigid-body motion. The artifacts are reduced by correction based on the estimated movements. Therefore, brain activation areas are accurately detected in functional brain images. We demonstrate that our method is valid by applying it to real fMRI data and that it can improve the detection of brain activation areas.

First, we develop a Poisson model for blank scan data obtained from rotating rod sources. Then, we estimate the detector efficiencies using two expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms that differ in the way the maximization step is solved. As desired, the resulting algorithms have the property that the log-likelihood function is non-decreasing as the iteration number increases. Simulation studies using synthetic data demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperformed two alternative approaches.

On one hand, a data driven designed neural modelling of handwriting primitives is proposed ANNs are firstly used as state models in a HMM primitive divider that associates each signal frame with an ANN by minimizing the accumulated prediction error. Then, the neural modelling is realized by training each network on its own frame set. Organizing these two steps in an EM algorithm, precise primitive models are obtained. On the other hand, a data driven systematic method is proposed for HMM topology inference task. All possible prototypes of a pattern class are firstly merged into several clusters by a Tabu search aided clustering algorithm. Then a multiple parallel-path HMM is constructed for the pattern class. Experiments prove an 8% recognition improvement with a saving of 50% of system resources, compared to an intuitively designed referential ANN/HMM system.

However, a drawback for the gradient-descent approaches is the slow training speed, which limits their applications in large training problems, such as large vocabulary speech recognition and other applications. For hidden Markov models, some training algorithms, such as the reestimation (or expectation-maximization) algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), are fast, but they are not readily extendible to discriminative training for recognition performance improvements. To address the problem, we proposed a fast discriminative training algorithm in this paper. It is a batch-mode algorithm derived for the objective function of minimal error rate. The significant advantage is its closed-form solution for parameter estimation during iterations, instead of incremental search in the direction of gradient, as conventionally done. We experimentally show that the algorithm requires only a few iterations to achieve the optimization objective and that the estimated results lead to better recognition performance than a traditional MLE.

Since maximum-likelihood sequence estimation is too complex to perform, multiuser receivers are proposed based on the sequential expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. With prior knowledge of only the signature waveforms, the delays and the second-order statistics of the fading channel, the receivers sequentially estimate the channel using the sequential EM algorithm. The snapshot estimates of each path are further tracked by linear minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) filters and the user data are detected by a maximum-likelihood sequence detector, given the channel estimates. The proposed receivers that use the exact expressions have a computational complexity O(2(K)) per bit, where K is the number of users. Using the traditional EM algorithm, we derive low-complexity approximations which have a complexity of O(K(2)) per bit. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed receivers offer substantial performance gains over conventional pilot-symbol assisted techniques and achieve a performance close to the known-channel bounds. Furthermore, the proposed receivers even outperform the single-user RAKE receiver with Nyquist pilot-insertion rate in a single-user environment.

A mixture model formulation allows separate consideration of whether the event will eventually occur, termed incidence, and when the event will occur given the individual is susceptible, termed latency. In this paper, we propose a flexible semi-parametric cure model. In the model the latency distribution is non-parametrically specified, and covariates can affect the incidence probability through a non-linear generalized additive model. An EM algorithm, applied to a penalized likelihood, is developed to fit the model. Likelihood ratio tests are developed to test for non-linearity. The proposed methodology is applied to a data set of tonsil cancer patients treated with radiation therapy to evaluate the effects of dose and treatment time on the probability of local recurrence. The estimation and testing procedures are evaluated in a Monte Carlo simulation study. The simulation results suggest that the procedure can estimate the non-linearity and that the likelihood ratio test is effective in detecting departures from linearity.

In this paper we further prove that it is exactly an EM algorithm for the MAP factor estimate problem. Thus its convergence can be guaranteed. We also empirically show that NFA has better generalization ability than Independent Factor Analysis (IFA) on data with small sample size.

We define a video scenelet as a short consecutive samples of frames of a video sequence. The approach makes use of an unsupervised method to represent scenelets of a video with a concise Gaussian mixture model and cluster them into different video scenes according to their visual similarities. In particular, the Expectation-Maximization algorithm is employed to estimate the unknown model parameters, and Bayesian Information Criterion is used to determine the optimal number and model of scene clusters in a principled manner. This approach is fundamentally different from many existing video clustering methods, as it does not require explicit knowledge of shot boundaries. Instead, the shot boundaries can also be obtained as a by-product of the scene clustering process. The proposed methods have been tested with various types of sports videos and promising results are reported in this paper.

The waveforms are made up of one low, and one high, bandwidth type. Various features have been extracted from each waveform for training different classifiers. Specifically, the classifier types consist of various neural networks, Weighted voting (Linear), Fishers Linear discriminant, the Expectation Maximization algorithm, and the Bayesian Data Reduction Algorithm. The contribution of this paper is to show that overall classification performance improves if the decision outputs of the individually trained classifiers are fused using majority voting. Also, it is shown that classification performance depends on the transmitting carrier frequency of the waveforms and the specific configuration of the classes used to train each classifier.

Each linear dynamic model is formulated as a state-space system, where the VTR's target-directed dynamic property is incorporated in the state equation and a linear regression function is used for the observation equation to piecewise linearly approximate the nonlinear mapping relationship. A version of the generalized EM algorithm is developed for learning the model parameters, where the VTR targets are constrained to change only at the segmental level (rather than at the frame level) in the parameter learning and model scoring algorithms. Speech recognition experiments are carried out to evaluate this new model using the N-best re-scoring paradigm in a Switchboard task. Compared with a baseline recognizer using the triphone HMM acoustic model, the new recognizer demonstrates superior performance under a number of experimental conditions.

The model consists of two parts; one is nonlinear transformation and the other is sparse coding to reduce the dependency involved in the transformed signal. The later part theoretically corresponds to noisy Independent Component Analysis. The two parts individually learns so as to maximize the entropy. The model can well reproduce a couple of biological phenomena observed in the auditory system. They are virtual pitch and masking effect. These results imply that the nonlinear transformation by single neurons and the transformation realized by neural populations play essential roles to obtain efficient information processing, i.e., coding, in the primary auditory system. This is consistent to the recent results in the primary visual system, which have introduced the notion of maximum entropy criterion and sparse coding.

This paper proposes to combine a handset selector with stochastic feature transformation to reduce the mismatch. Specifically, a GMM-based handset selector is trained to identify the most likely handset used by the claimants, and then handset-specific stochastic feature transformations are applied to the distorted feature vectors. To overcome the non-linear distortion introduced by telephone handsets, a 2nd-order stochastic feature transformation is proposed. Estimation algorithms based on the stochastic matching technique and the EM algorithm are derived. Experimental results based on 150 speakers of the HTIMIT corpus show that the handset selector is able to identify the handsets accurately (98.3%), and that both linear and non-linear transformation reduce the error rate significantly (from 12.37% to 5.49%).

The scheme works without setting any parameter. The mean shift detection problem is divided into two stages: window size optimization and detection. In the first stage, the maximum circular neighborhood centered on each pixel for which it is true that all the elements belong to the same class as the central one is estimated using redundant data sets generated with overlapping groups. Statistics are computed from all these neighborhoods and associated to the respective central pixels. As expected, larger values of a minimizing energy function are assigned to pixels belonging to heterogeneous regions. In the second stage, those regions are detected by applying first an expectation-maximization algorithm and, afterwards, automatically defining a threshold between homogeneous and heterogeneous regions. The present scheme is tested on a set of synthetical images. Results are shown on synthetical and real images. Extensions of the scheme to textural cases are also shown.

Maps generated by our approach consist of small numbers of planar surfaces, which are augmented by fine-grained polygons for non-flat environmental features. Our approach builds on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, but develops a new, incremental version that can be executed in real-time. Experimental results obtained in corridor-type environments illustrate that compact and accurate maps can be acquired in real-time, from range and camera data collected by a mobile robot.

The parameters of the model can be generated in different ways. The most common way of generating these parameters is using the kmeans (KM) algorithm and/or the expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm. In this paper a third method is proposed based on genetic algorithms(GA). The GA-based method is computationally more expensive than the other techniques when enrolling the speakers. But for the identification task it takes as much time as the other methods and this is because it is only used to generate the model parameters and not the features.

We present an application of hierarchical Bayesian methods to the problem of recognizing degraded printed characters in a variety of fonts. The proposed method works by using training data of various styles and classes to compute prior distributions on the parameters for the class conditional distributions. For classification, the parameters for the actual class conditional distributions are fitted using an EM algorithm. The advantage of hierarchical Bayesian methods is motivated with a theoretical example. Severalfold increases in classification performance relative to style-oblivious and style-conscious are demonstrated on a multifont OCR task.

The idea is to transfer the optimization to a general class of convex divergences between two probability density functions. The first part explains why such optimization transfer is significant. The second part contains derivation of the generalized ICA (Independent Component Analysis). Experiments on brain fMRI maps are reported. The third part discusses this optimization transfer in the generalized EM algorithm (Expectation-Maximization).

However in wireless systems, performance and mobility can be further enhanced either by operating semi-blind channel estimation refinement or variation tracking between reference symbols. In this paper, we propose a semi-blind Expectation-Maximization (EM) based estimation method which takes into account OFDM specificities. Indeed, a new EM cost function is introduced accounting for the fact that the channel impulse response is shorter than the cyclic prefix duration. Simulation results using the new algorithm yields a 2 dB SNR improvement compared to classical training sequences based channel estimation in the context of 5 GHz OFDM WLANs (IEEE802.11a and HIPERLAN/2).

In this work, we present a novel method for estimation of time delays and amplitudes of multipath arrivals with a maximum a posteriori estimation approach. Maximum a posteriori estimation is optimal if appropriate statistical models are selected for the received data; its implementation, however, is computationally demanding. To reduce the computational requirements for the analytical calculation of the necessary probability distribution functions, we propose optimization using Gibbs sampling. Gibbs sampling allows the estimation of posterior probability distributions through an iterative process. Through a comparison to a simple matched filter and analytical maximum a posteriori estimation, the new method is shown to be accurate and efficient. The Gibbs sampling - maximum a posteriori estimation approach is also demonstrated to be more informative than other time delay and amplitude estimation methods, because it provides estimates of posterior probability distribution functions in addition to point estimates typically provided by other approaches.

The EM algorithm gives good reconstructed images compared to those created by deterministic methods such as Filtered Back Projection (FBP) and Convolution Back projection (CBP). However, the computational complexity of EM-based algorithm is high due to the iterative nature of the algorithm. Prior knowledge of the estimate has been added to the basic EM algorithm to improve image quality as well as to reduce the number of iterations required for an acceptable image quality. We have developed an algorithm which produces better quality images in much lesser number of iterations, thereby speeding up the image reconstruction task.

The detectors have two soft and hard stages. In soft stage, a soft estimation of the interference is obtained by solving an unconstrained maximum-likelihood (NIL) problem via iterative Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Then, the hard stage detects the user information bit by solving a one-dimensional Boolean constrained problem conditioned on knowing the interference. Our results reveal that the proposed detectors have very low complexity and robust against changes in parameters. Moreover, the numerical results illustrate that despite of their simplicities, our detectors substantially outperform other well-known suboptimum detectors, such as multi-stage and decorrelating detectors.

However, if an a posteriori function is maximized instead of the likelihood function, this rescaling procedure produces a different outcome. This abstract concentrates on the difference between these procedures applied in the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) algorithm with the Median Root Prior (MRP). It will be shown that depending on the way the prior is utilised, it is possible to achieve more noise reduction in the low sensitivity regions. The disadvantage being the fact that weight prior, beta, must be tuned according to the maximum in the sensitivity.

We study resolution properties for MLEM/Ordered Subsets EM (OSEM) with different types of regularisation. It will be shown that although different parts of the image converge at different rates, pure and post filtered MLEM/OSEM achieve reasonably uniform resolution. By contrast, inter-iteration filtering (IF OSEM) with smoothing filters, such as a Gaussian, produces images with varying spatial resolution that is dependent on the surrounding activity. We conclude that the resolution non-uniformity is entirely due to the filtering. We propose a spatially varying filter to overcome this problem and to obtain images with nearly uniform resolution. Experimental evidence of the performance of these filters on noiseless data is also shown.

Recently, we have proposed a new mixture model called block mixture model which takes into account this situation. This model allows to embed simultaneous clustering of objects and variables in a mixture approach. We have considered this probabilistic model under the classification likelihood approach and we have developed a new algorithm for simultaneous partitioning based on the Classification EM algorithm. In this paper, we consider the block clustering problem under the maximum likelihood approach and the goal of our contribution is to estimate the parameters of this model. To reach this aim, we use an approximation of the likelihood and we propose an alternated-optimization algorithm to estimate the parameters, and to illustrate our approach, we study the case of binary data.

Particularly, Nowak et al. [11] generalized an evolutionary theory of language with the universal grammar mathematically. In this paper, we propose a model of language evolution for the emergence of creole based on their theory, and try to discover the critical conditions for creolization. In our experimentation, we utilize the inside-outside (EM) algorithm to find the grammar of a new generation. As a result, we contend that creolization is strongly affected by the popularity of community of the original language, rather than the similarity of original grammars.

The parameters optimized are the iteration number and the amount of 3-D Gaussian postfiltering. The numerical observer employed in the optimization was the channelized Hotelling observer (CHO). We used channels as previously determined to rank tumor detection accuracy of different reconstruction strategies, that showed good agreement with the rankings of human observers. The intent of this work was to determine if this CHO could also be employed for the detection of CAD. Results indicate that when quantized images are used, the CHO optimization results correlates well with human observers. However, when using floating-point images, the CHO maintains detection performance even when images are excessively filtered, a result that is at odds with our human observer study. Modeling the additive internal noise that quantization introduces, requires further investigation.

This is referred to as the Expectation-Maximization-Viterbi algorithm (EMVA) [1, 2]. The EMVA is a blind algorithm capable of simultaneously performing system identification and signal estimation whenever the transmission system can be modeled as a finite-state machine with unknown parameters, a scenario frequently encountered in signal processing for communications. We specifically focus on CPM, but the algorithm is equally applicable to any other modulation type, linear or nonlinear. The channel estimate obtained via the EMVA is shown via simulations to asymptotically (as the SNR increases) attain the most optimistic Cramer-Rao bound and to have an error performance close to that of the true channel; a 0.5 dB difference is seen at BER equal to 10(-4).

The method we employ is based on the expectation maximization Viterbi algorithm (EMVA) [1][2][3]. The. EMVA is applicable to transmission schemes that can be modeled as a finite state machine (FSM), whose noisy output sequence is thus a hidden Markov chain. The GMSK signal transmitted via an inter-symbol interference.(ISI) channel is just one particular instance of a hidden Markov model [2][3][4]. Our channel identification procedure makes full use of the known training bits available in each GSM frame and thereby results in a semi-blind EMVA (SbEMVA). For a static ISI channel, simulation results indicate that the SbEMVA is near-optimal in error-performance. For a Ricean fading ISI channel with a spread factor of 0.01, a K factor of 5, and at a BER of 10(-3), we fend that the SbEMVA is about 4 dB better than the ML receiver that uses the channel estimate obtained from just the training data.

In particular, two novel versions of the BEM-based detection and demodulation algorithms are derived. In contrast to the earlier developments of BEM algorithms, the formulations derived in this paper lead to the computationally efficient algorithms which avoid the matrix inversions while using sequential processing over the time and trellis branch indexes. In addition, it is shown how the recursive versions of the BEM algorithms can be combined with the well-known forward-backward processing soft-input soft-output (SISO) algorithms resulting in adaptive SISOs with soft decision directed (SDD) channel estimators. An application of the-proposed algorithms to the iterative "turbo-processing" receivers illustrates how these SDD channel estimators can efficiently exploit the extrinsic information obtained from the SISO decoder in order to enhance their estimation accuracy.

The instantaneous FHR (beats/min) can either be obtained by Doppler ultrasound or directly from the fetal electrocardiogram via scalp electrodes. The uterine activity is measured using an external tocodynamometer or with the use of an intra-uterine pressure catheter (mmHg) [1]. Today, almost all cardiotocographs in use are operating using Doppler ultrasound and external tocodynamometer (CTG is acquired using an Doppler ultrasound that is applied externally on the pregnant's womb and it records the movements of the fetus). This method of CTG acquisition often leads to a discontinuous trace, arising the problem of missing data. In this paper we propose a technique, based on the maximum likelihood framework, for the data forecasting between these discontinuities of the CTG signal. More specific, the probability density function (pdf) of the CTG signal is assumed to be mixture of Gaussian, and the parameters are estimating on-line using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Following the statistics of the signal's source, we predict the missing samples under the constraint that the distance between adjacent values is relative short in the time domain. The evaluation of our method shows improvement of the prediction accuracy when compared with a linear interpolation method.

After a finite number of iterations, the response of the MLEM-reconstruction algorithm is non-linear and not shift-invariant. As a result, two problems occur when MLEM is used for tracer kinetic modeling. First, resolution and recovery may be different for different positions and for different time frames, adversely affecting the modeling results. Second, it is not trivial to determine appropriate weights for weighted least squares fitting to image derived time-activity curves. The first problem can be remedied by applying a "relatively high" number of iterations, followed by smoothing with a shift invariant kernel. The smoothing kernel reduces the noise and imposes an (approximately) constant resolution. For the second problem, different approaches exist. Some authors have shown that the variance of pixel values in MLEM images is proportional to the mean of the pixel value. Others have suggested that the uncertainty about a reconstructed pixel value can be estimated from the Fisher information matrix. These two approaches produce different results. Our simulation study confirms that the pixel variances of unsmoothed MLEM images are approximately proportional to the pixel values. However, smoothing reduces the variance more in high count regions than in low count regions. As a result, the variances of smoothed MLEM pixel values correlate better with the reciprocal of the diagonal elements of the Fisher information matrix. Smoothing strongly affects the variance because neighboring pixel values are highly correlated. Because computing the mean of a region is a smoothing operation, the Fisher information can be used to compute appropriate weight values for model based analysis of time-activity curves.

The gamma camera system with a semiconductor detector enables us to measure projection data with arbitrary angles because the detector is smaller than those of the ordinary gamma cameras with a scintillation detector. The proposed data acquisition scheme is to measure projection data with angles where the signal to noise ratio in projection data is relatively high. We assumed that we could measure twenty projections to the heart, i.e., in the x-y plane the positions of the detector were 0, 30, 60 and 90 deg. (anterior to LAO 90 deg.) and in the y-z plane they were 60, 30, 0, -30 and -60 deg. to the x-y plane. Then to reduce the number of projections required for an acceptable quality of images, we carefully decided the minimum number of projections and selected optimum projection angles. The criterion for selecting the projection angle was an integral value of power spectra for each projection. We listed projection angles in descending order according to this integral value and made four projection subsets. A subset was composed of two projections, i.e., the projection which had the largest integral value and the other projection which was perpendicular to the former one. In the image reconstruction we used the ordered subset expectation maximization method and used four subsets that were composed of two orthogonal projections that were selected according to the above rule. As a result, even with only eight projection data we could obtain images of almost the same quality as those with 60 projections.

Specifically the inverse covariance (precision) matrix of each Gaussian is expanded in a rank-1 basis i.e., Sigma(j)(-1) = P-j = Sigma(k=1)(D) lambda(k)(j)a(k)a(k)(T), lambda(k)(j) is an element of R, a(k) is an element of R-d. A generalized EM algorithm is proposed to obtain maximum likelihood parameter estimates for the basis set {a(k)a(k)(T)} and the expansion coefficients {lambda(k)(j)}. This model, called the Extended Maximum Likelihood Linear Transform (EMLLT) model, is extremely flexible: by varying the number of basis elements from d to d(d + 1)/2 one gradually moves from a Maximum Likelihood Linear Transform (MLLT) model to a full-covariance model. Experimental results on two speech recognition tasks show that the EMLLT model can give relative gains of up to 35% in the word error rate over a standard diagonal covariance model.

The resulting algorithm is guaranteed to monotonically increase the loglikelihood functional. Both the expectation step and the maximization step are given in closed form. The formulation is general enough that it can be extended to other energy-dependent models for the detectors.

Rice is the staple food in many parts of Asia and knowledge of rice growth provides valuable economic and environmental information. Extensive pixel accuracy ground truth from an area of Kojima, Japan is used to compare the accuracy of unsupervised mapping algorithms. An acceptable classification is achieved by Gaussian Expectation Maximisation applied to existing maximum-likelihood (ML) based segmentation methods. Using a Bayesian extension of the ML segmentation scheme gives a dramatic improvement in accuracy which results in a pixel classification accuracy of 86% (68% kappa) and an essentially exact estimate of rice coverage within a 1000 hectare area.

A theory of learning discrete Bayesian networks from data is presented in this paper. The theory is based on a joint criterion of maximizing the joint probability or interchangeably miniziming the joint description length of the data and the Bayesian network model including the network structure and the probability distribution parameters. The computable formalisms for the data likelihood given a structure, the description length of a structure, and the estimation of the parameters given a structure are derived. EM algorithms are constructed for handling incomplete and soft data. The theory leads to a computational algorithm described in a companion paper.

The Alamouti's transmit diversity scheme with two transmit antennas is employed here and generalized for OFDM systems. The algorithm requires a convenient representation of the discrete multipath fading channel based on the Karhunen-Loeve orthogonal expansion and estimates the complex channel parameters of each subcarriers iteratively using the Expectation Maximization(EM) method, which converges to the true MAP estimation of the unknown channel. Ananalytical expression is derived for the Modified Cramer-Rao. lower bound of the proposed MAP channel estimator. The performance is presented in terms of the mean-square error for a system employing QPS signaling.

A non-data-aided scheme is considered for the estimation of a multipath time-varying channel by averaging over the M-PSK signal constellation. For this, an EM algorithm is derived which estimates the complex channel parameters of each subcarriers iteratively in frequency domain and which converges to the true MAP estimation of the Unknown channel, The algorithm requires a convenient representation of die discrete multipath fading channel based on the Karhumen-Loeve orthogonal expansion. The algorithm is applied to the QPSK modulated OFDM systems and efficiency of the method proposed is shown by the computer simulations.

This approach is inspired in the parallelism that may be drawn between chaotic estimation and multiuser detection, which also becomes prohibitively complex as the number of users increases. The resulting algorithms are based on an iterative updating of estimates of the chaotic signal itinerary. Computer simulations show that the proposed algorithms achieve the performance of the ML estimator for short data registers and improve the computationally feasible (suboptimal) estimators for long records.

All TH-SPECT reconstructions will contain artifacts since the tilted orbit does not satisfy the Orlov sampling criteria. However, it is not clear which reconstruction method, if any, is better suited for TH-SPECT data. Here a geometric derivation of the ramp filter for tilted parallel-beam geometries is presented. A new filter is then heuristically suggested, specifically designed to boost frequencies near the unmeasured null space present in all TH-SPECT geometries. This filter, H(nu(11),tau(11)), was combined with the ramp filter and then implemented and compared with an iterative Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization (OSEM) algorithm and a ramp-only FBP algorithm, using TH-SPECT data. Contrast values as well as axial elongation present in all TH-SPECT reconstructions were characterized using a mini-Defrise disk phantom placed inside a fillable breast phantom and imaged from 0-15 degree head tilt. At small tilt angles about the mini-Defrise disk phantom, contrasts were generally equal between H(nu(11),tau(11)) -filtered FBP and OSEM reconstructions compared at similar noise values, and poorer contrasts were obtained for ramp-only FBP results. In conclusion, measured results indicate OSEM reconstruction may offer better shape and uniform activity distribution of the breast compared to FBP methods. H(nu(11),tau(11))-filtered TH-SPECT FBP, however, performed more comparably to OSEM than ramp-only FBP methods, and other similar filtering techniques may provide even greater improvements.

Therefore, the PET system has been mounted directly at the treatment site. A fully 3D reconstruction algorithm based on the Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization algorithm has been developed and adapted to a spatially varying imaging situation. The scatter and attenuation correction is applied to the measured list mode data before each iterative step. This requires an attenuation map containing the Information on the tissue composition and densities. This information is derived from the X-ray computed tomograms (CT) of the patient and the patient fixation system including the head rest. The scatter correction is included into the forward projection step of the Maximum Likelihood image reconstruction. The normalization of scattered events relative to the unscattered events is done by a global scatter fraction factor. The results are presented.

Since the training is unsupervised, no target values are needed. The TSFRS models the degree of membership based on a given distribution that can be modified by changing the consequence of the rules or by rule pruning. We use this training algorithm to train a hidden Markov model (HMM) with state memberships provided by TSFRS using a modified Baum-Welch algorithm.

The maximum a posteriori (MAP) hidden states in an Ising model are estimated by a stochastic EM algorithm. We demonstrate that HMGMM obtains better classification than several popular methods, including CART, LVQ, causal HMM, and multiresolution HMM in terms of Bayes risk and the spatial homogeneity of the classified objects. A heuristic solution for the number of clusters achieves a robust image classification.

Since the methods-of learning RBFN are often separated into two stages which trend lead to suboptimal results. In this paper we proposed the method of using EM algorithm to training the whole parameters at the same stage such that the parameters are learned globally. The initial parameters are decided by an improved cluster method to alleviate the local minimal problem. We analyze the relationship between the RBFN and the Gaussian mixture model that assure the feasibility of using the EM algorithm in RBFN.

The main task of image segmentation is to extract interested objects placed at different locations in images, so it is a kind of pattern classification problem. It can be treated as maximum likelihood estimation problem in color image when represented in color histogram. In order to improve the flexibility of the classify result in changed environment we propose the method of training the color pattern in a neural network using the EM algorithm which is a general method for maximum likelihood problem.

Therefore a reconstruction algorithm is required which can, in a practical time frame, reconstruct into very large image arrays (sub-millimetre voxels, which range over a large field of view) whilst preferably retaining the precision of the data. This work presents an algorithm which meets these demands: Regularized One-Pass List-mode EM (ROPLE). The algorithm operates directly on list-mode data, passes through the data once only, accounts for finite resolution effects in the system model and also includes regularization. The algorithm performs multiple image updates during its single pass through the list-mode data, corresponding to the number of subsets that the data have been split into. The algorithm has been assessed using list-mode data from a quad-HIDAC, and is compared to the analytic reconstruction method 3D RP.

The algorithm has the following desirable attributes; fast convergence is attained for high frequency object components, is less sensitive to constraint parameters, and will accommodate randomly missing data. Speed and convergence results are presented. Field test imagery was obtained with a passive millimeter wave imaging sensor having a 30.5 cm aperture. The algorithm was implemented and tested in near real time using field test imagery. Theoretical results and experimental results using the field test imagery will be compared using an "effective aperture" measure of resolution increase. The effective aperture measure, based on examination of the edge-spread function, will be detailed.

Due to the high dimensionality of these images, the underlining motivation of this work was on how to build up a robust unsupervised segmentation algorithm with acceptable computation complexity. After an initial approximate segmentation using EM algorithm, a cost function associated to each pixel is proposed. This function includes a term that measures how close the pixel at hand is to region's distribution centroids, and another term that measures the local homogeneity in pixel's neighborhood. In addition, an edge progression technique has been used to optimally re-label pixels. Extensive experiments have been carried out on many multispectral images and quantitative results have shown the efficiency of this approach.

We extend a robust parametric clustering algorithm able to manage outlier rejection to the semi-supervision approach. This is achieved by modifying the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. The proposed method shows good performance with respect to data structure discovering, even facing to outliers.

Our proposal kernel function, Constructive Elliptical Basis Function (CEBF), is an extension of the EBF and can effectively represent ill-scaled and non-separable distributions without a covariance matrix even in high dimensionality in a nonparametric manner. The overlapping CEBFs with a fixed smoothing parameter can be used as an approximation of Gaussian distribution in a statistical sense. Using CEBFs as kernel functions, we propose Non-parametric Expectation-Maximization (NPEM) for the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Then we show that NPEM obtains better estimation in terms of log likelihood than traditional EM algorithms when the given data set has high dimensionality or holds multiple components by numerical experiments.

The measurements discussed are white blood cell counts. Blood samples were analyzed both by machine and manually. The variable analyzed statistically is the logarithm of the count, because the counts vary over several orders of magnitude. A mixture of two bivariate normal distributions is fitted to the log counts. In one distribution there is high correlation between the machine and manual results. In the other, corresponding to low machine counts, there is very low correlation between the two. Fitting the mixture model yields estimates of the distributional parameters. Taking into account the risks and costs, a suitable cut-off point is found in the marginal distribution of the decision variable, the log machine count.

One method to correct for respiratory artifacts is through respiratory gating. We study the effectiveness of respiratory gating through a simulation study using the newly developed NURBS-based cardiac-torso (NCAT) phantom. The organ shapes in the NCAT phantom are formed using non-uniform rational b-splines (NURBS) and are based on detailed human image data. With its basis on actual human data, the NCAT phantom realistically simulates human anatomy and motions such as the cardiac and respiratory motions. With the NCAT software, we generated 128 phantoms over one respiratory cycle (5 seconds per cycle) with the diaphragm and heart set to move a total of 4 cm from end-inspiration to end-expiration. The heart was set to beat at a rate of 1 beat per second resulting in a total of five heart cycles. We divide the respiratory cycle into different numbers of respiratory gates (16, 8, and 4) by averaging the phantoms. For each gate, we generate its projection data using an analytical projection algorithm simulating the effects of attenuation, scatter, and detector response. We then reconstruct the projections using an iterative OS-EM algorithm compensating for the three effects. The reconstructed images for each gating method were examined for artifacts due to the respiratory motion during that gate. We found that respiratory artifacts are significantly reduced if the respiratory motion of the heart that occurs during a gating time period is 1 cm or less. We conclude that respiratory gating is an effective method for reducing effects due to respiration. The timing of the gates is dependent on the extent of the heart's motion during respiration.

Since router link monitoring is not practical due to high communication overhead, there has been considerable interest in monitoring from edge (end-to-end) observations. This paper focuses on the estimation of internal link delay distributions from edge measurements. Discrete and continuous delay models are introduced and we propose a new mixed finite mixture model for link delay probability density functions(p.d.f). When collecting end-to-end unicast packet delays from edge nodes, we are able to estimate internal link delay distributions using the EM algorithm. Simulation results are given to illustrate our method.	Univ Michigan, Dept EECS, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA	Shih, MF (reprint author), Univ Michigan, Dept EECS, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.

For range distributed targets with multiple discrete scatterers, HRR radars will receive detections across multiple range bins. When the resolution is very high, and the target has significant extent, then it is likely that the detections will not occur in adjacent bins. For target tracking purposes, the multiple detections must be grouped and fused to create a single object report and a range centroid estimate is computed since the detections are range distributed. With discrete scatterer separated by multiple range bins, then when closely spaced objects are present there is uncertainty about which detections should be grouped together for fusion. This paper applies the EM algorithm to form a recursive measurement fusion algorithm that segments the data into object clusters while simultaneously forming a range centroid estimate with refined bearing and elevation estimates.

This is when there is noise in both the partial differential equation and the observations. Previous spatially varying parameter estimation work allows one or the other but not both. We show how to deal with this case by developing a penalised EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm for noisy observations of the stochastic heat equation.

Thirty-six subjects including normal controls and lung cancer patients underwent whole body PET scan (emission 3 min, transmission 1 min) using a GE Advance scanner after the administration of approximately 370 MBq of FDG. The raw data were then reconstructed by conventional FBP and OSEM. The PET images were interpreted by two observers with random exposure of normal and diseased cases for transverse and coronal sections. The results were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The optimal parameters for reconstructing by OSEM involved 2 iterations and 16 subsets. The image quality of thirty-six subjects including normal controls and lung cancer patients reconstructed by OSEM was generally superior to FBP in terms of visual analysis. Though FBP had poor image quality, it had better image contrast than OSEM. The ROC curve plotted for the identification of lung cancer in coronal sections showed better results than in transverse sections by FBP and OSEM, except for the OSEM result of observer 2. ROC analysis showed that OSEM performed better than conventional FBP in terms of its discriminative ability of lung cancer with FDG-PET, although there was no significant difference in the area under the ROC curve (p-value > 0.05). The results suggest that the simultaneous use of FBP and OSEM images is helpful for the FDG-PET diagnosis of lung cancer.

In multi-dimensions, we obtain the quantization grid using genetic algorithms. Smoothing is an important aspect as it affects the generalization ability of the quantizer We propose a fast k neighborhood smoothing algorithm. Optimal quantization is much more efficient than other non-parametric methods. For not very well separated Gaussian mixture models, it produces much better results than the EM algorithm, which fails to converge to the true parameters of the underlying density.

The observed images and prior shape knowledge are combined to make the most consistent inference about unknown surface models using the maximum a posteriori rule. Typical model-based computer vision techniques divide the overall problem into two separate low- and high-level subproblems. Unlike previous approaches, our approach unifies these two levels through a pixel class prediction mechanism. A putative surface model is generated from a catalog of 86 representative surface models. For each observed pixel, its appearance probability profile from different classes is first computed. Then the class predication probability profile is also computed, based only on the putative surface model. An optimal surface model has the best overall match between these two profiles for all the pixels. The probability models are obtained off-line by the expectation maximization algorithm from 20 training studies. Quantitative experimental results on 25 test studies show the advantage of the integrated approach.

The distinguished part of this work is that it is based on unlabeled data, i.e., the training features include both useful foreground parts and background clutter and the correspondence between the parts and detected features are unknown. We use decomposable triangulated graphs to depict the probabilistic independence of parts, but the unsupervised technique is not limited to this type of graph. In the new approach, labeling of the data (part assignments) is taken as hidden variables and the EM algorithm is applied. A greedy algorithm is developed to select parts and to search for the optimal structure based on the differential entropy of these variables. The success of our algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to generate models of human motion automatically from unlabeled real image sequences.

IEEE Signal Processing Sco, Engn Med & Biol Soc			EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; TRANSMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; EM ALGORITHM; LIKELIHOOD	The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for maximum-likelihood image recovery converges very slowly. Thus, the ordered subsets EM (OS-EM) algorithm has been widely used in image reconstruction for tomography due to an order-of-magnitude acceleration over the EM algorithm. However, OS-EM is not guaranteed to converge. The recently proposed ordered subsets, separable paraboloidal surrogates (OS-SPS) algorithm with relaxation has been shown to converge to the optimal point while providing fast convergence. In this paper, we develop a relaxed OS-SPS algorithm for image restoration. Because data acquisition is different in image restoration than in tomography, we adapt a different strategy for choosing subsets in image restoration which uses pixel location rather than projection angles. Simulation results show that the order-of-magnitude acceleration of the relaxed OS-SPS algorithm can be achieved in restoration. Thus the speed and the guarantee of the convergence of the OS algorithm is advantageous for image restoration as well.

In this scheme, the joint probability density function (pdf) of the spectrum parameters of successive speech frames is modelled using a Gaussian mixture model whose parameters are estimated using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The conditional density of the spectrum parameters of the current speech frame based on the quantized values of the spectrum parameters of previous speech frames is used to generate a new codebook for every current speech frame. An efficient quantization scheme using transform coding and bit allocation techniques which allows easy and computationally efficient mapping from observation to quantized value is developed. Transparent quality speech for the first order fixed rate recursive coding case is achieved at 20 bits per frame.

As in past work [1], the probability density function (pdf) of the source is modeled as a Gaussian mixture model whose parameters are estimated using the EM algorithm. The novelty of the approach lies in the development of a more efficient mapping from the density to the codebook vectors. The individual Gaussian component densities are quantized using an optimal multidimensional compressor function followed by a Lattice Vector Quantizer (LVQ). For the purpose of speech spectrum quantization, the E-8 lattice is used for lattice quantization. Low complexity encoding and index assignment algorithms are presented and the performance is compared and shown to be better than that of PDF optimized parametric VQ [1].

The paper investigates the possibility of the multiple-thread search with the DAEM algorithm for a Gaussian mixture. The experiments showed the minimal beam size to guarantee the global optimality is not so large for a Gaussian mixture, and the solution quality of the beam DAEM algorithm always exceeds the EM and DAEM algorithms.

In this paper, we present a novel methodology for inferring queuing delay distributions across internal links in the network based solely on unicast, end-to-end measurements. A key feature of our new approach is that it is nonparametric, meaning that no a priori limit is placed on the number of unknown parameters used to model the delay distributions. The nonparametric approach is required in order to accurately estimate the wide variety of internal delay distributions. The methodology is formulated according to a recently proposed nonparametric, wavelet-based density estimation method in combination with an expectation-maximization optimization algorithm that employs a novel fast Fourier transform implementation. We perform network level ns simulations to verify the accuracy of the estimation procedure.

The vector channel prediction is based on first-order auto-regressive model and expectation-maximization algorithm. The signal-to-interference ratio and signal-to-noise ratio are estimated from vector channel model's parameters, and we adapt the weight of each interference cancellation path via fuzzy inference mechanism. The proposed fuzzy PIC and vector channel prediction cooperate in a way that fuzzy PIC' some input parameters come from channel predictor and fuzzy PIC makes the channel predictor be more accurate at the next stage. Computing weights via fuzzy adaptive method adds insignificant complexity because it involves only table lookup. The overall complexity is still linear in the number of users. The simulation results show that the proposed fuzzy PIC/vector channel prediction scheme performs better than previous improved PIC schemes in Rayleigh fading channels.

In this paper, we show how to integrate ME models efficiently within a maximum likelihood training scheme of statistical machine translation models. Specifically, we define a set of context-dependent ME lexicon models and we present how to perform an efficient training of these ME models within the conventional expectation-maximization (EM) training of statistical translation models. Experimental results are also given in order to demonstrate how these ME models improve the results obtained with the traditional translation models. The results are presented by means of alignment quality comparing the resulting alignments with manually annotated reference alignments.

Given this equivalence, we exploit results from set theoretic estimation and develop subgradient projections algorithms to maximize the log likelihood function.

Inherent estimation accuracy limitations are examined via a simple, closed-form approximation to the associated Cramer-Rao Bound which eliminates the need for numerical integration.

To identify and track dispersive time-varying fading channels and to avoid the phase ambiguity that come with the second-order statistic approaches, a sliding-window scheme using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed. The complexity of joint channel equalization and symbol detection for all users increases exponentially with system loading and the channel memory. The situation is exacerbated if strong inter-symbol interference (ISI) exists. To reduce the complexity and the number of samples required for channel estimation, a blind multiuser detector is developed. Together with multi-stage interference cancellation using soft outputs provided by this detector, our algorithm can track fading channels with no phase ambiguity even when channel gains attenuate close to zero.

In this paper we investigate a Space-Alternating Generalized Expectation-Maximization (SAGE) algorithm to iteratively estimate the channel impulse responses associated with multiple transmitters and the receiver. The performance of the estimator is compared with a previously proposed Expectation-Maximization (EM) based algorithm in terms of convergence rate.

In this paper, several major dependence structure mining tasks are overviewed from statistical learning perspective, with a number of major results on unsupervised learning models that range from a single-object world to a multi-object world. Moreover, efforts towards a key challenge to learning have been discussed in three typical streams, based on generalization error bounds, Ockham principle, and BYY harmony learning, respectively.

Usually two type of tests are used, the Peason-type test and log-likelihood ratio test. Both test statistics are asymptotically follows a x(2..) distribution. However, one may often observe that the values of these statistics are quite different. This is especially true when the observed counts are relatively small. This fact suggests us that the x(2) approximation is not accurate. In this paper we propose a quasi-exact test for the model using MCMC technique.

IEEE Signal Processing Sco, Engn Med & Biol Soc			BRAIN	In this paper, a high resolution segmentation method for MR images of mouse heart chambers is developed, in which the E-M algorithm is adopted and extended to the spatio-temporal cardiac cycle, and a partial pixel effect (PPE) is accommodated so that the heart chambers boundary is detected to sub-pixel accuracy. The method has been tested on high and low spatial resolution images. Quantitative measurements of the left ventricle (LV) area-time curve over cardiac cycle are reported, which show that the accuracy of the LV area can be improved based on the new method, on low spatial resolution images. The average relative error of the area estimate of the new method applied to low resolution images relative to measurements on high resolution images is less than 8%.

The system contains specially designed hidden Markov models (HMMs) for detecting functional sites including protein-translation start sites, mRNA splicing junction donor and acceptor sites, etc. Our main hypothesis is that, given a vertebrate genomic DNA sequence S, it is always possible to construct a directed acyclic graph G such that the path for the actual coding region of S is in the set of all paths on G. Thus, the gene detection problem is reduced to that of analyzing the paths in the graph G. A dynamic programming algorithm is used to find the optimal path in G. The proposed system is trained using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm and its performance on vertebrate gene prediction is evaluated using the 10-way cross-validation method. Experimental results show the good performance of the proposed system and its complementarity to a widely used gene detection system.

Experimental evaluations based on 138 speakers of the YOHO corpus using probabilistic decision-based neural networks (PDBNNs), Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and elliptical basis function networks (EBFNs) as speaker models were conducted. The original PDBNN training algorithm was also modified to make PDBNNs appropriate for speaker verification. Results show that the equal error rate obtained by PDBNNs and GMMs is about half of that of EBFNs (1.19% vs. 2.73%), suggesting that GMM- and PDBNN-based speaker models outperform the EBFN one. This work also finds that the globally supervised learning of PDBNNs is able to find a set of decision thresholds that reduce the variation in FAR, whereas the ad hoc approach used by the EBFNs and GMMs is not able to do so. This property makes the performance of PDBNN-based systems more predictable.

In this feasibility study, the collimator hole size is the only design variable changed. Other collimator parameters are fixed to a low-energy-high-resolution (LEHR) design. The design is based on a task of imaging a small hot lesion with a uniform background. A Channelized Hotelling Trace (CHT) is used to quantify the lesion detectability in a reconstructed image for a particular collimator parameter. The unique feature of this development is that the image quality is not evaluated for planar projection data, but rather is evaluated for the reconstructed tomographic image with an OS-EM (ordered-subset expectation-maximization) reconstruction algorithm. Our results suggest that a collimator hole size that is larger than the LEHR collimator hole size is preferable for lesion detection. This implies that the parameter that gives the optimal lesion detectability on the planar projections may not give the optimal lesion detectability in the reconstructed image. In SPECT, the optimal collimator design should be reconstruction algorithm dependent.

The proposed modeling techniques consist of joint modeling of spectral feature distributions among neighboring pixels and partial modeling of spectral correlations across TM sensor bands with a set of semi-tied covariance matrices in Gaussian mixture densities (GMD). The GMD parameters and semi-tied transformation matrices are first estimated by an iterative maximum likelihood estimation algorithm of Expectation-Maximization, and the parameters are next tuned by a minimum classification error training algorithm to enhance the discriminative power of the statistical classifiers. Compared with a previously proposed single-pixel based Gaussian mixture density classifier, the proposed techniques significantly improved the overall classification accuracy on eight land cover classes from imagery data of Missouri state.

The algorithm has some features in common with both the expectation-maximization algorithm and the K-means clustering algorithm. The algorithm also provides symbol reliability information and block reliability information that can be used for iterative soft-decision decoding, errors-and-erasures decoding, adaptive modulation algorithms, and retransmission algorithms. The reliability information has the additional benefit that it can be determined even if amplitude scaling (due to an AGC device) is unknown. A reduced complexity algorithm has also been investigated. Numerical results are presented for a variety of modulation formats with Reed-Solomon coding and errors-and-erasures decoding in a fading channel. Compared with other techniques, results show that these algorithms, as a function of performance and complexity, perform extremely well.

Reseachers usually evaluate the value of the construct for each person by a factor score or in terms of mean scores on a questionnaire that is thought to measure the construct. Although it is often the case that not only each person's mean score but also the intra-person variability will have important information, no method has been developed for utilizing within-subject variance. In the present research, by introducing random effects for each person into a weakly congeneric measurement model in classical test theory, we developed a model in which not only the mean but also the within-subject variance are regressors for other variables or scales. The proposed method is also applicable to repeated measurement. A simulation study demonstrated the validity of the estimation method of the proposed model. We also showed that within-subject variance on emotionality (in the Five-Factor Model) can be one of the regressors of STAI.

With no repeated measurements and known measurement error, models for variation decomposition have been proposed when there are one or more types of measurements. Estimation was performed using the EM algorithm accompanied by model augmentation that demands more computational efforts. In this article we extend previous variation models and modify the estimation methods in order to estimate various variation components after eliminating the unknown effects of measurement error. Specifically, methods that dispense with model augmentation and estimation of time-dependent covariates are considered. A set of lower leg length data from Chinese infants is analysed by using the proposed model. Interestingly, our results are consistent with the well-accepted three-phase (infancy-childhood-puberty) growth transition proposition for human growth. Moreover, gender effect is found to be time-varying. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

If no reliable information about the variance of the key response is available at the beginning of a clinical trial, the use of data from the first 'few' patients entered in the trial ('internal pilot') may be appropriate to estimate the variance and thus to recalculate the required sample size. A SAS macro that implements the EM algorithm for carrying out and simulating such interim power evaluations without unblinding the treatment status is presented.

The assumptions are that the observations are multivariate normally distributed and that the missing values are missing at random. The two models are tested applying the log-likelihood ratio test; for deriving the maximum likelihood estimates and evaluating the corresponding log-likelihood functions the EM algorithm is used. The problem of different and non-monotone patterns of missing data is solved introducing suitable transformations and partitions of the data matrix. The algorithm is proposed for general constraints on the mean vector; the topic of exchangeability of random vectors is also presented.

The both schemes rely either on directional information or the spatial diversity of the mobile radio channel. It is shown via simulations that for a large number of waves impinging at the receiver the latter scheme being less complex is more robust in channels whose model order is generally unknown.

J	Ane, T; Labidi, C				Ane, T; Labidi, C			Revisiting the finite mixture of Gaussian distributions with application to futures markets	JOURNAL OF FUTURES MARKETS			English	Article							STOCK INDEX FUTURES; EM ALGORITHM; MODELS	We present a new estimation method for Gaussian mixture modeling, namely, the kurtosis-controlled expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, which overcomes the limitations of the usual estimation techniques via kurtosis control and kernel splitting. Our simulation study shows that the dynamic allocation of kernels according to the value of the total kurtosis measure makes the proposed kurtosis-con trolled ERI algorithm an efficient method for Gaussian mixture density estimation. This algorithm yielded considerable improvements over the classical ERI algorithm. We then used the discrete Gaussian mixture framework to account for the observed thick-tailed distributions of futures returns and applied the kurtosis-controlled EM algorithm to estimate the distributions of real (agricultural, metal, and energy) and financial (stock index and currency) futures returns. Mie proved that this framework is perfectly adapted to capturing the departures from normality of the observed return distributions. Unlikein previous studies, we found that a two-component Gaussian mixture is too poor a model to accurately capture the distributional properties of returns. Similar results have been obtained for stocks, indexes, currencies, interest rates, and commodities. This has important implications in many financial studies using Gaussian mixtures to incorporate the thickness of the tails of the distributions in the computation of the value at risk or to infer implied risk-neutral densities from option prices, to name but a few.

In addition, we investigate the use of a formula derived by Guenther to estimate the preplanned sample size. This simple modification could improve somewhat the existing methods for the same problem. There is no effect of the EM algorithm on the type I error rate of the existing procedures, and the effect on the type II error rate is negligible as long as the number of patients in the internal pilot is not too small. Thus, to recalculate the sample size it is not necessary to unveil the treatment status in an internal pilot with a moderate number of patients.

The introduced modification consists of using different time interval lengths wizen calculating the time correlations for optimizing the different channel parameters. This modification was proposed for the purpose of a further reduction in the algorithm's computational weight in case of receiving sufficiently resolvable waves. Specifically, we found that short interval windows are sufficient for estimating delays and azimuth angles, which is quite effective in reducing the computational burden in their optimization processes. As for the estimation of the attenuation parameters, a longer time window, equal to the preamble length, is considered for more accurate estimation. Also two other estimators are proposed. The first one combining the modified SAGE with a sequential estimation of the attenuation parameters, suitable for slowly varying channels. Another one, similar to the first, and primarily designed to alleviate the influence of present strong interferers. Through a numerical example, the performances of the three presented estimation schemes, in terms of their near-far resistance, are compared. And it is shown that the proposed second combined estimator outperforms the modified SAGE in environments with high MAI levels.

The EM algorithm takes advantage of the finite alphabet property of the transmitted signal. It also provides MMSE estimates of the transmitted data that can be used by the receiver for decoding purposes. The algorithm has been applied to a multicarrier system and results show that the application of EM in the high SNR case provides significant improvement over traditional channel estimation techniques.

The iterative procedure can be viewed as an iterative method of moments procedure for estimating the variance components and an iterative reweighted least squares estimates for estimating the fixed effects. Therefore, it is valid without the normality assumptions on the random components. A computationally simple method of moments estimates of the model parameters area used as the starting values for our iterative procedure. A simulation study was conducted to compare the performances of the proposed procedure with the procedure proposed by LINDSTROM and BATES (1990) for some normal models and nonnormal models.

Since labeled corpora are difficult to collect for this task, we propose a semi-supervised method, which makes use of a small set of labeled sentences together with a large set of unlabeled documents, for improving the performances of summary systems. We show that this method is an instance of the Classification EM algorithm in the case of gaussian densities, and that it can also be used in a non-parametric setting. We finally provide an empirical evaluation on the Reuters news-wire corpus.

The whole image volume is simultaneously calculated from the full set of projection values during the iteration steps of fully 3D image reconstruction. In, this article we report on the development and implementation of an improved ML-EM algorithm, which implicitly corrects attenuation and scatter and minimizes reconstruction noise. To demonstrate the clinical usefulness results of the algorithm were compared to reconstructions with filtered back-projection. The improved image reconstruction algorithm has been parallelized for efficient execution on SMP clusters by adopting a hybrid parallelization strategy based on a combination of the MPI and OpenMP application. programming interfaces. In order to employ the parallel image reconstruction software over the Internet, a Java-based framework is being developed allowing transparent access to remote high-performance computing platforms from clinical environments.

In the last years many algorithms have been developed for reconstructing tomography images. The maximum likelihood expectation maximization algorithm (ML-EM) (Vardi & Shepp 1982) is a very stable nonlinear method and was developed by Shepp and Vardi in 1982. For the first time, one was able to model the reconstruction process by taking into account stochastic properties of the underlying physical model. However, the ML-EM algorithm causes some serious problems in the context of the application considered. It is an iterative procedure and seems to converge rapidly to a stationary point, however, the reconstructed image is distorted by superimposed high frequency noise. This poor performance motivated different modifications of the algorithm. These can be divided into two classes. 1. Stopping the algorithm at a step where the reconstructed image seems to have an acceptable quality (Llacer & Veklerov 1989). Obviously; it is a problem to determine a reasonable stop criteria and to explain the gap between this subjective best reconstruction and the optimal one in the maximum likelihood sense. 2. Modification of the nonlinear algorithm by using a priori information in order to improve the algorithm with Bayesian methods (Levitan & Herman 1987). In this chapter the second method is used, based on an analysis of the ML-EM method.

A database of observations is clustered by identifying Ic sub-populations and summarizing each sub- population with a model or probability density function. The EM algorithm is an approach that iteratively estimates the memberships of the observations in each cluster and the parameters of the k density functions for each cluster. Typical EM implementations require a full database scan at each iteration and the number of iterations required to converge is arbitrary. For large databases, these scans become prohibitively expensive. We present a scalable implementation of the EM algorithm based upon identifying regions of the data that are compressible and regions that must be maintained in memory. The approach operates within the confines of a limited main memory buffer. Data resolution is preserved to the extent possible based upon the size of the memory buffer and the fit of the current clustering model to the data. We extend the framework to update multiple cluster models simultaneously. Computational tests indicate that this scalable scheme outperforms sampling-based and incremental approaches - the straightforward alternatives to "scaling" existing traditional in-memory implementations to large databases.

The proposed approach, unlike classical ones, is based on the formulation of the unsupervised change-detection problem in terms of the Bayesian decision theory. In this context, we propose an iterative non-parametric technique for the unsupervised estimation of the statistical terms associated with the gray levels of changed and unchanged pixels in the difference image generated by the comparison of the two images. Such a technique exploits the effectiveness of two theoretically well-founded estimation procedures: the reduced parzen estimate (RPE) procedure and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Then, on the basis of the resulting non-parametric estimates, a markov random field (MRF) approach is used for modeling the spatial-contextual information contained in the multitemporal images considered. The non-parametric nature of the proposed method allows its application to different kind of remote-sensing images (e.g., SAR and optical images). Experimental results, obtained on a set of multitemporal remote-sensing images, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique.
