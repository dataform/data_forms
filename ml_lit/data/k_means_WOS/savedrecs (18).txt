Here, it is an important issue to evaluate how much the extracted topics, which are set of documents, are interpretable for human. As the objective is vector representable topic extractions, e.g., Latent Semantic Analysis, we tried to formulate the interpretable likelihood of the extracted topic using the manually derived topics. We evaluated this likelihood of topics on English news articles using LSA, PCA and Spherical k-means for topic extraction. The results show that this likelihood can be applied as a filter to select meaningful topics.

Namely, it can be used to discover interesting groupings of semantically annotated resources in a wide range of concept languages. The method exploits a novel dissimilarity measure that is based on the resource semantics w.r.t. a number of dimensions corresponding to a committee of features, represented by a group of concept descriptions (discriminating features). The algorithm is an adaptation of the classic BISECTING K-MEANS to complex representations typical of the ontology in the Semantic Web. We discuss its complexity and the potential applications to a variety of important tasks.

Almost, all of the WordNets are manually built and unfortunately these WordNets are not verified and are being used in many knowledge-based applications. In this paper we aimed at the clustering based verification of a manually built lexical taxonomy WordNet, namely the Korean WordNet, U-WIN. For this purpose two kinds of clustering methods are used: K-Means approach and ICA based approach. As a result the ICA based approach gives better result, and it shows very effective characteristic for extracting features.

Clustering stability is a common heuristics used to determine the number of clusters in a wide variety of clustering applications. We continue the theoretical analysis of clustering stability by establishing a complete characterization of clustering stability in terms of the number of optimal 14 solutions to the clustering optimization problem. Our results complement earlier work of Ben-David, von Luxburg and Pal, by settling the main problem left open there. Our analysis shows that, for probability distributions with finite support, the stability of k-means clusterings depends solely on the number of optimal solutions to the underlying optimization problem for the data distribution. These results challenge the common belief and practice that view stability as an indicator of the validity, or meaningfulness, of the choice of a clustering algorithm and number of clusters.

Evaluating the quality of results and determining the number of clusters in data is an important issue. Most current validity indices only cover a subset of important aspects of clusters. Moreover, these indices are relevant only for data sets containing at least two clusters. In this paper, a new bounded index for cluster validity, called the score function (SF), is introduced. The score function is based on standard cluster properties. Several artificial and real-life data sets are used to evaluate the performance of the score function. The score function is tested against four existing validity indices. The index proposed in this paper is found to be always as good or better than these indices in the case of hyperspheroidal clusters. It is shown to work well on multidimensional data sets and is able to accommodate unique and sub-cluster cases.

Its formulation is based on the definition of MDL derived for Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).

The domain knowledge takes the form of constraints that must hold on the set of clusters. We consider instance level constraints, such as must-link and cannot-link. This type of constraints has been successfully used in popular clustering algorithms, such as k-means and hierarchical agglomerative clustering. This paper shows how clustering trees can support instance level constraints. Clustering trees are decision trees that partition the instances into homogeneous clusters. Clustering trees provide a symbolic description for each cluster. To handle non-trivial constraint sets, we extend clustering trees to support disjunctive descriptions. The paper's main contribution is ClusILC, an efficient algorithm for building such trees. We present experiments comparing ClusILC to COP-k-means.

Recently, the CVQE algorithm was proposed in this context. It modifies the objective function of traditional K-means to include penalties for violated constraints. CVQE was shown to efficiently produce high-quality clustering of UCI data. In this work, we examine the properties of CVQE and propose a modification that results in a more intuitive objective function, with lower computational complexity. We present our extensive experimentation, which provides insight into CVQE and shows that our new variant can dramatically improve clustering quality while reducing run time. We show its superiority in a large-scale surveillance scenario with noisy constraints.	IBM Haifa Labs, Haifa, Israel	Pelleg, D (reprint author), IBM Haifa Labs, Haifa, Israel.

A Naive-Bayes classifier for damage detection in engineering materials	MATERIALS & DESIGN			English	Article								This paper is intended to introduce the Bayesian network in general and the Naive-Bayes classifier in particular as one of the most successful classification systems to simulate damage detection in engineering materials. A method for feature subset selection has also been introduced too. The method is based on mean and maximum values of the amplitudes of waves after dividing them into folds then grouping them by a clustering algorithm (e.g. k-means algorithm). The Naive-Bayes classifier and the feature sub-set selection method were analyzed and tested on two sets of data. The data sets were conducted based on artificial damages created in quasi isotopic laminated composites of the AS4/3501-6 graphite/epoxy system and ball bearing of the type 6204 with a steel cage. The Naive-Bayes classifier and the proposed feature subset selection algorithm have been shown as efficient techniques for damage detection in engineering materials. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Empirical results show that a multi-resolution approach can improve the training stage of several unsupervised pattern classification algorithms including K-means clustering, LBG vector quantization, and competitive neural networks [8, 13, 10]. While, previous research concentrated on convergence rate of on-line unsupervised training [21, 6]. New results, reported in this paper, show that the multi-resolution approach can be used to improve training quality (measured as a derivative of the rate distortion function) on the account of convergence speed. The probability of achieving a desired point in the quality / convergence-rate space of Kohonen Competitive Neural Networks (KCNN) is evaluated using a detailed Monte Carlo set of experiments. It is shown that multi-resolution can reduce the distortion by a factor of 1.5 to 6 while maintaining the convergence rate of traditional KCNN. Alternatively, the convergence rate can be improved without loss of quality. The experiments include a controlled set of synthetic data, as well as, image data. Experimental results are reported and evaluated.

It is generally implemented along with the minimum square error (MSE) minimization criteria. It has been shown empirically that the algorithm provides '' good '' MSE results. Nevertheless, K-means has several deficiencies; first, it is sensitive to the seeding method and may only converge to a local optimum [ 18]. Second, the algorithms is known to be NP complete [ 10], hence, validating the quality of results may be intractable. Finally, the convergence rate of the algorithm is dependent on the seeding. Generally, low convergence rate is observed. This paper presents a multi-resolution K-means clustering method which applies the K-means algorithm to a sequence of monotonically increasing-resolution samples of the given data. The cluster-centers obtained from a low resolution stage are used as initial cluster-centers for the next stage which is a higher resolution stage. The idea behind this method is that a good estimation of the initial location of centers can be obtained through K-means clustering of a sample of the input data. This can reduce the convergence time of K-means. Alternatively the algorithm can be used to obtain better MSE in about the same time as the traditional K-means. The validity of pyramid K-means algorithm is tested using Monte Carlo simulations applied to synthetic data and to multi-spectral images and compared to traditional K-means. It is found that in the average case pyramid K-means improves the MSE by a factor of four to six. This may require only 1.35 more iterations than the traditional K-means. Alternatively, it can reduce the computation time by a factor of three to four with a slight improvement in the quality of clustering.

Often, homologies between points that represent the surfaces are assumed which might lead to imprecise mean shape and variability results. We propose an approach where exact correspondences are replaced by evolving correspondence probabilities. These are the basis for a novel algorithm that computes a generative statistical shape model. We developed an unified MAP framework to compute the model parameters ('mean shape' and 'modes of variation') and the nuisance parameters which leads to an optimal adaption of the model to the set of observations. The registration of the model on the instances is solved using the Expectation Maximization - Iterative Closest Point algorithm which is based on probabilistic correspondences and proved to be robust and fast. The alternated optimization of the MAP explanation with respect to the observation and the generative model parameters leads to very efficient and closed-form solutions for (almost) all parameters. Experimental results on brain structure data sets demonstrate the efficiency and well-posedness of the approach. The algorithm is then extended to an automatic classification method using the k-means clustering and applied to synthetic data as well as brain structure classification problems.

The fibrosis and nodules formation causes distortion of the normal liver architecture, resulting in characteristic texture patterns. Texture patterns are commonly analyzed with the use of co-occurrence matrix based features measured on regionsof-interest (ROls). A classifier is subsequently used for the classification of cirrhotic or non-cirrhotic livers. Problem arises if the classifier employed falls into the category of supervised classifier which is a popular choice. This is because the 'true disease states' of the ROls are required for the training of the classifier but is, generally, not available. A common approach is to adopt the 'true disease state' of the liver as the 'true disease state' of all ROls in that liver. This paper investigates the use of a nonsupervised classifier, the k-means clustering method in classifying livers as cirrhotic or non-cirrhotic using unlabelled ROI data. A preliminary result with a sensitivity and specificity of 72% and 60%, respectively, demonstrates the feasibility of using the k-means non-supervised clustering method in generating a characteristic cluster structure that could facilitate the classification of cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic livers.

One prerequisite of our ICA approach is that the number of fiber directions per voxel be known. In this paper, we present a method to extract voxels with zero to three fiber directions and classify them accordingly using diffusion MRI data. The approach relies on the SPM segmented white matter images as well as diffusion anisotropic values per voxel. K-means segmentation and constrained non-linear optimization techniques are used to classify voxels into one to three fiber directions. The diffusion model for optimization is based on the hierarchy of diffusion characteristics. The method is tested with a healthy human subject. It is observed that the fiber maps are consistent with the underlying brain anatomy.

A methodology using Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM) and Markov Models (MM) were used to analyze database acquired the E-Pelvis (physical simulator) during a pelvic exam. The focus is on the method of selection of HMM parameters. K-Means is used to choose the alphabet size. Successful classification rates of 62% are observed with the HMM as opposed to 92% with the MM. Moreover, the MM provide an insight into the nature of the process while identifying typical sequences that are unique to each level of expertise, where the HM, given their nature as a black box model, do not.

Clustering is performed as a two-stage process, in which the first stage model is Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM). In semi-supervised settings, class information can be added to refine the clustering process. A class information-enriched variant of GTM, class-GTM, is used here for a first cluster description of the data. The number of clusters used by GTM is usually large for visualization purposes and does not necessarily correspond to the overall class structure. Consequently, in a second stage, clusters are agglomerated using the K-means algorithm with different initialization strategies, some of them defined ad hoc for the GTM models.

In general, there are four main steps in the process of airport recognition: pre-processing of remote sensing images, features extraction, rough location and the recognition of airport. This paper puts forward an automatic airport recognition method which adopts improved methods in each step. In pre-processing, an edge-preserve image smoothing algorithm based on Convexity Model is developed. In features extraction, the Canny operator and chain codes are used. An improved K-Means lines segmentation and estimate rules are used to find candidate areas in rough location of the airport. And those candidate regions are binarized and prior knowledge is used in airport recognition. Experimental data and application results show that the above methods are efficient and enhance the accuracy in airport recognition.

Firstly the continuity among adjacent frames is used to create a motion template according to the Displaced Frame Difference's (DFD) higher character([1]). And then the color template is established by using the k-means clustering. Based upon the information derived from the previous two templates, the segmentation image is defined as foreground, background and boundary regions. Then, the segmentation problem is formulated as an energy minimization problem. The hard edge of foreground is then obtained by implementing graph-cut algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithm.

This algorithm uses the evolutionary programming (EP) to search the optimal clustering and bases on the principles of the K-means algorithm. The proposed self-adaptive evolutionary (SAEP) clustering algorithm self-adapts the vector of the step size appropriate for each parent. This is different from other genetic-based algorithms. The algorithm can minimize the degeneracy in the evolutionary process. The experimental results show that the KSAE clustering algorithm is efficient in the unsupervised classification of the multispectral remote sensing image.

This method, however, only considers distances between the objects' shape distribution histograms and ignores the information included. Actually the information of the shape distribution histograms, such as the mean value, the standard deviation, the kurtosis and the skewness, can be used to map the 3D model. As a result, the retrieval precision of Shape Distribution is low. To enhance the retrieve efficiency, a novel method which employs the K-means clustering method is proposed in this paper. First, the models' shape distribution histograms are established by Shape Distribution method and are normalized as the proper format of K-means clustering method. Then, the objects' shape distribution histograms are served as inputs of K-means clustering method and are classified into certain groups by this algorithm. Last, all the models that belong to the classification of the query model are exported as the retrieval results. A case study is used to validate the proposed method. Experimental results show that the retrieval precision by using the proposed method is higher than that of the Shape Distribution method.

In this method, we follow the steps of Joint Boost, but substitute weak learns with basic clustering algorithm. We compute the sharing features between samples in order to reduce clustering times. The proposed clustering method, JBC constructs a new training set by random sampling from the original dataset, then selects the best feature and the best clusters for sharing, and calculates a distribution over the training samples using current shared feature and clusters, and finally a basic clustering algorithm (e.g. K-mean) is applied to partition the new training set. The final clustering solution is produced by aggregating the obtained partitions. The clustering results for SAR images show that the proposed method has a good performance.

A popular technique for clustering is based on K-means. However, it suffers from the four main disadvantages. Firstly, it is slow and scales poorly on the time. Secondly, it is often impractical to expect a user to specify the number of clusters. Thirdly, it may find worse local optima. Lastly, its performance heavily depends on the initial clustering centers. To overcome the above four disadvantages simultaneously, an effectively adaptive K-means clustering algorithm (AKM) is proposed in this paper. The AKM estimates the correct number of clusters and obtains the initial centers by the segmentation of the norm histogram in the linear normed space consisting of the data set, and then performs the local improvement heuristic algorithm for K-means clustering in order to avoid the local optima. Moreover, the kd-tree is used to store the data set for improving the speed. The AKM was tested on the synthetic data sets and the real images. The experimental results demonstrate the AKM outperforms the existing methods.

Instead of characterizing points along an object contour, our method employs HMMs to model the relationship among structural segments of the contour. Firstly, an object contour is partitioned into segments at points with zero curvature value. Secondly, each segment is represented with structural features. Finally, a HMMs is utilized to characterize the object contour by treating each segment as an observation of a hidden state. Promising experimental results obtained on two popular shape datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is efficient in classifying shapes, particularly unclosed shapes and similar shapes.

Our first evaluation is based on a limited exemplary test set of 10 different audio reference signals recorded as mono audio data by four microphones in 10 different rooms with 44.1 kHz sampling rate and 16 bit quantisation. Note that, of course, a generalisation of the results cannot be achieved. Motivated by the syntactical and semantical analysis of information and in particular by known audio steganalysis approaches, a first set of specific features are selected for classification to evaluate, whether this first feature set can support correct classifications. The idea was mainly driven by the existing steganalysis features and the question of applicability within a first and limited test set. In the tests presented in this paper, all inter-device analysis with different device characteristics is perforated while intra-device evaluations (identical microphone models of the same manufacturer) are not considered. For classification the data mining tool WEKA with K-means as a clustering and Naive Bayes as a classification technique are applied with the goal to evaluate their classification in regard to the classification accuracy on known audio steganalysis features. Our results show, that for our test set, the used classification techniques and selected steganalysis features, microphones call be better classified than environments. These first tests show promising results but of course are based on a limited test and training set as well a specific test set generation. Therefore additional and enhanced features with different test set generation strategies are necessary to generalise the findings.

This includes videos, images, and audios, where we now have higher expectations in exploiting these data at hands. Typical manipulations are in some forms of video/image/audio processing, including automatic speech recognition, which require fairly large amount of storage and are computationally intensive. In our recent work, we have demonstrated the utility of time series representation in the task of clustering multimedia data using k-medoids method, which allows considerable amount of reduction in computational effort and storage space. However, k-means is a much more generic clustering method when Euclidean distance is used. In this work, we will demonstrate that unfortunately, k-means clustering will sometimes fail to give correct results, an unaware fact that may be overlooked by many researchers. This is especially the case when Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is used as the distance measure in averaging the shape of time series. We also will demonstrate that the current averaging algorithm may not produce the real average of the time series, thus generates incorrect k-means clustering results, and then show potential causes why DTW averaging methods may not achieve meaningful clustering results. Lastly, we conclude with a suggestion of a method to potentially find the shape-based time series average that satisfies the required properties.

Based on a well-suited Markovian model, we have developed a clustering algorithm called K-Models and inspired by the K-Means technique to cluster and analyze behaviors. These models are constructed using the different actions proposed to the user while he is viewing a video sequence (play, pause, forward, rewind, jump, stop). We have applied our algorithm with a movie trailer mining tool. This tool allows users to perform searches on basic attributes (cast, director, onscreen date . . .) and to watch selected trailers. With an appropriate server, we log every action to analyze behaviors. First results obtained from a set of beta users answering to a set of defined questions reveals interesting typical behaviors.

In this paper we propose a system to extract object-based and global features from compressed MPEG video using the motion vector information for video retrieval. The reliability of the motion information is enhanced by a motion accumulation process. The global features like motion activity and camera motion parameters are extracted from the above enhanced motion information. The object features such as speed, area and trajectory are then obtained after the proposed object segmentation. The number of objects in a given video shot is determined by the proposed K-means clustering procedure. The object segmentation is done by applying EM algorithm.

Various heuristics for constructing such ensembles have been examined in the literature, e.g., random feature selection, weak clusterers, random projections, etc. Typically, one heuristic is picked at a time to construct the ensemble. To increase diversity of the ensemble, several heuristics may be applied together. However, not any combination may be beneficial. Here we apply a standard genetic algorithm (GA) to select from 7 standard heuristics for k-means cluster ensembles. The ensemble size is also encoded in the chromosome. In this way the data is forced to guide the selection of heuristics as well as the ensemble size. Eighteen moderate-size datasets were used: 4 artificial and 14 real. The results resonate with our previous findings in that high diversity is not necessarily a prerequisite for high accuracy of the ensemble. No particular combination of heuristics appeared to be consistently chosen across all datasets, which justifies the existing variety of cluster ensembles. Among the most often selected heuristics were random feature extraction, random feature selection and random number of clusters assigned for each ensemble member. Based on the experiments, we recommend that the current practice of using one or two heuristics for building k-means cluster ensembles should be revised in favour of using 3-5 heuristics.(1)	Bulgarian Acad Sci, CLBME, BU-1113 Sofia, Bulgaria	Hadjitodorov, ST (reprint author), Bulgarian Acad Sci, CLBME, BU-1113 Sofia, Bulgaria.

Current limitations in sequencing limit the number of base pairs that can be processed to only several hundred at a time. Consequently, these sequenced substrings need to be assembled into the overall genome. However, the existence of insertions, deletions and substitutions can complicate the assembly of subsequences and confuse existing methods. What has been needed is an approach that deals with ambiguity in trying to match and assemble a genome from its sequenced subsequences. This research develops fuzzy similarity measures between subsequences that are then incorporated into an assembler based on fuzzy logic and fuzzy similarity measures. The research addresses the problem of extensive computation required by clustering data into meaningful groups. Preliminary evaluation of this approach in conjunction with K-Means clustering suggests that this approach is at least as good as standard approaches and in some cases better.

Towards a systematic climatology of sensitivities of Mediterranean high impact weather: a contribution based on intense cyclones	NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							ADJOINT; MODEL	One of the multiple approaches currently explored to mitigate the effects of hydro-meteorological hazardous events aims at improving the numerical weather forecasts. Under an ever increasing societal demand for cost cuts and more precise forecasts, targeted observations are currently receiving great attention within the operational weather community. The MEDEX project ( http://medex.inm.uib.es) is aimed at improving the forecasts of high impact weather (HIW) in the Mediterranean and, in particular, proposes the creation of a climatology of sensitivities of such episodes. The construction of a comprehensive climatology of sensitivities is hampered by the lack of an exhaustive collection of Mediterranean HIW events. In this study we contribute with a systematic climatology of Mediterranean intense cyclones. We perform an objective cluster analysis of intense cyclones detected from the ECMWF ERA40 reanalysis using a k-means algorithm and compute the sensitivities for each of the resulting classes. For each cluster, a representative sensitivity field is computed using the MM5 Adjoint Modeling system. The results show that although the sensitive areas for intense Mediterranean cyclones are not particularly confined, it is remarkable how areas poorly sampled by the regular observing networks, such as North Africa, the Mediterranean Sea and the eastern North-Atlantic, are highlighted in the prototype sensitivity maps.

However, little work has been done to investigate attributes of clustering process, and previous studies just focused on characteristics of text itself. As a dynamic and sequential process, we aim to describe text clustering as state transitions for words or documents. Taking K-means clustering method as example, we try to parse the clustering process into several sequences. Based on research of sequential and temporal data clustering, we propose a new text clustering method using HMM(Hidden Markov Model).

These relations derive from the entries and the words in their definitions in a dictionary, which are quantified under the assumption that the entries and their definitions are equivalent in meaning. This kind of relations is regarded as "knowledge" for text clustering. Under the framework of k-means algorithm, the new interpolated similarity improves the performance of clustering system significantly in terms of optimizing hard and soft criterion functions. Our results show that introducing the conceptual knowledge from the un-structured dictionary into the similarity measure tends to provide potential contributions for text clustering in future.

Mercy			Multispectral image classification using modified k-Means algorithm	NEURAL NETWORK WORLD			English	Article						clustering; k-Means; local search		Clustering is used to organize data for efficient retrieval. A popular technique for clustering is based on k-Means such that the data is partitioned into k clusters. In k-Means clustering a set of n data points in d-dimensional space R-d, an integer k is given and the problem is to determine a set of k-points in R-d called centers, to minimize the mean squared distance from each point to its nearest center. In this method, the number of clusters is predefined and the technique is highly dependent on the initial identification of elements that represent the clusters well. A large area of research in clustering has focused on improving the clustering process such that the clusters are not dependent on the initial identification of cluster representation. In this paper, a modified technique, which grows the clusters without the need to specify the initial cluster representation, has been proposed. Initially a local search single swap heuristic can identify the number of clusters and its centers in the interpolated (bicubic) multispectral image. Then the regular k-Means clustering is implemented using the results of the previous process for the true image data set. The technique achieves an impressive speed up of the clustering process even when the number of clusters is not specified initially and the classification accuracy is improved within a fewer number of iterations.

Segmentation of thalamic nuclei using a modified k-means clustering algorithm and high-resolution quantitative magnetic resonance imaging at 1.5 T	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						thalamic nuclei; image segmentation; quantitative magnetic resonance imaging; T-1; T-2	HUMAN BRAIN; T-1; VISUALIZATION; REGISTRATION; IMAGES; ATLAS; STATE; TIME; MRI	Patient outcome in minimally invasive stereotactic neurosurgical procedures depends on the ability to accurately locate the desired functional region within the deep brain while avoiding the surrounding anatomy. Due to the lack of sufficient contrast within this region in pre-operatively acquired MR images, electrophysiological exploration and histological atlases are currently required to define the surgical target within the thalamus in the treatment of many motor-control disorders. In this paper we introduce a method for segmenting the individual thalamic nuclei based on high-resolution quantitative magnetic resonance images, providing improved target visualization. The method was tested using whole-brain T-1 and T-2 data acquired from four healthy individuals. Accuracy of the segmentation results was assessed by comparing the center-of-mass coordinates of the segmented nuclei, with coordinates obtained from a classic histological atlas registered to these images. Strong agreement was found, with an average Euclidean distance difference of less than 4.5 mm averaged across all nuclei and all individuals. Reproducibility of the method, determined by calculating the percent similarity of segmentation results derived from data acquired from repeated scan sessions, was greater than 85%. These results illustrate the ability to accurately and reliably segment the primary nuclei of the thalamus and suggest that the method may have utility in the study of individual nuclear regions in disease state as well as for planning deep-brain surgical procedures.

However, different runs of the same clustering technique on a specific dataset may result in different solutions. The cause of this difference is the choice of the initial cluster setting and the values of the parameters associated with the technique. A definition of good initial settings and optimal parameters values is not an easy task, particularly because both vary largely from one dataset to another. In this paper the authors investigate the use of Genetic Algorithms to determine the best initialization of clusters, as well as the optimization of the initial parameters. The experimental results show the great potential of the Genetic Algorithms for the improvement of the clusters, since they do not only optimize the clusters, but resolve the problem of the number K cluster, which had been giving it form a priori. The techniques of clustering are most used in the analysis of information or. Data Mining, this method was applied to Data Set at mining.	[Jimenez, J. F.; Carpio, J.

We improve the original algorithm mainly in three aspects. First, the number of clusters is automatically decided by merging and splitting of clusters. Second, a small portion of labeled samples are employed to supervise the clustering process in the merging and splitting stage. Also, we modify the algorithm to directly process the symbolic attribute values. Experimental result on the KDD 99 intrusion detection datasets shows that our algorithm has high detection rate while maintaining a low false positive rate.

The proposed method conducts irregular sampling on the data preserving the subjectively noteworthy features using a user specified gradient. It also conducts irregular quantization, preserving the intrinsically objective characteristics of the data using statistical distributions. It then extracts representative patterns from the discretized data using group average clustering. Experimental results using benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed method does not destroy the intrinsically objective features, since it has the same performance as the basic subsequence clustering using K-Means algorithm. Results using a dataset from a clinical hepatitis study indicate that it extracts interesting patterns for a medical expert.

A number of security approaches are proposed to address this problem, among which the intrusion detection system (IDS) appears to be one of the major and most effective solutions for defending against malicious users. Essentially, intrusion detection problem can be generalized as a classification problem, whose goal is to distinguish normal behaviors and anomalies. There are many well-known pattern recognition algorithms for classification purpose. In this paper we describe the details of applying pattern recognition methods to the intrusion detection research field. Experimenting on the KDDCUP 99 data set, we first use information gain metric to reduce the dimensionality of the original feature space. Two supervised methods, the support vector machine as well as the multi-layer neural network have been tested and the results display high detection rate and low false alarm rate, which is promising for real world applications. In addition, three unsupervised methods, Single-Linkage, K-Means, and CLIQUE, are also implemented and evaluated in the paper. The low computational complexity reveals their application in initial data reduction process.

In our framework, tracking and recognition share the same appearance manifold. During training, K-means is applied to partition the normalized training face images into pose subsets. Appearance manifold and dynamics are learned in this period. During testing, Appearance manifold is updated after tracking and recognition are conducted. The updated appearance manifold is used for future frames. Experimental results show that our proposed framework is effective for tracking and recognition.

Object detection in hyperspectral imagery by using K-means clustering algorithm with preprocessing - art. no. 65740M	Optical Pattern Recognition XVIII	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE)		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Optical Pattern Recognition XVIII	APR 09-10, 2007	Orlando, FL	SPIE		K-means algorithm; object detection; Hyperspectral data; clustering; Euclidean distance		K-means clustering method has been employed in different applications of data analysis. This paper develops a target detection system using the k-means algorithm including a preprocessing step based on the Euclidean distance. The pre-processing step reduces the computational complexity of the k-means algorithm in case of hyperspectral. imagery. After reducing the set of pixels in the background from the data by using the pre-processing step, k-means algorithm is employed to determine the clusters in rest of the image data cube. Having obtained the clustered data, the objects of interest can easily be detected using the known target signature. The proposed clustering algorithm is successfully applied to the real life hyperspectral data sets where the objects of interest can efficiently be detected. The proposed scheme effectively reduces the convergence time of the k-mean algorithm compared to that required by the traditional k-means algorithm.

A reliable, affordable and easy-to-use method to observe the distribution in the field is required and the infrared thermoimage analysis can be considered as a potential method based on non-contact imaging technologies. The basic idea is that the application of colder water (10 degrees C less) than the leaves surface makes it possible to distinguish and measure the targeted areas by means of a infrared thermoimage analysis based on significant and time persistent thermal differences. Trials were carried out on a hedge of Prunus laurocerasus, 2.1 in height with an homogenous canopy. A trailed orchard sprayer was employed with different spraying configurations. A FLIR (TM) (S40) thermocamera was used to acquire (@ 50 Hz) thermal videos, in a fixed position, at frame rate of 10 images/s, for nearly 3 min. Distribution quality was compared to the temperature differences obtained from the thermal images between pre-treatment and post-treatment (AT)., according two analysis: time-trend of AT average values for different hedge heights and imaging AT distribution and area coverage by segmentation in k means clustering after 30 s of spraying. The chosen spraying configuration presented a quite good distribution for the entire hedge height with the exclusion of the lower (0-1 m from the ground) and the upper part (> 1.9 in). Through the image segmentation performed of AT image by k-means clustering, it was possible to have a more detailed and visual appreciation of the distribution quality among the entire hedge. The thermoimage analysis revealed interesting potentiality to evaluate quality distribution from orchards sprayers.

Some researchers have proposed to use temporal changes intrinsic to the colposcopic image sequences to automatically characterize cervical lesion. Under this approach, every single pixel on the image is represented as a Time Series of length equal to the sampling frequency times acquisition points. Although this approach seems to show promising results, the data analysis procedures have to deal with huge data set that rapidly increase with the number of cases (patients) considered in the analysis. In the present work, we perform principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data in order to facilitate similarity measures for classification and clustering. The importance of this work is that we propose a model to parameterize the dynamics of the system using an efficient representation getting a 1.11% data compression ratio and similarity on clustering of 0.78. The feasibility of the proposed model is shown testing the similarity of the clusters generated using the k-means algorithm over the raw data and the compressed representation of real data.

In this paper, we presented an approach called Ant-MST for gene expression data clustering based on both ant-based clustering and minimum spanning trees (MST). The ant-based clustering algorithm is firstly used to construct a fully connected network of nodes. Each node represents one gene, and every edge is associated with a certain level of pheromone intensity describing the co-expression level between two genes. Then MST is used to break the linkages in order to generate clusters. Comparing to other MST-based clustering approaches, our proposed method uses pheromone intensity to measure the similarity between two genes instead of using Euclidean distance or correlation distance. Pheromone intensities associated with every edge in a fully-connected network records the collective memory of the ants. Self-organizing behavior could be easily discovered through pheromone intensities. Experimental results on three gene expression datasets show that our approach in general outperforms the classical clustering methods such as K-means and agglomerate hierarchical clustering.

We compare the gap statistic performance versus the partition coefficient and entropy indices introduced by Bezdek, the Xie-Beni and extended Xie-Beni indices, and the Fukuyama-Sugeno index. We show that the fuzzy gap statistic is more robust than the ordinary gap statistic for the IRIS data set, and we show promising results when comparing the gap statistic to the traditional fuzzy clustering indices.

In this paper we propose a data-driven activation detection method called neighborhood one-class SVM (NOC-SVM). By incorporating the idea of neighborhood consistency into one-class SVM, the method classifies a voxel as an activated or non-activated voxel by its neighbor weighted distance to a hyperplane in a high-dimensional kernel space. On two synthetic datasets under different SNRs, the proposed method almost has lower error rate than K-means clustering and fuzzy K-means clustering. On a real fMRI dataset, all the three algorithms can detect similar activated regions. Furthermore, the NOC-SVM is more stable than random algorithms, such as K-means clustering and fuzzy K-means clustering. These results show that the proposed NOC-SVM is a new effective method for activation detections in fMRI data.

However if the pre-specified number of clusters is modified, the precision of each result also changes. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new clustering algorithm based on the Kea keyphrase extraction algorithm which returns several keyphrases from the source documents by using some machine learning techniques. In this paper documents are grouped into several clusters like K-means, but the number of clusters is automatically determined by the algorithm with some heuristics using the extracted keyphrases. Our Kea-means clustering algorithm provides easy and efficient ways to extract test documents from massive quantities of resources.

Bottleneck bandwidth estimation using frequency analysis	PROCEEDINGS - 16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS, VOLS 1-3	IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS		English	Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks	AUG 13-16, 2007	Honolulu, HI	IEEE Commun Soc, Nokia				This paper presents a new passive technique for estimating the bottleneck bandwidth based on transferring the Gaussian kernel density estimation of the packets inter arrival times to the frequency domain. The resulting spectrum contains information about the transmission time of the bottleneck link and can reveal information about multiple bottlenecks if they exist along the end-to-end path. The advantage of the technique is that it provides a model that can be manipulated by the digital signal processing methods and, unlike prior work in the area, it relies less on statistical methods. The proposed technique was validated using the ns2 network simulator on several topologies and traffic sources. Further experiments were conducted to test the strength of the patterns between flows that share a bottleneck by applying K-means algorithm to cluster the average packet inter-arrival times of these flows. The paper also presents a set of results from real traffic experiments conducted in order to infer both the bottleneck bandwidth and the capacity of the path using a passive approach.

Besides, FICA also adds the concept of data compression to lower the operating times and coordinates with parameters to reach global search. A series of experiments have been conducted on FICA and other clustering algorithms, like K-Means and DBSCAN. According to the simulation results, it is observed that the proposed FICA clustering algorithm outperforms K-Means and DBSCAN. FICA can not only to perform good efficiency and correctness but also be applied in large number of data sets. Finally, the proposed FICA is applied in face recognition problem.

Various clustering methods are need for different domains and applications. A clustering algorithm for data mining based on swarm intelligence called Ant-Cluster is proposed in this paper. Ant-Cluster algorithm introduces the concept of multi-population of ants with different speed, and adopts fixed moving times method to deal with outliers and locked ant problem. Finally, we experiment on a telecom company's customer data set with SWARM, agent-based model simulation software, which is integrated in SIMiner, a data mining software system developed by our own studies based on swarm intelligence. The results illuminate that Ant-Cluster algorithm can get clustering results effectively without giving the number of clusters and have better performance than k-means algorithm.

The method applies the skin color features extracted in the color spaces and a k-means clustering ensembles. There are three stages are included in the proposed method. The first, the skin-color pixel feature vector included both its position and color information is extracted. For providing fast and stable classification, a k-means clustering ensembles approach which combine the clustering results obtaining from a set of k-means clusters started from a random initialization is employed. The consensus partitions of skin color pixel feature vector can be obtained based on voting mechanism. By taking face region property into account, the optimum region boundaries are then obtained by frame integration and frame segmentation algorithms those are used for merging frames and partitioning different faces in the same region respectively. Finally, candidate face regions will be found by rejecting the framed regions when its ratio of height to width is over than 2.3. The face verification of these candidate face regions can be effectively achieved by performing an appearance-based method with spectral histograms as representation and support vector machines (SVMs) as classifiers.

However it is only able to detect one cluster of non-convex shape in the feature space. In this study, we propose an alternative method using two-stage v-SVC to cluster data into several groups. The two-stage v-SVC is used to calculate the centroid of the sphere for each cluster in the feature space, and the K-means procedure is used to refine the clustering result iteratively. A mechanism is provided to control the position of the cluster centroid to work against outliers. Experimental results have shown that our method compares favorably with other kernel based clustering algorithms, such as KKM and KFCM, on several synthetic data sets and UCI real data.

A new pursuit projection based text clustering algorithm is proposed. With minimizing (or maximizing) a projecting index, Projection Pursuit searches for an optimal projection direction and projects text feature vectors from high-dimensional into low-dimensional (1 to 3 dimensions) space. The linear and non-linear structures and features of the original high-dimensional data can be expressed by its projection weights in the optimal projection direction. The optimal projection direction is looked for by genetic algorithm, and the distribution of texts can be visualized. Pursuit projection based text clustering does not need to set cluster number previously like in k-means clustering, and opens out non-linear structure not like in latent semantics analysis only discovering linear structure. Experiments demonstrated that this algorithm is effective to cluster texts.

However, privacy regulations and other privacy concerns may prevent data owners from sharing information for data analysis. To resolve this challenging problem, data owners must design a solution that meets privacy requirements and guarantees valid data clustering results. To achieve this dual goal, we introduce a new method for privacy-preserving clustering based on the probability distributed model for clustering. This paper proposes square wave-based clustering model, gauss distribution-based clustering model and the multivariate normal distribution-based clustering model based on the information provided by the K-means clustering result separately. And we mainly show the correctness and feasibility of the sampled data for clustering by experiment. This new preserving technique can be used not only for distributed clustering, but also for simultaneous clustering rule and data hiding.

This type is a permanent, shielded and submersible cable joint for direct burial or vault application. It confirms to the requirements of IEEE std. 404-2004 by factory testing, but many problems of insulated cable systems are caused by internal defects of the joint part which have to be mounted onsite. Faults arise from impurities or voids. A suitable solution for a monitoring of cable joints during the after-laying test and service is partial discharge detection. This paper described the influence on partial discharge distribution of various defects at the model power cable joints interface by statistical processing. As the result of analyzing Phi-q-n patterns, several parameters i.e. maximum discharge qmax, average discharge q and average angle of discharge theta g were found to depend upon the defect type varying applied voltage. As the result of analyzing discharge number distribution of Phi-n cluster using K-means clustering, clusters shifted to 0 degrees and 180 degrees with increasing applying voltage. It was confirmed that discharge quantity and Euclidean distance between centroids were increased with applying voltage from the analyzing centroid distribution of Phi-q cluster.

Typical behavior patterns extraction and anomaly detection algorithm based on accumulated home sensor data	PROCEEDINGS OF FUTURE GENERATION COMMUNICATION AND NETWORKING, WORKSHOP PAPERS, VOL 2			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Future Generation Communication Networking	DEC 06-08, 2007	Jeju Isl, SOUTH KOREA					In this paper we propose a method consists of two components, behavior patterns extraction and anomaly detection algorithm in daily life. To begin with, sensor data are accumulated in a room environment and behavior description labels are assigned for each data segment using HMM(Hidden Markov Model) and k-means method. An HMM is composed every day based on sensor data segments of the day. The behavior description label at each time segment is determined by likelihood of the segment computed using the HMM. In anomaly detection step, typical behavior sequences are acquired using probabilistic density of behavior occurrence and behavior successive time. Each probabilistic density is composed based on accumulating labeled-data using Sequential Discounting Laplace Estimation and Sequential Discounting Expectation and Maximization algorithms. When a new datum comes, if typical behavior data change largely, the data is detected as anomaly. The proposed method is verified by a long-time activity detection sensor data taken at a house of elderly person.

But it is difficult to decide tumor region of X-ray images, and veterinarians have to diagnose many X-ray images. Therefore, there is increasing demand for the development of CAD (Computer Aided Diagnosis) system to support veterinarians. We use X-ray images of small animals such as dogs. In this paper, automatic detection of tumor region from X-ray images is studied. We use normalized correlation between original image and template image to emphasize tumor region. This template image is based on feature of tumor. We also use Quoit filter to detect tumor candidate regions. Then, we calculate two feature values, mean of intensity and roundness in these regions, and classify these two feature values into four patterns by K-means clustering to decide true tumor region. As a result, some tumor region can be detected.

If the temperature exceeds the rated temperature of the transformer, then its life decreases exponentially. This paper shows the relation between the sequence of slabs and the life loss of oil-immersed power transformer in steel works. Firstly, the equivalent thermal model for oil-immersed power transformer will be introduced. Using k-means clustering, current for slabs are classified into some current groups. To expect current groups of slabs that have not classified, a model for the system is needed. For this model, neural network with MLP was used. Finally, to know that the life loss of the transformer is influenced by different slab sequences, some different sequences were designed. The optimal sequence which minimizes the life loss of the transformer was obtained by means of Quasi-Newton optimization method. It is shown that proposed optimal sequence has the minimum loss of life among others.

The load curves can reflect the actual characteristics of power utilization. The analysis of power utilization characteristics based on load curves can make related work more reasonable. This paper presents a method based on a combination of clustering and classification to analyze the power utilization characteristics of distribution network customers. Two steps are involved in the proposed method, they are k-means clustering to form typical load curves and a decision tree model based on the clustering result for customer classification. C4.5 classification algorithm is used to classify customers of distribution network. Load classification accuracy is increased by selecting the optimal decision tree attributes. This method is applied to analyzing the load curves of distribution network customers. The result can reflect the actual power utilization characteristics and provides an effective pricing basis for managers.

Though clustering e-learners is important for better cooperation between teachers and students in e-learning, it is a challenge job to group learners flexibly and exactly. Since there are already many models for the features which are used for the basis of the clustering methods, this paper proposes an improvement of Matrix-based Clustering Method which preformed efficiently without extra comparison in contrast to k-means clustering algorithm. The improvement of the Matrix-based Clustering Method proposes the concept "Agglomerate Strength " for further cluster cohesion measurement in contrast to the previous Matrix-based Clustering Method in precision. And the comparison experiments between the improvement Matrix-based Clustering Method and the other methods, i.e. the previous Matrix-based Clustering Method and K-means algorithm, are investigated. The results of experiments show that this method is feasible and efficient.

It is evitable that these types of images will be affected by uncertainties. As a result, image segmentation is especially useful for the processing of underwater and aerial images. Segmentation acts as a basic approach to clarify both feature ambiguity and information noise. It categorizes an image into separate parts which correlate with objects or areas involved. Image segmentation by clustering refers to grouping similar data points into different clusters. K-means clustering requires that the number of partitioning clusters be specified and its distance metric be defined to quantify the relative orientation of objects. Being a competitive learning method, Winner-Take-All (WTA) methodology has been selected to update one particular cluster centroid each time, which is an effective and optimal approach. K-means clustering is capable of both simplifying computation and accelerating convergence. To evaluate the role of image segmentation in image processing process, quantitative measures should be defined. The discrete entropy of the grayscale image is a statistical measure of randomness which can be used to characterize original and segmented images. The measure of the proximity between the probability density functions of the clustered and original images is described as relative entropy. Both measures are proposed to further study the influence of image segmentation via clustering. This study has the potential to apply on national defense and resource exploitation.

Its aim is to minimize the mean squared distance from each data to its nearest center. A lot of variants of Lloyd's heuristic have been studied. Unfortunately, many research results haven't given any approximate ratio. In this paper, an algorithm is presented which can obtain the optimal clustering with the ration of at most 2. The main idea of this algorithm is that k points are selected by means of a very simple, randomized seeding technique and then the local search is implemented to improve the accuracy. Some examples are selected to verify our algorithm and got better results both the speed and accuracy than the former methods. The main algorithmic contribution is that the input points are used as the candidate sets to obtain the optimal clustering with a constant ratio by means of local search technique and one method of selecting initial points.

So a novel clustering algorithm based on hierarchical and K-means clustering, which has good computational complexity, is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the concept of silhouette coefficient is introduced and the optimal clustering number K-opt, included in data set of unknown class information is decided. Then the distribution of data set is gotten through hierarchical clustering and clustering center is decided. Finally, the clustering is completed through K-means clustering. The efficiencies of the algorithm is validated through the test of IRIS testing data set.

Almost color is the major feature which has been used in skin detection methods. In this paper, we propose a skin detection approach which combines a block-based skin detection classifier with a boosted pixel-based one. The block-based skin detector classifies image blocks based on both color and texture features. In this classifier, a k-means algorithm clusters various training skin samples. The boosted pixel-based classifier combines some explicit boundary skin detectors. These detectors operate in different color spaces. Two structures for the combination of these classifiers are introduced. In the first structure, each image is passed through the block-based classifier and then the pixel-based approach is applied on skin candidate blocks to adjust the results. The second structure uses block-based classifier to refine pixel-based skin detection results. By using both color and texture information, we obtained acceptable results. Our methods are examined on a large image dataset and are compared with some other available methods. The results prove the effectiveness and benefits of our proposed methods.

Multiple features extracted from the video are considered for the determination of the scene boundaries in an unsupervised clustering procedure. For each video shot to shot comparison feature, one-dimensional signal is constructed by graph partitions obtained from the similarity matrix in a temporal interval. After each one-dimensional signal is filtered, k-means clustering is conducted for finding scene boundaries. The proposed graph-based scene boundary detection method is evaluated and compared with the graph-based scene detection method presented in literature.

The classifier is used in low power and capacity devices such as Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) and Smartphone. In the training phase, ICC employs K-means to group instances into several clusters, and then incrementally separates the cluster into two clusters until the cluster members belong to the same type within each cluster. Thus instances have uniform class label within each cluster. In the predicting phase, ICC adopts NNR to find a centroid which is the nearest neighbor of the unlabeled instance. Since the training data are substituted by the cluster centroids; memory and computation requirements are decreased. K-means and NNR are both simple and efficient methods. ICC is easy to redo and have efficient performance and is, hence, suitable for low capacity hardware. In this paper, the prediction accuracy of ICC is evaluated and compared with those of NNR and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Our experimental results show that the prediction accuracy of ICC is comparable to NNR. Although NNR is the easiest to use and redo, it is sensitive to noises and consumes time and memory for a large dataset. Despite the higher accuracy of LIBSVM, it is time-consuming to select an appropriate kernel function and related parameters. ICC is parameter-free, simple to operate and easy to implement. Mobile users can complete their work more conveniently and accurately.

There are many clustering approaches proposed in the literature with different quatity/complexity tradeoffs. Combining multiple clustering is an approach to overcome the deficiency of single algorithms and further enhance their performances. Current approaches to combining multiple clusterings use end-result cooperation (e.g. ensemble clustering and hybrid clustering) between the clustering algorithms. Inherent drawbacks of the end-result cooperation are: the computational complexity of ensemble clustering and the idle wasted time in the hybrid approaches. In this paper, the k-means and the bisecting k-means clustering algorithms are both combined using intermediate-cooperation strategy for the aim of obtaining better clustering solutions than non-cooperative algorithms. Undertaken experimental results show that the quality of the clustering solutions obtained from the Cooperative Partitional-Divisive Clustering (CPDC) model is better than those obtained from the non-cooperative algorithms over a number of gene expression datasets.

Many of them assume to find exclusive biclusters whose subsets of genes are co-regulated under subsets of conditions without intersection. This is not consistent with a general understanding of biological processes that many genes participate in multiple different processes. Therefore nonexclusive biclustering algorithms are required. In this paper we present a novel approach (ROB) to find potentially overlapping biclusters in the framework of generalized rough sets. Our scheme mainly consists of two phases. First, we generate a set of highly coherent seeds (original biclusters) based on two-way rough k-means clustering. And then, the seeds are iteratively adjusted (enlarged or degenerated) by adding or removing genes and conditions based on a proposed criterion. We illustrate the method on yeast gene expression data. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.

Although it offers no accuracy guarantees, its simplicity and speed are very appealing in practice. By augmenting k-means with a very simple, randomized seeding technique, we obtain an algorithm that is Theta(log k)-competitive with the optimal clustering. Preliminary experiments show that our augmentation improves both the speed and the accuracy of k-means, often quite dramatically.

Furthermore, the way of filming of the video recordings, which follow the motion of the thumb., the pre-processing of these recordings and the subsequent parametrization have been briefly mentioned. Two groups of classificators have been created, unsupervised and supervised. The unsupervised classificators use the K-Means algorithm and were used only for labeling training data, therefore they will not be discussed in this paper. The supervised classificators are based on the use of Hidden Markov Models. Several classificators of diverse complexity have been created for the purpose of verification of their functionality and quality.

We propose a novel two stage algorithm for the recognition of printed segmented isolated characters of any script especially for cursive scripts like Arabic and Urdu. This algorithm is based on cluster guided pattern recognition through the use of k-means clustering algorithm to considerably reduce the recognition time for the template matching based pattern recognizer. In the first stage Confusion matrix of templates pool is generated through template matching and then applying cluster prediction algorithm on confusion matrix, three different sets of clusters are predicted using k-means clustering. Based on a cost evaluation criterion, the final value for clusters is selected which is used to perform clustering. The proposed approach automatically ensures the same recognition rate as that of template matching alone because cluster centers just serve to reduce the search space of template matching from global pool of templates to local one and actual recognition is still function of template matching. The proposed technique is applied on Urdu character set in Naskh font style. The implementation results show 8.45 times faster recognition rate.

The performance of the proposed method was tested on cancer classification problems. Genetic Programming is employed as a classifier. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method yields higher accuracy than using the SNR ranking alone and higher than using all of the genes in classification. The clustering step assures that the selected genes have low redundancy, hence the classifier can exploit these features to obtain better performance.

So using classification technique of images we can recognize land-using-type. The principle of computer-RS classification recognizing is using the difference of feature of structure and spectrum energy to recognize information of surface features. This article is depending on experiment of RS-image in CUG, land-using-type is divided Isodata, K-means, Parallelepiped, minimum Distance, Mahalanobos Distance, Maximum Likelihood, Spectral angle mapper and binary encoding. The comparison begins with a theoretical example in which several criteria are varied: number of pixels per class, overlapping (or not) of radiometric values between classes, and presence and absence of spatial structuring of classes within the geographical space. And then the results of experiment are compared to pick out the distinctness of every methods with the attempt to bring out the trend of remote sensing image classification. It is seen that: (I)Supervised classification is more complex but have a more accurate results compared with unsupervised classification. (2) Maximum likelihood gives better results than other classification methods when the radiometric values for each class are clearly separated. This advantage is lost as the number of pixels per class increase; (3) Spectral Angle Mapper is systematically better in hyperspectral remote sensing images and the result is not very good for high resolution remote sensing images.

Among which the fuzzy clustering method is effective to land use classification. This paper analyzes some of the shortages in basic principles of the fuzzy clustering methods caused by the massive redundant information in multispectral images, and supplies an updated weighted clustering method, which considers the weights of different spectrums according to their effective information capacities. In examination we take the TM images of part of Beijing city as an example to carry out land use classification. The results of ISODATA clustering method, common fuzzy K-mean clustering method and weighted clustering method are compared.

Many real-world data, on the other hand, comprise of multiple types of heterogeneous interrelated components, such as web pages and hyperlinks, online scientific publications and authors and publication venues to name a few. In this paper, we present K-SVMeans, a clustering algorithm for multi-type interrelated datasets that integrates the well known K-Means clustering with the highly popular Support Vector Machines. The experimental results on authorship analysis of two real world web-based datasets show that K-SVMeans can successfully discover topical clusters of documents and achieve better clustering solutions than homogeneous data clustering.

The search process for the optimal clusters approximating the unknown classes towards getting homogenous groups, where the homogeneity is defined in terms of the "typicality" of components with respect to the current skeleton. Our method is described in the third section of the paper. The compression scheme was set in terms of the principal directions corresponding to the available cloud. The final section presents the results of the tests aiming the comparison between the performances of our method and the standard k-means clustering technique when they are applied to the initial space as well as to compressed data.

Our MRF terms can include cliques of variable sizes, and solve these using Loopy Belief Propagation. To calculate our MRF topology we develop a variant of the K-means algorithm which we call the KN-means algorithm (where each mean has a specified number of neighbours). The method is compared to other state of the art sparse feature correspondence algorithms and shown to compare well, especially for less dense feature sets. Outliers are handled naturally within this paradigm.

The existing spectral clustering algorithms are all off-line algorithms, i.e., they can not incrementally update the clustering result given a small change of the data set. However, the capability of incrementally updating is essential to some applications such as real time monitoring of the evolving communities of websphere or blogsphere. Unlike traditional stream data, these applications require incremental algorithms to handle not only insertion/deletion of data points but also similarity changes between existing items. This paper extends the standard spectral clustering to such evolving data by introducing the incidence vector/matrix to represent two kinds of dynamics in the same framework and by incrementally updating the eigenvalue system. Our incremental algorithm, initialized by a standard spectral clustering, continuously and efficiently updates the eigenvalue system and generates instant cluster labels, as the data set is evolving. The algorithm is applied to a blog data set. Compared with recomputation of the solution by standard spectral clustering, it achieves similar accuracy but with much lower computational cost. Close inspection into the blog content shows that the incremental approach can discover not only the stable blog communities but also the evolution of the individual multi-topic blogs.

An image is divided into number of blocks. Based on its texture pattern, each block is replaced by a texture value and 'texture image' corresponding to the original image is obtained. A set of descriptors obtained from this 'texture image' describes the image. Finally, a simple but novel cluster based retrieval scheme is presented which is free from the drawbacks of k - means algorithm. Experiment shows the effectiveness of the texture features and the clustering scheme.

The boundary can be looked upon as a sequence of certain elementary shapes. These elementary shapes are in fact, the states in the model. An HMM is quite appropriate in applications where the shape of the boundary varies significantly from one sample to another within a class. For the task of learning of the HMM parameters, the segmental K-means algorithm is used. This algorithm was basically developed for speech recognition and was not fully connected. Here it is modified as a fully connected HMM. The state distribution is assumed to be multivariate Gaussian. The proposed scheme has been tested on two databases of handwritten numeral and character shapes of Bangla script. The results are quite encouraging.

The main goal is to guide enterprise to provide on-the-job training for employees after obtains the suitable subsidy fund, and improves quality of work force. However, after various enterprises receive the subsidy, whether can really provide effective training which fulfills the market demand is worth to concern. Therefore this research using data mining method to analysis database from Bureau of Employment Vocational Training (BEVT) in Taiwan base on Combined Density-and Constraint-based Algorithm (CDC). Since CDC Algorithm has the characteristic which can reduce the effect of noise distortion and outliers, it can be more accurate and faster to analysis the data in order to find the relationship between the amount of government subsidy and the effectiveness of on-the-job training. CDC Algorithm basically has two stages. In division stage, it uses the concept of data density to clustering the data, and isolates the noise distortion and outliers simultaneously in order to discover the cluster centroid, then take the k-mean cluster center as the concept, take larger cluster as the center, merges into smaller clusters with limited mean error, finally completes the calculation process. The finding shows significant positive correlation between the amount of government subsidy and the return on investment of training. Since enterprise has links training investment to organizational performance, therefore, it will also receive more government subsidy. Therefore if the enterprise continue conduct structure training program, the enterprise will have more complete quality training environment to continuously re-invest in and upgrade the competence of their human resources.

Often, the obstruction is such as to render unreliable the definition of underling images. There are several typical mathematical methods used in image processing to remove interferences from images to include spectral methods, wave front or shock methods, and the use of non-Abelian group operations. In this paper, a new advanced image processing technique based on image segmentations has been developed and tested for the removal of fog, clouds, foliage and other interfering structures. The developed method has been applied to certain images to demonstrate its effectiveness in removing unwanted sub-images.

Due to a variety of reasons inherent in web browsing and web logging, the likelihood of bad or incomplete data is higher than conventional applications. The analytical techniques in web mining need to accommodate such data. Fuzzy and rough sets provide the ability to deal with incomplete and approximate information. Fuzzy set theory has been shown to be useful in three important aspects of web and data mining, namely clustering, association, and sequential analysis. There is increasing interest in research on clustering based on rough set theory. Clustering is an important part of web mining that involves finding natural groupings of web resources or web users. Researchers have pointed out some important differences between clustering in conventional applications and clustering in web mining. For example, the clusters and associations in web mining do not necessarily have crisp boundaries. As a result, researchers have studied the possibility of using fuzzy sets in web mining clustering applications. Recent attempts have used genetic algorithms based on rough set theory for clustering. However, the genetic algorithms based clustering may not be able to handle the large amount of data typical in a web mining application. This paper proposes a variation of the K-means clustering algorithm based on properties of rough sets topology.

The mTSP is more complicated than the traveling salesman problem (TSP) because it requires determining which cities to assign to each salesman, as well as the optimal ordering of the cities within each salesman's tour. Previous studies proposed that Genetic Algorithm (GA), Integer Programming (IP) and several neural network (NN) approaches could be used to solve mTSP. This paper compared the results for mTSP, solved with Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (NNA). The number of cities is clustered into a few groups using k-means clustering technique. The number of groups depends on the number of salesman. Then, each group is solved with NNA and GA as an independent TSP. It is found that k-means clustering and NNA are superior to GA in terms of performance (evaluated by fitness function) and computing time.

In order to build complex digital logic circuits its often essential to sub-divide multi-million transistor design into manageable Pieces. This paper looks at the various partitioning techniques aspects of VLSI CAD, targeted at various applications. We proposed an evolutionary time-series model and a statistical glitch prediction system using a neural network with selection of global feature by making use of clustering method model, for partitioning a circuit. For evolutionary time-series model, we made use of genetic, memetic & neuro-memetic techniques. Our work focused in use of clustering methods - K-means & EM methodology. A comparative study is provided for all techniques to solve the problem of circuit partitioning pertaining to VLSI design. The performance of all approaches is compared using benchmark data provided by MCNC standard cell placement benchmark net lists. Analysis of the investigational results proved that the Neuro-memetic model achieves greater performance then other model in recognizing sub-circuits with minimum amount of interconnections between them.

On Combining Support Vector Machines and Fuzzy K-Means in Vision-based Precision Agriculture	PROCEEDINGS OF WORLD ACADEMY OF SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY, VOL 22	Proceedings of World Academy of Science Engineering and Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference of the World-Academy-of-Science-Engineering-and-Technology	JUL 27-29, 2007	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC			Fuzzy k-Means; Precision agriculture; Support Vectors Machines; Weed detection	IMAGE-ANALYSIS; WEED-CONTROL; SEGMENTATION; COLOR	One important objective in Precision Agriculture is to minimize the volume of herbicides that are applied to the fields through the use of site-specific weed management systems. In order to reach this goal, two major factors need to be considered: 1) the similar spectral signature, shape and texture between weeds and crops; 2) the irregular distribution of the weeds within the crop's field. This paper outlines an automatic computer vision system for the detection and differential spraying of Avena sterilis, a noxious weed growing in cereal crops. The proposed system involves two processes: image segmentation and decision making. Image segmentation combines basic suitable image processing techniques in order to extract cells from the image as the low level units. Each cell is described by two area-based attributes measuring the relations among the crops and the weeds. From these attributes, a hybrid decision making approach determines if a cell must be or not sprayed. The hybrid approach uses the Support Vector Machines and the Fuzzy k-Means methods, combined through the fuzzy aggregation theory. This makes the main finding of this paper.

It is much more complex, usually large in size, and continuously changes. Until recently business data has been the main target for discovering trends, patterns or future expectations. However, with the recent rise in biotechnology, the powerful technology that was used for analyzing business data is now being applied to biological data. With the advanced technology at hand, the main trend in biological research is rapidly changing from structural DNA analysis to understanding cellular functions of the DNA sequences. DNA chips are now being used to perform experiments and DNA analysis processes are being used by researchers. Clustering is one of the important processes used for grouping together similar entities. There are many clustering algorithms such as hierarchical clustering, self-organizing maps, K-means clustering and so on. In this paper, we propose a clustering algorithm that imitates the ecosystem taking into account the features of biological data. We implemented the system using an Ant-Colony clustering algorithm. The system decides the number of clusters automatically. The system processes the input biological data, runs the Ant-Colony algorithm, draws the Topic Map, assigns clusters to the genes and displays the output. We tested the algorithm with a test data of 100 to 1000 genes and 24 samples and show promising results for applying this algorithm to clustering DNA chip data.

The fact that a single segmentation result do not generally allow a higher level process to take into account all the elements included in the image has motivated the consideration of image segmentation as a multiobjective optimization problem. The proposed algorithm adopts a split/merge strategy that uses the result of the k-means algorithm as input for a quantum evolutionary algorithm to establish a set of non-dominated solutions. The evaluation is made simultaneously according to two distinct features: intra-region homogeneity and inter-region heterogeneity. The experimentation of the new approach on natural images has proved its efficiency and usefulness.

Enhancing K-Means Algorithm with Initial Cluster Centers Derived from Data Partitioning along the Data Axis with the Highest Variance	PROCEEDINGS OF WORLD ACADEMY OF SCIENCE, ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY, VOL 26, PARTS 1 AND 2, DECEMBER 2007	Proceedings of World Academy of Science Engineering and Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference of the World-Academy-of-Science-Engineering-and-Technology	DEC 14-16, 2007	Bangkok, THAILAND	World Acad Sci Engn & Technol		Clustering algorithm; K-means algorithm; Data partitioning; Initial cluster centers		In this paper, we propose an algorithm to compute initial cluster centers for K-means clustering. Data in a cell is partitioned using a cutting plane that divides cell in two smaller cells. The plane is perpendicular to the data axis with the highest variance and is designed to reduce the sum squared errors of the two cells as much as possible, while at the same time keep the two cells far apart as possible. Cells are partitioned one at a time until the number of cells equals to the predefined number of clusters, K. The centers of the K cells become the initial cluster centers for K-means. The experimental results suggest that the proposed algorithm is effective, converge to better clustering results than those of the random initialization method. The research also indicated the proposed algorithm would greatly improve the likelihood of every cluster containing some data in it.

In this paper, the features of Volterra filter are utilized for color image segmentation. The discrete Volterra filter exhibits both linear and nonlinear characteristics. The linear part smoothes the image features in uniform gray zones and is used for getting a gross representation of objects of interest. The nonlinear term compensates for the blurring due to the linear term and preserves the edges which are mainly used to distinguish the various objects. The truncated quadratic Volterra filters are mainly used for edge preserving along with Gaussian noise cancellation. In our approach, the segmentation is based on K-means clustering algorithm in HSI space. Both the hue and the intensity components are fully utilized. For hue clustering, the special cyclic property of the hue component is taken into consideration. The experimental results show that the proposed technique segments the color image while preserving significant features and removing noise effects.	[Meenavathi, M.

The procedure follows a simple and easy way to classify a given data set through a pre-specified number of clusters K, therefore the problem of determining '' the right number of clusters '' has attracted considerable interest. However, to the authors' knowledge, no experimental results of their comparison have been reported so far. This paper presents results of such a comparison involving eight selection options presenting four approaches. We generate data according to a Gaussian-mixture distribution with clusters' spread and spatial sizes variant. Most consistent results are shown by the least squares and least modules version of an intelligent version of the method, iK-Means by Mirkin [14]. However, the right K is reproduced best by the Hartigan's [5] method. This leads us to propose an adjusted iK-Means method, which performs well in the current experiment setting.

The visualization method can also incorporate the result of a clustering algorithm to facilitate the process of data analysis. Specifically, we show the integration with a graph-based clustering algorithm that outperforms the results against other benchmarks, namely k-means and self-organizing maps. Even though the application uses gene expression data, the method is general and only requires a similarity function being defined between pairs of objects. The microarray dataset is based on the budding yeast (S. cerevisiae). It is composed of 79 samples taken from different experiments and 2,467 genes.

The algorithm performs actual analysis for the initial population and periodically every few generations. An external archive of the unique solutions evaluated using the actual analysis is maintained to train the surrogate models. The data points in the archive are split into multiple partitions using k-Means clustering. A Radial Basis Function (RBF) network surrogate model is built for each partition using a fraction of the points in that partition. The rest of the points in the partition are used as a validation data to decide the prediction accuracy of the surrogate model. Prediction of a new candidate solution is done by the surrogate model with the least prediction error in the neighborhood of that point. Five multiobjective test problems are presented in this study and a comparison with Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is included to highlight the benefits offered by our approach. EASDS algorithm consistently reported better nondominated solutions for all the test cases for the same number of actual evaluations as compared to a single global surrogate model and NSGA-II.

In order to avoid this kind of flaw, we proposed Hybrid Parallel Genetic Algorithm. In this method, we expressed the documents set into Vector Space Model and randomly chose initial clustering center to form chromosome among document vectors. Combined with the efficiency of K-means Algorithm and the global optimization ability of Parallel Genetic Algorithm, we can provide a higher efficiency and precision for text clustering by means of heredity, mutation in the community, and parallel evolution, intermarriage among communities. Experiments indicate that Hybrid Parallel Genetic Algorithm has higher accuracy and global optimization ability than the other text clustering methods like K-means Algorithm, Genetic Algorithm and so on.

As k-means is easy to obtain local optimum, ACOK use ant colony optimization algorithm to obtain global search. It improves the k-means by locating the objects in a cluster with the probability, which is updated by the pheromone, while the rule of updating pheromone is according to total within cluster variance (TWCV). The experiment results showed that it is better than another famous heuristic based k-means method, genetic algorithm (GA) based k-means algorithm (GKA) and k-means.

To enhance the LDA's power for high-dimensional pattern classification, such as face recognition, numerous LDA-extension approaches have been proposed in the literature. This paper proposes a new method that improves the performance of LDA-based classification by simply increasing the number of (sub)-classes through clustering a few of classes of the training set prior to the execution of LDA. This is based on the fact that the eigen space of the training set consists of the range space and the null space, and that the dimensionality of the range space increases as the number of classes increases. Therefore, when constructing the transformation matrix, through minimizing the null space, the loss of discriminative information resulted from this space can be minimized. To select the classes to be clustered, in the present paper, the intraset distance is employed as a criterion and the k-means clustering is performed to divide them. Our experimental results for an artificial data set of XOR-type samples and a well-known benchmark face database of Yale demonstrate that the classification efficiency of the proposed method could be improved.

Current techniques for measuring fruit diameter are mostly touching measurements and these touching measurements will crush berry and affect berries normal growth. In addition, the sensors of measuring the fruit diameter are expensive. During the period of ripeness, the measurement error becomes larger because of a little of shrinkage of berries. Therefore, we developed an image acquisition system which can measure the fruit diameters of multi berries once, no touching and high precision. The primary components of the developed image acquisition system are a fluorescent light source, a time controller, a digital camera with high resolution, and software for automatically analyzing images. An algorithm which works in two steps, in a totally unsupervised way, is used in the software. The first step consists of color model transformation procedure which RGB color space is converted into L* a* b* color space. In the second step, color clustering is performed by K-means methods.

For all these problems, we consider the following simple sampling scheme: select a small sample set of input points uniformly at random and then run some approximation algorithm on this sample set to compute an approximation of the best possible clustering of this set. Our main technical contribution is a significantly strengthened analysis of the approximation guarantee by this scheme for the clustering problems. The main motivation behind our analyses was to design sublinear-time algorithms for clustering problems. Our second contribution is the development of new approximation algorithms for the aforementioned clustering problems. Using our random sampling approach, we obtain for these problems the first time approximation algorithms that have running time independent of the input size, and depending on k and the diameter of the metric space only.

At the same time, it is sensitive to the choice of the initial cluster centers and it's difficult to determine the cluster number. An efficient adaptive large-scale text clustering method based on genetic K-means algorithm called TCGKA was proposed. In this method, firstly, we randomly extracted a: suitable number of documents, and then adopted the improved genetic K-means clustering algorithm (called IGKCA) based on variable-length chromosome encoding (called VLCE) to get optimal initial cluster centers and cluster number. In the end, according to the clustering feature, clustering texts were divided into lots of document sets. Using optimized initial cluster centers and cluster number which got from step 1, we clustered those document sets one by one, updated cluster centers, and then gained the clustering result. Experiments indicated that this algorithm was efficient and accurate.

Using a computational model of the NF-kappa B signaling network involving two negative regulators, I kappa B alpha and A20, we performed sensitivity analyses with three different sampling methods and present a ranking of the kinetic rate variables by the strength of their influence on the NF-kappa B signaling response. We also present a classification of temporal-response profiles of nuclear NF-kappa B concentration into six clusters, which can be regrouped to three biologically relevant clusters.

Recently several rough clustering algorithms have been suggested and successfully applied to real data. Switching regression is closely related to clustering. The main difference is that the distance of the data objects to regression functions has to be minimized in contrast to the minimization of the distance of the data objects to cluster representatives in k-means and k-medoids. Therefore we will introduce rough switching regression algorithms which utilizes the concepts of rough clustering algorithms as introduced by Lingras at al. [2] and Peters [3].

We also notice that methods of unsupervised classification (in other words, data clustering) in pattern recognition are closely related to supervised classification techniques. This observation leads us to the discussion of clustering for information systems by investigating relations between the two methods in the pattern classification. We thus discuss a number of methods of data clustering of information tables without decision attributes on the basis of rough set approach in this paper. Current clustering algorithms using rough sets as well as new algorithms motivated from pattern classification techniques are considered. Agglomerative clustering are generalized into a method of poset-valued clustering for discussing structures of information systems using new notations in relational databases. On the other hand K-means algorithms are developed using the kernel function approach. Illustrative examples are given.

In this paper, the cell region is extracted from an image of uterine cervical cytodiagnosis using the region growing method. Segmented images from background and cell areas are binarized using a threshold value. And the 8-directional tracking algorithm for contour lines is applied to extract the cell area. Each extracted nucleus is transformed to the original RGB space. Then the K-Means clustering algorithm is employed to classify RGB pixels to the R, G, and B channels, respectively. Finally, the Hue information of nucleus is extracted from the HSI models that are transformed using the clustering values in R, G, and B channels. The fuzzy RBF Network is then applied to classify and identify the normal or abnormal nucleus. The result shows that the accuracy of our method is 80% overall and 66% in 5-class problem according to the Bethesda system.

This ambitious plan, the so-called Lisbon Strategy, was restarted and made more dynamic by the renewed European Commission in 2005. This paper gives a regional analysis of the ratios and objectives set by the EU. It focuses on the development (NUTS2) regions of Central and Eastern Europe, which represent the main places of intervention and the beneficiaries of most subsidies. The following socio-economic ratios were involved in the study: employment rate, elderly employment rate, female employment rate, research & development spending as a percentage of GDP, life-long learning participation levels, university degree holders ratio, long-term unemployment rate and per capita GDP and productivity rate computed at purchasing power parity. We wanted to examine the impacts of and the relationships between the various socio-economic movements in the regions. In order to identify relationships, we used an interlinked system of muitivariable analyses such as factor (principal component) analysis, cluster analysis and discriminance analysis. The factor analysis proved our assumption: by keeping reliable information content, it "concentrated" the ratios describing the Central and Eastern European regions into two (economy/education and employment) factors. Besides the description of the relationships, another result was that the newly created factors were able to "separate" the territorial units under study. We attached the factor scores to the database and then made a classification through K-means clustering. Based on the Central and Eastern European regions, we created eight distinct clusters and their distribution was checked through discriminance analysis. The independent variables of this latter were the relevant factors (typical of the region under study). According to our results, the cluster-based separation represents a reliable solution.

Ant colony algorithm is used as the method of cursory clustering based on ants piling up their corpses and classifying their young ones. ISODATA algorithm is applied to meticulous clustering. This algorithm has been implemented and tested on several simulated data sets. At the same time, the performance efficiency of ACIA is analyzed based on four parameters:intracluster dissimilarity degree, intercluster dissimilarity degree, misclassification rate and CPU performance time. The computational results show that it is better than three other algorithms: ant colony K-means algorithm (ACKA), ant colony genetic algorithm (AGA) and genetic K-means algorithm (GYA).

SCM systems face complexity, process's time compression, and lack ness of process optimization. In our current work, we present a broad framework for SCM, based on K-means clustering algorithm which concentrates on the supply chain (SC) processes for lessen the complexity, optimization factors in SC process communication, product variability and inaccurate forecast.

Nowadays, databases are distributed among two or more parties because of different reasons such as physical and geographical restrictions and the most important issue is privacy. Related data is normally maintained by more than one organization, each of which wants to keep its individual information private. Thus, privacy-preserving techniques and protocols are designed to perform data mining on distributed environments when privacy is highly concerned. Cluster analysis is a technique in data mining, by which data can be divided into some meaningful clusters, and it has an important role in different fields such as bio-informatics, marketing, machine learning, climate and medicine. k-means Clustering is a prominent algorithm in this category which creates a one-level clustering of data. In this paper we introduce privacy-preserving protocols for this algorithm, along with a protocol for Secure comparison, known as the Millionaires' Problem, as a sub-protocol, to handle the clustering of horizontally or vertically partitioned data among two or more parties.

In this paper, by using matrix arguments, we first model MSSC as a so-called 0-1 semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. We show that our 0-1 SDP model provides a unified framework for several clustering approaches such as normalized k- cut and spectral clustering. Moreover, the 0-1 SDP model allows us to solve the underlying problem approximately via the linear programming and SDP relaxations. Second, we consider the issue of how to extract a feasible solution of the original 0-1 SDP model from the optimal solution of the relaxed SDP problem. By using principal component analysis, we develop a rounding procedure to construct a feasible partitioning from a solution of the relaxed problem. In our rounding procedure, we need to solve a K-means clustering problem in Rk - 1, which can be done in O(n(k2 - 2k + 2)) time. In case of biclustering, the running time of our rounding procedure can be reduced to O(n log n). We show that our algorithm provides a 2-approximate solution to the original problem. Promising numerical results for biclustering based on our new method are reported.

We use K-means algorithm and the Mahalanobis distance, and analyze the heavy-tailed behavior of intra-session characteristics and their correlations for each cluster. Our results show that clustering provides an efficient way to classify tens or hundreds thousands of sessions into several coherent classes that efficiently describe Web workloads. These classes reveal phenomena that cannot be observed when studying the workload as a whole.

In view of this, a lot of work has been done on various versions of k-means, which refines initial points and detects the number of clusters. In this paper, we present a new algorithm, called an efficient k-means clustering based on influence factors,which is divided into two stages and can automatically achieve the actual value of k and select the right initial points based on the datasets characters. Propose influence factor to measure similarity of two clusters, using it to determine whether the two clusers should be merged into one. In order to obtain a faster algorithm, a theorem is proposed and proofed, using it to accelerate the algorithm. Experimental results from Gaussian datasets were generated as in Pelleg and Moore (2000)[11] show the algorithm has high quality and obtains a satisfying result.

The proposed method can improve the quality of document summaries because the inherent semantics of the documents are well reflected by using the semantic features calculated by NMF and the sentences most relevant to the given topic are extracted efficiently by using the semantic variables derived by NMF. Besides, it uses K-means clustering to remove noises so that it can avoid the biased inherent semantics of the documents to be reflected in summaries. We perform detail experiments with the well-known DUC test dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has better performance than other methods using the LSA, the Kmeans, and the NMF.

Various statistical techniques are available in order to identify market segments, among these, cluster analysis and latent class models. In this paper, an extension of traditional latent class analysis, called latent class factor model, is applied to market segmentation. This approach is more parsimonious than the traditional one and allows to obtain results easier to interpret in managerial terms. The model is used to identify segments of doctors homogeneous for attitude towards pharmaceutical industries and drugs prescription behaviour.

The goal of private data analysis is to release aggregate information about a data set while protecting the privacy of the individuals whose information the data set contains. Our framework allows one to release functions f of the data with instance-based additive noise. That is, the noise magnitude is determined not only by the function we want to release, but also by the database itself. One of the challenges is to ensure that the noise magnitude does not leak information about the database. To address that, we calibrate the noise magnitude to the smooth sensitivity of f on the database x - a measure of variability of f in the neighborhood of the instance x. The new framework greatly expands the applicability of output perturbation, a technique for protecting individuals' privacy by adding a small amount of random noise to the released statistics. To our knowledge, this is the first formal analysis of the effect of instance-based noise in the context of data privacy. Our framework raises many interesting algorithmic questions. Narnely, to apply the framework one must compute or approximate the smooth sensitivity of f on x. We show how to do this efficiently for several different functions, including the median and the cost of the minimum spanning tree. We also give a generic procedure based on sampling that allows one to release f(x) accurately on many databases x. This procedure is applicable even when no efficient algorithm for approximating smooth sensitivity of f is known or when f is given as a black box. We illustrate the procedure by applying it to k-SED (k-means) Clustering and learning mixtures of Gaussians.

J	Loncaric, D				Loncaric, Darko			Identifying the patterns of coping with school failure	SUVREMENA PSIHOLOGIJA			Croatian	Article						coping; stress; school failure	THEORETICALLY BASED APPROACH; ADOLESCENTS; STRATEGIES; STRESS; CHILDREN; STYLE; COPE	Variable centered approach focused on co-variations among variables is the predominant analytical strategy in stress and coping research. When trying to understand the behaviour of a complex and dynamic living system, many limitations of a strictly variable-centred approach exist and a typological or person-centred approach may overcome such limitations (Magnusson, 2001). The main goal of this work is to investigate applicability of the typological approach to coping research and to classify the pupils according to the different coping patterns they use when confronted with an academic stressor. Older elementary school pupils (N = 586; 6(th) to 8(th) grade) participated in this investigation. The pupils completed the Academic Stress Coping Scale (Loncaric, 2006). Data on the pupils' sex and age were also collected. K-means cluster analysis was used to classify pupils into six groups according to their pattern of coping with academic stress. Two of the groups consisted of pupils with very high or very low score on all coping strategies. The remaining pupils were classified into the following four groups: a) pupils focused exclusively on solving the problem, b) those focused on solving the problem and on using social support, c) those focused on minimizing the problem, and d) those that are emotionally reactive in stressful situations.

Aspect mining is a process that tries to identify crosscutting concerns in existing software systems. The goal is to refactor the existing systems to use aspect oriented programming, in order to make them easier to maintain and to evolve. This paper aims at presenting a new k-means based clustering algorithm used in Aspect Mining. Clustering is used in order to identify crosscutting concerns. We propose some quality measures in order to evaluate the results both from the clustering point of view and the aspect mining point of view, and we also report two case studies.

In this paper, we introduce a simple method to construct gene co-expression networks from microarray data, and then propose an efficient spectral clustering algorithm to identify natural communities, which are relatively densely connected sub-graphs, in the network. To assess the effectiveness of our approach and its advantage over existing methods, we develop a novel method to measure the agreement between the gene communities and the modular structures in other reference networks, including protein-protein interaction networks, transcriptional regulatory networks, and gene networks derived from gene annotations. We evaluate the proposed methods on two large-scale gene expression data in budding yeast and Arabidopsis thaliana. The results show that the clusters identified by our method are functionally more coherent than the clusters from several standard clustering algorithms, such as k-means, self-organizing maps, and spectral clustering, and have high agreement to the modular structures in the reference networks.

Among the vast range of clustering algorithms, K-means is one of the most popular clustering algorithms. The basic principle of the K-means algorithm is to know how different distance measure is defined. It is a critical issue for K-means users. For example, how can we select a unique distance measure method for an optimum clustering task? Our research provides a statistical based Unique Distance Measure Approach for K-means (UDMA-Km) to this issue. We consider 112 supervised datasets and measure the statistical data characteristics using central tendency measure. Those data characteristics are split using well known entropy method to generate the rules. Finally, the generated rules are used to select the unique distance measure for K-means algorithm. The experiment is conducted within 112 problems and 10 fold cross validation methods. The most significant contribution of our study is that a new algorithm was created and the new algorithm can be used and has been used to solve any clustering tasks very quickly and provide much better optimum performance.

The construction of AWC tool requires computer implementation of latent semantic analysis (LSA) combined with clustering algorithms. To meet the need, Python-based software has been developed. Major procedures performed by AWC tool are segmentation of input texts and context analysis, co-occurrence matrix construction, agglomerative and K-means clustering. Special attention is drawn to experimental results on clustering words in raw texts with changing parameters.

Synoptic and regional patterns of heavy precipitation in Austria	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							CLASSIFICATION; IMPACT	Seven synoptic patterns responsible for heavy precipitation in Austria were identified with a trajectory clustering method. Back trajectories at different levels, at different times during each day, and from different locations in Austria were utilised together with one potential vorticity value. In addition, seven regions within Austria with similar daily precipitation were identified. The response of heavy precipitation in each of these regions to the synoptic patterns was studied. The results correspond to the synoptic experience and reflect known meteorological situations, such as southerly and northerly Stau or the Vb pattern. The analyses are based on the 15-year re-analysis of the ECMWF (1979-1993), used to calculate the back trajectories, and daily precipitation sums of 131 climate stations in Austria. This paves the way to future applications in climate change research, as the necessary input data are also available from global climate models. The clustering was performed with a promising new procedure, a combination of hierarchical and iterative (K-means) clustering.

This research aims to develop a systematic performance grading approach for effectively and efficiently evaluating the performance of lithium-ion battery cells. After identifying the essential quality characteristics, this approach employs some common techniques for the evaluation: clustering analysis, Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM), and correlation analysis. For clustering analysis, an Ant-Based Self-Organizing Map (ABSOM) algorithm embeds the exploitation and exploration transition rules of ant colony optimization inside as well as U-matrix block diagram to make the algorithm more sound and identifiable. Additionally, this algorithm is combined with the K-Means into a two-stage method to improve the clustering result. After compared with SOM+K-Means and K-Means alone, the ABSOM shows better visualization and clustering results. Subsequently, the TOPSIS method is applied for grading analysis to provide battery fabricators a basis to assign a proper level for each cell and the following applications.

J	Saunier, N; Sayed, T				Saunier, Nicolas; Sayed, Tarek			Automated analysis of road safety with video data	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							TRAFFIC CONFLICTS; INTERSECTIONS; PREDICTION; TRACKING	Traffic safety analysis has often been undertaken with historical collision data. However, well-recognized availability and quality problems are associated with collision data. In addition, the use of collision records for safety analysis is reactive: a significant number of collisions has to be recorded before action is taken. Therefore, the observation of traffic conflicts has been advocated as a complementary approach in the analysis of traffic safety. However, incomplete conceptualization and the cost of training observers and collecting conflict data have been factors inhibiting extensive application of the traffic conflict technique. The goal of this research is to develop a method for automated analysis of road safety with video sensors to address the problem of dependency on the deteriorating collision data. The method automates the extraction of traffic conflicts from video sensor data. This method should address the main shortcomings of the traffic conflict technique. A comprehensive system is described for traffic conflict detection in video data. The system is composed of a feature-based vehicle tracking algorithm adapted for intersections and a traffic conflict detection method based on the clustering of vehicle trajectories. The clustering uses a K-means approach with hidden Markov models and a simple heuristic to find the number of clusters automatically. Traffic conflicts can then be detected by identifying and adapting pairs of models of conflicting trajectories. The technique is demonstrated on real-world video sequences of traffic conflicts.

We also present a novel link grouping algorithm using agglomerative hierarchical clustering that groups links in the same spatial neighborhood together while preserving link structure. Grouping allows users with severe disabilities to use a scan-based mechanism to tab through a web page and select items. In experiments, we saw up to a 40-fold reduction in the number of commands needed to click on a link with a scan-based interface. Our classification method consistently outperformed a baseline classifier even when using minimal data to generate article and index clusters, and achieved classification accuracy of 94.0% on web sites with well-formed or slightly malformed HTML, compared with 80.1% accuracy for the baseline classifier.

But even though formal models and classification rules may not exist in these data exploration scenarios, domain scientists and experts generally have a vast amount of non-compiled knowledge and intuition that they can bring to bear in this effort. In CA, there are various popular mechanisms to generate the clusters, however, the results from their non-supervised deployment rarely fully agree with this expert knowledge and intuition. To this end, our paper describes a comprehensive and intuitive framework to aid scientists in the derivation of classification hierarchies in CA, using k-means as the overall clustering engine, but allowing them to tune its parameters interactively based on a non-distorted compact visual presentation of the inherent characteristics of the data in high-dimensional space. These include cluster geometry, composition, spatial relations to neighbors, and others. In essence, we provide all the tools necessary for a high-dimensional activity we call cluster sculpting, and the evolving hierarchy can then be viewed in a space-efficient radial dendrogram. We demonstrate our system in the context of the mining and classification of a large collection of millions of data items of aerosol mass spectra, but our framework readily applies to any high-dimensional CA scenario.

Texture image segmentation techniques based on feature extraction by first and higher order statistical methods have been developped for unsupervised pixel classification. The K-Means algorithm is implemented before the choice of a threshold to highlight the ears. Three methods have been tested with very heterogeneous results, except the run length technique for which the results are closed to the visual counting with an average error of 6%. Although the evaluation of the quality of the detection is visually done, automatic evaluation algorithms are currently implementing. Moreover, other statistical methods of higher order must be implemented in the future jointly with methods based on spatio-frequential transforms and specific filtering.

Here we assume that the sequence does not contain outlier points which can be present in the depth images. Our method first performs estimation of noise and signal covariance matrices and then performs vector denoising. Luminance image is segmented into similar contexts usina k-means algorithm, which are used for calculation of covariance matrices. Denoising results are compared with the ground truth images obtained by averaging of the multiple frames of the still scene.

Two over-segmentations (OS) of a dataset are achieved and then fused to determine the best-possible initial means to perform the iterative process of k-means. The method is tested over both, image as well as non-image data. The image data is segmented using texture features based on Gabor energy features (GEF). The method is compared with single-run k-means and k-means with multiple restarts. Encouraging results have been obtained while segmenting a variety of texture images and the non-image data. The 40% OS is found to give the best results. This technique addresses the issue of data clustering in all the possible areas including data mining, pattern recognition, machine learning and statistics.

Indeed, we consider an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm, a divisive clustering algorithm, k-means partitional clustering algorithm, and a partitional competitive clustering algorithm, namely Winner Takes All (WTA). All the clustering algorithms take as input a matrix of the distances between the structures of the web pages. The distance of two pages is computed applying the Levenshtein edit distance to the strings that encode the sequences of HTML tags of the web pages.

Several rough k-means cluster algorithms have been proposed and successfully applied to Web usage mining. However, they did not explain why rough approximations of these cluster algorithms were introduced. This paper analyzes the characteristics of the data in the boundary areas of clusters, and then a rough k-means cluster algorithm based on a reasonable rough approximation (RKMrra) is proposed. Finally RKMrra is applied to Web access logs. In the experiments RKMrra compares to Lingras and West algorithm and Peters algorithm with respect to five characteristics. The results show that RKMrra discovers meaningful clusters of Web users and its rough approximation is more reasonable.

Various data representations, similarity measurements and organization manners are led to several classes of clustering methods. In this paper a new combinatorial method is proposed that iteratively uses another clustering method such as Rival Penalized Competitive Learning (R-PCL) or K-Means as the core of clustering system. Moreover, some novel auxiliary techniques are suggested to increase the clustering performance. The proposed method has been compared with well known clustering methods such as K-Means, its improvement, ISODATA and DSRPCL2. The new combinatorial technique can detect the drawbacks of core clustering method and improve its efficiency. Our method is applied on some standard multi-class datasets. After clustering, labels of grouped samples in each cluster are compared with their real class labels to show the accuracy of clustering.

It provides for the organization of a collection of patterns, represented as a vector in a multidimensional space, into clusters based on the similarity of these patterns. Medical decision support is also of increasing research interest. Ongoing collaborations between cardiovascular clinicians and computer science are looking at the application of neural networks, and in particular clustering, to the area of individual patient diagnosis, based on clinical records. The cardiovascular domain is characterized as a mixture of continuous and discrete data. This limits the use of the K-means algorithm, which is widely used for partitioning clusters in data mining. This paper presents an improvement on the K-means algorithm (KMIX) grid allows. its application to the mixture of attribute types found in the cardiovascular domain.

In the new formulation, (i) the performance function of the neural network regression models is modified such that the fuzzy clustering weightings can be introduced in these network models; (ii) the errors of these network models are feed-backed into the fuzzy clustering process. This hybrid approach leads to an iterative procedure to formulate neural network regression models with optimal fuzzy membership values for each object such that the overall error of the neural network regression models can e minimized. Our testing results show that this hybrid algorithm NN-FC can handle cases that the K-means and Fuzzy C-means perform poorly. The overall training errors drop down rapidly and converge with only a few iterations. The clustering accuracy in testing period is consistent with these drops of errors and can reach up to about 100% for some problems that the other classical fuzzy clustering algorithms perform poorly with about accuracy of 60% only. Our algorithm can also build regression models, which has the advantage of the NN component, being non-parametric and thus more flexible than the fuzzy c-regression.

As a result, much effort has gone individual into studying this problem in order to understand h droplets contribute to the accretion process. One approach has been capture the moment of impact of a supercooled droplet onto a surface placed in an icing tunnel. However, this produces a large number of images that must be analysed manuallys. This paper describes the development of an automated analysis system, employing image processing techniques, that is capqble of classifying the impact images without operator input. Using a carefully chosen feature vector and K-means cllustering algorithm, the classifition results from the automated system are comparable results from the automated system are comparable with that achieved using the manual approach.

Scenario generation employing copulas	World Congress on Engineering 2007, Vols 1 and 2	Lecture Notes in Engineering and Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	World Congress on Engineering 2007	JUL 02-04, 2007	London, ENGLAND	Int Assoc Engineers		copula; K-means clustering; multistage scenario tree construction; stochastic programming		Multistage stochastic programs are effective for solving long-term planning problems under uncertainty. Such programs are usually based on scenario generation model about future environment developments. In the present paper, the scenario model is developed for the case when enough data paths can be generated, but due to solvability of stochastic program the scenario tree has to be constructed. The proposed strategy is to generate multistage scenario tree from the set of individual scenarios by bundling scenarios based on cluster analysis. The K-means clustering approach is modified to capture the interstage dependencies. Such generation of scenario tree can be useful in cases when it is difficult to construct the adequate scenario tree from the stochastic differential equations or time-series models, and the sampled paths can be obtained by sampling or resampling techniques. While generating the initial fan of individual scenarios, the copula is employed for modeling the dependence between stochastic variables in a multivariate structure. This allows to model nonlinear dependencies between non-elliptically distributed stochastic variables. While investigating the copula effect on the scenario tree structure, we will try to answer the question: does the copula features are captured in the approximate representation of uncertainty in the form of scenario tree. The proposed scenario tree generation method is implemented on sampled data of discount bond yields. The Gaussian copula and Student's t-copula are employed while generating the set of individual scenarios in the multivariate structure.

Because of its great sensitivity to malignancy, CE-MRI of the breast finds lesions that may not be found on mammography or second-look ultrasound. However, a typical CE-MRI examination produces numerous images which need to be analyzed by ones. The complete analysis of a single dataset requires a long time for the radiologist to diagnose and is an error-prone process due to the errors caused by the fatigue and the habituation of the radiologist. Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) related to CE-MRI is able to help the clinicians in the analysis of big datasets and in the differentiation of kinetic curve patterns. In this study, we present an examination of K-means classifier for the classification of signal intensity curves on malignancy extracted from CE-MRI images. We used 13 examinations with diagnostically confirmed results. From this data, we extracted 1734 malignant patterns and used them to train. The signal patterns were divided into 10 classes through K-means clustering algorithm. The kinetic curves on the tumor region were computationally classified with the centroid signals acquired from the clustering, and the distribution of each class was mapped on the tumor region. The result shows visually the classified distributions of the kinetic curves corresponding to the malignant tumor region. Moreover, various malignant cases could be analyzed by the rank of the kinetic distributions. This technique will help the radiologist particularly in exactly diagnosing a malignant tumor with heterogeneous patterns.	[Lee, S. H.; Kim, J. H.; Kim, K. G.; Park, S. J.; Moon, W.

To this end, we have defined an approach to identify static pages that are duplicated or cloned at the content level. This approach is based on a process that first computes the dissimilarity between web pages using Latent Semantic Indexing, a well known information retrieval technique, and then groups similar-pages using clustering algorithms. We consider five instances of this process, each based on three variants of the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm, a divisive clustering algorithm, k-means partitional clustering algorithm, and a widely employed partitional competitive clustering algorithm, namely Winner Takes All. In order to assess the proposed approach, we have used the static pages of three web, applications and one static web site.

More and more literatures have researched the application of data mining technology in customer segmentation, and achieved sound effectives. One of the key purposes of customer segmentation is customer retention. Although previous segment methods may identify which group needs more care, it is unable to identify customer, chum trend for adopting different action. This paper focus on constructs a new customer segmentation method based on customer survival character. The new customer segmentation method constituted of two steps. Firstly, using K-means clustering arithmetic cluster customer into different segments which has the similar survival probability (chum trend) inside. Secondly, the method uses survival analysis to predict each cluster's survival/hazard function to test the validity of clustering and identify customer chum trend. The method mentioned above was applied in, a dataset from China Telecommunications Company, which result proposes some useful management measures and suggestions. This paper also suggests some propositions for further research.

First, the number of active brain sources in each time frame is determined. Then, Second Order Blind Identification (SOBI) is applied to isolate brain sources in a number of signal segments. After applying SOBI to the signals during seizure, rows of resulted unmixing matrix are clustered by k-mcans clustering method. The value of k is estimated via gap statistic method. By multiplying each cluster center to the electrode signals, the brain sources are extracted. The results showed that seizure source could be effectively separated from other brain sources.

J	Wan, S; Yen, HY				Wan, Shiuan; Yen, Ha Yih			The study on SSI problems in an industrial area with modified neural network approaches	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL AND ANALYTICAL METHODS IN GEOMECHANICS			English	Article						BPN; EDBD; SSI; site effects		The analysis, design, and performance of buried structures associated with machinery facilities, require an understanding of soil-structure interaction (SSI). In the past, responses recorded from a structure and near-by site of a given major earthquake were studied. Few studies have been done to find the factors influencing the structure properties and massive inputs of the soil parameters when considering a regional SSI problem. The present study, more specifically, combines a simple of 2-dof structural system representing precision machinery with an extremely detailed site description. Equivalent soil parameters such as horizontal spring stiffness and the horizontal damping ratio are estimated using local soil properties. Back-propagation neural network (BPN) with extended delta bar delta (EDBD) was used as a predictor to solve SSI problems. Finally, K-mean techniques were introduced to classify the site effects. The contribution of the study shows that EDBD helps BPN to accelerate the convergent speed. It is also found that the radius of the foundation and the maximum diameter of gravel play vital roles in the maximum displacement of both the foundation and machinery. Site effect contains a local part and a global part determined by the local soil properties and geological characteristics of the area, respectively. K-mean techniques successfully cluster the stations with similar global site effects. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Hare, Manual for the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised, Multi-Health System, Toronto, 1991]. The analysis indicated two independent types of antisocial personality disorders, not identified in the PCL-R in its standardized form, one of them being strongly associated with criminal conduct and the other with psychopathic personality. Such clusters were stable when the analysis was replicated with other hierarchical algorithms, and also, they were independently extracted via the k-means method without having previously fixed the value for k. One of the clusters concentrated the PCL-R highest scores, indicating that it is the prototypical psychopathic character determinant. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Each loop has at least one additional P/D station, provided as interface between adjacent loops. This study describes the development of a tabu search algorithm for the design of tandem AGV systems. Starting from an initial partition generated by a k-means clustering method, the tabu search algorithm partitions the stations into loops by minimizing the maximum workload of the system, without allowing the paths of loops to cross each other. The new algorithm and the partitioning algorithm presented by Bozer and Srinivasan are compared on, randomly generated problems. Results show that in large scale problems, the partitioning algorithm often leads to infeasible configurations with crossed loops in spite of its shorter running time. However the newly developed algorithm avoids infeasible configurations and often yields better objective function values. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Validation of fuzzy logic method for automated mass spectral classification for mineral imaging	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE			English	Article						chemical imaging; mineral; fuzzy logic; principal component analysis; cluster analysis; laser desorption Fourier transform mass spectrometry	TOF-SIMS; SPECTROMETRY; SURFACES	Imaging mass spectrometry requires the acquisition and interpretation of hundreds to thousands of individual spectra in order to map the mineral phases within heterogeneous geomatrices. A fuzzy logic inference engine (FLIE) was developed to automate data interpretation. To evaluate the strengths and limitations of FLIE, the chemical images obtained using FLIE were compared with those developed using two chemometric methods: principle component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (K-Means). Two heterogeneous geomatrices, a low-grade chalcopyrite ore and basalt, were imaged using a laser-desorption Fourier transform mass spectrometer. Similar mineral distribution patterns in the chalcopyrite ore sample were obtained by the three data analysis methods with most of the differences occurring at the interfaces between mineral phases. PCA missed one minor mineral phase in the chalcopyrite ore sample and did not clearly differentiate among the mineral classes of the basalt. K-Means cluster analysis differentiated among the various mineral phases in both samples, but improperly grouped some spectra in the chalcopyrite sample that only contained unanticipated high mass peaks. Unlike the chemometric methods, FLIE was able to classify spectra as unknowns for those spectra that fell below the confidence level threshold. A nearest neighbor approach, included in FLIE, was used to classify the unknowns to form a visually complete image; however, the unknowns identified by FLIE can be informative because they highlight potential problems or overlooked results. In conclusion, this study validated the fuzzy logic-based approach used in our laboratory and reveald some limitations in the three techniques that were evaluated. 0 (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast, previous algorithms use either top-down or bottom-up methods to construct a hierarchical clustering or produce a flat clustering using local search ( e. g., k-means). For the divide phase, which produces a tree whose leaves are the elements of the set, we suggest an efficient spectral algorithm. When the data is in the form of a sparse document-term matrix, we show how to modify the algorithm so that it maintains sparsity and runs in linear space. The merge phase quickly finds the optimal partition that respects the tree for many natural objective functions, for example, k-means, min-diameter, min-sum, correlation clustering, etc. We present a thorough experimental evaluation of the methodology. We describe the implementation of a meta-search engine that uses this methodology to cluster results from web searches. We also give comparative empirical results on several real datasets.

A chemical space is a structurally diverse representation of a molecular database and contains regions of drugs having the same activity. Algorithms based on neural network systems or statistical multivariate data analyses have been used for clustering molecular data and mapping multidimensional information into lower level. We used a tree-structured self-organizing map (TS-SOM) technique to construct a chemical space of orally active compounds. In addition to the TS-SOM, other methods namely k-means and Sammon's mapping were used for clustering data. As a mapping result of the TS-SOM there are unrelated regions where well and poorly soluble and permeable drugs are mostly situated. Thus, it is possible to determine the regions where orally active drugs are located in respect to BCS, the biopharmaceutical classification system. The results of our study suggests that the properties related to the permeability and the solubility behaviour of drugs, such as molecular weight and the balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions of the molecules, to be the most important feature in classifying the results of the TS-SOM. Moreover, the TS-SOM is proved to be an efficient tool for mapping high dimensional data into lower dimensions according to the properties of underlying data. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In the associated data analysis, a data array is approximated by a model array that can be represented by a three-mode partitioning model of a prespecified rank, minimizing a least squares loss function in terms of differences between data and model. Algorithms have been proposed for this minimization, but their performance is not yet clear. A framework for alternating least-squares methods is described in order to offset the performance problem. Furthermore, a number of both existing and novel algorithms are discussed within this framework. An extensive simulation study is reported in which these algorithms are evaluated and compared according to sensitivity to local optima. The recovery of the truth underlying the data is investigated in order to assess the optimal estimates. The ordering of the algorithms with respect to performance in finding the optimal solution appears to change as compared to the results obtained from the simulation study when a collection of four empirical data sets have been used. This finding is attributed to violations of the implicit stochastic model underlying both the least-squares loss function and the simulation study. Support for the latter attribution is found in a second simulation study. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

One possible principle is that complex networks are formed by similar behavior of their nodes. So K-means clustering, which is such a method to cluster objects by some measure of similarity, is used to construct the networks. The resulting networks are woven by all clustering paths and every clustering path is generated by following its cluster's centroid. The experiments results of the resulting networks show properties of small world networks including small average distance and the clustering effect. Moreover the constructing process has also shown the evolution behaviors.

It is drawn by assigning the data dimension to the facial feature. Each face is human like and the user identifies the clusters from the faces. To improve the shortcomings of Chernoff faces clustering, we present a simple and efficient implementation of Chernoff faces with the integration of principle component analysis (PCA) and k-means algorithm. The two-stage procedure - first using k-means algorithm to produce the cluster prototypes that are then used to reclassify all data or the partial special data using the improved Chernoff faces based on PCA - is found to reduce the subjective judgment time of classify data and to perform wed when compared with Chernoff faces clustering.

This network's structure is different from the conventional ellipsoidal unit neural network, but similar to the RBF neural network. In the new network, the ellipsoidal unit functions are used in the hidden layer, and the weights between the hidden nods and the output nods are all connected. A method of rough K-means is used for getting the centers of ellipsoidal basic functions and how to decide the threshold is given in the paper. The new neural network can not only make the partition of input space local, but also make it limitary and bounded.

K-means algorithm based on particle swarm optimization for web document clustering	DYNAMICS OF CONTINUOUS DISCRETE AND IMPULSIVE SYSTEMS-SERIES B-APPLICATIONS & ALGORITHMS			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Sensing, Computing and Automation	MAY 08-11, 2006	Chongqing, PEOPLES R CHINA					K-means as a clustering algorithm has been studied in Web document clustering. However, with the deficiency of global search ability it is not satisfactory. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is one of the evolutionary computation techniques based on swarm intelligence, which has high global search ability. So K-means algorithm based on PSO (PSO-KM) was proposed in this paper. The vector space model (VSM) was employed to represent the documents, and Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format was implemented to store the data. Computational experiments were conducted to test the performance of the hybrid algorithm using three web document datasets. The F-measure and the entropy were adopted to evaluate the quality of clustering. The results were compared with that of K-means algorithm and that of K-means algorithm based on genetic algorithm (GA-KM), which show that the quality of the clustering solutions obtained from PSO-KM is better than that from K-means or GA-KM. The run time of PSO-KM is less than that of GA-KM algorithm.

This paper used hidden semi-Markov model to categorize the Web pages in an unsupervised manner. A new parameter re-estimation algorithm based on segmental K-means algorithm was derived for the model which was used to implement the application-layer distributed denial of service attacks detection for large-scale Web server. Likelihood of observation sequence on user browsing behaviors fitting to the model was used as a measure of user's normality. Finally, an experiment was conducted to validate our model and algorithm, which was based on a set of data colleted from a real traffic data of a heavily-accessed Web server and an emulated distributed denial of service attack that launches flooding of HTTP requests to the Web site.

Spatially constrained clustering and upper level set scan hotspot detection in surveillance geoinformatics	ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS			English	Article						hotspot detection; multivariate scan by spatial coincidence; spatially constrained clustering; surveillance geoinformatics; upper level set scan statistic		We discuss upper level set (ULS) scan as a type of spatially constrained clustering in relation to two ways of imposing the spatial constraint, retrospectively versus progressively. We show that ULS scan produces the same results both ways; whereas two popular clustering techniques, single-linkage and K-means, can yield different results when spatial constraints are imposed retrospectively versus progressively. The ULS scan approach examines spatially connected components of a tessellation as a threshold is moved from the highest level (value) in the data to the lowest level. When the variable of interest on the tessellation is a rate of incidence, then a significance test is available based on binomial or Poisson null models and Monte Carlo techniques. This is a common context for detecting hotspots of diseases in epidemiological work. We also discuss an approach for extending the univariate methodology to accommodate multivariate contexts.

For this task, we developed a methodology taking as input multi-word terms and lexico-syntactic relations between them. Our clustering algorithm, named CPCL is implemented in the Term-Watch system. We compared CPCL to other existing clustering algorithms, namely hierarchical and partitioning (k-means, k-medoids). This out-of-context clustering task led us to adapt multi-word term representation for statistical methods and also to refine an existing cluster evaluation metric, the editing distance in order to evaluate the methods. Evaluation was carried out on a list of multi-word terms from the genomic field which comes with a hand built taxonomy. Results showed that while k-means and k-medoids obtained good scores on the editing distance, they were very sensitive to term length. CPCL on the other hand obtained a better cluster homogeneity score and was less sensitive to term length. Also, CPCL showed good adaptability for handling very large and sparse matrices.

They characterize hundreds of thousands or millions of particles, generating vast amounts of rich and complex data, the proper mining of which requires dedicated state of the art tools. The analysis of individual particle mass spectra is particularly difficult because of their high dimensionality-each data point, representing a single particle, includes the 450 mass spectral peak intensities, particle size, and time of detection. The first step is to organize the data; a process typically accomplished by grouping particles of similar attributes. Since the common assumption is that the data should be reduced to become manageable, they are typically classified into a small number of clusters (similar to 10), each of which is represented by an average/representative spectrum. Our approach is quite different. We have developed a data mining and visualization software package we call SpectraMiner that makes it possible to handle hundreds of clusters, limiting loss of information and thus overcoming the boundaries set by traditional statistical data analysis approaches. Data, which often include over 1 million particle spectra, are organized using K-mean clustering algorithm. The clusters are merged into nodes by sequentially combining similar clusters. The final structure is displayed in a hierarchical dynamical tree or circular dendogram. This interactive dendogram is the visual interface that allows for real-time data exploration and mining. Clicking on any of the clusters/nodes in the dendogram reveals the detailed information about the particles that reside at that position. At each step the scientist is in control of the level of detail and the visualization format, rapidly switching between them while running the program on a PC. Here we present a study that puts the classification aspect of SpectraMiner to the test. Twelve types of laboratory generated particles are carefully chosen to test some of the difficult aspects of single particle mass spectroscopy. We quantify the degree of particle identification and separation at a number of levels and demonstrate how the visualization tools that SpectraMiner provides can be used to refine, steer and control the data mining process.

Laboratory experiments showed the spectral response of both instruments for mineral particles before and after heterogeneous reactions. During a period of 47 h, both instruments determined size and chemical composition of several thousand single particles of an ambient particle population. Time-resolved evaluation (1-h resolution) of specific ion signals, which showed a characteristic temporal evolution, in combination with meteorological information, was used to select four periods for separate evaluation of particle spectra. Application of the two particle classification algorithms, fuzzy c-means clustering and k-means clustering, on the same data set (SPASS) showed only minor differences in spectral patterns and class abundances caused by the clustering method ("soft" or "hard" clustering). Spectral patterns determined for the data sets of two instruments (SPASS and LAMPAS 2) were similar for some particle types and could be compared directly (e.g., mineral or carbonaceous particles). For other types of particles, spectral patterns differed from each other and had to be interpreted using additional information on instrumental parameters (e.g., laser wavelengths or irradiance) and experimental conditions. The different response of SPASS and LAMPAS 2, as reflected in the different abundances of particle classes, indicates the necessity to determine adjustment factors for each instrument, for different particle classes, to enable a direct comparison of quantitative information from such online aerosol mass spectrometers and from bulk analysis. The reported results are an important basis for a general database of single particle spectra, spectral patterns of common and specific particle classes and abundances of these classes for atmospheric aerosols, showing their dependence on particle size, geographic location, meteorological conditions and time of analysis.

The authors describe 3 clustering techniques that can be used to improve the selection of active compounds (i.e., hits). They are designed to identify quality hits in the observed HTS measurements. The considered clustering techniques were first tested on simulated data and then applied to analyze the assay inhibiting Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase produced at the HTS laboratory of McMaster University.

J	Xia, HX; Wang, SG; Yoshida, T				Xia, Haoxiang; Wang, Shuguang; Yoshida, Taketoshi			A MODIFIED ANT-BASED TEXT CLUSTERING ALGORITHM WITH SEMANTIC SIMILARITY MEASURE	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING			English	Article						Ant-based clustering; text clustering; ant movement rule; semantic similarity measure		Ant-based text clustering is a promising technique that has attracted great research attention. This paper attempts to improve the standard ant-based text-clustering algorithm in two dimensions. On one hand, the ontology-based semantic similarity measure is used in conjunction with the traditional vector-space-model-based measure to provide more accurate assessment of the similarity between documents. On the other, the ant behavior model is modified to pursue better algorithmic performance. Especially, the ant movement rule is adjusted so as to direct a laden ant toward a dense area of the same type of items as the ant's carrying item, and to direct an unladen ant toward an area that contains an item dissimilar with the surrounding items within its Moore neighborhood. Using WordNet as the base ontology for assessing the semantic similarity between documents, the proposed algorithm is tested with a sample set of documents excerpted from the Reuters-21578 corpus and the experiment results partly indicate that the proposed algorithm perform better than the standard ant-based text-clustering algorithm and the k-means algorithm.

A main task now is to propose analytical methods to identify groups of genes that manifest similar expression patterns and are activated by similar conditions. The corresponding analysis problem is to cluster multi-condition gene expression data. The purpose of this paper is to present a general view of clustering techniques used in microarray gene expression data analysis.

Its populations adapt to a whole range of different micro-habitats with inter- and intra-population variability. Genetic variability research for individual tree species, including Pedunculate Oak, is conducted through provenance trials. Materials and Methods: During the Pedunculate Oak provenance trial, the tree biomass was analyzed on the basis of 5 variables (stein weight, live branches, dry branches, leaves, roots). Through cluster analysis (hierarchy and k-means), Pedunculate Oak provenances were grouped and differences in monitored features between resulting clusters were analyzed using univariate and multivariate vanriance analysis. Results: Results show that the inclusion of individual provenances into clusters was adequate in both the hierarchy and non-hierarchy procedure (4in total). Cluster 1 (Vrbanja) showed the highest values for all analyzed features except the dry branch, which indicates that the process of branch dying and stem cleaning in this provenance has not yet started. Cluster 3 (Motovun, Dubica, Skakavac, Gusevac, Morovic, V.Gorica) showed the lowest values for all analyzed features except the dry branches. Clusters 2 (Orlovac, Spacva, Zdenacki Gaj, Kljucevi, Novska, Gunja, Lipovljani) and 4 (Okucani and Durdenovac) showed very similar results for every feature except the dry branches, with cluster 4 having statistically significantly higher value than cluster 2 although they are geographically relatively close. Conclusions: Clusters do not follow geographic links, therefore we assume genetic connectedness. Vrbanja provenances (cluster 1) showed the greatest biomass production for all variables, except dry branches. The lowest biomass production was rcorded for Motovun and Dubica provenances (cluster 3). The feature pertaining to leaves was relatively in line with micro-habitat conditions.

Ionization cluster size distribution for alpha particles: Experiment, modelling	RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	14th International Symposium on Microdosimetry	NOV 13-18, 2005	Venezia-Isola di San Servo, ITALY	INFN Lab Nazl Legnaro, Legnaro Padova, INFN Sezione Pavia, Univ Pavia Dipartimento Fis Nucl Teor, NASA Johnson Space Ctr, CERN, Med Res Council				The paper presents data for measured ionization cluster size distributions by alpha particles in tissue equivalent media and comparison with the simulated data for liquid water. The experiments were carried out with a beam of 4.6 MeV alpha particles performed in a setup called the JET Counter. The theoretically derived cluster size distributions for alphas particles were obtained using the K-means algorithm. The simulation was carried out by Monte Carlo track structure calculations using cross sections for liquid water. The first moments of cluster size distributions, derived from K-means algorithm as a function of diameter of cluster centroid, were compared with the corresponding moments derived from the experiments for nitrogen and propane targets. It was found that the ratio of the first moments for water to gas targets correlates well with the corresponding ratio of the mean free paths for primary ionization by alpha particles in the two media. It is shown that the cluster size distributions for alpha particles in water, obtained from K-means algorithm, are in agreement with the corresponding distributions measured experimentally in nitrogen or propane gas targets of nanometer sizes.

QSPR of the bioconcentration factors of non-ionic organic compounds in fish using extended topochemical atom (ETA) indices	SAR AND QSAR IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						QSAR; QSPR; ETA; topological indices; bioconcentration factor	FUNCTIONAL ACYCLIC COMPOUNDS; MOLECULAR CONNECTIVITY INDEXES; TAU-INDEXES; ACUTE TOXICITY; PHENYLSULFONYL CARBOXYLATES; THERMOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; SUBSTITUTED BENZENES; COMPARATIVE QSAR; PART I; LOG P	Bioconcentration refers to the absorption or uptake of a chemical from the media to an organism's tissues leading to greater concentration in tissues than that in the surrounding environment. Considering the importance of bioconcentration from the viewpoint of ecological safety assessment, a QSPR study was conducted based upon log BCF of 122 non-ionic organic compounds in fish using the recently introduced extended topochemical atom (ETA) indices. In deriving the models, principal component factor analysis (FA) followed by multiple linear regression (MLR), stepwise regression, partial least squares (PLS) and principal component regression analysis (PCRA) were applied as statistical tools. This was repeated with non-ETA (topological and physicochemical) descriptors and a combination set including both the ETA and non-ETA descriptors. The ETA indices suggested negative contributions of functionalities of nitro, amino and hydroxy substructures and positive contributions of branching, volume and functionality of chloro substituents. Again, the predictive ability of the developed models was compared with the previously reported models. Finally the validation of all the QSAR models was discussed based on random division, sorted logBCF data and K-means clusters for the factor scores of the original variable (ETA) matrix without the response property values. The results suggest that ETA parameters are sufficiently rich in chemical information to encode the structural features contributing to the bioconcentration of the non-ionic organic compounds in fish and thus these merit further assessment to explore their potential in QSAR/QSPR/QSTR modelling.

Cluster analysis as a method for determining size ranges for spinal implants: Disc lumbar replacement prosthesis dimensions from magnetic resonance images	SPINE			English	Article						cluster analysis; disc replacement; implant sizes; spinal implants	NUCLEUS PULPOSUS; INTERVERTEBRAL DISKS; PREDICTION; DEGENERATION	Study Design. Statistical analysis of clinical radiologic data. Objective. To develop an objective method for finding the number of sizes for a lumbar disc replacement. Summary of Background Data. Cluster analysis is a well-established technique for sorting observations into clusters so that the "similarity level" is maximal if they belong to the same cluster and minimal otherwise. Methods. Magnetic resonance scans from 69 patients, with no abnormal discs, yielded 206 sagittal and transverse images of 206 discs (levels L3 - L4 - L5 - S1). Anteroposterior and lateral dimensions were measured from vertebral margins on transverse images; disc heights were measured from sagittal images. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to determine the number of clusters followed by nonhierarchical (K-means) cluster analysis. Discriminant analysis was used to determine how well the clusters could be used to classify an observation. Results. The most successful method of clustering the data involved the following parameters: anteroposterior dimension; lateral dimension (both were the mean of results from the superior and inferior margins of a vertebral body, measured on transverse images); and maximum disc height (from a midsagittal image). These were grouped into 7 clusters so that a discriminant analysis was capable of correctly classifying 97.1% of the observations. The mean and standard deviations for the parameter values in each cluster were determined. Conclusions. Cluster analysis has been successfully used to find the dimensions of the minimum number of prosthesis sizes required to replace L3 - L4 to L5 - S1 discs; the range of sizes would enable them to be used at higher lumbar levels in some patients.

J	Bocker, A; Schneider, G; Teckentrup, A				Boecker, Alexander; Schneider, Gisbert; Teckentrup, Andreas			NIPALSTREE: A new hierarchical clustering approach for large compound libraries and its application to virtual screening	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							SHANNON ENTROPY; SELECTION; DESIGN; DESCRIPTORS; INFORMATION; FINGERPRINT; DISCOVERY; SETS	A hierarchical clustering algorithm - NIPALSTREE - was developed that is able to analyze large data sets in high-dimensional space. The result can be displayed as a dendrogram. At each tree level the algorithm projects a data set via principle component analysis onto one dimension. The data set is sorted according to this one dimension and split at the median position. To avoid distortion of clusters at the median position, the algorithm identifies a potentially more suited split point left or right of the median. The procedure is recursively applied on the resulting subsets until the maximal distance between cluster members exceeds a user-defined threshold. The approach was validated in a retrospective screening study for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The resulting clusters were assessed for their purity and enrichment in actives belonging to this ligand class. Enrichment was observed in individual branches of the dendrogram. In further retrospective virtual screening studies employing the MDL Drug Data Report (MDDR), COBRA, and the SPECS catalog, NIPALSTREE was compared with the hierarchical k-means clustering approach. Results show that both algorithms can be used in the context of virtual screening. Intersecting the result lists obtained with both algorithms improved enrichment factors while losing only few chemotypes.

A cluster-based strategy for assessing the overlap between large chemical libraries and its application to a recent acquisition	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE COMPOUNDS; MOLECULAR DIVERSITY; COMPOUND SELECTION; DRUG DISCOVERY; DATABASE; SUBSTRUCTURES; SYSTEM	We report on the structural comparison of the corporate collections of Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development (JNJPRD) and 3-Dimensional Pharmaceuticals (3DP), performed in the context of the recent acquisition of 3DP by JNJPRD. The main objective of the study was to assess the druglikeness of the 3DP library and the extent to which it enriched the chemical diversity of the JNJPRD corporate collection. The two databases, at the time of acquisition, collectively contained more than 1.1 million compounds with a clearly defined structural description. The analysis was based on a clustering approach and aimed at providing an intuitive quantitative estimate and visual representation of this enrichment. A novel hierarchical clustering algorithm called divisive k-means was employed in combination with Kelley's cluster-level selection method to partition the combined data set into clusters, and the diversity contribution of each library was evaluated as a function of the relative occupancy of these clusters. Typical 3DP chemotypes enriching the diversity of the JNJPRD collection were catalogued and visualized using a modified maximum common substructure algorithm. The joint collection of JNJPRD and 3DP compounds was also compared to other databases of known medicinally active or druglike compounds. The potential of the methodology for the analysis of very large chemical databases is discussed.

A pulsational distance to omega Centauri based on near-infrared period-luminosity relations of RR Lyrae stars	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						distance scale; globular clusters : individual (omega Centauri); stars : evolution; stars : horizontal-branch; stars : oscillations; stars : variables : other	GALACTIC GLOBULAR-CLUSTERS; LARGE-MAGELLANIC-CLOUD; STELLAR EVOLUTION DATABASE; HUBBLE-SPACE-TELESCOPE; VARIABLE-STARS; POPULATION SYNTHESIS; HORIZONTAL-BRANCH; AGES EXPERIMENT; CALIBRATION; PHOTOMETRY	We present new near-infrared (J and K) magnitudes for 114 RR Lyrae stars in the globular cluster omega Centauri (NGC 5139), which we combine with data from the literature to construct a sample of 180 RR Lyrae stars with J and K mean magnitudes on a common photometric system. This is currently the largest such sample in any stellar system. We also present updated predictions for J- and K-band period-luminosity relations for both fundamental and first-overtone RR Lyrae stars, based on synthetic horizontal branch models with metal abundance ranging from Z = 0.0001 to 0.004. By adopting for the omega Cen variables with measured metal abundances an alpha-element enhancement of a factor of 3 (approximate to 0.5 dex) with respect to iron, we find a true distance modulus mu(0) = 13.70 +/- 0.06 +/- 0.06 ( random and systematic errors, respectively), corresponding to a distance d = 5.5 +/- 0.03 +/- 0.03 kpc. Our estimate is in excellent agreement with the distance inferred for the eclipsing binary OGLEGC 17, but differ significantly from the recent distance estimates based on cluster dynamics and on high-amplitude delta Scuti stars.

Such patterns arise through the elaboration of a network structure driven by the tidal forcing and through the interaction between hydrodynamical, geophysical and ecological components (chiefly vegetation). Intertidal morphological and ecological structures possess characteristic extent (order of kilometers) and small-scale features (down to tens of centimeters) which are not simultaneously accessible through field observations, thus making remote sensing a necessary observation tool. This paper describes a set of remote sensing observations from several satellite and airborne platforms, the collection of concurrent ground reference data and the vegetation distributions that may be inferred from them, with specific application to the Lagoon of Venice (Italy). The data set comprises ROSIS, CASI, MIVIS, IKONOS and QuickBird acquisitions, which cover a wide range of spatial and spectral resolutions. We show that spatially-detailed and quantitatively reliable vegetation maps may be derived from remote sensing in tidal environments through unsupervised (K-means) and supervised algorithms (Maximum Likelihood and Spectral Angle Mapper). We find that, for the objective of intertidal vegetation classification, hyperspectral data contain largely redundant information. This in particular implies that a reduction of the spectral features is required for the application of the Maximum Likelihood classifier. A large number of experiments with different feature extraction/selection algorithms show that the use of four bands derived from Maximum Noise Fraction transforms and four RGBI broad bands obtained by spectral averaging yield very similar classification performances. The classifications from hyperspectral data are somewhat superior to those from multispectral data, but the close performance and the results of the features reduction experiments show that spatial resolution affects classification accuracy much more importantly than spectral resolution. Monitoring schemes of tidal environment vegetation may thus be based on high-resolution satellite acquisitions accompanied by systematic ancillary field observations at a relatively limited number of reference sites, with practical consequences of some relevance.

Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol 291: L1027-L1037, 2006. First published June 23, 2006; doi:10.1152/ajplung.00435.2005.-Fetal lung development is a complex biological process that involves temporal and spatial regulations of many genes. To understand the molecular mechanisms of this process, we investigated gene expression profiles of fetal lungs on gestational days 18, 19, 20, and 21, as well as newborn and adult rat lungs. For this analysis, we used an in-house rat DNA microarray containing 6,000 known genes and 4,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Of these, 1,512 genes passed the statistical significance analysis of microarray (SAM) test; an at least twofold change was shown for 583 genes (402 known genes and 181 ESTs) between at least two time points. K-means cluster analysis revealed seven major expression patterns. In one of the clusters, gene expression increased from day 18 to day 20 and then decreased. In this cluster, which contained 10 known genes and 5 ESTs, 8 genes are associated with development. These genes can be integrated into regulatory pathways, including growth factors, plasma membrane receptors, adhesion molecules, intracellular signaling molecules, and transcription factors. Real-time PCR analysis of these 10 genes showed an 88% consistency with the microarray data. The mRNA of LIM homeodomain protein 3a (Lhx3), a transcription factor, was enriched in fetal type II cells. In contrast, pleiotrophin, a growth factor, had a much higher expression in fetal lung tissues than in fetal type II cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed that Lhx3 was localized in fetal lung epithelial cells and pleiotrophin in the mesenchymal cells adjacent to the developing epithelium and blood vessel. Using GenMAPP, we identified four regulatory pathways: transforming growth factor-beta signaling, inflammatory response, cell cycle, and G protein signaling. We also identified two metabolic pathways: glycolysis-gluconeogenesis and proteasome degradation. Our results may provide new insights into the complex regulatory pathways that control fetal lung development.

J.; Vlassis, Nikos			Accelerated EM-based clustering of large data sets	DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY			English	Article						Gaussian mixtures; EM algorithm; free energy; kd-trees; large data sets	DENSITY-ESTIMATION; ALGORITHM; MODELS; TREES	Motivated by the poor performance (linear complexity) of the EM algorithm in clustering large data sets, and inspired by the successful accelerated versions of related algorithms like k-means, we derive an accelerated variant of the EM algorithm for Gaussian mixtures that: (1) offers speedups that are at least linear in the number of data points, (2) ensures convergence by strictly increasing a lower bound on the data log-likelihood in each learning step, and (3) allows ample freedom in the design of other accelerated variants. We also derive a similar accelerated algorithm for greedy mixture learning, where very satisfactory results are obtained. The core idea is to define a lower bound on the data log-likelihood based on a grouping of data points. The bound is maximized by computing in turn (i) optimal assignments of groups of data points to the mixture components, and (ii) optimal re-estimation of the model parameters based on average sufficient statistics computed over groups of data points. The proposed method naturally generalizes to mixtures of other members of the exponential family. Experimental results show the potential of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art acceleration techniques.

Comparing SOM neural network with Fuzzy c-means, K-means and traditional hierarchical clustering algorithms	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						multivariate statistics; hierarchical clustering; SOM neural network; Fuzzy c-means; K-means	CLASSIFICATION	In this paper we present a comparison among some nonhierarchical and hierarchical clustering algorithms including SOM (Self-Organization Map) neural network and Fuzzy c-means methods. Data were simulated considering correlated and uncorrelated variables, nonoverlapping and overlapping clusters with and without outliers. A total of 2530 data sets were simulated. The results showed that Fuzzy c-means had a very good performance in all cases being very stable even in the presence of outliers and overlapping. All other clustering algorithms were very affected by the amount of overlapping and outliers. SOM neural network did not perform well in almost all cases being very affected by the number of variables and clusters. The traditional hierarchical clustering and K-means methods presented similar performance. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Evaluation of stability of k-means cluster ensembles with respect to random initialization	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						clustering; cluster ensembles; stability and diversity; cluster validity	ALGORITHMS	Many clustering algorithms, including cluster ensembles, rely on a random component. Stability of the results across different runs is considered to be an asset of the algorithm. The cluster ensembles considered here are based on k-means clusterers. Each clusterer is assigned a random target number of clusters, k and is started from a random initialization. Here, we use 10 artificial and 10 real data sets to study ensemble stability with respect to random k, and random initialization. The data sets were chosen to have a small number of clusters (two to seven) and a moderate number of data points (up to a few hundred). Pairwise stability is defined as the adjusted Rand index between pairs of clusterers in the ensemble, averaged across all pairs. Nonpairwise stability is defined as the entropy of the consensus matrix of the ensemble. An experimental comparison with the stability of the standard k-means algorithm was carried out for k from 2 to 20. The results revealed that ensembles are generally more stable, markedly so for larger k. To establish whether stability can serve as a cluster validity index, we first looked at the relationship between stability and accuracy with respect to the number of clusters, k. We found that such a relationship strongly depends on the data set, varying from almost perfect positive correlation (0.97, for the glass data) to almost perfect negative correlation (-0.93, for the crabs data). We propose a new combined stability index to be the sum of the pairwise individual and ensemble stabilities. This index was found to correlate better with the ensemble accuracy. Following the hypothesis that a point of stability of a clustering algorithm corresponds to a structure found in the data, we used the stability measures to pick the number of clusters. The combined stability index gave best results.

J	Aharon, M; Elad, M; Bruckstein, A				Aharon, Michal; Elad, Michael; Bruckstein, Alfred			K-SVD: An algorithm for designing overcomplete dictionaries for sparse representation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						atom decomposition; basis pursuit; codebook; dictionary; FOCUSS; gain-shape VQ; K-means; K-SVD; matching pursuit; sparse representation; training; vector quantization	BASES; IDENTIFICATION; MINIMIZATION; SELECTION	In recent years there has been a growing interest in the study of sparse representation of signals. Using an over-complete dictionary that contains prototype signal-atoms, signals are described by sparse linear combinations of these atoms. Applications that use sparse representation are many and include compression, regularization in inverse problems, feature extraction, and more. Recent activity in this field has concentrated mainly on the study of pursuit algorithms that decompose signals with respect to a given dictionary. Designing dictionaries to better fit the above model can be done by either selecting one from a prespecified set of linear transforms or adapting the dictionary to a set of training signals. Both of these techniques have been considered, but this topic is largely still open. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for adapting dictionaries in order to achieve sparse signal representations. Given a set of training signals, we seek the dictionary that leads to the best representation for each member in this set, under strict sparsity constraints. We present a new method-the K-SVD algorithm-generalizing the K-means clustering process. K-SVD is an iterative method that alternates between sparse coding of the examples based on the current dictionary and a process of updating the dictionary atoms to better fit the data. The update of the dictionary columns is combined with an update of the sparse representations, thereby accelerating convergence. The K-SVD algorithm is flexible and can work with any pursuit method (e.g., basis pursuit, FOCUSS, or matching pursuit). We analyze this algorithm and demonstrate its results both on synthetic tests and in applications on real image data.

The Taguchi method is used to experiment with electrodes of the same size and different shapes, based on key factors acquired under the consideration of the interaction between factors, and analyze the experimental results respectively with average values and S/N ratio. Eventually, the research will determine and calculate the best combination of factors of each quality property (machining and reaming amount, surface roughness, electrode corner loss, and material removal rate (MRR)) by analyzing predicated values and prove it with experimental data. The experiment proves that the interaction between factors really exists and that the best combination of factors acquired has favorable effects and credibility.

J	Lim, KL; Fam, HB				Lim, Kooi-Ling; Fam, Han-Bor			Relationship between the corneal surface and the anterior segment of the cornea: An Asian perspective	JOURNAL OF CATARACT AND REFRACTIVE SURGERY			English	Article							IN-SITU KERATOMILEUSIS; II TOPOGRAPHY SYSTEM; ORBSCAN-II; PHOTOREFRACTIVE KERATECTOMY; CHAMBER DEPTH; CURVATURE; DIAMETER; KERATOCONUS; CHILDREN; RADIUS	PURPOSE: To determine the values for the anterior best-fit sphere (BFS) and posterior BFS in an Asian population using the Orbscan II (Bausch & Lomb) slit-scanning Placido disk corneal topographer. SETTING: Hospital-based refractive surgery center. METHODS: This prospective nonrandomized study comprised of 1 eye of 724 subjects. The eyes were measured with the Orbscan II. Default settings were used to generate relative elevation maps. Anterior BFS, posterior BFS, mean keratometry (K-mean), spherical equivalent (SE), horizontal white-to-white size (WTW), and anterior chamber depth (ACD) were analyzed. RESULTS: The mean spherical equivalent (SE) in the 724 eyes was -5.32 diopters (D) +/- 2.88 (SD). The anterior BFS and posterior BFS were normally distributed, with a mean of 43.05 +/- 1.37 D and 52.43 +/- 2.03 D, respectively. The regression equation of anterior BFS and posterior BFS was posterior BFS = 0.443 + 1.208 anterior BFS (r(2) = 0.667, P<.01). The ratio of posterior BFS to anterior BFS was 1.22 +/- 0.03. The anterior BFS was significantly correlated to posterior BFS (P<.01), K-mean (P<.01), and horizontal WTW (P<.01) but not to SE (P =.28). The posterior BFS was significantly correlated to K-mean (P<.01) and the horizontal WTW (P<.01) but not to SE (P =.70). CONCLUSION: There was a close relationship between the various corneal parameters, which is significant in refractive surgery and intraocular lens calculation and design.

A rule-based risk decision-making approach and its application in China's customs inspection decision	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						risk decision-making; logistic regression; cluster analysis; optimization; customs inspection	K-MEANS ALGORITHM; LARGE DATA SETS; CLUSTERING-ALGORITHM; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; EXPECTED UTILITY; SYSTEMS; SUPPORT	This paper addresses a kind of risk decision-making problem existing widely in public administration and business management, which is characterized by ( 1) occurrence probabilities of states of nature can be estimated by analysing historical observations, but historical observations of different objects are unhomogeneous, ( 2) the relation between observations and occurrence probabilities of states of nature are affected by some qualitative and quantitative indicators, ( 3) it is a real-time decision-making problem, that is, there are many decisions for different objects to be made in a limited time, ( 4) considering decision's execution, impact of resource constrains is an important issue in decision-making process. In this paper, we develop a rule-based approach to address the problem. In the proposed approach, a two-step clustering method is employed to classify objects into categories, and observations in each category can be approximately viewed as homogeneous. For objects in each category, occurrence probabilities of states of nature are estimated by logistic regression, and the decision rule is obtained through solving an optimization model, which is to minimize the total decision risks while satisfying resource constrains. Effect and efficacy of our approach are illustrated through its application to China's customs inspection decision.

J	Das, P; Bhattacharyay, BK; Datta, S				Das, Prasun; Bhattacharyay, Bidyut Kumar; Datta, Shubhabrata			A comparative study for modeling of hot-rolled steel plate classification using a statistical approach and neural-net systems	MATERIALS AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES			English	Article						back-propagation; CART; classification; hot-rolled steel; K-means; LDA; LM; LVQ; MSE; PAM; perceptron; PNN; RBF; SCG; SOM	DISCRIMINANT-ANALYSIS; NETWORKS	Classification of. at steel products from the point of view of reaching the target property is a common practice in industries. In most classification problems, standard statistical methods generally place constraints such as continuous, differentiable, otherwise well behaved, etc. However, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) has an ability to learn and generalize any complex system without making any model assumptions. This work emphasizes on making performance evaluation of usual statistical techniques such as general clustering like K-means, partition around medoid (PAM), classification and regression tree (CART), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) vis-a-vis usage of multilayer perceptron (MLP) learning algorithm, radial basis function (RBF) family of methods and Kohonen networks. To recommend the utility of modeling, some real-life industrial databases are used. It can be observed from the results that learning of networks through back-propagation yielded minimum misclassification of two groups of heats including minimization of train-test error. The statistical techniques such as LDA and CART provide the same results of misclassification along with the results obtained from perceptron learning, RBF network algorithm and Kohonen learning with learning-vector quantization (LVQ) algorithm.

Expression profiling of chickpea genes differentially regulated during a resistance response to Ascochyta rabiei	PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						ascochyta blight; chickpea; expressed sequence tag (EST); genomics; microarray	CICER-ARIETINUM L.; PLANT-DISEASE RESISTANCE; BLIGHT DEFENSE GENES; PATHOGEN INTERACTIONS; MICROARRAY DATA; INFECTION; IDENTIFICATION; RECOGNITION; ARABIDOPSIS; INHERITANCE	Using microarray technology and a set of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) unigenes, grasspea (Lathyrus sativus L.) expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and lentil (Lens culinaris Med.) resistance gene analogues, the ascochyta blight (Ascochyta rabiei (Pass.) L.) resistance response was studied in four chickpea genotypes, including resistant, moderately resistant, susceptible and wild relative (Cicer echinospermum L.) genotypes. The experimental system minimized environmental effects and was conducted in reference design, in which samples from mock-inoculated controls acted as reference against post-inoculation samples. Robust data quality was achieved through the use of three biological replicates (including a dye swap), the inclusion of negative controls and strict selection criteria for differentially expressed genes, including a fold change cut-off determined by self-self hybridizations, Student's t-test and multiple testing correction (P < 0.05). Microarray observations were also validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The time course expression patterns of 756 microarray features resulted in the differential expression of 97 genes in at least one genotype at one time point. k-means clustering grouped the genes into clusters of similar observations for each genotype, and comparisons between A. rabiei-resistant and A. rabiei-susceptible genotypes revealed potential gene 'signatures' predictive of effective A. rabiei resistance. These genes included several pathogenesis-related proteins, SNAKIN2 antimicrobial peptide, proline-rich protein, disease resistance response protein DRRG49-C, environmental stress-inducible protein, leucine-zipper protein, polymorphic antigen membrane protein, Ca-binding protein and several unknown proteins. The potential involvement of these genes and their pathways of induction are discussed. This study represents the first large-scale gene expression profiling in chickpea, and future work will focus on the functional validation of the genes of interest.

J	Bollen, J; de Sompel, HV				Bollen, Johan; de Sompel, Herbert Van			Mapping the structure of science through usage	SCIENTOMETRICS			English	Article							SOCIAL DESIRABILITY BIAS; SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE; COMBINED COCITATION; PUBLICATION DELAYS; DIGITAL LIBRARY; WORD ANALYSIS; CITATION; IMPACT; NETWORKS; JOURNALS	Science has traditionally been mapped on the basis of authorship and citation data. Due to publication and citation delays such data represents the structure of science as it existed in the past. We propose to map science by proxy of journal relationships derived from usage data to determine research trends as they presently occur. This mapping is performed by applying a principal components analysis superimposed with a k-means cluster analysis on networks of journal relationships derived from a large set of article usage data collected for the Los Alamos National Laboratory research community. Results indicate that meaningful maps of the interests of a local scientific community can be derived from usage data. Subject groupings in the mappings corresponds to Thomson ISI subject categories. A comparison to maps resulting from the analysis of 2003 Thomson ISI Journal Citation Report data reveals interesting differences between the features of local usage and global citation data.

Universality of color names	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						basic color terms; cluster analysis; color naming; concordance; World Color Survey	SUNLIGHT; CATEGORIES; GRUE; EYE	We analyzed the World Color Survey (WCS) color-naming data set by using k-means cluster and concordance analyses. Cluster analysis relied on a similarity metric based on pairwise Pearson correlation of the complete chromatic color-naming patterns obtained from individual WCS informants. When K, the number of k-means clusters, varied from 2 to 10, we found that (i) the average color-naming patterns of the clusters all glossed easily to single or composite English patterns, and (it) the structures of the k-means clusters unfolded in a hierarchical way that was reminiscent of the Berlin and Kay sequence of color category evolution. Gap statistical analysis showed that 8 was the optimal number of WCS chromatic categories: RED, GREEN, YELLOW-OR-ORANGE, BLUE, PURPLE, BROWN, PINK, and GRUE (GREEN-OR-BLUE). Analysis of concordance in color naming within WCS languages revealed small regions in color space that exhibited statistically significantly high concordance across languages. These regions agreed well with five of six primary focal colors of English. Concordance analysis also revealed boundary regions of statistically significantly low concordance. These boundary regions coincided with the boundaries associated with English WARM and COOL. Our results provide compelling evidence for similarities in the mechanisms that guide the lexical partitioning of color space among WCS languages and English.

General principles	GEOMORPHOLOGY			English	Article						rapid hazard assessment; abrupt mass movement hazard; zonation approach; clustering	LANDSLIDE HAZARD; HIMALAYAS; VALLEY; MODELS; SCALE	Hazards caused by mass movement cost many human lives and cause severe damage to property. Accurate zonation of such hazards provides an important tool for preventive measures. Previous approaches for mass movement hazard zonation are costly because they require large amounts of data, time and labor, and are only applicable to specific local areas. In this paper, a Rapid Zonation of Abrupt Mass-movement Hazard (RZAMH), applicable to large regions, is proposed. It involves the selection of appropriate zonation principles, routes, units, and indexes that can be used for the classification of reference groups, identification of matching groups of test sites, evaluation of blank test sites, and coalescence of sub-regions into specified zonation areas. The K-means clustering method is used in the classification processes. The applicability of the RZAMH approach to a large area implies that the number of reference sites required to build the reference groups is not of primary importance as long as the reference sites are representative. Therefore, for large areas, the RZAMH approach would be more economical than other conventional methods. The RZAMH approach is probably applicable to all abrupt mass movement hazards including rock falls, landslides, and debris flows. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Whenever uncertainty exists, simulation can be used as a model. Simulation is very flexible, although it can involve significant levels of computation. This article discusses fuzzy decision-making using the grey related analysis method. Fuzzy models are expected to better reflect decision-making uncertainty, at some cost in accuracy relative to crisp models. Monte Carlo simulation is used to incorporate experimental levels of uncertainty into the data and to measure the impact of fuzzy decision tree models using categorical data. Results are compared with decision tree models based on crisp continuous data.

J	Moreno, D; Marco, P; Olmeda, I				Moreno, David; Marco, Paulina; Olmeda, Ignacio			Self-organizing maps could improve the classification of Spanish mutual funds	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						finance; mutual funds; clustering; self-organizing map (SOM); investment analysis	PERFORMANCE; PERSISTENCE	In this paper, we apply nonlinear techniques (Self-Organizing Maps, k-nearest neighbors and the k-means algorithm) to evaluate the official Spanish mutual funds classification. The methodology that we propose allows us to identify which mutual funds are misclassified in the sense that they have historical performances which do not conform to the investment objectives established in their official category. According to this, we conclude that, on average, over 40% of mutual funds could be misclassified. Then, we propose an alternative classification, based on a double-step methodology, and we find that it achieves a significantly lower rate of misclassifications. The portfolios obtained from this alternative classification also attain better performances in terms of return/risk and include a smaller number of assets. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

TnSNPV transcription is temporally regulated and divided into three promoter sequence-dependent classes (early, late and very late genes). A viral oligonucleotide DNA microarray containing all potential (144) viral genes of TnSNPV was designed to investigate global viral gene expression during cell infection. Total BT1-Tn-5B1-4 cellular mRNAs extracted between 0 and 72 h posttransfection with TnSNPV genomic DNA were hybridized to the microarray. Initial average expression of early genes was detected between 12 and 24 h posttransfection while late genes were mainly detected between 24 and 72 h posttransfection. The microarray expression profiling data verified many computer predicted promoter assignments. K-means clustering was used to sort the 144 genes based on their temporal expression pattern similarities. This clustering resulted in the confirmation and temporal class assignment of previously unidentified genes and promoters. Crown Copyright (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Types of fishing actions (tactics) are defined through catch composition on fourteen stocks. Types of fishing units (strategies) are defined according to the tactics they can use. These two typologies are built using the K Means method, a non hierarchical classification approach. As results, twelve tactics and six strategies are primarily identified. Using expert knowledge some fishing tactics are gathered and eight tactics and five strategies are finally considered and discussed with a presentation of the articulations between stocks, tactics and strategies.

Evaluation and comparison of gene clustering methods in microarray analysis	BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							EXPRESSION DATA; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; DNA MICROARRAYS; CELL-CYCLE; DATA SET; GENOME; PATTERNS; IDENTIFICATION; NORMALIZATION; VISUALIZATION	Motivation: Microarray technology has been widely applied in biological and clinical studies for simultaneous monitoring of gene expression in thousands of genes. Gene clustering analysis is found useful for discovering groups of correlated genes potentially co-regulated or associated to the disease or conditions under investigation. Many clustering methods including hierarchical clustering, K-means, PAM, SOM, mixture model-based clustering and tight clustering have been widely used in the literature. Yet no comprehensive comparative study has been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of these methods. Results: In this paper, six gene clustering methods are evaluated by simulated data from a hierarchical log-normal model with various degrees of perturbation as well as four real datasets. A weighted Rand index is proposed for measuring similarity of two clustering results with possible scattered genes (i.e. a set of noise genes not being clustered). Performance of the methods in the real data is assessed by a predictive accuracy analysis through verified gene annotations. Our results show that tight clustering and model-based clustering consistently outperform other clustering methods both in simulated and real data while hierarchical clustering and SOM perform among the worst. Our analysis provides deep insight to the complicated gene clustering problem of expression profile and serves as a practical guideline for routine microarray cluster analysis.

J	Wang, SJ; Liu, SS; Cao, WM; Xiao, XA				Wang Shoujue; Liu Singsing; Cao Wenming; Xiao Xiao			Cognitive models in biomimetic pattern cognition	CHINESE JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS			English	Article						cognitive models; manifold space; covering subset		We describe a new model which is based on the concept of cognizing theory. The method identifies subsets of the data which are embedded in arbitrary oriented lower dimensional space. We definite k-mean covering, and study its property. Covering subsets of points are repeatedly sampled to construct trial geometry space of various dimensions. The sampling corresponding to the feature space having the best cognition ability between a mode near zero and the rest is selected and the data points are partitioned on the basis of the best cognition ability. The repeated sampling then continues recursively on each block of the data. We propose this algorithm based on cognition models. The experimental results for face recognition demonstrate that the correct rejection rate of the test samples excluded in the classes of training samples is very high and effective.

An extended self-organizing map network for market segmentation - a telecommunication example	DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						SOM neural network; extended SOM network; factor analysis; K-means cluster analysis; market segmentation	NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; MODEL; STATE	Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM) network is an unsupervised learning neural network that maps an n-dimensional input data to a lower dimensional output map while maintaining the original topological relations. The extended SOM network further groups the nodes on the output map into a user specified number of clusters. In this research effort, we applied this extended version of SOM networks to a consumer data set from American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T). Results using the AT&T data indicate that the extended SOM network performs better than the two-step procedure that combines factor analysis and K-means cluster analysis in uncovering market segments.

Effects of variable attribute weights on landform classification	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS			English	Article						attribute; weights; sensitivity; landform classification; fuzzy k-means	FUZZY K-MEANS; DIGITAL ELEVATION; C-MEANS; TERRAIN; MODELS; PREDICTION; ELEMENTS; OBJECTS	This paper focuses on the attribute weight issue and advocates use of modifiable attribute weights in terrain-based environmental analysis and classification. A question was asked: 'How much will the result of a terrain-based environmental analysis be affected if the weights of used terrain attributes are changed?' The literature on landform classification and the fuzzy k-means method was reviewed in particular to help clarify the background and importance of this weight assignment issue. As an example, the effects of modifying attribute weights were evaluated for fuzzy k-means landform classification in a case study area. A total of 102 classifications were compared with each other and with a soil map, and comparison methods were specifically designed to evaluate the differences between these classifications. The results show that fuzzy k-means landform classification is sensitive to weight adjustments of adopted terrain attributes. The sensitivity is particularly high when the attribute weights started to be tuned away from the standard (i.e. uniform) weight of one. Better matching between landform classification and a soil map may be produced when attribute weights are tuned. In all, we advocate the widespread adoption of an exploratory attitude in assigning attribute weights for environmental analysis and classification. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Kim, J; Cai, WD; Feng, DG; Eberl, S				Kim, Jinman; Cai, Weidong; Feng, Dagan; Eberl, Stefan			Segmentation of VOI from multidimensional dynamic PET images by integrating spatial and temporal features	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						image segmentation; multivolume rendering; positron emission tomography (PET); quantitative evaluation	FUNCTIONAL BRAIN IMAGES; ANATOMIC STANDARDIZATION; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; VALIDATION; MODEL	Segmentation of multidimensional dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) images into volumes of interest (VOIs) exhibiting similar temporal behavior and spatial features is a challenging task due to inherently poor signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution. In this study, we propose VOI segmentation of dynamic PET images by utilizing both the three-dimensional (3-D) spatial and temporal domain information in a hybrid technique that integrates two independent segmentation techniques of cluster analysis and region growing. The proposed technique starts with a cluster analysis that partitions the image based on temporal similarities. The resulting temporal partitions, together with the 3-D spatial information are utilized in the region growing segmentation. The technique was evaluated with dynamic 2-[18F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose PET simulations and clinical studies of the human brain and compared with the k-means and fuzzy c-means cluster analysis segmentation methods. The quantitative evaluation with simulated images demonstrated that the proposed technique can segment the dynamic PET images into VOIs; of different kinetic structures and outperforms the cluster analysis approaches with notable improvements in the smoothness of the segmented VOIs with fewer disconnected or spurious segmentation clusters. In clinical studies, the hybrid technique was only superior to the other techniques in segmenting the white matter. In the gray matter segmentation, the other technique tended to perform slightly better than the hybrid technique, but the differences did not reach significance. The hybrid technique generally formed smoother VOIs with better separation of the background. Overall, the proposed technique demonstrated potential usefulness in the diagnosis and evaluation of dynamic PET neurological imaging studies.

A spectral method for clustering of rock discontinuity sets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES			English	Article						joint sets; K-means; orientation analysis	TRACE LENGTH; JOINT SETS; ALGORITHM; HOMOGENEITY; BOREHOLES; MASSES; USA	We demonstrate the use of a spectral clustering algorithm as a novel approach for the identification of rock discontinuity sets based on discontinuity orientations. We use the spectral clustering approach with a simple measure of similarity between normal unit vectors in spherical space that is specific to the clustering of rock discontinuity orientations. The performance of the algorithm is studied using benchmark test cases with data sets corresponding to real rock masses. The results show that the algorithm provides good clustering results, providing partitions that agree well with the results of several other clustering algorithms that are commonly used in rock engineering. Furthermore, we show an example case with data sets of discontinuity orientation compiled from the literature, in which the spectral clustering algorithm provides more natural partitions than the other algorithms considered. Additional advantages of the algorithm are that convergence is fast, and that it can be easily (and efficiently) implemented using popular software packages for numerical analysis.

J	Zhong, S				Zhong, Shi			Semi-supervised model-based document clustering: A comparative study	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						semi-supervised clustering; seeded clustering; constrained clustering; clustering with feedback; model-based clustering; deterministic annealing	EM ALGORITHM; CLASSIFICATION; RETRIEVAL	Semi-supervised learning has become an attractive methodology for improving classification models and is often viewed as using unlabeled data to aid supervised learning. However, it can also be viewed as using labeled data to help clustering, namely, semi-supervised clustering. Viewing semi-supervised learning from a clustering angle is useful in practical situations when the set of labels available in labeled data are not complete, i.e., unlabeled data contain new classes that are not present in labeled data. This paper analyzes several multinomial model-based semi-supervised document clustering methods under a principled model-based clustering framework. The framework naturally leads to a deterministic annealing extension of existing semi-supervised clustering approaches. We compare three (slightly) different semi-supervised approaches for clustering documents: Seeded damnl, Constrained damnl, and Feedback-based damnl, where damnl stands for multinomial model-based deterministic annealing algorithm. The first two are extensions of the seeded k-means and constrained k-means algorithms studied by Basu et al. (2002); the last one is motivated by Cohn et al. (2003). Through empirical experiments on text datasets, we show that: (a) deterministic annealing can often significantly improve the performance of semi-supervised clustering; (b) the constrained approach is the best when available labels are complete whereas the feedback-based approach excels when available labels are incomplete.

Can acidosis and hyperphosphataemia result in increased erythropoietin dosing in haemodialysis patients?	NEPHROLOGY			English	Article						acidosis; anaemia; erythropoietin; haemodialysis; oxygen dissociation; phosphorus	RECOMBINANT ERYTHROPOIETIN; INORGANIC PHOSPHATES; OXYGEN DISSOCIATION; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; UREMIC PATIENTS; ANEMIA; HEMOGLOBIN; RECEPTOR; DISEASE; EXPRESSION	Aim: To evaluate whether factors such as acidosis and hyperphosphataemia that might cause an increased oxygen delivery to tissues could result in increased dosing requirements for intravenous erythropoietin (EPO) administration given to haemodialysis patients. Methods: The clinical records of the patients seen at the Hypertension, Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplantation Clinic from December, 2004 through August, 2005 were reviewed to identify patients who had taken intravenous erythropoietin. Two-tailed, Pearson's correlation was performed to determine correlations between any of the parameters. Analysis of variance and stepwise regression for covariance were used to evaluate the relations of demographic and clinical characteristics and laboratory variables. Analysis of covariance and K means cluster analyses were also performed to examine linkage between variables. Kendall's Tau correlation was used for correlations of non-parametric data. Results: There was a significant direct or positive correlation at the 0.01 levels between dry weight, age, intact parathyroid hormone level (PTH), and serum phosphorus and EPO dose. There was an inverse or negative correlation at that level between the serum bicarbonate and urea reduction ratio (URR) with the EPO dose at the same level while there was a weaker correlation but direct correlation between the white blood count (WBC) and EPO dose. There was significant colinearity between serum phosphorus and PTH but serum phosphorus showed a more significant correlation with EPO overall. Stepwise regression analysis for covariance revealed that phosphorus remained significantly correlated with EPO resistance after the removal of the effect of PTH while PTH lost its significance after the effect of phosphorus was removed. Conclusion: Acidosis and hyperphosphataemia are associated with apparent increased erythropoietin dosing requirements. While this study did not evaluate the mechanism of such requirements and indeed many mechanisms might be possible, a rightward shift in the oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve resulting in down-regulation of erythropoietin receptors is considered consistent with the data and present knowledge.

The effect of different basis functions on a radial basis function network for time series prediction: A comparative study	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						radial basis function network; basis function; basis width	SELECTION	Many applications using radial basis function (RBF) networks for time series prediction utilise only one or two basis functions; the most popular being the Gaussian function. This function may not always be appropriate and the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the variation of test set error between six recognised basis functions. The tests were carried out on the Mackey-Glass chaotic time series, Box-Jenkins furnace data and flood prediction data sets for the Rivers Amber and Mole, UK. Each RBF network was trained using a two-stage approach, utilising the k-means clustering algorithm for the first stage and singular value decomposition for the second stage. For this type of network configuration the results indicate that the choice of basis function (and, where appropriate, basis width parameter) is data set dependent and evaluating all recognised basis functions suitable for RBF networks is advantageous.

Relaxational metric adaptation and its application to semi-supervised clustering and content-based image retrieval	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						distance metric; nonparametric method; semi-supervised clustering; constrained k-means; side information; pairwise similarity and dissimilarity; content-based image retrieval	NEAREST-NEIGHBOR CLASSIFICATION; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; MODELS	The performance of many supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms is very sensitive to the choice of an appropriate distance metric. Previous work in metric learning and adaptation has mostly been focused on classification tasks by making use of class label in, formation. In standard clustering tasks, however, class label information is not available. In order to adapt the metric to improve the clustering results, some background knowledge or side information is needed. One useful type of side information is in the form of pairwise similarity or dissimilarity information. Recently, some novel methods (e.g., the parametric method proposed by Xing et al.) for learning global metrics based on pairwise side information have been shown to demonstrate promising results. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric method, called relaxational metric adaptation (RMA), for the same metric adaptation problem. While RMA is local in the sense that it allows locally adaptive metrics, it is also global because even patterns not in the vicinity can have long-range effects on the metric adaptation process. Experimental results for semi-supervised clustering based on both simulated and real-world data sets show that RMA outperforms Xing et al.'s method under most situations. Besides applying RMA to semi-supervised learning, we have also used it to improve the performance of content-based image retrieval systems through metric adaptation. Experimental results based on two real-world image databases show that RMA significantly outperforms other methods in improving the image retrieval performance. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society.

Total concentrations of As, Cr, Cd, Hg, and Pb were determined in 220 topsoil samples (0-20 cm) collected using a grid design in a study area of 2 600 km(2). Heavy metal concentrations were grouped into three classes according to the optimum number of classes and fuzziness exponent using the fuzzy c-mean (FCM) algorithm. Membership values were interpolated using ordinary kriging. The polluted soils of the study area induced by the measured heavy metals were concentrated in the northwest corner and eastern part, especially the southeastern part close to the urban zone, whereas the soils free of pollution were mainly distributed in the southwestern part. The soils with potential risk of heavy metal pollution were located in isolated spots mainly in the northern part and southeastern corner of the study region. The FCM algorithm combined with geostatistical techniques, as compared to conventional single geostatistical kriging methods, could produce a prediction with a quantitative uncertainty evaluation and higher reliability. Successful prediction of soil pollution achieved with FCM algorithm in this study indicated that fuzzy set theory had great potential for use in other areas of soil science.

Many producers utilize simple GIS color ramping techniques to produce visual yield maps with delineated clusters. However, a more quantitative approach such as an unsupervised clustering procedure is generally used by scientists since it is much less arbitrary. Intuitively the yield clusters are due to soil and terrain properties, but there is no clear criterion for the delineation. We compared the effectiveness of two delineation or classification procedures: quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and k-nearest neighbor discriminant analysis (k-NN) for the study of how yield temporal patterns relate to site properties. This study used three production fields, one in Monticello, IL, and two in Centralia, MO. Clusters were defined using maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) yield from three seasons. The k-NN had greater and more consistent successful classification rates than did QDA. Classification success rate varied from 0.465 to 0.790 for QDA while the k-NN classification rate varied from 0.794 to 0.874. This shows that areas of certain temporal yield patterns correspond to areas of specific site properties. Although profiles of site properties differ by crop and production field, areas of consistent low maize yield had greater shallow electrical conductivity (ECshallow), than those of consistent high maize yield. Furthermore, areas of consistent high soybean yield had lower soil reflectance than those areas of consistent low yields.

A three-step statistical procedure to identify sperm kinematic subpopulations in canine ejaculates: Changes after cryopreservation	REPRODUCTION IN DOMESTIC ANIMALS			English	Article							SEMEN QUALITY; MOTILITY; IDENTIFICATION; FERTILITY; SELECTION	Strong evidences suggest that many different sperm subpopulations co-exist within the mammalian ejaculate. These subpopulations have been identified in a number of species; however, to the best of our knowledge, no data exist regarding the existence of sperm subpopulations within the canine ejaculate. Ejaculates were obtained by masturbation from four mongrels and processed using a standard freezing protocol. Motility data were analysed before and after cryopreservation using a computer assisted sperm analysis (CASA) system ISAS (c). On raw data, a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to reduce the number of motility descriptors to a few informative variables, and then a K-means cluster procedure was performed and then a regression analysis to validate the clusters obtained in the second analysis and chi-squared analyses were used to compare clusters and males. PCA revealed that two principal components represented more that the 88% of the variance with eigenvalues of 3.25 and 3.02, respectively. The clustering and discriminant analysis using curvilinear velocity and linear velocity as variables revealed the existence of 11 sperm subpopulations - four of them characterized by high velocities, two by medium values and five by low velocities. After freezing-thawing, nine subpopulations were found - four of high velocities, two of medium and three of low velocities. It is concluded that freezing-thawing not only impairs sperm motility but also produces changes in the sperm subpopulation structure in the canine ejaculate, that the evaluation of the sperm structure subpopulations is a better indicator of semen quality and freezeability than the use of mean values, and that two sperm motility quality indexes can be used to resume of the variables obtained from the CASA analysis.

J	He, ZS; Xie, SL; Fu, YL				He Zhaoshui; Xie Shengli; Fu Yuli			Sparse representation and blind source separation of ill-posed mixtures	SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES F-INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						ill-posed mixture; blind source separation; sparse representation; PCA; K-mean clustering	INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; OVERCOMPLETE REPRESENTATIONS; INFORMATION; ALGORITHMS	Bofill et al. discussed blind source separation (BSS) of sparse signals in the case of two sensors. However, as Bofill et al. pointed out, this method has some limitation. The potential function they introduced is lack of theoretical basis. Also the method could not be extended to solve the problem in the case of more than three sensors. In this paper, instead of the potential function method, a K-PCA method (combining K-clustering with PCA) is proposed. The new method is easy to be used in the case of more than three sensors. It is easy to be implemented and can provide accurate estimation of mixing matrix. Some criterion is given to check the effect of the mixing matrix A. Some simulations illustrate the availability and accuracy of the method we proposed.

J	Cres, H				Cres, Herve			A geometric study of shareholders' voting in incomplete markets: multivariate median and mean shareholder theorems	SOCIAL CHOICE AND WELFARE			English	Article							EQUILIBRIUM; ECONOMY; FIRM; RULE; CHOICE	A simple parametric general equilibrium model with S states of nature and K < S firms is considered. Since markets are incomplete, at a (financial) equilibrium shareholders typically disagree on whether to keep or not the status quo production plans. Hence each firm faces a genuine problem of social choice. The setup proposed in the present paper allows to study these problems within a classical (Downsian) spatial voting model. Given the multidimensional nature of the latter, super majority rules with rate rho is an element of [1/2, 1] are needed to guarantee existence of politically stable production plans. A simple geometric argument is proposed showing why a 50%-majority stable production equilibrium exists when K=S-1. When the degree of incompleteness is more severe, under more restrictive assumptions on agents' preferences and the distribution of agents' types, equilibria are shown to exist for rates rho smaller than Caplin and Nalebuff (Econometrica 59: 1-23, 1991) bound of 0.64: they obtain for production plans whose span contains the 'ideal securities' of all K mean shareholders.

A typology of South Dakota muzzleloader deer hunters	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN			English	Article						attitudes; deer; equipment; hunter; motivations; muzzleloader; Odocoileus siop.; skills; success; typology		In 1999 we surveyed 1,000 randomly selected South Dakota, USA, muzzleloader deer (Odocoileus spp.) hunters using a self-administered mail survey to gain better understanding of equipment used, skills, success, motivations, and attitudes about technology and restrictions. This sample represented 67% of the state's muzzleloader deer-hunter population in 1999, Nine hundred and four usable surveys were returned. We conducted a K-means cluster analysis to determine if muzzleloader hunters could be separated (based on equipment used) into modem and traditional hunters. Modem muzzleloader hunters (31%) used in-line muzzleloaders, bullet with sabot, Pyrodex pellets, or fiber-optic open sights, while traditional muzzleloader hunters (69%.) used caplock muzzleloaders, blackpowder, or flintlock muzzleloaders. We compared hunter type, age, experience, skills, success, and equipment used by category to determine if differences existed. Most muzzleloader deer hunters (68%) were satisfied with current equipment regulations. Probability of hunter success increased when modem muzzleloader equipment was used and the distance hunters were willing to shoot at a standing deer increased. Equipment type only slightly impacted harvest success. Because more muzzleloader hunters were satisfied with equipment restrictions, we concluded that establishing additional limits was not necessary. Moreover, South Dakota wildlife managers already had a lottery quota system for permit allocation that could be used to adjust for increased muzzleloader harvest. Thus, we contend muzzleloader-equipment-regulation decisions for South Dakota hunters may be more a social than a biological issue.

J	Loganantharaj, R; Cheepala, S; Clifford, J				Loganantharaj, Raja; Cheepala, Satish; Clifford, John			Metric for measuring the effectiveness of clustering of DNA microarray expression	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd Annual Conference of the MidSouth-Computational-Biology-and-Bioinformatics-Society	MAR 02-04, 2006	Baton Rouge, LA	MidSouth Computat Biol & Bioinformat Soc			MOUSE SKIN; VALIDATION	Background: The recent advancement of microarray technology with lower noise and better affordability makes it possible to determine expression of several thousand genes simultaneously. The differentially expressed genes are filtered first and then clustered based on the expression profiles of the genes. A large number of clustering algorithms and distance measuring matrices are proposed in the literature. The popular ones among them include hierarchal clustering and k-means clustering. These algorithms have often used the Euclidian distance or Pearson correlation distance. The biologists or the practitioners are often confused as to which algorithm to use since there is no clear winner among algorithms or among distance measuring metrics. Several validation indices have been proposed in the literature and these are based directly or indirectly on distances; hence a method that uses any of these indices does not relate to any biological features such as biological processes or molecular functions. Results: In this paper we have proposed a metric to measure the effectiveness of clustering algorithms of genes by computing inter-cluster cohesiveness and as well as the intra-cluster separation with respect to biological features such as biological processes or molecular functions. We have applied this metric to the clusters on the data set that we have created as part of a larger study to determine the cancer suppressive mechanism of a class of chemicals called retinoids. We have considered hierarchal and k-means clustering with Euclidian and Pearson correlation distances. Our results show that genes of similar expression profiles are more likely to be closely related to biological processes than they are to molecular functions. The findings have been supported by many works in the area of gene clustering. Conclusion: The best clustering algorithm of genes must achieve cohesiveness within a cluster with respect to some biological features, and as well as maximum separation between clusters in terms of the distribution of genes of a behavioral group across clusters. We claim that our proposed metric is novel in this respect and that it provides a measure of both inter and intra cluster cohesiveness. Best of all, computation of the proposed metric is easy and it provides a single quantitative value, which makes comparison of different algorithms easier. The maximum cluster cohesiveness and the maximum intra-cluster separation are indicated by the metric when its value is 0. We have demonstrated the metric by applying it to a data set with gene behavioral groupings such as biological process and molecular functions. The metric can be easily extended to other features of a gene such as DNA binding sites and protein-protein interactions of the gene product, special features of the intron-exon structure, promoter characteristics, etc. The metric can also be used in other domains that use two different parametric spaces; one for clustering and the other one for measuring the effectiveness.

Gene interaction network analysis suggests differences between high and low doses of acetaminophen	TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						systems biology; oxidative stress; apoptosis; toxicogenomics; dose-dependent toxicity; risk assessment	ACTIVATED RECEPTOR-GAMMA; MITOCHONDRIAL PERMEABILITY TRANSITION; NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; FACTOR-KAPPA-B; INDUCED HEPATOTOXICITY; INDUCED APOPTOSIS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; HEME OXYGENASE-1; GENOTOXIC STRESS; EXPRESSION DATA	Bayesian networks for quantifying linkages between genes were applied to detect differences in gene expression interaction networks between multiple doses of acetaminophen at multiple time points. Seventeen (17) genes were selected from the gene expression profiles from livers of rats orally exposed to 50, 150 and 1500 mg/kg acelaminophen (APAP) at 6, 24 and 48 h after exposure using a variety of statistical and bioinformatics approaches. The selected genes are related to three biological categories: apoptosis, oxidative stress and other. Gene interaction networks between all 17 genes were identified for the nine dose-time observation points by the TAO-Gen algorithm. Using k-means clustering analysis, the estimated nine networks could be clustered into two consensus networks, the first consisting of the low and middle dose groups, and the second consisting of the high dose. The analysis suggests that the networks could be segregated by doses and were consistent in structure over time of observation within grouped doses. The consensus networks were quantified to calculate the probability distribution for the strength of the linkage between genes connected in the networks. The quantifying analysis showed that, at lower doses, the genes related to the oxidative stress signaling pathway did not interact with the apoptosis-related genes. In contrast, the high-dose network demonstrated significant interactions between the oxidative stress genes and the apoptosis genes and also demonstrated a different network between genes in the oxidative stress pathway. The approaches shown here could provide predictive information to understand high- versus low-dose mechanisms of toxicity. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Soil management zones delineated by electrical conductivity to characterize spatial and temporal variations in potato yield and in soil properties	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POTATO RESEARCH			English	Article						geonic EM38; precision agriculture; drainage; soil-specific crop management	ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION; PRECISION AGRICULTURE; VARIABILITY; LANDSCAPE; WATER; QUALITY	Within-field management zones (MZ) delineated using soil electrical conductivity (EC) may provide the basis for site-specific crop management (SSCM). The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of EC for delineating homogenous soil MZ related to soil properties. Soil EC was measured on a 15-m x 15-m grid using a Geonics EM38 on a 13.8-ha commercial field under potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) production. A subset of this grid (30 in x 30 in) was used to collect soil samples (0-0.2 in) and to perform soil profile descriptions (1.2 in). Soil samples were analyzed for physicochemical properties (texture, organic matter, pH, Mehlich-3 extractable elements). Potato tuber yields were measured using a yield monitor in 1998, 1999, and 2000. The K-means clustering algorithm was performed for delineating MZ using the soil EC kriged data matrix. Two MZ were found to be optimal for implementing SSCM management for potato in this field. These two MZ showed significant differences in soil water regime (thickness of sandy deposit over the clayey substratum, water table depth, water-holding capacity) and in some soil physico-chemical properties (soil organic matter, soil P, soil pH). Significant differences in potato yields (5.9 t ha(-1)) between the two MZ were attributed to differing water supply. Soil EC has the potential to be used efficiently for delineating within-field MZ for soils in which soil deposits and soil physical properties control soil moisture availability.

J	Chekanov, S				Chekanov, S.			A new jet algorithm based on the k-means clustering for the reconstruction of heavy states from jets	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C			English	Article								A jet algorithm based on the k-means clustering procedure is proposed which can be used for the invariant-mass reconstruction of heavy states decaying to hadronic jets. The proposed algorithm was tested by reconstructing e(+)e(-)-> t(t)over bar -> 6 jets and e(+)e(-)-> W+W--> 4 jets processes at root s=500 GeV using a Monte Carlo simulation. It was shown that the algorithm has a reconstruction efficiency similar to traditional jet-finding algorithms, and leads to 25% and 40% improvement of the top-quark and W mass resolution, respectively, compared to the k(T) (Durham) algorithm. In addition, it is expected that the peak positions measured with the new algorithm have smaller systematical uncertainty.

Current approaches for the analysis of motion patterns depend on known scenes, where objects move in predefined ways. It is highly desirable to automatically construct object motion patterns which reflect the knowledge of the scene. In this paper, we present a system for automatically learning motion patterns for anomaly detection and behavior prediction based on a proposed algorithm for robustly tracking multiple objects. In the tracking algorithm, foreground pixels are clustered using a fast accurate fuzzy K-means algorithm. Growing and prediction of the cluster centroids of foreground pixels ensure that each cluster centroid is associated with a moving object in the scene. In the algorithm for learning motion patterns, trajectories are clustered hierarchically using spatial and temporal information and then each motion pattern is represented with a chain of Gaussian distributions. Based on the learned statistical motion patterns, statistical methods are used to detect anomalies and predict behaviors. Our system is tested using image sequences acquired, respectively, from a crowded real traffic scene and a model traffic scene. Experimental results show the robustness of the tracking algorithm, the efficiency of the algorithm for learning motion patterns, and the encouraging performance of algorithms for anomaly detection and behavior prediction.

In this paper, we present a feature-based vortex detection and visualization technique that is appropriate for large computational fluid dynamics data sets computed on unstructured meshes. In particular, we focus on the application of this technique to visualization of the flow over a serrated wing and the flow field around a spinning missile with dithering canards. We have developed a core line extraction technique based on the observation that vortex cores coincide with local extrema in certain scalar fields. We also have developed a novel technique to handle complex vortex topology that is based on k-means clustering. These techniques facilitate visualization of vortices in simulation data that may not be optimally resolved or sampled. Results are included that highlight the strengths and weaknesses of our approach. We conclude by describing how our approach can be improved to enhance robustness and expand its range of applicability.

The methodology used, previously proposed by Esteban et al. (2005) to identify heavy snowfall days over Andorra (Pyrenees), involves a pre-processing approach consisting of a spatial standardization of the data used for the rotated PCA on S-mode analysis and correlation matrix, and Varimax rotation of the retained components. For the clustering process, an alternative approximation based on the PCA results (positive and negative phases) to decide the centroids and the number of groups for the K-means clustering is shown, followed by the rejection of the iterations for this non-hierarchical algorithm. Twenty sea level pressure (SLP) circulation patterns were obtained, with all days classified. The composite maps for SLP and 500 hPa geopotential height (GPH), the monthly distribution, and the long-term variability for each of the circulation patterns is obtained. The results are consistent with the subjective knowledge of the daily atmospheric circulation over the area treated, and seem to be an easy and accessible way for the synoptic studies of short-lived (from weekly to daily) phenomena. In addition, this methodology appears to be applicable to all climatic areas of the world, as it characterizes well enough the complex circulation variability at mid-latitudes, including the surface low-pressure gradient patterns normally located over the Mediterranean in summer.

J	Sun, TH; Lee, LJH; Tien, FC				Sun, Te-Hsiu; Lee, Larry J. H.; Tien, Fang-Chih			Solving single allocation uncapacitated p-Hub median problem with hybrid genetic algorithms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING-THEORY APPLICATIONS AND PRACTICE			English	Article						p-Hub median problem; genetic algorithms; K-means algorithm; Taguchi method	LOCATION PROBLEM; TAGUCHI METHOD; OPTIMIZATION; FACILITIES; PROGRAM; SEARCH	The p-Hub Median problem is one of the most important logistic problems. The purpose of it is to locate p hubs in a number of nodes, and allocate the remaining nodes to the hubs so that an objective cost function is minimized. In this paper, we propose a hybrid genetic algorithm, including K-means algorithm, selection with elitism, two-point crossover, distance-based mutation, multi-start and short-term memory to solve this problem with un-capacitated and single-allocation conditions. To enhance the efficiency of the hybrid GA, tuning a set of controllable factors leading the evolutionary process to a quick convergence becomes a critical task. Therefore, Taguchi method is used to find the best operating combination of controllable factors based on several well-known test problems. The results of experimental analyses show that the proposed method solves the p-Hub Median problem effectively and efficiently. Significance: The p-Hub Median problem has been a practical issue for current logistic networks. The proposed method offers an effective solution to determine hub locations and allocation, and has been implemented on a Windows platform (GUI interface) for practical use. The proposed method can be widely applied to the areas of telecommunication traffic, computer system, data transmissions, airline passengers, express package, etc.	Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Taipei 106, Taiwan	Sun, TH (reprint author), Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Management, 1 Chung Hsiao E Rd,Sect 3, Taipei 106, Taiwan.	fctien@ntut.edu.tw					Abdinnour-Helm S, 1998, EUR J OPER RES, V106, P489, DOI 10.1016/S0377-2217(97)00286-5; Campbell D.

J	Li, PH				Li, Peihua			A clustering-based color model and integral images for fast object tracking	SIGNAL PROCESSING-IMAGE COMMUNICATION			English	Article						video processing; object tracking; K-means clustering; integral image; similarity measure	REAL-TIME TRACKING; HISTOGRAMS; SPACE	The paper presents a clustering-based color model and develops a fast algorithm for object tracking. The color model is built upon K-means clustering, by which the color space of the object can be partitioned adaptively and the histogram bins can be determined accordingly. In addition, in each bin the multi-channel gray level is modelled as Gaussian distribution. Defined in this way the color model can describe accurately the color distribution with very little bins. To evaluate similarity between the reference model and the candidate model, a similarity measure based on Bhattacharrya distance is introduced and its simplified form is derived under assumption that in each bin distribution of gray level in different channel is independent of each other. Motivated by the paper of Viola and Jones, the Integral Images for computation of histogram, mean and variance are proposed, with which the similarity measure can be evaluated at negligible computational cost. Thus, exhaustive search is made efficiently for object localization which guarantees the global maximum be achieved. Comparisons with the well-known mean shift algorithm demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has better performance while having the same (or less) computational cost. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Classification of tenderness of large cooked beef joints using wavelet and Gabor textural features	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						computer vision; cooked meats; Gabor energy; image texture; linear discrimination; multiresolution representation; silhouette value; vacuum cooling; wavelet transform	MACAQUE VISUAL-CORTEX; IMAGE TEXTURE; SPATIAL-FREQUENCY; QUALITY; SURFACE; PREDICTION; PRODUCT; REPRESENTATION; ORIENTATION; SELECTIVITY	Thirty-two large cooked beef joints were clustered into tender and tough using k-means clustering based on the shear values obtained from an Instron machine. An image acquisition system was set up to capture images of beef samples, and four different groups of texture features, i.e., wavelet features (WF), Gabor features (GF), wavelet Gabor features (WGF), and a combination of wavelet features and Gabor features (CWG), were extracted from the captured images. After removing the collinear redundancy using principal component analysis (PCA) among the various features in each group, a linear discrimination function was employed for classifying the tenderness of the samples. The discrimination results, together with the error rates estimated by the posterior probability error rate estimate method, suggest that the WGF provided the best classification results, followed by WF and CWG. The GF performed the worst among the four methods. Some existing problems with the wavelet transform and Gabor filter, which limited the accuracy of the proposed method, were also discussed.

Navigational context recognition for an autonomous robot in a simulated tree plantation	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						autoregressive model; extended Kalman filter; robotic weeding; robot navigation; sensor fusion; tree plantation nursery		A sensor fusion technique was developed for estimating the navigational posture of a skid-steered mobile robot in a simulated tree plantation nursery. Real-time kinematic GPS (RTK-GPS) and dynamic measurement unit (DMU) sensors were used to determine the position and orientation of the robot, while a laser range finder was used to locate the tree positions within a selected range. The RTK-GPS error was modeled by a second-order autoregressive model, and error states were incorporated into extended Kalman filter (EKF) design. Through EKF filtering, the mean and standard deviation of error in the easting direction decreased from 4.05 to 2.21 cm and from 8.27 to 1.89 cm, respectively, while in the northing direction, they decreased from 4.64 to 1.81 cm and from 11 to 2.16 cm, respectively. The geo-referenced tree positions along the navigational paths were also recovered by using a K-means clustering algorithm, achieving an average error of tree position estimates of 4.4 cm. The developed sensor fusion algorithm was proven to be capable of recognizing and reconstructing the navigational environment of a simulated tree plantation, which offers a great potential in improving the applicability of an autonomous robot to operate in nursery tree plantations for operations such as intra-row mechanical weeding.

The goal is to develop a systematic way of placing patients with similar CGH imbalance profiles into the same cluster. Our expectation is that patients with the same cancer types will generally belong to the same cluster as their underlying CGH profiles will be similar. Results: We focus on distance-based clustering strategies. We do this in two steps. (1) Distances of all pairs of CGH samples are computed. (2) CGH samples are clustered based on this distance. We develop three pairwise distance/similarity measures, namely raw, cosine and sim. Raw measure disregards correlation between contiguous genomic intervals. It compares the aberrations in each genomic interval separately. The remaining measures assume that consecutive genomic intervals may be correlated. Cosine maps pairs of CGH samples into vectors in a high-dimensional space and measures the angle between them. Sim measures the number of independent common aberrations. We test our distance/similarity measures on three well known clustering algorithms, bottom-up, top-down and k-means with and without centroid shrinking. Our results show that sim consistently performs better than the remaining measures. This indicates that the correlation of neighboring genomic intervals should be considered in the structural analysis of CGH datasets. The combination of sim with top-down clustering emerged as the best approach.

Predicting ozone concentrations from meteorological conditions is a very important issue in air pollution. A self-organizing map (SOM) neural network is suitable for clustering data because of its visualization property. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network was widely used recently in predicting air pollutant concentrations since MLP can capture the complex nonlinear concentration-meteorology relationship. In this work, a two-stage neural network (model I) was developed and used to predict ozone concentrations from meteorological conditions. The two-stage neural network first utilized an unsupervised neural network (two-level clustering approach: SOM followed by K-means clustering) to cluster meteorological conditions into different meteorological regimes. It was found that ozone concentrations within most meteorological regimes exhibited significantly different concentration characteristics. Then a supervised MLP neural network was used to simulate the nonlinear ozone-meteorology relationship within each meteorological regime. The results showed that meteorological conditions can explain at least 60% variance of ozone concentrations by the two-stage neural network. In addition, three other models (model II: multiple linear regressions (MLR), model III: two-level clustering approach followed by MLR and model IV: MLP) were also utilized to predict ozone concentrations, and were compared with model I. The sequence of predicted accuracy was model I > model IV > model III > model II, suggesting that the two-stage neural network had the best prediction performance among the four models and can elucidate better the dependence of ozone on meteorology than other models.

Multipolarized radar for delineating within-field variability in corn and wheat	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							PRECISION AGRICULTURE; POLARIMETRIC SAR; MANAGEMENT; IMAGERY	In agriculture, there is growing interest in determining field spatial variability for implementing differential management practices, which should generate economic and environmental benefits. To date, the majority of studies involving remote sensing and differential management have focused on optical sensor systems. Less attention has been paid to synthetic aperture radar (SAR), despite the advantages of "all-weather" acquisition enabling information to be collected under cloud cover. This study examined the information content of multipolarization (HH, HV, VV, RR, LL, RL), multitemporal, and multiangle radar for delineating within-field spatial variability. On three dates in 2001, airborne C-band SAR data ( 35 and 55 incident angles) were acquired over four experimental fields. A series of fuzzy K-means analyses showed that the ability to differentiate zones was dependent upon the crop, the date in the growing season, and the pedodiversity of the field. Consistent with the soil and plant biophysical data, two of the four fields showed no spatial variability in radar backscatter. In the high-pedodiversity cornfield (Zea mays L.), three zones of productivity were discriminated early in the growing season and two zones of productivity in mid-season. Late in the season as a result of saturation of the radar signal, no spatial variability was evident. In corn, the results were similar regardless of the radar polarization. In the wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) field, which was of lower pedodiversity, two zones were identified in early-, mid-, and late-season images. Differences were evident among polarizations, with VV and HV being most sensitive to within-field variation. The delineated zones in both fields were shown to relate to plant and soil parameters, suggesting that radar may be a valuable tool in delineating spatial variation in producer fields and delineating differential management units.

J	Beringer, J; Hullermeier, E				Beringer, J; Hullermeier, E			Online clustering of parallel data streams	DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						data mining; clustering; data streams; fuzzy sets		In recent years, the management and processing of so-called data streams has become a topic of active research in several fields of computer science such as, e.g., distributed systems, database systems, and data mining. A data stream can roughly be thought of as a transient, continuously increasing sequence of time-stamped data. In this paper, we consider the problem of clustering parallel streams of real-valued data, that is to say, continuously evolving time series. In other words, we are interested in grouping data streams the evolution over time of which is similar in a specific sense. In order to maintain an up-to-date clustering structure, it is necessary to analyze the incoming data in an online manner, tolerating not more than a constant time delay. For this purpose, we develop an efficient online version of the classical K-means clustering algorithm. Our method's efficiency is mainly due to a scalable online transformation of the original data which allows for a fast computation of approximate distances between streams. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

By using overall information available on the distribution of genetic variation between 102 populations previously investigated, we expect to strengthen our knowledge on the spread of the invasive aspersa subspecies in the Western Mediterranean. We propose a new approach based on a centre-based clustering procedure to cluster populations into groups following rules of geographical proximity and genetic similarity. Assuming a stepping-stone model of diffusion, we apply a partitioning algorithm which clusters only populations that are geographically contiguous. The algorithm used, which is actually part of leading methods developed for analysing large microarray datasets, is that of the k-means. Its goal is to minimize the within-group variance. The spatial constraint is provided by a list of connections between localities deduced from a Delaunay network. After testing each optimal group for the presence of spatial arrangement in the genetic data, the inferred genetic structure was compared with partitions obtained from other methods published for defining homogeneous groups (i.e. the Monmonier and SAMOVA algorithms). Competing biogeographical scenarios inferred from the k-means procedure were then compared and discussed to shed more light on colonization routes taken by the species.

Detection and classification of sensory information from acute spinal cord recordings	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						brain interface; functional electrical stimulation; neural prosthesis; spinal cord injury	DORSAL-ROOT GANGLION; NEURAL PROSTHESES; NERVE; NEUROPROSTHESIS; STIMULATION; NEURONS; INJURY	One avenue of research for partial restoration of function following spinal cord injury is the use of neural prostheses, an example of which is functional electrical stimulation (FES) devices for motor functions. Neural prostheses may also be useful for the extraction of sensory information directly from the nervous system. We suggest the spinal cord as a possible site for the detection of peripheral sensory information from neural activity alone. Acute multichannel extracellular recordings were used to extract neural spike activity elicited from peripheral sensations from the spinal cords of rats. To test the recording method and classification potential, eight classes of sensory events were recorded consisting of electrical stimulation of seven locations on rat forepaws, and another class of data during which no stimulus was present. A dual-stage classification scheme using principal component analysis and k-Means clustering was devised to classify the sensory events during single trials. The eight tasks were correctly identified at a mean accuracy of 96%. Thus, we have shown the methodology to detect and classify peripheral sensory information from multichannel recordings of the spinal cord. These methods may be useful, for example, in a closed-loop FES for restoration of hand grasp.

We present new, efficient methods for burst optical signal detection in burst-mode data transmission using a modified K-means clustering technique. We also develop a data-aided feedforward symbol-timing recovery method based on a polynomial interpolation and maximum-likelihood estimation theory. A performance criterion considering the error caused by the interpolation approximation is derived for this method. The proposed detection and timing recovery approaches can be implemented effectively and rapidly; therefore, they are very suitable for burst-mode receivers. We also provide some numerical examples to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods.

This methodology extends and combines two existing approaches: the L-level set active contour (AC) segmentation approach and the agglomerative hierarchical k-means approach for unsupervised clustering (UC). To prevent the trapping of the current iterative minimization AC algorithm in a local minimum, we introduce a multiresolution approach that applies the level set functions at successively increasing resolutions of the image data. The resulting AC clusters are subsequently rearranged by the UC algorithm that seeks the optimal set of clusters yielding the minimum within-cluster distances in the feature space. The presented results from Monte Carlo simulations and experimental animal-tissue data demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms other existing methods without depending on heuristic parameters and provides a reliable means for soft tissue differentiation in HUTT images.

J	Nock, R; Nielsen, F				Nock, Richard; Nielsen, Frank			On weighting clustering	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						clustering; Bregman divergences; k-means; fuzzy k-means; expectation maximization; harmonic means clustering		Recent papers and patents in iterative unsupervised learning have emphasized a new trend in clustering. It basically consists of penalizing solutions via weights on the instance points, somehow making clustering move toward the hardest points to cluster. The motivations come principally from an analogy with powerful supervised classification methods known as boosting algorithms. However, interest in this analogy has so far been mainly borne out from experimental studies only. This paper is, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt at its formalization. More precisely, we handle clustering as a constrained minimization of a Bregman divergence. Weight modifications rely on the local variations of the expected complete log- likelihoods. Theoretical results show benefits resembling those of boosting algorithms and bring modified ( weighted) versions of clustering algorithms such as k- means, fuzzy c- means, Expectation Maximization ( EM), and k- harmonic means. Experiments are provided for all these algorithms, with a readily available code. They display the advantages that subtle data reweighting may bring to clustering.

Viloria			Applicability of fuzzy set theory approach to soil classification in the Valencia lake depression, Venezuela	INTERCIENCIA			Spanish	Article							MAPPING SOIL; K-MEANS; C-MEANS; UTILITY; COST	Conventional soil classifications produce discrete groups with sharp boundaries, but soil variation is continuous. The fuzzy set theory offers an opportunity to overcome this limitation, expressing the degree of membership of each individual to every class by means of a function which varies continually between 0 (it does not belong) and 1 (it belongs). This study applies the fuzzy set theory to classify soils from the Valencia Lake basin, Venezuela, and evaluates the results. Data from 339 soil profiles, interpolated at 15 and 50cm depth, were used. The following variables were selected by means of a principal component analysis for their greater contribution to the whole variation: sand and clay percentages, pH, electrical conductivity and CaCO3 equivalent. percentage. Additionally, the following morphological attributes were considered: soil horizon sequence (A/C, A/Bw/C or A/Bt/C), soil drainage class, presence or absence of vertic properties and presence or absence of duplex (layers of contrasting soil textures). The fuzzy c-means with extragrades algorithm, available in the FuzME program, was applied. Soil data were clustered into 9 typical classes plus one extragrade class. The within-class variability is low, except for the percentage of soil organic C and electrical conductivity at 15cm. The base saturation and the cation exchange capacity, as laboratory variables from special analyses, are predictable by the fuzzy soil classes. Finally, an association was found between the fuzzy soil classes and landscape units, suggesting that these classes are amenable of mapping.

J	Trujillo, M; Izquierdo, E				Trujillo, Maria; Izquierdo, Ebroul			Improving the efficiency of a least median of squares schema for the estimation of the fundamental matrix	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						fundamental matrix; epipolar geometry; least median of squares; semivariogram function; k-means clustering	ALGORITHM	A robust and efficient approach to estimate the fundamental matrix is proposed. The main goal is to reduce the computational cost involved in the estimation when robust schemas are applied. The backbone of the proposed technique is the conventional Least Median of Squares (LMedS) technique. It is well known that the LMedS is one of the most robust regressors for highly contaminated data and unstable models. Unfortunately, its computational complexity renders it useless for practical applications. To overcome this problem, a small number of low-dimensionality least-square problems are solved using well-selected subsets from the input data. The results of this initial approach are fed into the LMedS schema, which is applied to recover the final estimation of the Fundamental matrix. The complexity is substantially reduced by applying a selection process based on an effective statistical analysis of the inherent correlation of the input data. This analysis is used to define a suitable clustering of the data and to drive the subset selection aiming at the reduction of the search space in the LMedS schema. It is shown that avoiding redundancies better estimates can be obtained while keeping the computational cost low. Selected results of computer experiments were conducted to assess the performance of the proposed technique.

J	Froese, R				Froese, R.			Cube law, condition factor and weight-length relationships: history, meta-analysis and recommendations	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY			English	Article							AEGEAN SEA GREECE; CEPOLA-MACROPHTHALMA; RED BANDFISH; FISHES; PARAMETERS	This study presents a historical review, a meta-analysis, and recommendations for users about weight-length relationships, condition factors and relative weight equations. The historical review traces the developments of the respective concepts. The meta-analysis explores 3929 weight-length relationships of the type W = aL(b) for 1773 species of fishes. It shows that 82% of the variance in a plot of log a over b can be explained by allometric versus isometric growth patterns and by different body shapes of the respective species. Across species median b = 3.03 is significantly larger than 3.0, thus indicating a tendency towards slightly positive-allometric growth (increase in relative body thickness or plumpness) in most fishes. The expected range of 2.5 < b < 3.5 is confirmed. Mean estimates of b outside this range are often based on only one or two weight-length relationships per species. However, true cases of strong allometric growth do exist and three examples are given. Within species, a plot of log a vs b can be used to detect outliers in weight-length relationships. An equation to calculate mean condition factors from weight-length relationships is given as K-mean = 100aL(b-3). Relative weight W-rm = 100W/(a(m)L(m)(b)) can be used for comparing the condition of individuals across populations, where a(m) is the geometric mean of a and b(m) is the mean of b across all available weight-length relationships for a given species. Twelve recommendations for proper use and presentation of weight-length relationships, condition factors and relative weight are given.

Functional annotation of IFN-alpha-stimulated gene expression profiles from sensitive and resistant renal cell carcinoma cell lines	JOURNAL OF INTERFERON AND CYTOKINE RESEARCH			English	Article							HISTONE DEACETYLASE INHIBITOR; CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA; CHRONIC HEPATITIS-C; INTERFERON-ALPHA; PHASE-I; DEPSIPEPTIDE FR901228; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; MYELOID-LEUKEMIA; MAP KINASE; PROTEIN	The antiproliferative, antiviral, and immunomodulatory properties of interferons (IFNs) have led to its therapeutic implementation. IFNs effects are mediated by a complex network of signal transducers, culminating in IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) induction. This complexity leads to diverse clinical responses to IFN, from no response to complete regression of disease. Elucidation of ISG induction patterns is, therefore, essential to understand and maximize its therapeutic potential. To correlate ISG expression profiles with IFN responsiveness, two renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines differing in antiviral and apoptotic response to IFN were treated with IFN-alpha for different times, and expression profiles were analyzed using a customized microarray containing 850 unique putative ISGs. Genes with similar kinetics of induction in both cell lines were clustered and analyzed for gene function. Seven sets of coordinately regulated genes were identified by k-means cluster analysis, and significant functional similarities were identified for five of the seven sets. Strikingly, expression of genes associated with transcription temporally preceded expression of those involved in signal transduction. Enhanced antiviral sensitivity to IFN was coincident with sustained expression of ISGs involved in transcriptional regulation. However, no difference in Stat1 activation was observed between the cell lines. Analysis of ISG expression patterns suggests that subtle differences in transcription profiles contribute to differences in IFN responsiveness.

A flocking based algorithm for document clustering analysis	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE			English	Article						document clustering; bio-inspired; agent; flocking model; F-measure		Social animals or insects in nature often exhibit a form of emergent collective behavior known as flocking. In this paper, we present a novel Flocking based approach for document clustering analysis. Our Flocking clustering algorithm uses stochastic and heuristic principles discovered from observing bird flocks or fish schools. Unlike other partition clustering algorithm such as K-means, the Flocking based algorithm does not require initial partitional seeds. The algorithm generates a clustering of a given set of data through the embedding of the high-dimensional data items on a two-dimensional grid for easy clustering result retrieval and visualization. Inspired by the self-organized behavior of bird flocks, we represent each document object with a flock boid. The simple local rules followed by each flock boid result in the entire document flock generating complex global behaviors, which eventually result in a clustering of the documents. We evaluate the efficiency of our algorithm with both a synthetic dataset and a real document collection that includes 100 news articles collected from the Internet. Our results show that the Flocking clustering algorithm achieves better performance compared to the K-means and the Ant clustering algorithm for real document clustering. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

J	Xu, J; Zhang, Q; Shih, CK				Xu, Jun; Zhang, Qiang; Shih, Chen-Kon			V-cluster algorithm: A new algorithm for clustering molecules based upon numeric data	MOLECULAR DIVERSITY			English	Article						cluster algorithm; similarity; data normalization	HIGH-DENSITY CLUSTERS; CRITERIA; TESTS; DISTRIBUTIONS; CONSISTENCY; MIXTURES; PATTERNS	Clustering molecules based on numeric data such as, gene-expression data, physiochemical properties, or theoretical data is very important in drug discovery and other life sciences. Most approaches use hierarchical clustering algorithms, non-hierarchical algorithms (for examples, K-mean and K-nearest neighbor), and other similar methods (for examples, the Self-Organization Mapping (SOM) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM)). These approaches are non-robust (results are not consistent) and, computationally expensive. This paper will report a new, non-hierarchical algorithm called the V-Cluster (V stands for vector) Algorithm. This algorithm produces rational, robust results while reducing computing complexity. Similarity measurement and data normalization rules are also discussed along with case studies. When molecules are represented in a set of numeric vectors, the V-Cluster Algorithm clusters the molecules in three steps: (1) ranking the vectors based upon their overall intensity levels, (2) computing cluster centers based upon neighboring density, and (3) assigning molecules to their nearest cluster center. The program is written in C/C++ language, and runs on Window95/NT and UNIX platforms. With the V-Cluster program, the user can quickly complete the clustering process and, easily examine the results by use of thumbnail graphs, superimposed intensity curves of vectors, and spreadsheets. Multi-functional query tools have also been implemented.

Consequently, Sparse ICA may be done by a combination of a clustering algorithm and PCA. For the clustering part, we use, in this paper, an algorithm inspired from K-means. The final algorithm is easy to implement for any number of sources.

However, the memberships that result from fuzzy-clustering algorithms are difficult to be analyzed and visualized. The memberships, usually converted to 0-1 values, are visualized using parallel coordinates or different color shades. In this paper, we propose a new approach to visualize fuzzy-clustered data. The scheme is based on a geometric visualization, and works by grouping the objects with similar cluster memberships towards the vertices of a hyper-tetrahedron. The proposed method shows clear advantages over the existing methods, demonstrating its capabilities for viewing and navigating inter-cluster relationships in a spatial manner.

To further understand the transcriptional regulation of neural differentiation of ESCs, we used oligonucleotide microarray to examine the gene expressions of the guided differentiation (GD) model for dopaminergic (DA) neurons from mouse ESCs. We also determined the gene expression profiles of the random differentiation (RD) model of mouse ESCs into embryoid bodies. From K-means clustering analysis using the expression patterns of the two models, most of the genes (1,282 of 1,884 genes [68.0%]) overlapped in their expression patterns. Six hundred twenty-two differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from the GD model by random variance F-test were classified by their critical molecular functions in neurogenesis and DNA replication (Gene Ontology analysis). However, 400 genes among GD-DEGs (64.3%) showed a high correlation with RD in Spearman's correlation analysis (Spearman's coefficient p(s) >= 6). The genes showing marginal correlation (-.4 < p(s) < .6) were present in the early stages of differentiation of both GD and RD, which were non-specific to brain development. Finally, we distinguished 66 GD-specific genes based on p(s) <= -.4, the molecular functions of which were related mainly to vesicle formation, neurogenesis, and transcription factors. From among these GD-specific genes, we confirmed the expression of Serpini1 and Rab33a in P19 differentiation models and adult brains. From these results, we identified the specific genes required for neural differentiation by comparing gene expressions of GD with RD; these would potentially be the highly specific candidate genes necessary for differentiation of DA neurons.

Cluster analysis for DNA methylation profiles having a detection threshold	BMC BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article							COLORECTAL-CANCER; CLASSIFICATION; PHENOTYPE; MARKERS	Background: DNA methylation, a molecular feature used to investigate tumor heterogeneity, can be measured on many genomic regions using the MethyLight technology. Due to the combination of the underlying biology of DNA methylation and the MethyLight technology, the measurements, while being generated on a continuous scale, have a large number of 0 values. This suggests that conventional clustering methodology may not perform well on this data. Results: We compare performance of existing methodology (such as k-means) with two novel methods that explicitly allow for the preponderance of values at 0. We also consider how the ability to successfully cluster such data depends upon the number of informative genes for which methylation is measured and the correlation structure of the methylation values for those genes. We show that when data is collected for a sufficient number of genes, our models do improve clustering performance compared to methods, such as k-means, that do not explicitly respect the supposed biological realities of the situation. Conclusion: The performance of analysis methods depends upon how well the assumptions of those methods reflect the properties of the data being analyzed. Differing technologies will lead to data with differing properties, and should therefore be analyzed differently. Consequently, it is prudent to give thought to what the properties of the data are likely to be, and which analysis method might therefore be likely to best capture those properties.

J	Lin, TH; Chiu, SH; Tsai, KC				Lin, Thy-Hou; Chiu, Shih-Hau; Tsai, Keng-Chang			Supervised feature ranking using a genetic algorithm optimized artificial neural network	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING			English	Article							FEATURE-SELECTION; HCVNS3 PROTEASE; INHIBITORS; DESIGN	A genetic algorithm optimized artificial neural network GNW has been designed to rank features for two diversified multivariate data sets. The dimensions of these data sets are 85 x 24 and 62 x 25 for 24 or 25 molecular descriptors being computed for 85 matrix metalloproteinase-1 inhibitors or 62 hepatitis C virus NS3 protease inhibitors, respectively. Each molecular descriptor computed is treated as a feature and input into an input layer node of the artificial neural network. To optimize the artificial neural network by the genetic algorithm, each interconnected weight between input and hidden or between hidden and output layer nodes is binary encoded as a 16 bits string in a chromosome, and the chromosome is evolved by crossover and mutation operations. Each input layer node and its associated weights of the trained GNW are systematically omitted once (the self-depleted weights), and the corresponding weight adjustments due to the omission are computed to keep the overall network behavior unchanged. The primary feature ranking index defined as the sum of self-depleted weights and the corresponding weight adjustments computed is found capable of separating good from bad features for some artificial data sets of known feature rankings tested. The final feature indexes used to rank the data sets are computed as a sum of the weighted frequency of each feature being ranked in a particular rank for each data set being partitioned into numerous clusters. The two data sets are also clustered by a standard K-means method and trained by a support vector machine (SVM) for feature ranking using the computed F-scores as feature ranking index. It is found that GNW outperforms the SVM method on three artificial as well as the matrix metalloproteinase-1 inhibitor data sets studied. A clear-cut separation of good from bad features is offered by the GNW but not by the SVM method for a feature pool of known feature ranking.

The proposed technique is based on the principles of the K-Means algorithm. It works in a localized asynchronous manner by communicating with the neighboring nodes. The paper offers extensive theoretical analysis of the algorithm that bounds the error in the distributed clustering process compared to the centralized approach that requires downloading all the observed data to a single site. Experimental results show that, in contrast to the case when all the data is transmitted to a central location for application of the conventional clustering algorithm, the communication cost (an important consideration in sensor networks which are typically equipped with limited battery power) of the proposed approach significantly smaller. At the same time, the accuracy of the obtained centroids is high and the number of samples which are incorrectly labeled is also small. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We used instead two nonparametric methods (principal component analysis and independent component analysis), which provided a basis for the response field clustering. Although both methods performed satisfactorily, the principal component analysis space is more straightforward to calculate. It also gave a clear preference toward was performed with both K-means and superparamagnetic clustering algorithms with similar results. We also show that the shapes of the eigenvectors remain consistent regardless of the response field data sets size. This finding reflects the fact that the response fields were generated by the same neural network and encode the same underlying process.

Our method basically implements the k-medoids algorithm with distance computed based on dynamic time warping for time series of unequal length and Euclidean for feature vectors. Each chromosome encodes objects serving as the k-medoids in binary. Both mutation and crossover rates are adapted during evolution. Six fitness functions are defined based on existing validity indices. An application in clustering grinding signals is first shown to illustrate its use. The method is then further evaluated using benchmark data available in the public domain to test. the performance of the fitness functions employed. The results indicate that: (i) the proposed method produces comparable or better clustering accuracies than k-means if there is a priori knowledge about the number of clusters; and (ii) all six validity indices fail to correctly identify the actual number of clusters based on the k-means results for most data sets. A GA-based procedure is proposed to devise a new validity index with two tuning parameters and is shown not only identifying the actual number of clusters for all data sets but also producing better clustering accuracy than k-means and some indices.

Most authors seem to equate this issue with the one of finding the maximum value of the modularity, as defined by Newman. Since the problem formulated this way is believed to be NP-hard, most effort has gone into the construction of search algorithms, and less to the question of other measures of community structures, similarities between various partitionings and the validation with respect to external information. Here we concentrate on a class of computer generated networks and on three well-studied real networks which constitute a bench-mark for network studies; the karate club, the US college football teams and a gene network of yeast. We utilize some standard ways of clustering data (originally not designed for finding community structures in networks) and show that these classical methods sometimes outperform the newer ones. We discuss various measures of the strength of the modular structure, and show by examples features and drawbacks. Further, we compare different partitions by applying some graph-theoretic concepts of distance, which indicate that one of the quality measures of the degree of modularity corresponds quite well with the distance from the true partition. Finally, we introduce a way to validate the partitionings with respect to external data when the nodes are classified but the network structure is unknown. This is here possible since we know everything of the computer generated networks, as well as the historical answer to how the karate club and the football teams are partitioned in reality.

Computational prediction of methylation status in human genomic sequences	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						DNA methylation; epigenomics; methylation prediction; CpG islands	CPG-ISLANDS; GENE-EXPRESSION; MOUSE; SELECTION	Epigenetic effects in mammals depend largely on heritable genomic methylation patterns. We describe a computational pattern recognition method that is used to predict the methylation landscape of human brain DNA. This method can be applied both to CpG islands and to non-CpG island regions. It computes the methylation propensity for an 800-bp region centered on a CpG dinucleotide based on specific sequence features within the region. We tested several classifiers for classification performance, including K means clustering, linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and support vector machine. The best performing classifier used the support vector machine approach. Our program (called HDFINDER) presently has a prediction accuracy of 86%, as validated with CpG regions for which methylation status has been experimentally determined. Using HDFINDER, we have depicted the entire genomic methylation patterns for all 22 human autosomes.

Evolving clusters in gene-expression data	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						clustering; evolutionary computation; bioinformatics; gene-expression data	K-MEANS ALGORITHM; PATTERNS	Clustering is a useful. exploratory tool for gene-expression data. Although successful applications of clustering techniques have been reported in the literature, there is no method of choice in the gene-expression analysis community. Moreover, there are only a few works that deal with the problem of automatically estimating the number of clusters in bioinformatics datasets. Most clustering methods require the number k of clusters to be either specified in advance or selected a posteriori from a set of clustering solutions over a range of k. In both cases, the user has to select the number of clusters. This paper proposes improvements to a clustering genetic algorithm that is capable of automatically discovering an optimal number of clusters and its corresponding optimal partition based upon numeric criteria. The proposed improvements are mainly designed to enhance the efficiency of the original clustering genetic algorithm, resulting in two new clustering genetic algorithms and an evolutionary algorithm for clustering (EAC). The original clustering genetic algorithm and its modified versions are evaluated in several runs using six gene-expression datasets in which the right clusters are known a priori. The results illustrate that all the proposed algorithms perform well in gene-expression data, although statistical comparisons in terms of the computational efficiency of each algorithm point out that EAC outperforms the others. Statistical evidence also shows that EAC is able to outperform a traditional method based on multiple runs of k-means over a range of k. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

For example, gene expression profiling of mutant animals that lack or contain an excess of certain cell types is a common way to identify genes that are important for the development and maintenance of given cell types. However, it is difficult for traditional computational methods, including unsupervised and supervised learning methods, to detect relevant genes from a large collection of expression profiles with high sensitivity and specificity. Unsupervised methods group similar gene expressions together while ignoring important prior biological knowledge. Supervised methods utilize training data from prior biological knowledge to classify gene expression. However, for many biological problems, little prior knowledge is available, which limits the prediction performance of most supervised methods. Results: We present a Bayesian semi-supervised learning method, called BGEN, that improves upon supervised and unsupervised methods by both capturing relevant expression profiles and using prior biological knowledge from literature and experimental validation. Unlike currently available semi-supervised learning methods, this new method trains a kernel classifier based on labeled and unlabeled gene expression examples. The semi-supervised trained classifier can then be used to efficiently classify the remaining genes in the dataset. Moreover, we model the confidence of microarray probes and probabilistically combine multiple probe predictions into gene predictions. We apply BGEN to identify genes involved in the development of a specific cell lineage in the C. elegans embryo, and to further identify the tissues in which these genes are enriched. Compared to K-means clustering and SVM classification, BGEN achieves higher sensitivity and specificity. We confirm certain predictions by biological experiments.

In this architecture, we use a novel hyper-fuzzy partition metric to improve the traditional common-used Euclidean norm metric clustering method. Since one fuzzy rule describes one pattern feature and implies the detection of one cluster center, it is encouraged to decrease the number of fuzzy rules with the hyper-fuzzy partition metric. According to the adaptive particle swarm optimization, it is very suitable to manage the clustering task for a complex, irregular, and high dimensional data set. To demonstrate the robustness of the proposed adaptive hyper-fuzzy partition particle swarm optimization clustering algorithms, various clustering simulations are experimentally compared with K -means and fuzzy c-means learning methods.

Novel image processing methods included K-means clustering segmentation preprocessing followed by modified discrete, normalized cross-correlational alignment of two-color images;, ratiometric processing for fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements; and intracellular spatial distribution measurements of RhoA GTPase activity. Results: The interdivision time was 19.4 h (mean) +/- 6.0 h (SD) (n = 7) for the GFP-histone cells in the two-by-two field that was scanned for 72 h. After registration and ratioing of the cells with the RhoA biosensor, increases in both cell protrusion and retraction were coincident with to increases in RhoA activity. Conclusions: These advances lay the foundation for extracting and correlating measurements characterizing the functional relationships of spatial localization and protein activation with features of cell migration such as velocity, polarization, protrusion, retraction, and mitosis.

J	Salgin, S; Salgin, U				Salgin, Sema; Salgin, Ugur			Supercritical fluid extraction of walnut kernel oil	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF LIPID SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						walnut kernel oil; supercritical fluid extraction; supercritical CO2; entrainer	CARBON-DIOXIDE EXTRACTION; CO2 EXTRACTION; SEEDS; SOLUBILITY; HAZELNUT; CANOLA	The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of the main process parameters on supercritical fluid extraction of walnut (Juglans regia L.) kernel oil. The recovery of walnut kernel oil was performed in a green and high-tech separation process. CO2 and CO2 + ethanol mixtures were used as the supercritical solvent. The extraction was carried out at operating pressures of 30, 40 and 50 MPa, operating temperatures of 313, 323 and 333 K, mean particle sizes of 1.78 x 10(-4), 3.03 x 10(-4), 4.78 x 10(-4), 7.00 x 10(-4) and 9.00 x 10(-4) m, supercritical CO2 (SC CO2) flow rates of 1.67 x 10(-8), 3.33 x 10(-8), 6.67 x 10(-8) and 13.33 x 10(-1) m(3)/s and entrainer (ethanol) concentrations of 2, 4, 8 and 12 vol-%. Maximum extraction yield and oil solubility in SC CO2 obtained at 50 MPa, 333 K, 9.00 x 10(-4) m, 3.33 x 10(-4) m(3)/h were 0.65 kg oil/kg of dry sample and 37.16 g oil/kg CO2, respectively. The results obtained in this study showed that the crossover pressure effect of walnut kernel oil was at 30 MPa. At 30 MPa and 313 K, the obtained extraction yields above 4 vol-% ethanol reached the organic solvent extraction yield of 68.5 kg oil/kg dry sample. Extraction time was decreased significantly because of the higher solubility of walnut kernel oil in SC CO2 + ethanol mixtures.

Subsequently, correlation statistics, namely, Pearson correlation and Spearman rank correlation, are used to segment the foreground and background intensity of microarray spots. The performance of correlation-based segmentation is compared to clustering-based (PAM, k-means) and seeded-region growing techniques (SPOT). It is shown that correlation-based segmentation is useful in flagging poorly hybridized spots, thus minimizing false-positives. The present study also raises the intriguing question of whether a change in correlation can be an indicator of differential gene expression.

J	Jodoin, PM; Mignotte, M				Jodoin, Pierre-Marc; Mignotte, Max			Markovian segmentation and parameter estimation on graphics hardware	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING			English	Article							MOTION; IMPLEMENTATION; ALGORITHMS; FIELDS	In this paper, we show how Markovian strategies used to solve well-known segmentation problems such as motion estimation, motion detection, motion segmentation, stereovision, and color segmentation can be significantly accelerated when implemented on programmable graphics hardware. More precisely, we expose how the parallel abilities of a standard graphics processing unit usually devoted to image synthesis can be used to infer the labels of a segmentation map. The problems we address are stated in the sense of the maximum a posteriori with an energy-based or probabilistic formulation, depending on the application. In every case, the label field is inferred with an optimization algorithm such as iterated conditional mode (ICM) or simulated annealing. In the case of probabilistic segmentation, mixture parameters are estimated with the K-means and the iterative conditional estimation (ICE) procedure. For both the optimization and the parameter estimation algorithms, the graphics processor unit's (GPU's) fragment processor is used to update in parallel every labels of the segmentation map, while rendering passes and graphics textures are used to simulate optimization iterations. The hardware results obtained with a mid-end graphics card, show that these Markovian applications can be accelerated by a factor of 4 to 200 without requiring any advanced skills in hardware programming.

J	Yang, SB; Huang, YP				Yang, Shiueng-Bien; Huang, You-Ping			Markov chain models based on genetic algorithms for texture and speech recognition	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING			English	Article							CLASSIFICATION	Markov chain models (MCMs) were recently adopted in many recognition applications. The well-known clustering algorithm, the k-means algorithm, is used to design the codebooks of the MCM, and then each code word in the codebook is regarded as one state of MCM. However, users usually have no idea how to determine the number of states before the design of the MCM, and therefore doubt whether the MCM produced by the k-means algorithm is optimal. We propose a new MCM based on the genetic algorithm for recognition applications. Genetic algorithms combine the clustering algorithm and the MCM design. The users do not need to define the size of the codebook before the design of the MCM. The genetic algorithm can automatically find the number of states in MCM, and thereby obtain a near-optimal MCM. Furthermore, we propose the fuzzy MCM (FMCM) and the fuzzy genetic algorithm (FGA) to enhance the recognition rate. Experimental results show that the proposed MCM outperforms the traditional MCM and other texture and speech recognition methods. (c) 2006 SPIE and IS&T.

J	Jin, RM; Goswami, A; Agrawal, G				Jin, Ruoming; Goswami, Anjan; Agrawal, Gagan			Fast and exact out-of-core and distributed k-means clustering	KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						k-means clustering; out-of-core datasets distributed k-means; confidence radius; boundary points		Clustering has been one of the most widely studied topics in data mining and k-means clustering has been one of the popular clustering algorithms. K-means requires several passes on the entire dataset, which can make it very expensive for large disk-resident datasets. In view of this, a lot of work has been done on various approximate versions of k-means, which require only one or a small number of passes on the entire dataset. In this paper, we present a new algorithm, called fast and exact k-means clustering (FEKM), which typically requires only one or a small number of passes on the entire dataset and provably produces the same cluster centres as reported by the original k-means algorithm. The algorithm uses sampling to create initial cluster centres and then takes one or more passes over the entire dataset to adjust these cluster centres. We provide theoretical analysis to show that the cluster centres thus reported are the same as the ones computed by the original k-means algorithm. Experimental results from a number of real and synthetic datasets show speedup between a factor of 2 and 4.5, as compared with k-means. This paper also describes and evaluates a distributed version of FEKM, which we refer to as DFEKM. This algorithm is suitable for analysing data that is distributed across loosely coupled machines. Unlike the previous work in this area, DFEKM provably produces the same results as the original k-means algorithm. Our experimental results show that DFEKM is clearly better than two other possible options for exact clustering on distributed data, which are down loading all data and running sequential k-means or running parallel k-means on a loosely coupled configuration.

In recent years there is a growing interest in the sparsest solution of this equation-the one with the fewest non-zero entries, measured by parallel to x parallel to(0). Such solutions find applications in signal and image processing, where the topic is typically referred to as "sparse representation". Considering the columns of A as atoms of a dictionary, it is assumed that a given signal b is a linear composition of few such atoms. Recent work established that if the desired solution x is sparse enough, uniqueness of such a result is guaranteed. Also, pursuit algorithms, approximation solvers for the above problem, are guaranteed to succeed in finding this solution. Armed with these recent results, the problem can be reversed, and formed as an implied matrix factorization problem: Given a set of vectors {b(i)}, known to emerge from such sparse constructions, Ax(i) = b(i), with sufficiently sparse representations x(i), we seek the matrix A. In this paper we present both theoretical and algorithmic studies of this problem. We establish the uniqueness of the dictionary A, depending on the quantity and nature of the set {b(i)}, and the sparsity of {x(i)}. We also describe a recently developed algorithm, the K-SVD, that practically find the matrix A, in a manner similar to the K-Means algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate this algorithm on several stylized applications in image processing. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Based on the cost function of NG, we introduce a batch variant of NG which shows much faster convergence and which can be interpreted as an optimization of the cost function by the Newton method. This formulation has the additional benefit that, based on the notion of the generalized median in analogy to Median SOM, a variant for non-vectorial proximity data can be introduced. We prove convergence of batch and median versions of NG, SOM, and k-means in a unified formulation, and we investigate the behavior of the algorithms in several experiments. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The methods considered refer to clustering and classification techniques. In particular, the investigated clustering techniques are self-organizing maps and K-means, while the classification techniques are multi-layer perceptrons, support vector machines, and k- nearest neighbours. Training and testing data have been collected selecting suitable diagnostic signals recorded over 4 years of EFDA-JET experiments. Multi-layer perceptron classifiers exhibited the best performance in classifying mode lock, density limit/high radiated power, H-mode/L-mode transition and internal transport barrier plasma disruptions. This classification performance can be increased using multiple classifiers. In particular the outputs of five multi-layer perceptron classifiers have been combined using multiple classifier techniques in order to obtain a more robust and reliable classification tool, that is presently implemented at JET.

J	Yang, Y; Kamel, MS				Yang, Y; Kamel, MS			An aggregated clustering approach using multi-ant colonies algorithms	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						ant algorithm; multi-ant colonies; clustering; aggregated clustering	QUADRATIC ASSIGNMENT PROBLEM	This paper presents a multi-ant colonies approach for clustering data that consists of some parallel and independent ant colonies and a queen ant agent. Each ant colony process takes different types of ants moving speed and different versions of the probability conversion function to generate various clustering results with an ant-based clustering algorithm. These results are sent to the queen ant agent and combined by a hypergraph model to calculate a new similarity matrix. The new similarity matrix is returned back to each ant colony process to re-cluster the data using the new information. Experimental evaluation shows that the average performance of the aggregated multi-ant colonies algorithms outperforms that of the single ant-based clustering algorithm and the popular K-means algorithm. The result also shows that the lowest outliers strategy for selecting the current data set has the best performance quality. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zhang, QP; Couloigner, I				Zhang, QP; Couloigner, I			Benefit of the angular texture signature for the separation of parking lots and roads on high resolution multi-spectral imagery	PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS			English	Article						road extraction; multi-spectral imagery; image segmentation; shape descriptor; texture	SATELLITE IMAGERY; LINEAR FEATURES; EXTRACTION	The misclassification of roads and parking lots is one of the major difficulties in automating road network extraction from high resolution remotely-sensed imagery, especially in urban areas. This paper proposes a new integrated approach to road identification on high resolution multi-spectral imagery. The input images are first segmented using a traditional k-means clustering on normalized digital numbers. The road cluster is then automatically identified using a fuzzy logic classifier. A number of shape descriptors of angular texture signature are introduced for a road class refinement, i.e. to separate the roads from the parking lots that have been misclassified as roads. Intensive experiments have shown that the proposed methodology is effective in automating the separation of roads from parking lots on high resolution multi-spectral imagery. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

RCLUS, a new program for clustering associated species: A demonstration using a Mojave desert plant community dataset	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						species association; cluster analysis; k-means; hierarchical clustering; TWINSPAN; Ambrosia; Larrea; Chrysothamnus; senecio; Eriogonum; Primus	LARGE DATA SETS; CLASSIFICATION; VEGETATION; DISSIMILARITY; COEFFICIENTS; SIMILARITY; DIVERSITY; ECOLOGY; FORESTS; POOLS	This paper presents a new clustering program named RCLUS that was developed for species (R-mode) analysis of plant community data. RCLUS identifies clusters of co-occurring species that meet a user-specified cutoff level of positive association with each other. The "strict affinity" clustering algorithm in RCLUS builds clusters of species whose pairwise associations all exceed the cutoff level, whereas the "coalition" clustering algorithm only requires that the mean pairwise association of the cluster exceeds the cutoff level. Both algorithms allow species to belong to multiple clusters, thus accommodating both generalist and specialist species. Using a 60-plot dataset of perennial plants occurring on the Beaver Dam Slope in southwestern Utah, we carried out RCLUS analyses and compared the results with 2 widely used clustering techniques: UPGMA and PAM. We found that many of the RCLUS clusters were subsets of the UPGMA and PAM clusters, although novel species combinations were also generated by RCLUS. An advantage of RCLUS over these methods is its ability to exclude species that are poorly represented in a dataset as well as species lacking strong association patterns. The RCLUS program also includes modules that assess the affinity of a given species, plot, or environmental variable to a given cluster. We found statistically significant correlations between some of the RCLUS species clusters and certain environmental variables of the study area (elevation and topographical position). We also noted differences in clustering behavior when different association coefficients were used in RCLUS and found that those incorporating joint absences (e.g., the phi coefficient) produced more clusters and more even numbers of species per cluster than those not incorporating joint absences (e.g., the Jaccard index). In addition to the species association application described in this paper, the RCLUS algorithms could be used for preliminary data stratification in sample (Q-mode) analysis. The indirect link between sample plots and RCLUS species clusters could also be exploited to yield a form of "fuzzy" classification of plots or to characterize species pools of plots.

Clustering of Pseudomonas aeruginosa transcriptomes from planktonic cultures, developing and mature biofilms reveals distinct expression profiles	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article							RIBOSOME MODULATION FACTOR; GLOBAL GENE-EXPRESSION; ESCHERICHIA-COLI K-12; TWITCHING MOTILITY; GROWTH-PHASE; POLYMYXIN-B; QUORUM; RESISTANCE; PROTEIN; OXYGEN	Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a genetically complex bacterium which can adopt and switch between a free-living or biofilm lifestyle, a versatility that enables it to thrive in many different environments and contributes to its success as a human pathogen. Results: Transcriptomes derived from growth states relevant to the lifestyle of P. aeruginosa were clustered using three different methods (K-means, K-means spectral and hierarchical clustering). The culture conditions used for this study were; biofilms incubated for 8, 14, 24 and 48 hrs, and planktonic culture (logarithmic and stationary phase). This cluster analysis revealed the existence and provided a clear illustration of distinct expression profiles present in the dataset. Moreover, it gave an insight into which genes are up-regulated in planktonic, developing biofilm and confluent biofilm states. In addition, this analysis confirmed the contribution of quorum sensing (QS) and RpoS regulated genes to the biofilm mode of growth, and enabled the identification of a 60.69 Kbp region of the genome associated with stationary phase growth (stationary phase planktonic culture and confluent biofilms). Conclusion: This is the first study to use clustering to separate a large P. aeruginosa microarray dataset consisting of transcriptomes obtained from diverse conditions relevant to its growth, into different expression profiles. These distinct expression profiles not only reveal novel aspects of P. aeruginosa gene expression but also provide a growth specific transcriptomic reference dataset for the research community.

J	Lin, GF; Chen, LH				Lin, GF; Chen, LH			Identification of homogeneous regions for regional frequency analysis using the self-organizing map	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						self-organizing map; homogeneous region; cluster analysis; regional frequency analysis	UNITED-STATES; L-MOMENTS; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; FLOOD FREQUENCY; RAINFALL; NETWORK; SOM	In this paper, the self-organizing map (SOM) is applied to identify the homogeneous regions for regional frequency analysis. First, the algorithm and structure of the SOM are presented. Then the experimental design is applied to test the cluster accuracy of the SOM, the K-means method and Ward's method. These three clustering methods are tested on experimental data sets where the amount of cluster dispersion and the cluster membership are controlled and known. Among the three clustering methods, the results show that the SOM determines the cluster membership more accurately than the K-means method and Ward's method. Finally, the SOM is applied to actual rainfall data in Taiwan to identify homogeneous regions for regional frequency analysis. A two-dimensional map indicates that the rain gauges can be grouped into eight clusters. A heterogeneity test indicates that the eight regions are sufficiently homogeneous. Moreover, the results show that the SOM can identify the homogeneous regions more accurately as compared to the other two clustering methods. Because of unsupervised learning, the SOM does not require the knowledge of corresponding output for comparison purposes. In addition, the SOM is more robust than the traditional clustering methods. Therefore, the SOM is recommended as an alternative to the identification of homogeneous regions for regional frequency analysis. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our companding approach, combines the efficiency of uniform quantization with the improved performance of nonuniform quantization. We show that the performance of companding techniques can be comparable with k-means clustering and a competitive neural network, while only requiring a single-pass processing step.

J	Al-Harbi, SH; Rayward-Smith, VJ				Al-Harbi, SH; Rayward-Smith, VJ			Adapting k-means for supervised clustering	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						classification; supervised clustering; weighted metrics; simulated annealing; supervised k-means		k-means is traditionally viewed as an algorithm for the unsupervised clustering of a heterogeneous population into a number of more homogeneous groups of objects. However, it is not necessarily guaranteed to group the same types (classes) of objects together. In such cases, some supervision is needed to partition objects which have the same label into one cluster. This paper demonstrates how the popular k-means clustering algorithm can be profitably modified to be used as a classifier algorithm. The output field itself cannot be used in the clustering but it is used in developing a suitable metric defined on other fields. The proposed algorithm combines Simulated Annealing with the modified k-means algorithm. We apply the proposed algorithm to real data sets, and compare the output of the resultant classifier to that of C4.5.

J	Walde, SSI				Walde, Sabine Schulte im			Experiments on the automatic induction of German semantic verb classes	COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS			English	Article							CLASSIFICATION	This article presents clustering experiments on German verbs: A statistical grammar model for German serves as the source for a distributional verb description at the lexical syntax-semantics interface, and the unsupervised clustering algorithm k-means uses the empirical verb properties to perform an automatic induction of verb classes. Various evaluation measures are applied to compare the clustering results to gold standard German semantic verb classes under different criteria. The primary goals of the experiments are (1) to empirically utilize and investigate the well-established relationship between verb meaning and verb behavior within a cluster analysis and (2) to investigate the required technical parameters of a cluster analysis with respect to this specific linguistic task. The clustering methodology is developed on a small-scale verb set and then applied to a larger-scale verb set including 883 German verbs.

J	Eick, CF; Rouhana, A; Bagherjeiran, A; Vilalta, R				Eick, CF; Rouhana, A; Bagherjeiran, A; Vilalta, R			Using clustering to learn distance functions for supervised similarity assessment	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						distance function learning; supervised clustering; nearest neighbor	CLASSIFICATION	Assessing the similarity between objects is a prerequisite for many data mining techniques. This paper introduces a novel approach to learn distance functions that maximizes the clustering of objects belonging to the same class. Objects belonging to a data set are clustered with respect to a given distance function and the local class density information of each cluster is then used by a weight adjustment heuristic to modify the distance function so that the class density is increased in the attribute space. This process of interleaving clustering with distance function modification is repeated until a "good" distance function has been found. We implemented our approach using the k-means clustering algorithm. We evaluated our approach using seven UCI data sets for a traditional 1-nearest-neighbor (1-NN) classifier and a compressed 1-NN classifier, called NCC, that uses the learnt distance function and cluster centroids instead of all the points of a training set. The experimental results show that attribute weighting leads to statistically significant improvements in prediction accuracy over a traditional 1-NN classifier for two of the seven data sets tested, whereas using NCC significantly improves the accuracy of the 1-NN classifier for four of the seven data sets.

This paper describes a low-level object tracking system that produces accurate vehicle motion trajectories that can be further analyzed to detect lane centers and classify lane types. Accompanying techniques for indexing and retrieval of anomalous trajectories are also derived. The predictive trajectory merge-and-split algorithm is used to detect partial or complete occlusions during object motion and incorporates a Kalman filter that is used to perform vehicle tracking. The resulting motion trajectories are modeled using variable low-degree polynomials. A K-means clustering technique on the coefficient space can be used to obtain approximate lam centers. Estimation bias due to vehicle lane changes can be removed using robust estimation techniques based on Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC). Through the use of nonmetric distance functions and a simple directional indicator, highway lanes can be classified into one of the following categories: entry, exit, primary, or secondary. Experimental results are presented to show the real-time application of this approach to multiple views obtained by an uncalibrated pan-tilt-zoom. traffic camera monitoring the junction of two busy intersecting highways.

J	Herrera, L; Escribano, R				Herrera, Liliana; Escribano, Ruben			Factors structuring the phytoplankton community in the upwelling site off El Loa River in northern Chile	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS			English	Article						community structure; Humboldt Current; phytoplankton species; northern Chile; coastal upwelling	HUMBOLDT CURRENT; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; CHEMICAL CONSEQUENCES; NINO; SYSTEM; ANTOFAGASTA; CIRCULATION; CHLOROPHYLL; BOUNDARY; REGION	Understanding processes affecting the structure of the autotrophic community in marine ecosystems is relevant because species-dependent characters may affect productivity and carbon fluxes of the ocean. In this work, we studied the influence of oceanographic variability on phytoplankton species composition at a coastal upwelling site off northern Chile. Four seasonal cruises carried out during 2003 off El Loa River (21 degrees S) showed that upwelling occurs year-round supporting a large number of diatoms, dinoflagellates, naked nanoflagellates, and silicoflagellates. The analysis of species composition showed that changes in the structure of the autotrophic community are expressed both in abundance and in differences in species assemblages. These changes occurred not only over the seasonal scale but also over the spatial pattern of distribution, and they correlated well to temporal variability of upwelling and spatial variation of upwelling conditions over the cross-shelf axis. A K-means clustering and principal component analyses showed that species assemblages can be represented by few dominant species strongly coupled to alternate upwelling vs. non-upwelling conditions. Both conditions are well defined, and mostly explained by changes in depth of the upper boundary of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) (a prominent feature in northern Chile), surface temperature and water column stratification. Abundance of dominant phytoplankton species were strongly correlated to both OMZ depth and water column stratification. Processes through which OMZ depth might influence species abundance and composition are unknown, although they may relate to changes in redox conditions which affect the nutrient field. Another explanation may relate to changes in grazing pressure derived from the effect of low oxygen water on zooplankton vertical distribution. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

Ribosomal protein S19 gene (RPS19) is one of the causative genes for DBA; however, the pathologic mechanism of erythroblastopenia and abnormal morphology has not been clarified. To assess the pathophysiology of DBA, the gene expression profile of 2 representative patients carrying no RPS19 mutations was compared with that of aplastic anemia (AA) patients.. assessed by the microarray analyses. The K-mean clustering analysis revealed the significant categorization of 28 ribosomal protein (R-P) genes into a small set of group (994 genes) (P = 2.39E-17), all of which were expressed at lower levels in DBA than in AA patients. RPS19 was categorized into the set of low expressing genes in DBA patients. No mutations were deter-mined in the promoter and coding sequences of top 10 RP genes expressed at the levels over 1.2 of the AA/DBA ratio, in 3 DBA patients. These results indicated that the lower expression of R-P gene group, even without the mutation, was a distinctive feature of DBA from AA, although the study number was small. The reduced RP gene expression, by itself, may suggest an underlying mechanism of the constitutional anemia.

The proposed scheme is devised to achieve three-level hierarchical parallel processing of massive data clustering. The divide-and-conquer approach to parallel data clustering is employed to perform the coarse-grain parallel processing by multiple PCs with a message passing mechanism. By taking advantage of the GPU's parallel processing capability, moreover, the proposed scheme can exploit two types of the fine-grain data parallelism at the different levels in the nearest neighbor search, which is the most computationally-intensive part of the data-clustering process. The performance of our scheme is discussed in comparison with that of the implementation entirely running on CPU. Experimental results clearly show that the proposed hierarchial parallel processing can remarkably accelerate the data clustering task. Especially, GPU co-processing is quite effective to improve the computational efficiency of parallel data clustering on a PC cluster. Although data-transfer from GPU to CPU is generally costly, acceleration by GPU co-processing is significant to save the total execution time of data-clustering.

J	Huang, XD; Lai, W				Huang, XD; Lai, W			Clustering graphs for visualization via node similarities	JOURNAL OF VISUAL LANGUAGES AND COMPUTING			English	Article						graph clustering; similarity metric; k-means algorithm; multilevel graph drawing; graph visualization		Graph visualization is commonly used to visually model relations in many areas. Examples include Web sites, CASE tools, and knowledge representation. When the amount of information in these graphs becomes too large, users, however, cannot perceive all elements at the same time. A clustered graph can greatly reduce visual complexity by temporarily replacing a set of nodes in clusters with abstract nodes. This paper proposes a new approach to clustering graphs. The approach constructs the node similarity matrix of a graph that is derived from a novel metric of node similarity. The linkage pattern of the graph is thus encoded into the similarity matrix, and then one obtains the hierarchical abstraction of densely linked subgraphs by applying the k-means algorithm to the matrix. A heuristic method is developed to overcome the inherent drawbacks of the k-means algorithm. For clustered graphs we present a multilevel multi-window approach to hierarchically drawing them in different abstract level views with the purpose of improving their readability. The proposed approaches demonstrate good results in our experiments. As application examples, visualization of part of Java class diagrams and Web graphs are provided. We also conducted usability experiments on our algorithm and approach. The results have shown that the hierarchically clustered graph used in our system can improve user performance for certain types of tasks. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The sensitivity of the method to errors in estimates of the different water compartment relaxation times is shown to be small at short echo times (TEs). Using data from healthy human subjects, it is shown that different image segmentation approaches that are commonly used to account for partial volume effects (SIPM2, FSL's FAST, and K-means) lead to different estimates of metabolite levels, particularly in gray matter (GM), owing primarily to variability in the estimates of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fraction. While consistency does not necessarily validate a method, a multi-spectral segmentation approach using FAST yielded the lowest intersubject variability in the estimates of GM metabolites. The mean GM and white matter (WM) levels of N-acetyl groups (NAc, primarily N-acetylaspartate), choline (Ch), and creatine (Cr) obtained in these subjects using the described method with FAST multispectral segmentation are reported: GM [NAc] = 17.16 +/- 1.19 mM; WM [NAc] = 14.26 +/- 1.38 mM; GM [Ch] = 3.27 +/- 0.47 mM; WM [Ch] = 2.65 +/- 0.25 mM; GM [Cr] = 13.98 +/- 1.20 mM; and WM [Cr] = 7.10 +/- 0.67 mM.

Normalized mutual information based registration using k-means clustering and shading correction	MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd International Workshop on Biomedical Image Registration	JUN 23-24, 2003	PHILADELPHIA, PA	Siemens Med Solut, Siemens Corp Res, Natl Lib Med, Univ Penn, Vice Provost Res	Univ Penn	image registration; normalized mutual information; k-Means clustering; shading correction; robustness	MINIMIZATION	In this paper the influence of intensity clustering and shading correction on mutual information based image registration is studied. Instead of the generally used equidistant re-binning, we use k-means clustering in order to achieve a more natural binning of the intensity distribution. Secondly, image inhomogeneities occurring notably in MR images can have adverse effects on the registration. We use a shading correction method in order to reduce these effects. The method is validated on clinical MR, CT and PET images, as well as synthetic MR images. It is shown that by employing clustering with inhomogeneity correction the number of misregistrations is reduced without loss of accuracy thus increasing robustness as compared to the standard non-inhomogeneity corrected and equidistant binning based registration.

Reduction of the number of spectral bands in Landsat images: a comparison of linear and nonlinear methods	OPTICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						curvilinear component analysis;principal-component analysis; Landsat 7; multispectral images; k-means; segmentation	COMPONENT ANALYSIS; DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; PROJECTION PURSUIT; BIRDS; COMMUNITIES; VARIABLES	We describe some applications of linear and nonlinear projection methods in order to reduce the number of spectral bands in Landsat multispectral images. The nonlinear method is curvilinear component analysis (CCA), and we propose an adapted optimization of it for image processing, based on the use of principal-component analysis (PCA, a linear method). The principle of CCA consists in reproducing the topology of the original space projection points in a reduced subspace, keeping the maximum of information. Our conclusions are: CCA is an improvement for dimension reduction of multispectral images; CCA is really a nonlinear extension of PCA; CCA optimization through PCA (called CCAinitPCA) allows a reduction of the computation burden but provides a result identical to that of CCA.

Only with suitable similarity metrics and when datasets are properly preprocessed, can results of high quality be obtained in cluster analysis. In this study, gene expression datasets with external evaluation criteria were preprocessed as normalization by line, normalization by column or logarithm transformation by base-2, and were subsequently clustered by hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering and self-organizing maps (SOMs) with Pearson correlation coefficient or Euclidean distance as similarity metric. Finally, the quality of clusters was evaluated by adjusted Rand index. The results illustrate that k-means clustering and SOMs have distinct advantages over hierarchical clustering in gene clustering, and SOMs are a bit better than k-means when randomly initialized. It also shows that hierarchical clustering prefers Pearson correlation coefficient as similarity metric and dataset normalized by line. Meanwhile, k-means clustering and SOMs can produce better clusters with Euclidean distance and logarithm transformed datasets. These results will afford valuable reference to the implementation of gene expression cluster analysis.

Steinley and R. Henson (2005), the author investigated the performance of K-means clustering under the following scenarios: (a) different probabilities of cluster overlap; (b) different types of cluster overlap; (c) varying samples sizes, clusters, and dimensions; (d) different multivariate distributions of clusters; and (e) various multidimensional data structures. The results are evaluated in terms of the Hubert-Arabie adjusted Rand index, and several observations concerning the performance of K-means clustering are made. Finally, the article concludes with the proposal of a diagnostic technique indicating when the partitioning given by a K-means cluster analysis can be trusted. By combining the information from several observable characteristics of the data (number of clusters, number of variables, sample size, etc.) with the prevalence of unique local optima in several thousand implementations of the K-means algorithm, the author provides a method capable of guiding key data-analysis decisions.

J	Brusco, MJ				Brusco, Michael J.			A repetitive branch-and-bound procedure for minimum within-cluster sums of squares partitioning	PSYCHOMETRIKA			English	Article						combinatorial data analysis; cluster analysis; K-means; branch and bound	PAIRED COMPARISON RANKING; ALGORITHM	Minimization of the within-cluster sums of squares (WCSS) is one of the most important optimization criteria in cluster analysis. Although cluster analysis modules in commercial software packages typically use heuristic methods for this criterion, optimal approaches can be computationally feasible for problems of modest size. This paper presents a new branch-and-bound algorithm for minimizing WCSS. Algorithmic enhancements include an effective reordering of objects and a repetitive solution approach that precludes the need for splitting the data set, while maintaining strong bounds throughout the solution process. The new algorithm provided optimal solutions for problems with up to 240 objects and eight well-separated clusters. Poorly separated problems with no inherent cluster structure were optimally solved for up to 60 objects and six clusters. The repetitive branch-and-bound algorithm was also successfully applied to three empirical data sets from the classification literature.

The K-means method is first introduced, various formulations of the minimum variance loss function and alternative loss functions within the same class are outlined, and different methods of choosing the number of clusters and initialization, variable preprocessing, and data reduction schemes are discussed. Theoretic statistical results are provided and various extensions of K-means using different metrics or modifications of the original algorithm are given, leading to a unifying treatment of K-means and some of its extensions. Finally, several future studies are outlined that could enhance the understanding of numerous subtleties affecting the performance of the K-means method.

J	Guldemir, H; Sengur, A				Guldemir, H; Sengur, A			Comparison of clustering algorithms for analog modulation classification	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						modulation recognition; modulation classification; clustering	AUTOMATIC CLASSIFICATION; SIGNALS	This study introduces a comparative study of implementation of clustering algorithms on classification of the analog modulated communication signals. A number of key features are used for characterizing the analog modulation types. Four different clustering algorithms are used for classifying the analog signals. These most representative clustering techniques are K-means clustering, fuzzy C-means clustering, mountain clustering and subtractive clustering. Performance comparison of these clustering algorithms and the advantages and disadvantages of the methods are examined. The validity analysis is performed. The study is supported with computer simulations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These images cover markedly different hydrological conditions during several winter seasons in order to enable the examination of the decrease of the radar backscattering signal during drying-up phases following important flood events. At the floodplain scale, with homogeneous land use and constant topography, the first principal components (PCs) are mainly dominated by the variance related to the changing areas. The PCs are thus mainly controlled by subsurface and surface water dynamics. The field observations of a densely equipped piezometric network in the floodplain are used to calculate a mean soil saturation index (SSI) continuously. A classification scheme, based on the PCs and k-means algorithm, leads to the segmentation of the floodplain into several hydrological behaviour classes with distinctive responses versus changing moisture conditions. To validate this classification method with ground-based estimations, the relation between the mean backscattering values of microplots within each PCA-derived hydrological class and the water table measurements, expressed by means of the SSI, is evaluated. Results show that each class of microplots is characterized by the slope of the 'backscattering-SSI' function and by the SSI threshold value at which groundwater resurgence appears. The water ponding implies very low signal return due to the specular backscattering effect on the water surface. Based on established relationships between measured initial water table depths, runoff coefficients and rainfall-induced water table rises, these results are used to discuss the potential of SAR-derived information in flood management applications.

A key aspect for building specific tariff structures is the identification of the consumption patterns of the customers, in order to form specific customer classes containing customers exhibiting similar patterns. This paper illustrates and compares the results obtained by using various unsupervised clustering algorithms (modified follow-the-leader, hierarchical clustering, K-means, fuzzy K-means) and the self-organizing maps to group together customers with similar electrical behavior. Furthermore, this paper discusses and compares various techniques-Sammon map, principal component analysis (PCA), and curvilinear component analysis (CCA)-able to reduce the size of the clustering input data set, in order to allow for storing a relatively small amount of data in the database of the distribution service provider for customer classification purposes. The effectiveness of the classifications obtained with the algorithms tested is compared in terms of a set of clustering validity indicators. Results obtained on a set of nonresidential customers are presented.

J	Yun, CH; Chuang, KT; Chen, MS				Yun, CH; Chuang, KT; Chen, MS			Adherence clustering: an efficient method for mining market-basket clusters	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						data mining; clustering market-basket data; category-based adherence; k-todes	K-MEANS ALGORITHM	We explore in this paper the efficient clustering of market-basket data. Different from those of the traditional data, the features of market-basket data are known to be of high dimensionality and sparsity. Without explicitly considering the presence of the taxonomy, most prior efforts on clustering market-basket data can be viewed as dealing with items in the leaf level of the taxonomy tree. Clustering transactions across different levels of the taxonomy is of great importance for marketing strategies as well as for the result representation of the clustering techniques for market-basket data. In view of the features of market-basket data, we devise in this paper a novel measurement, called the category-based adherence, and utilize this measurement to perform the clustering. With this category-based adherence measurement, we develop an efficient clustering algorithm, called algorithm k-todes, for market-basket data with the objective to minimize the category-based adherence. The distance of an item to a given cluster is defined as the number of links between this item and its nearest tode. The category-based adherence of a transaction to a cluster is then defined as the average distance of the items in this transaction to that cluster. A validation model based on information gain is also devised to assess the quality of clustering for market-basket data. As validated by both real and synthetic datasets, it is shown by our experimental results, with the taxonomy information, algorithm k-todes devised in this paper significantly outperforms the prior works in both the execution efficiency and the clustering quality as measured by information gain, indicating the usefulness of category-based adherence in market-basket data clustering.

J	Kao, Y; Fu, SC				Kao, Y; Fu, SC			An ant-based clustering algorithm for manufacturing cell design	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						ant algorithms; cell formation problems; cellular manufacturing	GROUP-TECHNOLOGY; DISTANCE MEASURES; SIMILARITY; EXTENSION	This paper proposes a new part clustering algorithm that uses the concept of ant-based clustering in order to resolve machine cell formation problems. The three-phase algorithm mainly utilizes distributed agents which mimic the way real ants collect similar objects to form meaningful piles. In the first phase, an ant-based clustering model is adopted to form the initial part families. For the purpose of part clustering, a part similarity coefficient is modified and used in the similarity density function of the model. In the second phase, the K-means method is employed in order to achieve a better grouping result. In the third phase, artificial ants are used again to merge the small, refined part families into larger part families in a hierarchical manner. This would increase the flexibility of determining the number of final part families for the factory layout designer. The proposed algorithm has been developed into a software system called the ant-based part clustering system (APCS). In addition to part family formation, APCS performs the tasks of machine assignment and performance evaluation. Finally, performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm was conducted by testing some well-known problems from literature. The evaluation results show that the algorithm is able to solve the cell formation problems effectively.

J	Gonzales-Barron, U; Butler, F				Gonzales-Barron, U; Butler, F			A comparison of seven thresholding techniques with the k-means clustering algorithm for measurement of bread-crumb features by digital image analysis	JOURNAL OF FOOD ENGINEERING			English	Article						image analysis; bread; thresholding; crumb features	SELECTION METHOD; GRAIN; SEGMENTATION; TEXTURE	The suitability of seven thresholding methods (six algorithms: isodata, Otsu, minimum error, moment-preserving, Pun and fuzzy; and a manual method) to consistently segment bread crumb images was investigated in comparison with the previously reported k-means clustering technique. Thresholding performance was assessed by two criteria: uniformity and busyness of the binary images. Crumb features (cell density, mean cell area, cell uniformity and void fraction) were computed for each optimal threshold on 135 bread slice images. Slight variations in threshold led to substantial variations in crumb feature values, with cell uniformity and void fraction being more sensitive than the others. The manual method was inadequate for quantification of cell uniformity and void fraction. The fuzzy, Otsu, isodata and moment-preserving methods yielded good and consistent binary images. Although the fuzzy method showed relatively higher amount of busyness than the other methods, it was able to perform well on images with large void areas. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Nagarajan, R				Nagarajan, R			Effect of coarse-graining on detrended fluctuation analysis	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						detrended fluctuation analysis; coarse-graining; k-means		Several studies have investigated the scaling behavior in naturally occurring biological and physical processes using techniques Such as detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). Data acquisition is an inherent part of these studies and maps the continuous process into digital data. The resulting digital data is discretized in amplitude and time, and shall be referred to as coarse-grained realization in the present study. Since coarse-graining precedes scaling exponent analysis, it is important to understand its effects on scaling exponent estimators such as DFA. In this brief communication, k-means clustering is used to generate coarse-grained realizations of data sets with different correlation properties, namely: anti-correlated noise, long-range correlated noise and uncorrelated noise. It is shown that the coarse-graining can significantly affect the scaling exponent estimates. It is also shown that scaling exponent can be reliably estimated even at low levels of coarse-graining and the number of the Clusters required varies across the data sets with different correlation properties.

Acquired using a microscopic mapping approach with the sample volume of similar to 2 mu m(3), these spectra were compared with the ones of the commercially available actin, DNA, collagen (type I), triolein etc. Some spectra were distinguished and identified and characterize the morphological element's like cell cytoplasm, extracellular matrix etc. The cell nucleus spectrum was also obtained by K-means cluster analysis. The correlation analysis showed that the spectrum from a morphological element is highly correlated with that from the corresponding purified chemical. The spectroscopic characterization of these morphological elements was then investigated. This study is helpful to understanding the chemical/morphological basis of the Raman spectrum and designing the Raman microspectroscopic model of human breast tissue.

J	Xu, Y; Liu, C; Clark, JC; Whitsett, JA				Xu, Y; Liu, C; Clark, JC; Whitsett, JA			Functional genomic responses to cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and CFTR Delta 508 in the lung	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Review							FACTOR-BINDING PROTEIN-3; GROWTH-FACTOR-I; NONSELECTIVE CATION CHANNEL; INDUCIBLE EARLY GENE-1; FATTY-ACID-METABOLISM; OXIDATIVE STRESS; CHLORIDE CHANNELS; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; MEDIATES APOPTOSIS; ARACHIDONIC-ACID	Cystic fibrosis (CF), a common lethal pulmonary disorder in Caucasians, is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene ( CFTR) that disturbs fluid homeostasis and host defense in target organs. The effects of CFTR and Delta 508-CFTR were assessed in transgenic mice that 1) lack CFTR expression (Cftr(-/-)); 2) express the human Delta 508 CFTR (CFTR Delta 508); 3) overexpress the normal human CFTR (CFTRtg) in respiratory epithelial cells. Genes were selected from Affymetrix Murine GeneChips analysis and subjected to functional classification, k-means clustering, promoter cis-elements/modules searching, literature mining, and pathway exploring. Genomic responses to Cftr(-/-) were not corrected by expression of CFTR Delta 508. Genes regulating host defense, inflammation, fluid and electrolyte transport were similarly altered in Cftr(-/-) and CFTR Delta 508 mice. CFTR Delta 508 induced a primary disturbance in expression of genes regulating redox and antioxidant systems. Genomic responses to CFTRtg were modest and were not associated with lung pathology. CFTRtg and CFTR Delta 508 induced genes encoding heat shock proteins and other chaperones but did not activate the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway. RNAs encoding proteins that directly interact with CFTR were identified in each of the CFTR mouse models, supporting the hypothesis that CFTR functions within amultiprotein complex whose members interact at the level of protein-protein interactions and gene expression. Promoters of genes influenced by CFTR shared common regulatory elements, suggesting that their co-expression may be mediated by shared regulatory mechanisms. Genes and pathways involved in the response to CFTR may be of interest as modifiers of CF.

To study the regulatory events controlling pigment-protein complex assembly, including the biosynthesis of metabolic precursors and pigment end products, etiolated Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were irradiated with continuous red light (Rc), which led to rapid greening, or continuous far-red light (FRc), which did not result in visible greening, and subjected to analysis by oligonucleotide microarrays and targeted metabolite profiling. An analysis using BioPathAt, a bioinformatic tool that allows the Visualization of post-genomic data sets directly on biochemical pathway maps, indicated that in Rc-treated seedlings mRNA expression and metabolite patterns were tightly correlated (e.g., Calvin cycle, biosynthesis of chlorophylls, carotenoids, isoprenoid quinones, thylakoid lipids, sterols, and amino acids). K-means clustering revealed that gene expression patterns across various biochemical pathways were very similar in Rc- and FRc-treated seedlings (despite the visible phenotypic differences), whereas a principal component analysis of metabolite pools allowed a clear distinction between both treatments (in accordance with the visible phenotype). Our results illustrate the general importance of integrative approaches to correlate post-genomic data sets with phenotypic outcomes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A prospective study of a large set of three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of spinal deformities in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Objectives. To determine the value of fuzzy clustering techniques to automatically detect clinically relevant 3D curve patterns within this set of 3D spine models. Summary of Background Data. Classification is important for the assessment of AIS and has been mainly used to guide surgical treatment. Current classification systems are based on visual curve pattern identification using two-dimensional radiologic measurements but remain controversial because of their low interobserver and intraobserver reliability. A clinically useful 3D classification remains to be found. Methods. An unsupervised learning algorithm, fuzzy k-means clustering, was applied on 409 3D spine models. Analysis of data distribution using clinical parameters was performed by studying similar curve patterns, near each cluster center identified. Results. The algorithm determined that the entire sample of models could be segmented in five easily differentiated curve patterns similar to those of the Lenke and King classifications. Furthermore, a system with 12 classes made possible the identification of subpatterns of spinal deformity with true 3D components. Conclusions. Automatic and clinically relevant 3D classification of AIS is possible using an unsupervised learning algorithm. This approach can now be used to build a relevant 3D classification of AIS using appropriate key features of 3D models selected by a panel of expert spinal deformity surgeons.

The subjects ran at 3.3 in s(-1) over a 16.5 m long running track, with a built-in pressure platform mounted on top of a force platform. Peak pressures, regional impulses and relative regional impulses were measured. These variables were found to be reliable (all intra class correlation coefficients above 0.75) and, except for the heel areas, gender and asymmetry effects could be neglected. Highest peak pressures were found under the heel due to large impact forces during initial contact phase (ICP). In the forefoot, the highest peak pressure was found under the second metatarsal (64.2 +/- 21.1 N cm(-2)). Compared to walking data, overall higher peak pressures and impulses and difference in hallux loading were found during barefoot jogging. Four pressure loading patterns were identified using a K-means cluster analysis, based on the relative regional impulses underneath the forefoot: medial M-1 pattern, medial M-2 pattern, central pattern and central-lateral pattern. These four pressure loading patterns could help in the functional interpretation of the foot behaviour during the stance phase in slow running. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Laszlo, M; Mukherjee, S				Laszlo, M; Mukherjee, S			A genetic algorithm using hyper-quadtrees for low-dimensional K-means clustering	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						k-means algorithm; clustering; genetic algorithms; quadtrees; optimal partition; center selection	THEOREM	The k-means algorithm is widely used for clustering because of its computational efficiency. Given n points in d-dimensional space and the number of desired clusters k, k-means seeks a set of k cluster centers so as to minimize the sum of the squared Euclidean distance between each point and its nearest cluster center. However, the algorithm is very sensitive to the initial selection of centers and is likely to converge to partitions that are significantly inferior to the global optimum. We present a genetic algorithm (GA) for evolving centers in the k-means algorithm that simultaneously identifies good partitions for a range of values around a specified k. The set of centers is represented using a hyper-quadtree constructed on the data. This representation is exploited in our GA to generate an initial population of good centers and to support a novel crossover operation that selectively passes good subsets of neighboring centers from parents to offspring by swapping subtrees.

J	Fukumoto, F; Suzuki, Y				Fukumoto, F; Suzuki, Y			Generating category hierarchy for classifying large corpora	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						category hierarchies; k-means; log loss function	MODEL; CLASSIFICATION	We address the problem of dealing with large collections of data, and investigate the use of automatically constructing domain specific category hierarchies to improve text classification. We use two well-known techniques, the partitioning clustering method called k-means and loss function, to create the category hierarchy. The k-means method involves iterating through the data that the system is permitted to classify during each iteration and construction of a hierarchical structure. In general, the number of clusters k is not given beforehand. Therefore, we used a loss function that measures the degree of disappointment in any differences between the true distribution over inputs and the learner's prediction to select the appropriate number of clusters k. Once the optimal number of k is selected, the procedure is repeated for each cluster. Our evaluation using the 1996 Reuters corpus, which consists of 806,791 documents, showed that automatically constructing hierarchies improves classification accuracy.

All Clustering algorithms applied, both hierarchical and K-means, invariably selected the same six "leader" genes involved in controlling the cell cycle of human T lymphocytes. Relations of the six genes to experimental data describing switching between stages of cell cycle of human T lymphocytes are discussed.

J	Wang, L; Khan, L				Wang, Lei; Khan, Latifur			Automatic image annotation and retrieval using weighted feature selection	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Workshop on Multimedia and Web Design	DEC   13, 2004	Miami, FL			automatic image annotation; subspace clustering algorithm	PICTURES	The development of technology generates huge amounts of non-textual information, such as images. An efficient image annotation and retrieval system is highly desired. Clustering algorithms make it possible to represent visual features of images with finite symbols. Based on this, many statistical models, which analyze correspondence between visual features and words and discover hidden semantics, have been published. These models improve the annotation and retrieval of large image databases. However, image data usually have a large number of dimensions. Traditional clustering algorithms assign equal weights to these dimensions, and become confounded in the process of dealing with these dimensions. In this paper, we propose weighted feature selection algorithm as a solution to this problem. For a given cluster, we determine relevant features based on histogram analysis and assign greater weight to relevant features as compared to less relevant features. We have implemented various different models to link visual tokens with keywords based on the clustering results of K-means algorithm with weighted feature selection and without feature selection, and evaluated performance using precision, recall and correspondence accuracy using benchmark dataset. The results show that weighted feature selection is better than traditional ones for automatic image annotation and retrieval.

Patterns of mother and father parenting and child cognitive outcomes at 24 and 36 months	PARENTING-SCIENCE AND PRACTICE			English	Article							INFANT INTERACTION; BEHAVIOR; PLAY; METAANALYSIS; SENSITIVITY; ATTACHMENT; FAMILIES; CONTEXT; MODEL	Objective. This study examined parenting patterns in a sample of low-income couples and the impact of those patterns on young children's cognitive out comes. Design. Interactions between 237 mothers, fathers, and their 2-year-old children were examined among coresident mothers and fathers or father figures who participated in the Early Head Start Research and Evaluation Project's Father and Child Interaction During Toddlerhood Study (FACITS). Scores on 6 parenting scales were entered into K-means cluster analyses to determine. whether different parenting patterns emerged by gender. Analyses of covariance were used to examine how the behavior of each parent alone and both parents jointly was associated with child cognitive outcomes concurrently and 1 year later. Results. Mothers and fathers exhibited similar parenting patterns, with Highly Supportive (43% of mothers, 34% of fathers), Somewhat Supportive (35%, 43%), Detached (8%, 15%), and Negative (14%, 8%) clusters emerging for both genders. However, differences emerged between the Detached and Negative mother and father clusters, with higher detachment among Detached mothers and higher negativity among Negative fathers. For mothers at both time points and fathers at 36 months, children with Highly Supportive parents had higher Bayley Mental Development Index (MDI) scores than children in the 2 non-Supportive clusters, controlling for parent demographics and income. Children with 2 Supportive parents scored higher on the Bayley MDI than all other children, whereas those with no Supportive parents were particularly disadvantaged. Having at least 1 Supportive mother or father benefited children's cognitive development over having none. Conclusions.

J	Chou, CH; Lin, CC; Liu, YH; Chang, F				Chou, CH; Lin, CC; Liu, YH; Chang, F			A prototype classification method and its use in a hybrid solution for multiclass pattern recognition	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm; handwritten character recognition; hybrid classifier; K-means clustering algorithm; prototype learning; support vector machine	NEAREST-NEIGHBOR RULE; CHARACTER-RECOGNITION; HANDWRITTEN	In this paper, we propose a prototype classification method that employs a learning process to determine both the number and the location of prototypes. This learning process decides whether to stop adding prototypes according to a certain termination condition, and also adjusts the location of prototypes using either the K-means (KM) or the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithms. When the prototype classification rnethod is applied, the support vector machine (SVM) method can be used to post-process the top-rank candidates obtained during the prototype learning or matching process. We apply this hybrid solution to handwriting recognition and address the convergence behavior and runtime consumption of the prototype construction process, and discuss how to combine our prototype classifier with SVM classifiers to form an effective hybrid classifier.

We construct GMMs over a variety of different color and texture feature spaces, with a view to the retrieval of textured color images from databases. We compare Supervised classification results for different choices of color and texture features using the Vistex database, and explore the best set of features and the best GMM Configuration for this task. In addition we introduce several methods for combining the 'color' and 'structure' information in order to improve the classification performances. We then apply the resulting models to the classification of texture databases and to the classification of man-made and natural areas in aerial images. We compare the GMM model with other models in the literature, and show an overall improvement in performance. (c) 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) was measured simultaneously with the EM38DD in the vertical and horizontal orientation, allowing the profile ratio (PR) to be calculated. Based on a fuzzy k-means classification the PR map was classified into two zones with a mean PR difference of 10%. A detailed drawing of the polygonal network served as a validation. A cross-tabulation yielded an overall accuracy of 81% when only wedges wider than 0.25 m wide were considered. The overall accuracy increased to 83% by introducing an uncertainty zone. Due to differences in composition between the wedge fillings and the host material, the PR was found to be a useful indicator of these phenomena. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Bagamery, FA; Turban, L; Igloi, F				Bagamery, FA; Turban, L; Igloi, F			Critical behavior at the interface between two systems belonging to different universality classes	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							CORNER SPONTANEOUS MAGNETIZATION; DEFECT PLANES; FREE SURFACES; ISING-MODEL; CONFORMAL-INVARIANCE; 3-SPIN INTERACTIONS; TRIANGULAR LATTICE; GRAIN-BOUNDARIES; TRANSITIONS	We consider the critical behavior at an interface which separates two semi-infinite subsystems belonging to different universality classes, thus having different sets of critical exponents, but having a common transition temperature. We solve this problem analytically in the frame of phi(k) mean-field theory, which is then generalized using phenomenological scaling considerations. A large variety of interface critical behavior is obtained which is checked numerically on the example of two-dimensional q-state Potts models with 2 <= q <= 4. Weak interface couplings are generally irrelevant, resulting in the same critical behavior at the interface as for a free surface. With strong interface couplings, the interface remains ordered at the bulk transition temperature. More interesting is the intermediate situation, the special interface transition, when the critical behavior at the interface involves new critical exponents, which, however, can be expressed in terms of the bulk and surface exponents of the two subsystems. We discuss also the smooth or discontinuous nature of the order parameter profile.

We develop a possible mechanism of establishment of such a low temperature phase, in which the driving force of the phase transition is the electron-phonon interaction with coupling depending on both the momentum transfer (q) and the momentum of the scattered electron (k). Mean field treatment is applied to obtain the excitation spectrum, correlation functions such as the density correlator and the optical conductivity, and the effective mass of the phase excitation. The fluctuation of the order parameter leads to the sliding of the UCDW as a whole. In the absence of impurities, we calculated the effect of this fluctuation on the optical properties. The inclusion of the collective mode significantly alters the optical conductivity, and leads to an effective mass which is nonmonotonic in temperature as opposed to conventional CDWs.

J	Deng, YX; Wilson, JP				Deng, YX; Wilson, JP			The role of attribute selection in GIS representations of the biophysical environment	ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS			English	Article						attribute selection; environmental modeling; fuzzy c-means landform classification	DIGITAL ELEVATION MODELS; FUZZY-C-MEANS; GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; K-MEANS; LANDSCAPE INVESTIGATIONS; LANDFORM CLASSIFICATION; TOPOGRAPHIC ATTRIBUTES; SOIL PROPERTIES; GRID SIZE; TERRAIN	This article questions the arbitrary selection of input attributes for the definition of landform classes and other fiat objects that are used to represent the biophysical environment in geographic information science. It suggests that attribute selection influences the characterization of both geographic and attribute space in these applications. Hence digital elevation model-based fuzzy c-means landform classification relies on sensible selection of terrain attributes to generate fuzzy landform classes (memberships) with biophysical meanings. A case study employed several sets of sensitivity tests and evaluated how selections of terrain attributes may affect the outputs of fuzzy c-means landform classifications. The results showed an average classification difference of 37 percent when different numbers of attributes are used and 18 percent when similar terrain attributes are swapped. Effects of attribute selection also show obvious dependence on spatial resolution and number of classes. These results indicate that the current approach of selecting terrain attributes (not only for landform classifications but also for other applications) according to tacit expert knowledge needs to be better justified. Because the fuzzy c-means classification method is essentially data-driven, the adoption of an exploratory approach as a part of this method is crucial. Such an approach may help to identify membership distributions (and corresponding classifications) that summarize the correspondence between landforms and specific biophysical patterns.

J	Lu, HC; Chang, CL; Hsieh, JC				Lu, HC; Chang, CL; Hsieh, JC			Classification of PM10 distributions in Taiwan	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						self-organizing maps; lognormal distribution; hierarchical clustering; K-means; air-quality basins	SELF-ORGANIZING MAP; STATISTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; METEOROLOGY; ALGORITHM; PATTERNS; OZONE	Daily average PM10 concentrations of 71 stations in Taiwan in wintertime (October to March) and summertime periods (April to September) were fitted individually by a lognormal distribution for a 2 yr period (2001 to 2002). The distribution parameters (geometric mean and geometric standard deviation) in wintertime were used to determine the air-quality basins for PM10 by utilizing three clustering techniques, viz. of hierarchical clustering (Ward's method), non-hierarchical clustering (K-means) and two-level approach (self-organizing maps neural network, then K-means clustering). All three techniques suggested that 71 air-monitoring stations in Taiwan can be divided into five air-quality basins which are located in northern, central, eastern, southwestern and southern Taiwan, respectively. The sequence of PM10 pollution levels in the five basins is southern Taiwan > southwestern Taiwan > central Taiwan > northern Taiwan > eastern Taiwan. Geometric means and geometric standard deviations in each of the five air-quality basins were significantly different from each other for the two-level approach method by the Waller-Duncan k-ratio t-test (k = 100, P = 0.05), suggesting that the two-level approach method is best among the three clustering methods. The clustering results of five air-quality basins in Taiwan are useful to decide the corresponding control strategy at different air-quality basins.(c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Acute postoperative tooth extraction pain is assessed and treated as a physiological (sensory) pain while chronic pain is a biopsychosocial problem. The purpose of this study was to assess whether psychological and social changes Occur in the acute pain state. Methods: A biopsychosocial pain questionnaire was completed by 438 subjects (165 males, 273 females) with acute postoperative pain at 24 hours following the surgical extraction of teeth and compared with 273 subjects (78 males, 195 females) with chronic orofacial pain. Statistical methods used a k-means cluster analysis. Results: Three clusters were identified in the acute pain group: 'unaffected', 'disabled' and 'depressed, anxious and disabled'. Psychosocial effects showed 24.8 per cent feeling 'distress/suffering' and 15.1 per cent 'sad and depressed'. Females reported higher pain intensity and more distress, depression and inadequate medication for pain relief (p<0.001). Distress and depression were associated with higher pain intensity. The developed questionnaire had tested reliability (test-retest r=0.89) and estimated validity. Conclusion: Cluster analysis showed constituent groups with a range of psychosocial effects in acute postoperative dental extraction pain and is associated with an increase in pain intensity.

J	Paterlini, S; Krink, T				Paterlini, S; Krink, T			Differential evolution and particle swarm optimisation in partitional clustering	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						cluster analysis; partitional clustering; differential evolution; particle swarm optimisation; genetic algorithms	LENGTH GENETIC ALGORITHM; K-MEANS ALGORITHM; PATTERN-CLASSIFICATION	Many partitional clustering algorithms based on genetic algorithms (GA) have been proposed to tackle the problem of finding the optimal partition of a data set. Very few studies considered alternative stochastic search heuristics other than GAs or simulated annealing. Two promising algorithms for numerical optimisation, which are hardly known outside the search heuristics field, are particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and differential evolution (DE). The performance of GAs for a representative point evolution approach to clustering is compared with PSO and DE. The empirical results show that DE is clearly and consistently superior compared to GAs and PSO for hard clustering problems, both with respect to precision as well as robustness (reproducibility) of the results. Only for simple data sets, the GA and PSO can obtain the same quality of results. Apart from superior performance, DE is easy to implement and requires hardly any parameter tuning compared to substantial tuning for GAs and PSOs. Our study shows that DE rather than GAs should receive primary attention in partitional clustering algorithms. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, several recent studies have questioned the accuracy and utility of such evaluation, mainly because of significant intra- and interobserver variations in histological interpretation. To examine the possibility that biochemical or molecular signatures of endometrium may prove to be more useful, we have investigated whole- genome molecular phenotyping (54,600 genes and expressed sequence tags) of this tissue sampled across the cycle in 28 normo-ovulatory women, using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays. Unsupervised principal component analysis of all samples revealed that samples self-cluster into four groups consistent with histological phenotypes of proliferative (PE), early-secretory (ESE), mid-secretory (MSE), and late-secretory (LSE) endometrium. Independent hierarchical clustering analysis revealed equivalent results, with two major dendrogram branches corresponding to PE/ESE and MSE/LSE and sub-branching into the four respective phases with heterogeneity among samples within each sub-branch. K-means clustering of genes revealed four major patterns of gene expression (high in PE, high in ESE, high in MSE, and high in LSE), and gene ontology analysis of these clusters demonstratedcycle-phase-specific biological processes and molecular functions. Six samples with ambiguous histology were identically assignable to a cycle phase by both principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering. Additionally, pairwise comparisons of relative gene expression across the cycle revealed genes/families that clearly distinguish the transitions of PE -> ESE, ESE -> MSE, and MSE -> LSE, including receptomes and signaling pathways. Select genes were validated by quantitative RT-PCR. Overall, the results demonstrate that endometrial samples obtained by two different sampling techniques (biopsy and curetting hysterectomy specimens) from subjects who are as normal as possible in a human study and including those with unknown histology, can be classified by their molecular signatures and correspond to known phases of the menstrual cycle with identical results using two independent analytical methods. Also, the results enable global identification of biological processes and molecular mechanisms that occur dynamically in the endometrium in the changing steroid hormone milieu across the menstrual cycle in normo-ovulatory women. The results underscore the potential of gene expression profiling for developing molecular diagnostics of endometrial normalcy and abnormalities and identifying molecular targets for therapeutic purposes in endometrial disorders.

The main constituents were terpene hydrocarbons, especially alpha-pinene, myrcene and germacrene D in the oils from berries and alpha-pinene, beta-phellandrene and Delta 3-carene in the oils from leaves. The results of the analyses were submitted to k-means partitioning and principal component analysis, which allowed the distinction of two compositions in the berry oils (differentiated by the contents of alpha-pinene, myrcene and germacrene D) and in the leaf oils (differentiated by the contents of alpha-pinene, beta-phellandrene and Delta 3-carene). (Z)-6-Pentadecen-2-one, an unusual alkenone present in several samples of leaf oil, was identified using C-13-NMR spectroscopy. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The results were submitted to chemometric analysis (k-means clustering and principal component analysis). Two principal clusters of equal importance were distinguished within the essential oil of the individuals of L. dentata. The samples belonging to cluster I were characterized by a very high content of 1,8-cineole (mean value 48%). Conversely, the mean composition of the samples of cluster H were dominated by 1,8-cineole, beta-pinene, trans-pinocarveol and linalool. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

B.C.) site in northwest Alabama- Samples analyzed using ICP-AES for aluminum (Al), barium (Ba), calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), sodium (Na), phosphorous (P), strontium (Sr), sulfur (S), and zinc (Zn) and suggest that cultural features differ chemically from geogenic sediments in several ways: (a) K-means cluster analyses indicate that features of known origin and suspected features of the same origin cluster together, thereby allowing for a preliminary separation into discrete functionalities; (b) phosphorus serves as an indicator of human occupation intensity; and (c) Sr/Ca and K/P ratios help identify anthropogenic materials. Micromorphological observations allow for a finer subdivision of feature types and help highlight postdepositional processes affecting cave sediments, and interpretation of activity at the site. These findings show that feature diversity and occupation intensity increased through time, peaking during the Middle Archaic. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Molla, KI; Hirose, K; Minematsu, N				Molla, KI; Hirose, K; Minematsu, N			Separation of mixed audio signals by decomposing Hilbert spectrum with modified EMD	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTER SCIENCES			English	Article						audio source indexing; audio source separation; empirical mode decomposition (EMD); Hilbert spectrum	EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION	The Hilbert transformation together with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) produces Hilbert spectrum (HS) which is a fineresolution time-frequency representation of any nonlinear and nonstationary signal. The EMD decomposes the mixture signal into some oscillatory components each one is called intrinsic mode function (IMF). Some modification of the conventional EMD is proposed here. The instantaneous frequency of every real valued IMF component is computed with Hilbert transformation. The HS is constructed by arranging the instantaneous frequency spectra of IMF components. The HS of the mixture signal is decomposed into subspaces corresponding to the component sources. The decomposition is performed by applying independent component analysis (ICA) and Kulback-Leibler divergence based K-means clustering on the selected number of bases derived from HS of the mixture. The time domain source signals are assembled by applying some post processing on the subspaces. We have produced experimental results using the proposed separation technique.

This paper describes a new single-channel in-car speech enhancement method that estimates the log spectra of speech at a close-talking microphone based on the nonlinear regression of the log spectra of noisy signal captured by a distant microphone and the estimated noise. The proposed method provides significant overall quality improvements in our subjective evaluation on the regression-enhanced speech, and performed best in most objective measures. Based on our isolated word recognition experiments conducted under 15 real car environments, the proposed adaptive nonlinear regression approach shows an advantage in average relative word error rate (WER) reductions of 50.8% and 13.1%, respectively, compared to original noisy speech and ETSI advanced front-end (ETSI ES 202 050).

SpeedScreen relies on the screening of compound mixtures with various target proteins and uses fast size-exclusion chromatography to separate target-bound from unbound substances. After disintegration of the target-binder complex, the binder molecules are identified by their molecular masses using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The authors report an analysis of the molecular properties of hits obtained with SpeedScreen on 26 targets screened within the past few years at Novartis using this technology. Affinity-based SpeedScreen is a robust high-throughput screening technology that does not accumulate frequent hitters or potential covalent binders. The hits are representative of the most commonly identified scaffold classes observed for known drugs. Validated SpeedScreen hits tend to be enriched on more lipophilic and larger-molecular-weight compounds compared to the whole library. The potential for a reduced SpeedScreen screening set to be used in case only limited protein quantities are available is evaluated. Such a reduced compound set should also maximize the coverage of the high-performing regions of the chemical property and class spaces; chemoinformatics methods including genetic algorithms and divisive K-means clustering are used for this aim.

To make this concept usable in practice for library design, we studied several complexity measures on the biological activity of ligand molecules. We applied the historical IC50/EC50 summary data of 160 assays run at Novartis covering a diverse range of targets, among them kinases, proteases. GPCRs, and protein-protein interactions. and compared this to the background of "inactive" compounds which have been screened for 2 years but have never shown any activity in any primary screen. As complexity measures we used the number of structural features present in various molecular fingerprints and descriptors. We found generally that with increasing activity of the ligands, their average complexity also increased, and we could therefore establish a minimum number of structural features in each descriptor needed for biological activity. Especially well suited in this context were the Similog keys and circular substructure fingerprints. These are those descriptors, which also perform especially well in the identification of bioactive compounds by similarity search, suggesting that structural features encoded in these descriptors have a high relevance for bioactivity. Since the number of features correlates with the number of atoms present in the molecule, also the number of atoms serves as a reasonable complexity measure and larger molecules have, in general, higher activities. Due to the relationship between feature counts and densities on one hand and biological activity on the other, the size bias present in almost all similarity coefficients becomes especially important. Diversity selections using these coefficients can influence the overall complexity of the resulting set of molecules, which has an impact on the biological activity that they exhibit. Using sphere-exclusion based diversity selection methods, such as OptiSim to-ether with the Tanimoto dissimilarity, the average feature count distribution of the resulting selections is shifted toward lower complexity than that of the original set, particularly when applying tight diversity constraints. This size bias reduces the fraction of molecules in the subsets having the complexity required for a high, sub-micromolar activity. None of the diversity selection methods studied, namely OptiSim, divisive K-means clustering, and self-organizing maps, yielded subsets covering the activity space of the IC50 summary data set better than Subsets selected randomly.

The responses share common elements with reactions to many other stresses, such as challenges by osmotic fluctuations, pathogens, mechanical interference, or cold stress. Also, hormones, such as ABA, ethylene, and jasmonic acid, play important roles in salt-stress signalling and adaptation. Publicly available and our own transcript profiling data are used here to dissect gene regulation under salt stress in A. thaliana Col-0. Applying the clustering method 'fuzzy k-means clustering' on 1500 strongly regulated genes, the salt-stress response could be categorized into distinct segments. Fewer than 25% of the regulated genes are salt stress-specific, while the majority also responded to other stresses and/or hormone treatments. Significantly, roots and shoots showed differences in hormone responsiveness, and early and late responses correlated with different signalling events. A network begins to emerge, revealing the basis of cross-talk between high salinity and other stresses.

J	Rao, AR; Srinivas, VV				Rao, AR; Srinivas, VV			Regionalization of watersheds by hybrid-cluster analysis	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						regionalization; flood-frequency analysis; L-moments; cluster analysis	FLOOD FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; COPHENETIC CORRELATION; HOMOGENEOUS REGIONS; SIMILARITY; VALIDATION; BASINS	Regionalization methods are often used in hydrology for regional trend analysis and frequency analysis of floods, low flows and other variables. During the last two decades considerable effort has gone into analysis and development of regionalization procedures. However, as no single procedure has been demonstrated to yield universally acceptable results, several methods of regionalization are in use. In this paper, three hybrid-clustering algorithms, which use partitional clustering procedure to identify groups of similar catchments by refining the clusters derived from agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms, are investigated to determine their effectiveness in regionalization. The hierarchical clustering algorithms used are single linkage, complete linkage and Ward's algorithms, while the partitional clustering algorithm used is the K-means algorithm. The effectiveness of the hybrid-cluster analysis in regionalization is investigated by using data from watersheds in Indiana, USA. Further, four cluster validity indices, namely cophenetic correlation coefficient, average silhouette width, Dunn's index and Davies-Bouldin index are tested to determine their effectiveness in identifying optimal partition provided by the clustering algorithms. The regions given by the clustering algorithms are, in general, not statistically homogeneous. The hybrid-cluster analysis is found to be useful in minimizing the effort needed to identify homogeneous regions. The hybrid of Ward's and K-means algorithms is recommended for use. The hybrid method provides enough flexibility and it offers prospects for improvement in regionalization studies. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

J	Du, Q; Gunzburger, M; Ju, LL; Wang, XQ				Du, Q; Gunzburger, M; Ju, LL; Wang, XQ			Centroidal voronoi tessellation algorithms for image compression, segmentation, and multichannel restoration	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL IMAGING AND VISION			English	Article						Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations; image compression; image segmentation; edge detection; image restoration; k-means		Centroidal Voronoi tessellations (CVT's) are special Voronoi tessellations for which the generators of the tessellation are also the centers of mass (or means) of the Voronoi cells or clusters. CVT's have been found to be useful in many disparate and diverse settings. In this paper, CVT-based algorithms are developed for image compression, image segmenation, and multichannel image restoration applications. In the image processing context and in its simplest form, the CVT-based methodology reduces to the well-known k-means clustering technique. However, by viewing the latter within the CVT context, very useful generalizations and improvements can be easily made. Several such generalizations are exploited in this paper including the incorporation of cluster dependent weights, the incorporation of averaging techniques to treat noisy images, extensions to treat multichannel data, and combinations of the aforementioned. In each case, examples are provided to illustrate the efficiency, flexibility, and effectiveness of CVT-based image processing methodologies.

J	Grubesic, TH				Grubesic, TH			On the application of fuzzy clustering for crime hot spot detection	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE CRIMINOLOGY			English	Article						hot-spot detection; crime; cluster analysis; spatial analysis; geographic information system (GIS)	PATTERN-ANALYSIS; AREAS	One of the fundamental challenges in crime mapping and analysis is pattern recognition. Efforts and methods to detect crime hot-spots, or geographic areas of elevated criminal activity, are wide ranging. For aggregate data, such as total crime events in a census tract(s), measures of spatial autocorrelation have proven useful. For disaggregate data (i.e. individual crime events), kernel density smoothing and non-hierarchical cluster analysis (e.g. k-means), are widely used. Non-hierarchical techniques are particularly effective in delineating geographic space into areas of higher or lower crime concentrations, because each observation is assigned to one and only one cluster. The resulting set of partitions provides clear-cut spatial boundaries that can be used for hot-spot evaluation and interpretation. However, the strength of non-hierarchical methods can also be viewed as a weakness. Although the hard-clustering of observations into a set of discrete clusters is helpful, there are many cases where ambiguity exists in the data. In such cases, a more generalized approach for hot-spot detection would be helpful. The purpose of this paper is to explore the use of a generalized partitioning method known as fuzzy clustering for hot-spot detection. Functional and visual comparisons of fuzzy clustering and two hard-clustering approaches (medoid and k-means), across a range of cluster values are analyzed. The empirical results suggest that a fuzzy clustering approach is better equipped to handle intermediate cases and spatial outliers.

J	Park, HS; Lee, SM; Baik, DK				Park, HS; Lee, SM; Baik, DK			Class-based request control system in multimedia contents service	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE			English	Article								This paper proposed the system and the algorithm for controlling clients' service requests using the CRM of multimedia contents service through client segmentation, based on a site's revenues. Thus, clients with higher profitability will have more chances of accessing media server resources. Likewise, controlling the service requests of all clients will enable controlling the use of network resources. To realize the system, K-Means Method was applied to the analysis of the clients' data as the first step. The clients were classified into four classes (First Class, Second Class, Third Class and Fourth Class). Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the system. The first experiment is the comparison of the number of admitted streams of proposed algorithm with other algorithm. In the second experiment, the renewal rates in the two cases were compared. Specifically, the renewal rates of the group of clients with expired contracts where the new algorithm was applied and those of the control group were evaluated. The renewal rate was higher in the group where the new algorithm was applied, suggesting an improvement in the satisfaction level of clients and revenues. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The average linkage and K-means clustering techniques were used to identify two major weather types during Asian dust events (ADEs, total 26 ADEs with 47 dusty days) of six spring seasons from 1996 to 2001. The first weather type mainly influenced neighboring Asian countries and frequently occurred with ADEs (similar to 23% of ADE cases). It mostly occurred under a surface high (low)-pressure system over the west (east) of the Korean peninsula coupled with an upper-level trough and cutoff low passage over the center of the Korean peninsula. It showed strong advection in the middle/upper troposphere with both a high aerosol index and enhanced coarse particulate matter (PM) loading over Korea. In contrast, the second weather type was mostly associated with long distance or continental-scale transport and occurred less frequently with ADEs (similar to 15%). It appeared with an upper-level trough and a cutoff low vertically connected with a surface low system that was formed by a strong cyclonic vortex over the north of the Korean peninsula. There were weak advection, low aerosol index, and low coarse PM concentration over the Korean peninsula during the second weather type. In addition, it was found to be mostly associated with the trans-Pacific transport of Asian dust to the western coast of North America.

The proposed method is conceptually simple and computationally straightforward, because it does not require any specific statistical models or any convergence criteria. Moreover, unlike most currently existing algorithms that compute the class membership or membership probability for every data point at each iteration, our algorithm sequentially extracts clusters from the given dataset. That is, at each iteration our algorithm strives to identify only one cluster, which will then be deleted from the dataset at the next iteration; this procedure repeats until there are no more significant clusters in the remaining data. Consequently, the number of clusters can be determined automatically by the algorithm. As for the identification and extraction of a cluster, we first locate the cluster center by using a Pearson chi-squared-type statistic on the basis of HD vectors. The partition of the dataset produced by our algorithm is unique and insensitive to the input order of data points. The performance of the proposed algorithm is examined using both simulated and real world datasets. Comparisons with two well-known clustering algorithms, K-modes and AutoClass, show that the proposed algorithm substantially outperforms these competitors, with the classification rate or the information gain typically improved by several orders of magnitude. Computational complexity and run time comparisons are also provided.

J	Zhou, ZH; Tang, W				Zhou, ZH; Tang, W			Clusterer ensemble	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						machine learning; ensemble learning; clustering; unsupervised learning; selective ensemble	NEURAL-NETWORK ENSEMBLES	Ensemble methods that train multiple learners and then combine their predictions have been shown to be very effective in supervised learning. This paper explores ensemble methods for unsupervised learning. Here, an ensemble comprises multiple clusterers. each of which is trained by k-means algorithm with different initial points. The clusters discovered by different clusterers are aligned, i.e. similar clusters are assigned with the same label, by counting their overlapped data items. Then, four methods are developed to combine the aligned clusterers. Experiments show that clustering performance could be significantly improved by ensemble methods, where utilizing mutual information to select a subset of clusterers for weighted voting is a nice choice. Since the proposed methods work by analyzing the clustering results instead of the internal mechanisms of the component clusterers, they are applicable to diverse kinds of clustering algorithms.

J	Avula, SR; Tang, JS; Acton, ST				Avula, SR; Tang, JS; Acton, ST			An object-based image retrieval system for digital libraries	MULTIMEDIA SYSTEMS			English	Article						image retrieval; digital libraries; image segmentation; texture; color; wavelets	SEGMENTATION; SNAKES	A novel approach to clustering for image segmentation and a new object-based image retrieval method are proposed. The clustering is achieved using the Fisher discriminant as an objective function. The objective function is improved by adding a spatial constraint that encourages neighboring pixels to take on the same class label. A six-dimensional feature vector is used for clustering by way of the combination of color and busyness features for each pixel. After clustering, the dominant segments in each class are chosen based on area and used to extract features for image retrieval. The color content is represented using a histogram, and Haar wavelets are used to represent the texture feature of each segment. The image retrieval is segment-based; the user can select a query segment to perform the retrieval and assign weights to the image features. The distance between two images is calculated using the distance between features of the constituent segments. Each image is ranked based on this distance with respect to the query image segment. The algorithm is applied to a pilot database of natural images and is shown to improve upon the conventional classification and retrieval methods. The proposed segmentation leads to a higher number of relevant images retrieved, 83.5% on average compared to 72.8 and 68.7% for the k-means clustering and the global retrieval methods, respectively.

J	Janson, H; Kjelsberg, E				Janson, H; Kjelsberg, E			Factor structure and individual patterns of DSM-IV conduct disorder criteria in adolescent psychiatric inpatients	NORDIC JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						adolescent psychiatry; cluster analysis; conduct disorder; diagnostic criteria; factor analysis	ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR; III-R; CHILDHOOD; BORDERLINE; CHILDREN; GIRLS; RISK	We investigated the factor structure of the DSM-IV conduct disorder ( CD) diagnostic criteria and typical individual patterns of CD subscales in an adolescent inpatient population using detailed hospital records of a Norwegian nationwide sample of 1087 adolescent psychiatric inpatients scored for the 15 DSM-IV CD criteria. Varimax rotated principal components and full-information factor analyses of 12 CD criteria were carried out separately for boys and girls employing two methods. Standardized values on three subscales of CD criteria were subjected to Ward's method of hierarchical cluster analyses followed by k-means relocation employing a double cross-replication design. Similar factor structures emerged regardless of factoring method and gender. With the exception of Criteria 8 ("Fire setting'') and 14 ("Run away from home'') the factor loadings for both genders were in accordance with Loeber's tripartite model, with Aggression, Delinquency, and Rule Breaking factors largely corresponding to Loeber's overt, covert and authority conflict pathways. A five-cluster solution proved highly replicable and interpretable. One cluster gathered adolescents without CD, and the remaining four described groups with different conceptually meaningful constellations of CD criteria, which were not equally prevalent in each gender. Delinquency appeared in all symptomatic clusters. The cluster analytic results highlighted typical forms of expressions of conduct problems, and the fact that these forms may not be equally prevalent in girls and boys even while the underlying structure of conduct problems may be similar across genders. Future research should address the prediction of specific outcomes from CD criteria subscales or constellations.

We then give a learning rate annealing schedule to improve the unsupervised teaming vector quantization (ULVQ) algorithm which uses the winner-take-all competitive learning principle in the self-organizing map (SOM). We also discuss the noisy and outlying problems of a sequential competitive learning algorithm and then propose an alternative learning formula to make the sequential competitive teaming robust to noise and outliers. Combining the proposed learning rate annealing schedule and alternative teaming formula, we propose an alternative learning vector quantization (ALVQ) algorithm. Some discussion and experimental results from comparing ALVQ with ULVQ show the superiority of the proposed method. (c) 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The method involves combining multiple correspondence analysis and k-means in a unified framework. The former is used for uncovering a low-dimensional space of multivariate categorical variables while the latter is used for identifying relatively homogeneous clusters of respondents. The proposed method offers an integrated graphical display that provides information on cluster-based structures inherent in multivariate categorical data as well as the interdependencies among the data. An empirical application is presented which demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed method and how it compares to several extant approaches.

J	Leonard, JT; Roy, K				Leonard, JT; Roy, K			On selection of training and test sets for the development of predictive QSAR models	QSAR & COMBINATORIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						QSAR; HIV protease; CCR5 antagonists; mannitol; piperidinyl amides; ureas; propylamine; validation; K-Means clusters	BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION; ANTI-HIV-1 AGENTS; CCR5 ANTAGONISTS; DERIVATIVES; VALIDATION; INHIBITORS; RECEPTOR	The development of predictive QSAR models depends not only oil the statistical method but also on the algorithm used for the selection of training and test sets. Here. we describe the validation of QSAR models for three data sets with different sizes (n = 35, 56 and 87) based on random division, sorted biological activity data and K-means clusters for the factor scores of the original variable matrix along with/without biological activity values. When the training and test sets were generated by random division or by the activity-range algorithm, predictive models were not obtained in most of the cases. In case of random division of the data sets into training and test sets, there is no correlation between internal and external validation statistics. However, good external validation statistics were obtained when training and test sets were selected based on K-means clusters of factor scores of the descriptor space along with/without the biological activity values. So, the selection of training and test sets should be based on the proximity of the representative points of the test set to representative points of the training set in the multidimensional descriptor space. The concept of closeness is based on the general assumption underlying all QSAR theories: similar compounds have similar activities. Thus, if one wishes to validate a QSAR model, the points of the test set must be close to the points of the training set in the multidimensional descriptor space. Based on the results of several methods for the division of the training and test sets, we propose that K-means-cluster-based division of training and prediction sets can be used as a reliable method of division of data set into training and test sets for developing predictive QSAR models.

J	Bertrand, P; Mufti, GB				Bertrand, P; Mufti, GB			Loevinger's measures of rule quality for assessing cluster stability	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						cluster stability; Monte Carlo test; cluster isolation and cluster cohesion; Loevinger's measure; number of clusters of a partition	VALIDITY	A method is developed for measuring clustering stability under the removal of a few objects from a set of objects to be partitioned. Measures of stability of an individual cluster are defined as Loevinger's measures of rule quality. The stability of an individual cluster can be interpreted as a weighted mean of the inherent stabilities in the isolation and cohesion, respectively, of the examined cluster. The design of the method also enables us to measure the stability of a partition, that can be viewed as a weighted mean of the stability measures of all clusters in the partition. As a consequence, an approach is derived for determining the optimal number of clusters of a partition. Furthermore, using a Monte Carlo test, a significance probability is computed in order to assess how likely any stability measure is, under a null model that specifies the absence of cluster stability. In order to illustrate the potential of the method, stability measures that were obtained by using the batch K-Means algorithm on artificial data sets and on Iris Data are presented.

J	Totaro, N; Guyader, JL				Totaro, N; Guyader, JL			SEA substructuring using cluster analysis: The MIR index	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							COUPLING LOSS FACTORS; STATISTICAL ENERGY ANALYSIS; K-MEANS ALGORITHM; TRANSMISSION; SUBSYSTEMS; PLATES; SOUND	Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) is a powerful tool to describe energy sharing in a complex structure. To apply this method, the structure must be divided into subsystems. One of the main drawback of this method is the difficulty in finding subsystems which verify SEA assumptions. Moreover, the weak coupling between subsystems is not well defined despite it being one of the most important assumptions of SEA. This paper deals with the derivation of a tool to aid decision-making in SEA substructuring. It is based on a cluster analysis to classify energy transfer functions and on principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce data size. The method is applied to three test cases: an L-shaped plate, an assembly of three plates and a complex thin shell structure. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Anomalies can be due to stress for lack of water and/or pollution phenomena and weed presence in agricultural fields. The hyperspectral cube (90-bands ranging from 450 to 900 nm) was acquired from the hill near Segni (RM), approximately 500 in far from the target, by means of electronically tunable filters and 8 bit CCD cameras. Spectral libraries were built using both endmember identification method and extraction of centroids of the clusters obtained from a k-means analysis of the image itself. Two classification methods were applied on the hyperspectral cube: Spectral Angle Mapper (hard) and Mixed Tuned Matching Filters (MTMF). Results show the good capability of the system in detecting areas with an arboreal, shrub or leafage cover, distinguishing between zones with different spectral response. Better results were obtained using spectral library originated by the k-means method. The detected anomalies not correlated to seasonal phenomena suggest a ground true analysis to identify their origin.

J	Beaver, S; Palazoglu, A				Beaver, S; Palazoglu, A			A cluster aggregation scheme for ozone episode selection in the San Francisco, CA Bay Area	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						air quality; k-means ensemble; aggregation; geospatial patterns; episode representativeness	CLASSIFICATION	Cluster analysis is used to determine groups of 8-h ozone episodes occurring between 1996 and 2003 in the San Francisco, CA Bay Area that have similar spatial distributions for ozone composition. An ensemble of randomly initialized runs of a nonhierarchical clustering algorithm (k-means) is aggregated to form a single, hierarchical solution. A proper range for the number of clusters represented in the ensemble ensures a converging, reproducible labeling of the episode days. Four clusters are identified which correspond to different meteorological regimes favorable to ozone buildup. Two modes have anomalous wind patterns likely influenced by offshore low pressure systems and are not representative of summer weather systems in the Bay Area. The other two Clusters capture stagnation of the boundary layer more typical of the Bay Area summer season. One dominant cluster indicates a persistent synoptic state producing some of the highest temperatures and lowest wind speeds during the years studied. The final cluster, often occurring on the last day of multiday exceedance periods, represents an atmospheric transition state from stagnant to more ventilated conditions. The study region can be decomposed into several geographical subregions, each with a single mechanism capable of producing episodes under certain meteorological conditions. Two inland regions are affected by stagnation due to weak marine layer flow, a local valley by precursor transport driven by differential heating, and the region closest the ocean by reversal of the typical shoreward marine flow.

J	Cho, C; Kim, S; Lee, J; Lee, DW				Cho, C; Kim, S; Lee, J; Lee, DW			A tandem clustering process for multimodal datasets	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						multivariate statistics; artificial intelligence; clustering; multimodal dataset; k-means algorithm	EFFICIENT ALGORITHM	Clustering multimodal datasets can be problematic when a conventional algorithm such as k-means is applied due to its implicit assumption of Gaussian distribution of the dataset. This paper proposes a tandem clustering process for multimodal data sets. The proposed method first divides the multimodal dataset into many small pre-clusters by applying k-means or fuzzy k-means algorithm. These pre-clusters are then clustered again by agglomerative hierarchical clustering method using Kullback-Leibler divergence as an initial measure of dissimilarity. Benchmark results show that the proposed approach is not only effective at extracting the multimodal clusters but also efficient in computational time and relatively robust at the presence of outliers.

In order to further demonstrate the proposed approach's capability, a real-world problem of the fright transport industry market segmentation is employed. A questionnaire is designed and surveyed, after which factor analysis extracts the factors from the questionnaire items as the basis of market segmentation. Then the proposed method is used to cluster the customers. The results also indicate that the proposed method is better than the other two methods (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

After establishing that mean-based algorithms converge to wrong solutions in practice, we propose a median-based clustering scheme.

J	Zhong, YF; Zhang, LP; Huang, B; Li, PX				Zhong, YF; Zhang, LP; Huang, B; Li, PX			An unsupervised artificial immune classifier for multi/hyperspectral remote sensing imagery	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						artificial immune system (AIS); clustering; pattern recognition; remote sensing; unsupervised classificationd	SYSTEM; MODEL	A new method in computational intelligence namely artificial immune systems (AIS), which draw inspiration from the vertebrate immune system, have strong capabilities of pattern recognition. Even though AIS have been successfully utilized in several fields, few applications have been reported in remote sensing. Modern commercial imaging satellites, owing to their large volume of high-resolution imagery, offer greater opportunities for automated image analysis. Hence, we propose a novel unsupervised machine-learning algorithm namely unsupervised artificial immune classifier (UAIC) to perform remote sensing image classification. In addition to their nonlinear classification properties, UAIC possesses biological properties such as clonal selection, immune network, and immune memory. The implementation of UAIC comprises two steps: initially, the first clustering centers are acquired by randomly choosing from the input remote sensing image. Then, the classification task is carried out. This assigns each pixel to the class that maximizes stimulation between the antigen and the antibody. Subsequently, based on the class, the antibody population is evolved and the memory cell pool is updated by immune algorithms until the stopping criterion is met. The classification results are evaluated by comparing with four known algorithms: K-means, ISODATA, fuzzy K-means, and self-organizing map. It is shown that UAIC is an adaptive clustering algorithm, which outperforms other algorithms in all the three experiments we carried out.

J	Ordonez, C				Ordonez, C			Integrating K-means clustering with a relational DBMS using SQL	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						clustering; K-means; SQL; relational DBMS		Integrating data mining algorithms with a relational DBMS is an important problem for database programmers. We introduce three SQL implementations of the popular K-means clustering algorithm to integrate it with a relational DBMS: 1) a straightforward translation of K-means computations into SQL, 2) an optimized version based on improved data organization, efficient indexing, sufficient statistics, and rewritten queries, and 3) an incremental version that uses the optimized version as a building block with fast convergence and automated reseeding. We experimentally show the proposed K-means implementations work correctly and can cluster large data sets. We identify which K-means computations are more critical for performance. The optimized and incremental K-means implementations exhibit linear scalability. We compare K-means implementations in SQL and C++ with respect to speed and scalability and we also study the time to export data sets outside of the DBMS. Experiments show that SQL overhead is significant for small data sets, but relatively low for large data sets, whereas export times become a bottleneck for C++.

The first challenging task of this approach is to estimate precisely the unknown mixing matrix. In this paper, an algorithm for estimating the mixing matrix that can be viewed as an extension of the DUET and the TIFROM methods is first developed. Standard clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means method) also can be used for estimating the mixing matrix if the sources are sufficiently sparse. Compared with the DUET, the TIFROM methods, and standard clustering algorithms, with the authors' proposed method, a broader class of problems can be solved, because the required key condition on sparsity of the sources can be considerably relaxed. The second task of the two-stage approach is to estimate the source matrix using a standard linear programming algorithm. Another main contribution of the work described in this paper is the development of a recoverability analysis. After extending the results in [7], a necessary and sufficient condition for recoverability of a source vector is obtained. Based on this condition and various types of source sparsity, several probability inequalities and probability estimates for the recoverability issue are established. Finally, simulation results that illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results are presented.

However, the k-means algorithm is developed for numerical data only. It is not suitable for the clustering of non-numerical data. K-modes algorithm has been developed for clustering categorical objects by extending from the k-means algorithm. However, no one applies this technique for classification of categorical data. In this paper, the k-modes algorithm is introduced for the classification of categorical objects based on Soybean and Nursery databases. Especially, a genetic algorithm is proposed for designing the dissimilarity measure termed Genetic Distance Measure (GDM) such that the performance of the K-modes algorithm may be improved by 10% and 76% for Soybean and Nursery databases compared with the conventional k-modes algorithm.

It is critical that computer architects have efficient means by which they may estimate the impact of various design options on the overall machine. This task is complicated by the fact that different programs, and even different parts of the same program, may have distinct behaviors that interact with the hardware in different ways. Researchers use very detailed simulators to estimate processor performance, which models every cycle of an executing program. Unfortunately, simulating every cycle of a real program can take weeks or months. To address this problem we have created a tool called SimPoint that uses data clustering algorithms from machine learning to automatically find repetitive patterns in a program's execution. By simulating one representative of each repetitive behavior pattern, simulation time can be reduced to minutes instead of weeks for standard benchmark programs, with very little cost in terms of accuracy. We describe this important problem, the data representation and preprocessing methods used by SimPoint, the clustering algorithm at the core of SimPoint, and we evaluate different options for tuning SimPoint.

J	Song, BC; Ra, JB				Song, Byung Cheol; Ra, Jong Beom			Fast exhaustive multi-resolution search algorithm based on clustering for efficient image retrieval	JOURNAL OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION AND IMAGE REPRESENTATION			English	Article						exhaustive search; K-means clustering; multi-resolution feature	QUANTIZATION; FEATURES	To find the best match for a query according to a certain similarity measure, this paper presents a fast exhaustive multi-resolution search algorithm based on image database clustering. Prior to search process, the whole image dataset is partitioned into a pre-defined number of clusters having similar feature contents. For a given query, the proposed algorithm first checks the lower bound of distances in each cluster, eliminating disqualified clusters. Next, it only examines the candidates in the surviving clusters through feature matching. To alleviate unnecessary feature-matching operations in the search procedure, the distance inequality property based on a multi-resolution data structure is employed. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm guarantees very rapid exhaustive search. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Omran, MGH; Salman, A; Engelbrecht, AP				Omran, MGH; Salman, A; Engelbrecht, AP			Dynamic clustering using particle swarm optimization with application in image segmentation	PATTERN ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						unsupervised clustering; clustering validation; particle swarm optimization; image segmentation	MULTIVARIATE DATA; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS	A new dynamic clustering approach (DCPSO), based on particle swarm optimization, is proposed. This approach is applied to image segmentation. The proposed approach automatically determines the "optimum" number of clusters and simultaneously clusters the data set with minimal user interference. The algorithm starts by partitioning the data set into a relatively large number of clusters to reduce the effects of initial conditions. Using binary particle swarm optimization the "best" number of clusters is selected. The centers of the chosen clusters is then refined via the K-means clustering algorithm. The proposed approach was applied on both synthetic and natural images. The experiments conducted show that the proposed approach generally found the "optimum" number of clusters on the tested images. A genetic algorithm and random search version of dynamic clustering is presented and compared to the particle swarm version.

J	Liu, Z; Xue, ZY; Blum, RS; Laganiere, R				Liu, Z; Xue, ZY; Blum, RS; Laganiere, R			Concealed weapon detection and visualization in a synthesized image	PATTERN ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						concealed weapon detection; unsupervised clustering; multiresolution mosaic; image fusion	WAVELET TRANSFORM; FUSION; SEGMENTATION; SELECTION	Images acquired by heterogeneous image sensors may provide complementary information about the scene, for instance, the visual image can provide personal identification information like the facial pattern while the infrared (IR) or millimeter wave image can detect the suspicious regions of concealed weapons. Usually, a technique, namely multiresolution pixel-level image fusion is applied to integrate the information from multi-sensor images. However, when the images are significantly different, the performance of the multiresolution fusion algorithms is not always satisfactory. In this study, a new strategy consisting of two steps is proposed. The first step is to use an unsupervised fuzzy k-means clustering to detect the concealed weapon from the IR image. The detected region is embedded in the visual image in the second step and this process is implemented with a multiresolution mosaic technique. Therefore, the synthesized image retains the quality comparable to the visual image while the region of the concealed weapon is highlighted and enhanced. The experimental results indicate the efficiency of the proposed approach.

J	Zhao, MF; Luo, AL; Wu, FC; Hu, ZY				Zhao, MF; Luo, AL; Wu, FC; Hu, ZY			Automated recognition of quasars based on adaptive radial basis function neural networks	SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS			Chinese	Article						galaxy; quasar; principal component analysis(PCA); radial basis function neural networks; K-means clustering; gradient descent	GALAXIES; PCA	Recognizing and certifying quasars through the research on spectra is an important method in the field of astronomy. This paper presents a novel adaptive method for the automated recognition of quasars based on the radial basis function neural networks (RBFN). The proposed method is composed of the following three parts: (1) The feature space is reduced by the PCA (the principal component analysis) on the normalized input spectra; (2) An adaptive RBFN is constructed and trained in this reduced space. At first, the K-means clustering is used for the initialization, then based on the sum of squares errors and a gradient descent optimization technique, the number of neurons in the hidden layer is adaptively increased to improve the recognition performance; (3) The quasar spectra recognition is effectively carried out by the above trained RBFN. The author's proposed adaptive RBFN is shown to be able to not only overcome the difficulty of selecting the number of neurons in hidden layer of the traditional RBFN algorithm, but also increase the stability and accuracy of recognition of quasars. Besides, the proposed method is particularly useful for automatic voluminous spectra processing produced from a large-scale sky survey project, such as our LAMOST, due to its efficiency.

These characteristics imply that Multivariate Regression Trees have the potential to be utilised as an easily interpretable clustering method. The suitability of Multivariate Regression Trees as a clustering technique is investigated with two real datasets containing only explanatory variables. The preliminary results show that Multivariate Regression Trees as a clustering algorithm produce clusters of similar quality to the well-known K-means technique, and more recent approaches to Cluster Analysis including Mixture Models of Factor Analysers and Plaid Models. The study also evaluates the suitability of various criteria used to describe cluster solutions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ouma, YO; Ngigi, TG; Tateishi, R				Ouma, YO; Ngigi, TG; Tateishi, R			On the optimization and selection of wavelet texture for feature extraction from high-resolution satellite imagery with application towards urban-tree delineation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							LAND-USE; CLASSIFICATION; SEGMENTATION; MODELS; DECOMPOSITION; FILTERS; ALGORITHMS; RETRIEVAL; NETWORK; FOREST	Integration of spectral and multi-scale texture is proposed in order to improve the detection and classification of urban-trees from QuickBird imagery. Arguing that spatial-structure semantic information exits at a hierarchy of scales and that texture is a consequence of objects in the hierarchy, multi-scale wavelets decomposition is proposed for the extraction of vertical, horizontal and diagonal texture components. Pre-selection of texture sub-bands is achieved via mean, entropy, variance and second angular moment. The resulting sub-bands are analysed for separability between trees and similarly reflecting features, such as rice-paddy, grass/lawns, open ground and playground, based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and Battacharyya distance. The results are ranked and classified with k-means. In comparison with the field data, KL gave the best results with omission and commission error of 4.4%. The proposed methodology has the ability to capture the increased natural variability in reflectance and improved the accuracy by 23.6%, in comparison with spectral-only.

Motion segmentation is challenging because of the large amounts of data to be processed and the real-time requirements of the applications. The k-means clustering algorithm has often been used for motion segmentation. However, the k-means algorithm is computationally expensive and requires prior knowledge of the number of clusters. In this paper, we present an approach for motion segmentation based on the incremental hierarchical clustering algorithm BIRCH. BIRCH is scalable and efficient because it processes data incrementally and is more accurate because it does not require prior knowledge of clusters. We describe our experiments using video from a web cam and compare the performance of BIRCH and k-means clustering for motion segmentation. Our results confirm that our approach is more accurate and efficient as compared to the k-means based approach.

It assembles every pixel and its neighbouring pixels to form a vector, and computes correlation coefficient to measure the similarity of corresponding window in the background image and current image. When the correlation coefficient is bigger than the adaptive threshold, the algorithm processes pixel level detection. Moreover, using k-means and correlation coefficient respectively, it realizes the clustering and tracking of the abnormality objects. The experimental results show the algorithm is robust against noise disturbance, illumination change, shadows and reflection effect. It can detect abnormality precisley, and improve the surveillance system's adaptability for the complicated environment greatly.

Firstly, the ROI are extracted in DWT domain by using the human visual characteristic and K-mean clustering. Secondly, the ROI is segmented into subregions, and the ROI features are extracted from the subregions (the dominant color and its percentage is used for color feature, the pixel distribution in the subregion is used for shape feature). Finally, the average similarity between images is computed according to the ROI' above features. Experimental results show that our image retrieval is more accurate and efficient in retrieving the user-interested images when there are ROI in the image (especially for the image with simple background).

A sample background subtraction algorithm is used to get the binary mask of moving objects for segmenting the video sequence captured by fixed camera. Then a mixture of hidden Markov models (HMMs) using the expectation-maximization (EM) scheme is fitted to the motion data extracted from the binary mask. Unlike previous literatures using k-means where every observed data set only assigned to a single HMM, the proposed approach allows every video segment to belong to more than a single HMM with some probability. Expermients with real data demonstrate the benefit when there is more "overlap" the processes generating the data.

The color model is built upon K-Means clustering, by which the color space of the object can be partitioned adaptively and the histogram bins can be determined accordingly. In addition, in each bin the multi-channel gray level is modelled as Gaussian distribution. A metric based on Chernov distance is defined to measure similarity between the reference model and the candidate model. The Integral Images are proposed for computation of mean vector and covariance matrix of color images, through which the similarity metric can be evaluated very fast. Comparisons with the well-known mean shift algorithm demonstrate the validity of the model and performance of the proposed algorithm.

Non-rigid object tracking is a challenging task because the target often appears as a concave shape or an object with apertures. In such cases, many background areas will be mixed into the tracking target, which are difficult to be removed by modifying the shape of the search area. Our algorithm realizes robust tracking for such objects by classifying the pixels in the search area into "target" and "background" with K-means clustering algorithm that uses both the "positive" and "negative" samples. The contributions of this research are: 1) Using a 5D feature vector to describe both the geometric feature "(x, y)" and color feature "(Y, U, V)" of an object (or a pixel) uniformly. This description enables the simultaneous adaptation of both the geometric and color variance during tracking; 2) Using a variable ellipse model (a) to describe the search area; (b) to model the surrounding background. This guarantees the stable tracking of objects with various geometric transformations. Through extensive experiments in various environments and conditions, the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed algorithm is confirmed.

The algorithm consists of two phases. The first phase performs attribute relevance analysis by detecting dense regions in each attribute, thereby allowing irrelevant attributes and outliers to be captured and eliminated. Starting from the results of the first phase, the second phase aims to uncover clusters in different subspaces. The clustering process is based on the k-means algorithm, with the computation of distance restricted to subsets of attributes where object values are dense.

An image is first split into small patches. Segmentation is then performed on each patch using the algorithms of standard normalized cut [9], mean shift clustering [3], or K-means clustering. Each region in a patch segmentation is assigned a label so as to represent different parts. After that, a connectedness value is calculated between any two overlapping patch segmentations with certain kinds of labeling. A weight called border strength is calculated for a segmentation with a certain labeling. We optimize a global criterion function that quantifies the consistency and quality of patch segmentations by a simulated annealing algorithm [5] in order to find the optimal patch segmentations and labeling. Finally, global segmentation is reconstructed by fusing patch segmentations by multiple techniques. Experimental results on natural images are reported. Precision and recall rates are also calculated to evaluate the performance quantitively.

Instead of the widely applied string-of-group-numbers encoding, we encode the prototypes of the clusters into the chromosomes. The crossover operator is designed to exchange prototypes between two chromosomes. The one-step K-means algorithm is used as the mutation operator. Hence, the proposed GA is called the prototypes-embedded genetic K-means algorithm (PGKA). With the inherent evolution process of evolutionary algorithms, PGKA has superior performance than the classical K-means algorithm, while comparing to other GA-based approaches, PGKA is more efficient and suitable for large scale data sets.

In this paper we present a grid based clustering algorithm (GCA) with time complexity (O (n)). Unlike previous clustering algorithm, GCA pays more attention to the running time of the algorithm. GCA achieves low running time by (i) determining the number of the clusters according to the point density of the grid cell and (ii) computing the distances between the centers of the clusters and the grid cells, not the data points. In order to make GCA more efficient, principal component analysis(PCA) is introduced to transform the data points from high dimension to low dimension. Finally, we analyze the performance of GCA and show that it outperforms most of the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of efficiency. In particular it outperforms k-means algorithm by several orders in the running time.

The algorithm combines the advantage of genetic algorithm(GA) and K-means to search the subspace thoroughly. Therefore, our algorithm converges globally. A weighting function is then introduced to initialize the parameters of the algorithm. The experiments on a synthetic dataset and a real dataset shows that (i) GK outperforms K-means since GK achieves the minimal value of the objective function and (ii) GK with the weighting function performs better than GK.

In our current implementation with one FPGA, the performance for 512 x 512 and 640 x 480 pixel images is more than 30 fps, and 20 - 30 fps for 756 x 512 pixel images in average when dividing to 256 clusters.

SKKC is used to cluster the retrieval results so that RF can be conducted on the cluster level. Compared with traditional RF conducted on the point single-image level, the new RF will facilitate the RF selection and reduce user's efforts on it. Furthermore, the proposed approach enables an accumulated learning ability by recording and learning from the history of users' RFs. The new RF is applied in a Content-Based Medical Image Retrieval (CBMIR) system.

In this paper, we investigate if biomedical ontology MeSH improves the clustering quality for MEDLINE articles. For this investigation, we perform a comprehensive comparison study of various document clustering approaches such as hierarchical clustering methods (single-link, complete-link and complete link), Bisecting K-means, K-means, and Suffix Tree Clustering (STC) in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability. According to our experiment results, biomedical ontology MeSH significantly enhances clustering quality on biomedical documents. In addition, our results show that decent document clustering approaches, such as Bisecting K-means, K-means and STC, gains some benefit from MeSH ontology while hierarchical algorithms showing the poorest clustering quality do not reap the benefit of MeSH ontology.

Faults are usually rare, and, therefore, predicting them is difficult . In this paper, a new greedy initialization method for the K-means algorithm is proposed to improve traditional K-means clustering techniques. The new initialization method tries to choose suitable initial points, which are well separated and have the potential to form high-quality clusters. Based on the clustering result of historical disqualification product data in manufacturing process which generated by the Improved-K-means algorithm, a prediction model which is used to detect and recognize the abnormal trend of the quality problems is constructed. This simple and robust alarm-system architecture for predicting incoming faults realizes the transition of quality problems from diagnosis afterward to prevention beforehand indeed. In the end, the alarm model was applied for prediction and avoidance of gear-wheel assembly faults at a gear-plant.

Firstly the CT image is segmented by the K-means clustering algorithm and Canny edge detection operator to obtain two images with clear regions and distinct edges respectively. Secondly these two images are synthesized to form a new one by the information fusion method based on features. The advantage of the method is that value K and the initial clustering centroids are determined automatically according to the image histogram and no need for the rectification of images before the images are fused. Experimental results show that the images are clearly segmented into multi-regions and the distinct image edges are preserved simultaneously as well.

In deed, the recent construction of multi and hyper spectral images will provide detailed data with information in both the spatial and spectral domain. This data shows great promise for remote sensing applications ranging from environmental and agricultural to national security interests. The exploitation of these images requires the use of different approach, and notably these founded on the unsupervised statistical segmentation principle. Indeed these methods that exploit the statistical images attributes offer some convincing and encouraging results, under the condition to have an optimal initialization step. Indeed, in order to assure a better convergence of the different images attributes, the unsupervised segmentation approaches, require a fundamental initialization step. We will present in this paper a k-means clustering algorithm and describe its importance in the initialization of the unsupervised satellite image segmentation.

Recently, two techniques (BSS-CCA and pSVD) were developed to remove those artifacts. The purpose of this study is to assess whether the removal of muscle and eye movement artifacts improves the EEG dipole source localization. We used a total of 8 EEG fragments, each from another patient, first unfiltered, then filtered by the BSS-CCA and pSVD. In both the filtered and unfiltered EEG fragments we estimated multiple dipoles using R.A.P-MUSIC. The resulting dipoles were subjected to a K-means clustering algorithm, to extract the most prominent cluster. We found that the removal of muscle and eye artifact results to tighter and more clear dipole clusters. Furthermore, we found that localization of the filtered EEG corresponded with the localization derived from the ictal SPECT in 7 of the 8 patients. Therefore, we can conclude that the BSS-CCA and pSVD improve localization of ictal activity, thus making the localization more reliable for the presurgical evaluation of the patient.

Regions containing GBM lesions from 40 patients and non-GBM lesions from 20 patients were manually segmented from MR imaging studies (T1 post-contrast and T2 weighted channels) to form the training set. In addition to the two acquired channels, a composite image was formed by an image fusion method. Data reduction techniques, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), were applied on the training sets (T1 post, T2, composite, and multi-channel combining the PCA features from T1post and T2). The retrieval accuracy was evaluated using a 'leave-one-out' strategy with query images belonging to 'normal', 'GBM' and 'non-GBM' classes. Several combinations of the similarity metric and classifier were used: Euclidean similarity measures with k-means classifier for the PCA and LDA features and Support Vector Machine (SVM) nonlinear classifier (radial basis function kernel) with the PCA derived features. The SVM classifier served as a comparison of nonlinear techniques vs. linear ones. Multi-channel PCA was 100% accurate in classifying a query image as either 'normal' or labnormal'. The highest accuracy in classification of tumor grade (GBM or other Grade 3) was 77% and was achieved by SVM coupled with the PCA features. The proposed algorithm intent is to be integrated into an automated decision support system for MR brain tumor studies.

Unfortunately evidence-based guidelines for clinical surveillance are poor and lack of reliable indexes. Therefore we proposed new parameters: the Lempel Ziv complexity (LZC) and the Multiscale entropy (MSE). The results show that the LZ complexity is able to significantly discriminate the severe IUGR (preterm delivered) from moderate IUGR (at term delivered) and healthy fetuses. Moreover the k-mean cluster analysis applied to these indexes was able to gather the severe IUGRs and to separate them from both not severe IUGRs and normal fetuses, which were included in the same cluster.

Comparing with existing thalamus segmentation algorithms which are mainly based on K-means algorithm, our mean-shift based algorithm is more flexible and adaptive. It does not assume a Gaussian distribution or a fixed number of clusters. Furthermore, the single parameter in the mean-shift based algorithm supports hierarchical clustering naturally.

However, the final outcome or the data analyses very much depend on the huge number of genes with relatively small number of samples present in each experiment. It is thus crucial to select relevant genes to be used for future specific cancer markers. Many feature selection methods have been proposed but none is able to classify all kinds of microarray data accurately, especially on those multi-class datasets. We propose a one-versus-one comparison method for selecting discriminatory features instead of performing the statistical test in a one-versus-all manner. Brain cancer is chosen as an example. Here, 3 types of statistics are used: signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), I-statistics and Pearson correlation coefficient. Results are verified by performing hierarchical and k-means clustering. Using our one-versus-one comparisons, best performance accuracies of 90.48% and 97.62% can be obtained by hierarchical and k-means clustering respectively. However best performance accuracies or 88.10% and 80.95% can be obtained respectively when using one-versus-all comparison. This shows that one-versus-one comparison is superior.

Laminar analysis of movement direction information in local field potentials of the rat motor cortex	2006 28th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, Vols 1-15			English	Proceedings Paper	28th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society	AUG 30-SEP 03, 2006	New York, NY	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Sci				Local field potentials (LFPs) have been proposed for use in controlling neural prosthetic devices because they can provide reliable motor and sensory-related information, and can easily be recorded over long periods of time. While studies have shown that directional information about motor movements can be inferred from LFPs, it is not known at what depth these signals should be recorded from in order to maximize the amount of movement information. Towards this end, we used a directional motor task in Long-Evans rats, while sampling LFPs with an electrode consisting of 16 vertical recording sites that were evenly-spaced 100 mu m apart. This allowed for simultaneous recording of all layers of the motor cortex. The frequency components of LFPs were then analyzed using k-means clustering to determine directional information as a function of depth. Here we report our initial findings that superficial layers (II/III) of motor cortex may provide more information about movement directions then deeper layers (V).

Instead of depending on traditional vector space model, this approach represents documents as graphs using domain knowledge in ontology because graphs can represent the semantic relationships among the concepts in documents. Based on scale-free network theory, our approach generates a model for each document cluster from the ontology-enriched graph representation by identifying k high density subgraphs capturing the core semantic relationship information about each document cluster. Using these k high density subgraphs, each document is assigned to a proper document cluster. Our extensive experimental results on MEDLINE articles show that our approach outperforms two leading document clustering algorithms, BiSecting K-means and CLUTO's vcluster. Moreover, our. approach provides a meaningful explanation for document clustering through generated models. This explanation helps users to understand clustering results and documents as a whole.

In a deregulated energy environment, consumers can purchase electricity from any provider regardless of size and location. As a result, there is a growing interest in understanding the nature of variations in consumer's consumption. This information can be used to facilitate electricity supplier in their marketing strategy. Many techniques for load profiling have been reported in the past. The techniques include applications of statistics, unsupervised clustering technique and methods based on frequency domain approach. This paper compares the application of fuzzy clustering with statistical method in load profiling. K-means has been chosen as the statistical approach employed in this study. These two approaches have the same objectives i.e. to recognise similarities, clusters and classify the individual load profiles of different customers to one of the identified categories. The paper evaluates the performance of each method and discusses the strength and weaknesses of both approaches based on the simulated results.

While in many available systems the focus is on tracking, the main problem still is to recognize objects in an arbitrary scene within a database of multiple objects. For any tracking system, recognition is needed for initialization and therefore always built in. However, the task of recognition becomes considerably harder, when learning and recognizing multiple objects. In this paper, we present a system, which accomplishes this task for textured objects robustly and efficiently. Our system is based on texture features, combining principal component analysis, k-means clustering and kd-tree search with best-bin-first strategy. We evaluated our system in several real-word scenarios, and present experimental results in a kitchen environment. Within a database of 20 objects, our system can analyze an arbitrary scene in less than 350 ms on a 3 GHz CPU.

Using Dimensionality Reduction (DR) algorithms, these datasets can be made easier to explore and to use. We present in this study an objective comparison of five DR methods, by evaluating their capacity to provide a usable input to the K-means clustering algorithm. We also suggest a method to automatically find a suitable number of classes K, using objective "cluster validity indexes" over a range of values for K Ten Landsat images have been processed, yielding a classification rate in the 70-80% range. Our results also show that classical linear methods, though slightly outperformed by more recent nonlinear algorithms, still offer a reasonable trade-off.

Speaker age interval and sex identification based on Jitters, Shimmers and Mean MFCC using supervised and unsupervised discriminative classification methods	2006 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOLS 1-4	International Conference on Signal Processing-ICSP		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Signal Processing	NOV 16-20, 2006	Guilin, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE Signal Proc Soc, CIE, IET, URSI, IEEE Beijing Sect, Natl Nat Sci Fdn China, Japan China Sci & Technol Exchang Assoc, IEEE SP Soc, Beijing Chapter, Beijing Jiaotong Univ		age & sex identification; Jitter; Shimmer; Mean MFCC; MLP; SVM; K-Means; FCM; cascade combination		Discrimination ability of Speech long term features, including Jitters, Shimmers and Mean MFCC is proposed, for age interval and sex identification. First to make a primary study of discrimination ability, two well-known unsupervised classification methods, i.e. K-Means and FCM, were used. Then, two supervised discriminative classification approaches, namely MLP neural network and SVM, have been employed for more precise age interval and sex identification. In addition, in order to make a study of mutual influences of age interval and sex discriminative features, a cascade combination of two MLPs neural networks, with one trained for age interval and other one for sex identification, has been utilized separately. Most practical applications of age interval and sex identification are remote applications where usually speech signal is affected by telecommunication channels. To take this affect into consideration, a telephonic database has been used in experiments. Obtained results demonstrate that Jitter and Shimmer have good discrimination ability between male and female or young and old speakers, but do not discriminate small age intervals appropriately. On the other hand, Mean MFCC is not suitable for sex unsupervised classification but leads to an increase in sex supervised classification performance. Also these coefficients contain useful information about speaker age interval, and can result in a decrease in identification error rate.

More precisely we analyse the singularity/regularity exponent that composes the textures as they theoretically carry most of the information. The analysis is made using the Legendre spectrum. Then a parameter vector is computed to describe this spectrum in order to classify the textures with an unsupervised k-means classifier. The resulting algorithm is evaluated against a classification directly based on the textures.

It is an indicator of various ophthalmic pathologies. This paper presents a novel algorithm to segment the optic disk, based on snake model. The proposed method improves and extends original snake technique in two aspects: clustering and smoothing update. The contour first deforms to the location with the minimal energy, and then self-separates into edge-point group or uncertain-point group by means of weighted k-means algorithm. The contour points are finally updated by variable updating sample numbers. These modifications directly solve the blood vessel problem, which has not been effectively solved in the earlier work on disk boundary detection up to now. The comparative results on the 100 testing images shown that the proposed method achieves better success rate (94%) when compared to those obtained by GVF-snake (12%) and modified ASM method (82%).

Adjusted Rand index and classification accuracy are used as accuracy criteria with respect to a known partition assumed to be the "true" one. The data sets are randomly chosen to represent medium-size problems arising within a variety of biomedical domains. Ensemble size of 10 was considered. It was found that there is a significant difference among the compared methods (Friedman's Two Way ANOVA). The best ensembles were based on k-means individual clusterers. Consensus functions interpreting the consensus matrix of the ensemble as data, rather than similarity, were found to be significantly better than the traditional alternatives, including CSPA and HGPA.

Unfortunately, all known clustering algorithms tend to break down in high dimensional spaces; this is due to the inherent sparsity of the points. We investigate, in this paper, the use of linear and nonlinear principal manifolds for learning lox, dimensional representations for clustering. Several leading methods: PCA, %PCA, Summon, and CCA are examined and tested in clustering experiments using synthetic and real datasets from the UCI Databases. We compare the clustering performance of the g means algorithm on data projected by these projection methods. The experimental results show that K -means clustering on data projected by %PCA outperforms those projected by the three other methods.

Inexpensive navigation-grade receivers provide estimates within a few meters in relatively open skies, while more specialized devices, typically distinguished by specialized antenna design and additional post processing can achieve sub-meter accuracy. These latter devices can be two orders of magnitude more expensive than navigation-grade receivers but are still subject to measurement error due to severe multipath in built-up areas. In our experiments we post-process positions computed by an inexpensive receiver by applying wavelet filtering following by clustering and characterization. This produces a reliable and significant reduction in variance of the estimate, a normalization of the data scatter-distribution and a characterization of the estimate that is amenable to a wider range of statistical comparisons and tests than would be possible for unfiltered, highly non-Gaussian distributions, especially as occur in urban canyon circumstances.

Further, a Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO) approach is proposed for automatically constructing the proper number of clusters as well as appropriate partitioning of the data set. And we hybridize the BPSO method with the k-means algorithm to optimize the WSVF automatically. In the experiments, we show the effectiveness of the WSVF and the validity of the BPSO. The BPSO can consistently and efficiently converge to the optimum corresponding to the given data in concurrence with the convergence result. The WSVF is found generally able to improve the confidence of clustering solutions and achieve more accurate and robust results.

The idea is to store all observations from a process in a database and then to estimate a local model by selecting portions of data that belong to a small neighborhood around the current operating point. The bottleneck of lazy teaming is management of large datasets and searching for the relevant neighbors. This paper aims to this question and the k-Means cluster algorithm is cast into lazy teaming framework. Using this strategy, the nearest neighbors searching process can be turned into hierarchical searching process with two levels and a lot of searching time for lazy teaming can he saved, Another contribution of this paper is that a new similar criterion between two examples is advanced. Using this criterion, the k-Vector Nearest Neighbors (k-VNN) technique is used to find the region surrounding the query point and the updating database strategy can be obtained without need any further computation. Furthermore, this updating strategy can save a lot of memory space and decrease the neighbors searching process. The advantages of those methodologies are demonstrated on nonlinear function prediction.

There are a large number of factors affecting the pneumatic drying process. As a key parameter of the drying process, the water content of the dried ore concentrate has effect on the stable operation for the smelting process directly. The manual measurement of the water content has serious time-delay, which influences the operation optimization of the drying process. It is significant to research on the soft-sensing method for water content in drying process. The neural network model for soft sensing with many inputs and very complicated model architecture is very time-consuming to train and easy to over-fit the data with low predication accuracy and bad robustness. A soft-sensing model for water content based on PCA (principal component analysis) and multiple neural networks (MNN) is proposed to solve this problem in this paper. Firstly, PCA method was used to decrease the number of input variables, and then classified the data by k-means algorithms based on evolutionary strategies. Each kind of data after clustering is used to train a neural network sub-model. Finally, these sub-model are combined using principal components regression (PCR) method to obtain a soft-sensing model. Simulation results of the data from the practical production process show that the model can effectively sense the water content in the pneumatic drying process.

In this paper, hidden Markov models (HMM) are utilized to recognize the nature of an event occurring in a scene. For this purpose, object trajectories, which are obtained through a successful track, are written as a sequence of flow vectors that contain instantaneous velocity and location information. These vectors are clustered by K-means algorithm to obtain a prototype representation. HMMs are trained with sequences obtained from usual motion patterns and abnormality is detected by measuring distances to these models. In order to specify the number of models without user interaction, a novel. approach is proposed in which the clues provided by centroid clustering are utilized. Promising simulation results are obtained for this approach, which is. applicable to any surveillance application.				Alatan, A. Aydin/E-3927-2012				KETTNAKER V, 2003, IEEE WORKSH DET REC; Lee K.

Once we've established the presence of the cloud in the latter images, we determine the origin of the cloud in the earlier ones and track its propagation. Gas usually expands from point sources and it is difficult to know whether it is significant when it occupies merely a few pixels in the image. After the gas size expands, it is easier to analyze as an interesting anomalous feature. Our algorithm includes techniques such as the improved K-Means classification, Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), match filter and tracking; in the paper we will show results based on real data taken by the "FIRST" camera (Field-portable Imaging Radiometric Spectrometer Technology).

The first corresponds to the one against all method. The second corresponds to the one class transformation training method. The one class training algorithm can he extended to an iterative algorithm, similar to segmental K-means. In this case the final output of the algorithm is a single set of pseudo-HMMs. Although they are not normalized. this set of pseudo-HMMs can be used in the standard recognition procedure (the Viterbi recognizer), as if they were plain HMMs. We use an isolated noisy digit recognition task to demonstrate that SVM re-scoring of HMMs typically reduces the error rate significantly compared to standard ML training.

Conventionally, visual inspection has been used for the cluster identification. However this approach is impractical for a large amount of measurement data. Moreover, visual methods lack an accurate definition of a "cluster" itself. We introduce a framework that is able to cluster multi-path components (MPCs), decide on the number of clusters, and discard outliers. For clustering we use the K-means algorithm, which iteratively moves a number of cluster centroids through the data space to minimize the total difference between MPCs and their closest centroid. We significantly improve this algorithm by following changes: (i) as the distance metric we use the multi-path component distance (MCD), (ii) the distances are weighted by the powers of the MPCs. The implications of these changes result in a definition of a "cluster" itself that appeals to intuition. We assess the performance of the new algorithm by clustering real-world measurement data from an indoor big hall environment.

Fast and accurate clustering of documents plays an important role in the field of text mining and automatic information retrieval systems. The k-means has served as the most widely used partitional clustering algorithm for text documents. However, in most cases it provides only locally optimal solutions. In this work, the clustering problem has been formulated as an optimization task and is solved using a modified DE algorithm. To reduce the computational time, a hybrid k-means with DE method has also been proposed. The new algorithms were tested on a number of document datasets. Comparison with k-means, a state of the art PSO and one recently proposed real coded GA based text clustering methods reflects the superiority of the proposed techniques in terms of speed and quality of clustering.

Gwenn			Investigating EA based training of HMM using a sequential parameter optimization approach	2006 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOLS 1-6	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation	JUL 16-21, 2006	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE			PROBABILISTIC FUNCTIONS; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; SPEECH RECOGNITION; MARKOV CHAINS	Hidden Markov models (HHMs) have become an increasingly useful tool for the analysis of biological data. HMI based tools are currently used for generating protein sequence profiles, predicting protein secondary structure, finding motifs in DNA sequence data, and many other bioinformatics applications. Such models are often constructed using gradient-decent based training methods such as a Baum-Welch learning algorithm or a Segmental K-means algorithm. HMM training involves estimating the model parameters based on an existing set of data. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have also been applied to this problem, but have typically been observed to perform best when combined with BW learning forming a hybrid approach In this work we describe a sequential parameter optimization approach for investigating the effectiveness of using EAs for training HMMs. We discuss preliminary results of this approach as obtained using synthetic DNA data sets. This approach not only offers the possibility for improving the effectiveness of the EA but will also provide much needed insight into directions for future improvements in the design of EAs for the construction of HMMs in general.

Face recognition using Pseudo-2D Ergodic HMM	2006 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH AND SIGNAL PROCESSING, VOLS 1-13	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing ICASSP		English	Proceedings Paper	31st IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	MAY 14-19, 2006	Toulouse, FRANCE	IEEE Signal Proc Soc				The work presented in this paper describes a novel Pseudo-2D Ergodic Hidden Markov Model (EHMM) based architecture for automatic face recognition. The primary HMM of this model being ergodic in nature, gives the flexibility to switch between the states, contrary to conventional Pseudo-2D HMM, which follows a top-to-bottom approach. The new approach helps in better modeling the different variations of a human face. We present a segmental K-means algorithm for training the Pseudo-2D EHMM, thereby jointly optimizing the observation densities and the state transitions corresponding to different variations of the face. The performance of the proposed method is presented with Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and the DCT-mod2 feature sets for the Olivetti Research Laboratory (ORL) database. The better modeling capability of the proposed architecture along with the robustness of DCT-mod2 feature set to illumination direction changes, proves to be an excellent combination for automatic face recognition.

Emotion detection from infant facial expressions and cries	2006 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, Vols 1-13	International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)		English	Proceedings Paper	31st IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing	MAY 14-19, 2006	Toulouse, FRANCE	IEEE Signal Proc Soc			RECOGNITION	A new system for translating the infant cries from its facial image and cry sounds is presented in this paper. The system is designed to analyze the facial image and sound of the crying infant to derive the reason why the infant is crying. The image and the sound represent the same cry event. The image processing module determines the state of certain facial features, certain combinations of which determine the reason for crying. The sound processing module analyzes the data for the fundamental frequency and the first two formants and uses k-means clustering to determine the reason of the cry. The decisions from the image and sound processing modules are then fused using a decision level fusion system. The overall accuracy of the image and sound processing modules are 64% and 74.2%, respectively, and that of the fused decision is 75.2%.

To control such complex systems, it is a challenge to determine appropriate dispatching strategies under various system conditions. Dispatching strategies are crucial for the system performance, especially for the real time control of the system. In this paper, an interval variant rescheduling mechanism is proposed. In order to deploy different dispatching rules to different intrabays, k-Means is used for clustering the intrabays of the fab. Then genetic algorithm (GA) is used for searching dispatching rule sets which promote better performance. In terms of the system conditions corresponding to dispatching rules, the support vector machine (SVM) classifier is constructed as the scheduler. In addition, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) prediction model is built for the sake of on-line deciding the scheduling intervals. The results indicate that applying the proposed mechanism to obtaining dispatching strategies is. an effective method considering the complexity and variation of semiconductor wafer fabrication systems.

However, although objects stored in the same R* tree leaf node enjoys spatial proximity, it is well-known that R* trees cannot be used directly for cluster analysis. Nevertheless, R* tree's indexing feature can be used to assist existing cluster analysis methods, thus enhancing their performance or cluster quality. In this paper, we explore how to use R* trees to improve well-known K-means and hierarchical clustering methods. Based on R* Tree's feature of indexing Minimum Bounding Box (MBB) according to spatial proximity, we extend R*-Tree's application to cluster analysis of time series. Two improved algorithms, KMeans-R and Hierarchy-R, are proposed. The performance of these two methods is evaluated against K-Means and K-Means with sampling technique (KMeans-S) using similarity-oriented, supervised measures of cluster validity. Rand Index (RI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and Information Gain (IG) are used as evaluation measures in our experiments. Compared with K-Means and KMeans-S, the clustering results from different data sets have shown that KMeans-R and Hierarchy-R have achieved better clustering quality.

Entropy Analysis is utilized to reduce Dimensionality and to find initial conditions or starting points for the extended K-Mean Algorithm. We start with the deciding criteria attribute, and based on comparison and selection of the surrounding points, inter value comparison and gain assessment is performed leading to optimal value selection. Dwarf data cubes are utilized to mitigate the effects of the Curse of Dimensionality, specifically in a database environment where suffixes and prefixes are present. Finally the use of the Entropy Generated Result for the initial conditioning of the extended K-Mean algorithm is explained.

K-means is an unsupervised clustering method which does not guarantee convergence. Numerous improvements to K-means have been done to make its performance better. Expectation Maximization is a statistical technique for maximum likelihood estimation using mixture models. It searches for a local maxima and generally converges very well. The proposed algorithm combines these two algorithms to generate optimum clusters which do not require a huge value of K and each cluster attains a more natural shape and guarantee convergence. The paper compares the new method with Fuzzy K-means on benchmark iris data.

People can communicate with each other beyond spacial restrictions using the Internet. In this situation, the demand for transmission bandwidth and storage space continues to outstrip the capacity of existing technologies. Image and video compression technology is therefore essential for the effective use of communication networks. In this paper, we propose a new method to compress images using vector quantization. Dimensions of the training vectors to prepare a codebook are determined on the basis of local fractal dimensions (LFDs) of a learning image. This means that each block size to divide the learning image is specified by the LFDs. In principle, the smaller the number of pixels in a training vector is, the larger is a codebook (low bit rate). Furthermore, the smaller the number of pixels in a codebook is, the higher is the quality of the encoded image. This is a tradeoff between compression rate and quality of the encoded image. The tradeoff can be solved by the division of images with different block sizes. Furthermore, the code-vecors are computed from the training vectors using a fuzzy k-means clustering algorithm. The performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated by compression rate and quality of encoded images in comparison with those using fuzzy generalized Lloyd algorithm. The experiments showed that the proposed algorithm solved the tradeoff between compression rate and quality of image.

The procedure exploits the results of a K-means clustering algorithm for first quantifying the membership degree of each pixel to a region in the image. Belief functions are then used to quantify the uncertainty about the pixel labelling. This theoretical framework allows to manage imprecise and uncertain information extracted from spatial neighbors. Using this strategy (classification + post-labelling), the segmentation scheme allows to perform a complementary approach combining region segmentation and edge detection. Segmentation results on different kinds of image are presented and allow to highlight the algorithm performances. Finally, the application of this methodology is also presented in case of 3D medical imaging and multi-spectral satellite images.

These conserved regions can potentially determine the conformation and activities of proteins. In this paper, short segments of proteins recurring pattern are explored by a novel clustering method based on Novel Hybrid Hierarchical K-means Clustering Algorithm. Our method is very suitable for discovering sequence motifs in extremely large databases: only two scan of whole database is required to generate subtle results. First scan to generate required information. In the second scan, we consider not only standard distance measurement but also DSSP similarity. Our approach generates more than 600 clusters with high structure homology out of 649 clusters. To achieve the goal of making as few assumptions about the data as possible, our design only needs to define two variables for outlier detection before execution. This research uses a larger and more recent database then previous related studies. The advance database and our novel clustering method reveal some subtle motifs which transect protein family boundaries that have not been discovered in previous studies.

A new cluster validity measure for spatio-temporal data that facilitates the use of unsupervised clustering is proposed. A computationally efficient version of the clustering algorithm is defined and performance compared with the basic algorithm. These new algorithms are validated on global climate data (sea level pressure) and it is seen that these algorithms are able to discover interesting phenomena in the climate data and compare well with other existing techniques.

The statistical representation of the back-round relies on its spatial color distributions herein modeled by a mixture of Gaussians. The Gaussian parameters are obtained after segmenting one reference frame with an unsupervised Bayesian approach whose parameter estimation step is ensured by the K-Means and the Iterated Conditional Estimation (ICE) algorithms. Since the motion detection function only depends on a global mixture of M Gaussians, only a few bits per pixel need to be stored in memory. Our method achieves real-time performances, especially when look up tables are used to store pre-calculated data. Results have been obtained on synthetic and real video sequences and compared with other statistical methods.

As the order and genre partition strategy of the SVM classifier series affect the over performance of the united classifier, two optimal SVM binary trees, local and global, are constructed aiming at finding the best categorization orders, i.e., the best tree structure, of the genre ontology. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms C4.5 Decision Tree, typical 1-vs-1 SVM scheme, as well as the hierarchical SVM built by K-means.

Misalignment of motor or coupled load on motor shaft is one of the common causes, which creates most of the mechanical faults and leads to motor vibration. Although different algorithms are available for motor condition monitoring, but an online identification of motor misalignment and comprehensive fault reporting to the maintenance personnel are still missing. The motor current spectrum analysis for misaligned motor is not well documented. This paper portrays a novel online fault diagnostic algorithm related to misalignment of induction motors fed by variable speed drive. The innovative approach features spectral analysis and clustering based, fault detection method. A new set of feature coefficients of the mechanical faults is extracted from the stator current by its spectral decomposition. The technique is validated experimentally for a 7.5-hp induction motor.

However due to the presence of scanning noise, accumulative registration errors, and improper data fusion, the reconstructed surfaces from multiple registered range images captured from different viewpoints are often distorted with thick patches, false connections and blurred features. Moreover, the existing integration methods are often expensive in the sense of computational time and data storage. These shortcomings will hinder the wide applications of 3D modelling using the latest laser scanning systems. In this paper, the kappa-means clustering approach from the pattern recognition and machine learning literatures is employed to optimally fuse the overlapping areas between two range images captured from two neighbouring viewpoints and to iteratively minimize the integration error. The final fused point set is then triangulated using an improved Delaunay method, guaranteeing a watertight surface. The new method is theoretically guaranteed to converge. A comparative study based on real images shows that the proposed algorithm is computationally efficient and significantly reduces the integration error, while desirably retaining geometric details of object surface.

In this paper we address the pattern evaluation problem by looking at both the capability of models and the difficulty of target concepts. We use four different data mining models: frequent itemset mining, k-means clustering, hidden Markov model, and hierarchical hidden Markov model to mine 39 concept streams from the a 137-video broadcast news collection from TRECVID-2005. We hypothesize that the discovered patterns can reveal semantics beyond the input space, and thus evaluate the patterns against a much larger concept space containing 192 concepts defined by LSCOM. Results show that HHMM has the best average prediction among all models, however different models seem to excel in different concepts depending on the concept prior and the ontological relationship. Results also show that the majority of the target concepts are better predicted with temporal or combination hypotheses, and there are novel concepts found that are not part of the original lexicon. This paper presents the first effort on temporal pattern mining in the large concept space. There are many promising directions to use concept mining to help construct better concept detectors or to guide the design of multimedia ontology.

The Audio Spectrum Flatness (ASF) feature of the MPEG-7 standard, although not having been considered as much as other feature types, has been utilized and evaluated as the underlying feature set. Expressive summaries are chosen as the longest patterns by the k-means clustering algorithm. Proposed approach is evaluated on a test bed consisting of popular song and speech clips based on the ASF feature. The well known Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are also considered in the experiments for the evaluation of features. Experiments show that, all the repetitive patterns and their locations are obtained with the accuracy of 93% and 78% for music and speech, respectively.

The sensorimotor coordination is generated through interaction with the environment. The system uses a learning architecture which is composed of reactive and deliberative layers. The reactive layer consists of a database of behaviors that are modulated to produce a desired behavior. We have implemented in the learning architecture an object manipulation behavior inspired by the concept that infants learn about their environment through manipulation [1]. While manipulating objects, the agent records both proprioceptive data and exteroceptive data. Both of these types of data are combined and statistically analyzed in order to extract important parameters that distinctively describe the object being manipulated. This data is then clustered using the standard k-means algorithm and the resulting clusters are labeled. The labeling is used to train a radial basis function network for classifying the clusters. The performance of the system has been tested on a kinematically complex walking robot, and it has been found that the trained neural network is able to classify objects even when only partial sensory data is available to the system. Our preliminary results demonstrate that this method can be effectively used in a robotic system which learns from experience about its environment.

Steganalysis embedding percentage determination with Learning Vector Quantization	2006 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS, VOLS 1-6, PROCEEDINGS	IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, MAN, AND CYBERNETICS, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics	OCT 08-11, 2006	Taipei, TAIWAN	IEEE Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc, Minist Educ, Natl Sci Council, Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Natl Chiao Tung Univ			STEGANOGRAPHY	Steganography (stego) is used primarily when the very existence of a communication signal is to be kept covert. Detecting the presence of stego is a very difficult problem which is made even more difficult when the embedding technique is not known. This article presents an investigation of the process and necessary considerations inherent in the development of a new method applied for the detection of hidden data within digital images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) as a clustering technique which assists in discerning clean or non-stego images from anomalous or stego images. This comparison is conducted using 7 features [1] over a small set of 200 observations with varying levels of embedded information from 1% to 10% in increments of 1%. The results demonstrate that LVQ not only more accurately identify when an image contains LSB hidden information when compared to k-means or using just the raw feature sets, but also provides a simple method for determining the percentage of embedding given low information embedding percentages.

We developed new clustering procedure called Grey K-means, which is able to handle the number of required clusters such as the hard K-means or the fuzzy c-means. Assume that the number of found clusters by the proposal is between I and the number of classified instances, a required threshold value is exist in [0, 1]. We defined a value range of the threshold as the interval grey number, and the range is specified automatically until obtaining the required clusters. In addition a new clustering method which analyzes the grey relational matrix closely instead of moving vectors is suggested. Several well-known data sets in the classification problem are applied, and we discuss their performances and the optimal threshold value.

In this paper, we analysis Region-Based Image Retrieval (RBIR) system query results, hypothesis test and Hubert's F statistic for cluster validation. Our experiment results suggest that images originated from different categories do form clusters in the feature space and thus can be separated. We then analysis the performance of clustering algorithms including K-Means, Fuzzy C-Mean, CA-Clustering, Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) and the proposed modified DBSCAN algorithm with a second merging phase. Our experiment results suggest that the proposed algorithm has clustering performance among the best algorithms. And the proposed modified DBSCAN algorithm with a second merging phase can avoid some of the drawbacks (e.g., k random initial cluster centers) in the original K-Means algorithms.

To asses the validity of the clustering approaches used to this end several performance indices can be computed. In this paper we show using a well known multispectral image and well known clustering algorithms (K-means, Fuzzy c-means) that the performance indices are not equivalent and that they can even lead to misleading conclusions. A side observation is that we did not found systematic significant differences between the clustering algorithms.

An immunological density-preserving approach to the synthesis of RBF neural networks for classification	2006 IEEE INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORK PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1-10	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network	JUL 16-21, 2006	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE			REGULARIZATION; CONSTRUCTION	Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural networks are universal approximators and have been used for a wide range of applications. Aiming at reducing the number of neurons in the hidden layer, for regularization purposes, the center and dispersion of each RBF have to be properly defined by means of competitive learning. Only the output weights will be defined in a supervised manner. One of the drawbacks of such learning methodology, involving unsupervised and supervised learning, is that the centers will be defined so that regions in the input space with a high density of samples tend to be under-represented and those regions with a low density of samples tend to be over-represented. Additionally, few approaches provide a proper and individual indication of the dispersion of each RBF. This paper presents an immune density-preserving algorithm with adaptive radius, called ARIA, to determine the number of centers, their location and the dispersion of each RBF, based only on the available training data set. Considering classification problems, the algorithm to determine the hidden layer is compared to another immune-inspired algorithm called aiNet, K-means and the random choice of centers. The classification accuracy of the final network is compared to another density based approach and a decision tree classifier, C 5.0. The results are reported and analyzed.

The time series signals obtained from the same source of fire are highly correlated, and different sources of fire exhibit unique patterns in the time series data. Therefore, the error back propagation (BP) method can be effectively used for the classification of the tested smell. The accuracy of 99.6% is achieved by using only a single training data set from each source of fire. The accuracy achieved with the k-means algorithm is 98.3%, which also shows the high ability of the EN in detecting the early stage of fire from various sources.

A new facial expression recognition technique using 2-D DCT and neural networks based decision tree	2006 IEEE INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORK PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1-10	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network	JUL 16-21, 2006	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE				Human facial expression recognition (FER) has attracted much attention in recent years because of its importance in realizing highly intelligent human-machine interfaces. In this paper, we propose a new FER technique that utilizes the 2-D DCT of full size facial images and a decision tree with feedforward neural network (NN) based nodes. The first NN-based node of the decision tree is designated to separate one group of facial expressions with members "smile" and "surprise" from another group that contains "anger" and "sadness". This node can reduce the confusion between the category members of the two groups. Two NN-based nodes that follow the first node are established for each group to separate their two members. As a result, the original recognition problem with four categories is divided into three subproblems, each having only two members to distinguish. This work is the first trial to use NN, decision tree and 2-D DCT simultaneously within a single recognition task. To demonstrate the capability of the proposed recognition technique, we use two databases, including a recently constructed one, which contain 2-D front face images of 60 men and 60 women, respectively. Experimental results reveal that the new technique outperforms, on the whole, the simple vector matching and K-means based vector matching techniques and two recently developed methods using fixed-size and constructive neural networks. The mean recognition rates of the new technique have been found as high as 97.5% and 93.8% for these two databases, respectively, which are the best results among those obtained for the same databases.

This method is based on the pixel neighbourhood relation. Each pixel is transformed into a vector, V = (n, e, s, w), where each element of the vector represents the total number of neighbour pixels in the respective direction, north, east, south, west. A binary object is represented by a set of neighbourhood vectors (NV), in which the information of the shape structure is retained. The k-means and fuzzy c-means clustering methods are used to reduce the total amount of NV and the probability distribution of the reduced NV is used to characterize a class of image. We applied this method for handwritten character recognition, using neural network as classifiers. The results show that the shape parameter can be used as a general method of feature extraction for problems in image processing and pattern recognition. In addition, we present an application of this representation scheme for the neighbourhood image operator.

This greatly improves upon our prior IJCNN hierarchical design. At each node in the hierarchy, we apply the SVRDM (support vector representation and discrimination machine) classifier, which offers generalization and good rejection ability. We also provide new theoretical bases and methods for our choice of the kernel function and new SVRDM parameter selection rules. Classification and rejection test results are presented on new databases of both simulated and real infra-red (IR) data.

During the analysis of such data the need for a functional grouping of genes arises. In this paper, we propose grouping genes according to their biological function by means of kernel functions, which are similarity measures having special mathematical properties and play a crucial role e.g. in SVM classification. Thereby our kernel functions rely on functional information on the genes provided by Gene Ontology annotation. We investigate and compare several provably symmetric, positive semidefinite kernel functions in combination with spectral clustering, dual k-means and average linkage and demonstrate that our approach leads to good clustering results.

The first goal of this research is to develop a method for automated road safety analysis using video sensors in order to address the problem of a dependency on the deteriorating collision data. The method will automate the extraction of traffic conflicts (near misses) from video sensor data. To our knowledge, there is limited research primarily applied to traffic conflicts. In this paper a method based on the clustering of vehicle trajectories is presented. The clustering uses a k-means approach with hidden Markov models and a simple heuristic to find the number of clusters automatically. Traffic conflicts can then be detected by identifying and adapting pairs of models of conflicting trajectories. The technique is demonstrated on real world video sequences of traffic conflicts.

However, it may still yield poor performance in some circumstances. In this paper, we consider a discrete optimization model for spkmeans. By using the convexity of objective function and specific structure of constraint set, we first reformulate the discrete problem as an equivalent convex maximization problem with linear constraints. Then we characterize the local optimality of relaxed problem. Based on the characteristics, we refine the spherical k-means algorithm by alternatively performing spherical k-means and switching data points between clusters. This strategy guarantees that the refined algorithm can always attain a local optimal solution.

Biologically inspired KFLANN Place fields for robot localization	2006 IEEE INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORK PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1-10	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Network	JUL 16-21, 2006	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE			MEMORY; NAVIGATION; SLEEP	This paper presents a hippocampal inspired robot localization model that provides a means for a simple robotic platform with ultrasonic sensors to localize itself. There have been published neurobiological. experiments where rats were found to have hippocampal cell activations that positively correlate with the location of the animal [2, 3, 5]. Such activations found in the hippocampal region are usually called Place fields (PF) or Place cells (PC). The Place Field Model presented in this paper was designed using a unique K-Means Fast Learning Artificial Neural Network (KFLANN) [13, 14, 15] and establishes a series of localization minima points that act as references for navigation. While such evidence of place cells are seen in hippocampal (CA1) and deep layers of the entorhinal cortex (EC) [4], a literature search indicates it is uncertain whether any applications were ever designed using such biological evidence. This paper aims to focus on experimental results relevant for a proof-of-concept of robot localization, rather than illustrating a robustly tested navigation system. As such, basic ultrasonic based experiments will suffice.

We analyze three months of network log data from a deployed public safety trunked radio network. After data cleaning and traffic extraction, we apply the K-means algorithm and identify that three clusters of talk groups best reflect users' behavior patterns represented by the hourly number of calls. We propose a traffic prediction model by applying the classical SARIMA models on clusters of users. The predicted network traffic agrees with the collected traffic data and the proposed cluster-based prediction approach performs well compared to the prediction based on the aggregate traffic.

Determination of the grey level ranks for the segmentation of textured images	2006 IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics, Vols 1-7			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics	JUL 09-13, 2006	Montreal, CANADA	IEEE Ind Elect Soc, ABB Canada, Ecol Technol Superieure			CLOUD CLASSIFICATION; FEATURES	In many cases, an image is made of various types of texture. Such diversity can be usefully exploited to get a suitable decomposition of the image into typical classes and then, identify its constitutive elements. Among the approaches used to segment textured images, those based on the statistical analysis of the neighborhood of each pixel seem to be most efficient. In this paper, this kind of method is implemented, which consists in coding the pixels surrounding each point of the image by taking into account the path traveling through them and their grey levels. The rank vectors namely the codes obtained for all the possible paths, are then classified using the K-means algorithm. Considering the 24rank vectors, this method is tested on different images of the Brodatz album and compared with Laws filters and GLCM. It yields a satisfactory reproduction of the image contours and a classification ratio exceeding 98 %. The 24 rank based-method is also applied to meteorological images collected by Meteosat over Europe and North Africa during December 1994. It is found that these images can be segmented into eight typical classes assignable to the soils, the seas and the clouds observed in the regions under study.

Two adaptive methods were implemented, namely the incremental version of the expectation-maximization (EM) and segmental k-means algorithms. The algorithms were implemented in an ECG segmentation system which classificatory is based on HMM. The performance criteria adopted are waveform detection, segmentation precision, and ischemia detection. For the tests, were used the QT and ST-T databases. The experiments have shown that the system adaptation for each individual improves the system reliability and increases the system performance. Furthermore, our results compare favorably with other works in the literature.	Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Vitoria, Brazil	Muller, SMT (reprint author), Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Vitoria, Brazil.

This is carried out by the use of a two-level classification approach including, high and low levels. We propose a new concept called phoneme family. To obtain phoneme families, we employ k-mean clustering method. A given unknown phoneme is first classified into a phoneme family at high level classification. Then, the exact label of the phoneme is determined at low level classification. We have used a combined framework of statistical and neural network based classifiers. Encouraging results are obtained by applying the proposed method on TIMIT database and its performance is compared against other methods.

At present cancer classification is done mainly by looking through the cells' morphological differences, which do not always give a clear distinction of cancer subtypes. Unfortunately, this may have a significant impact on the final outcome of whether a patient could be cured effectively. Microarray technology can play an important role on diagnosing which type of disease one is carrying. The gene selection process is critical for developing gene markers for faster and more accurate diagnosis. In this paper, we develop a method using pairwise data comparisons instead of the one-over-the-rest approach used nowadays. Results are evaluated using available clustering techniques including hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering. Using pairwise comparison, the best accuracy achieved is 95% while it is only 83% when using one-over-the-rest approach.

This is achieved using a recursive k-means clustering method, the output of which initializes successive parameter-less region growing procedures. The method automatically produces templates corresponding to bone, lung, soft and dense tissue (muscle and fat). The segmentation of each tissue class from k-means clustering is used to compensate for the higher statistical noise variation seen at lower dose. The use of the region grower provides local contextual information that minimizes the impact of global noise. The templates were assigned appropriate linear attenuation coefficients and then convolved with the PET/SPECT system's PSF. This approach was applied to a dataset from an experimental anthropomorphic phantom exposed to systematically reducing CT dose derived from an X-ray beam at 140kVp and varying current from 160mA (full diagnostic dose) to 10mA (ultra low dose). Preliminary results show that for the purpose of CT attenuation correction, it is possible to successfully produce attenuation maps at ultra low dose with very low error (compared to full diagnostic dose) if used with the segmentation method presented.

VOLS 1-5			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE/PES Power Systems Conference and Exposition	OCT 29-NOV 01, 2006	Atlanta, GA	IEEE, PES		artificial neural networks; clustering; electricity markets; price forecasting; risk management; volatility	MODELS	Factors such as uncertainty associated to fuel prices, energy demand and generation availability, are on the basis of the agents major concerns in electricity markets. Facing that reality, price forecasting has an increasing impact in agents' activity. The success on bidding strategies or on price negotiation for bilateral contracts is directly dependent on the accuracy of the price forecast. However, taking decisions based only on a single forecasted value is not a good practice in risk management. The work presented in this paper makes use of artificial neural networks to find the market price for a given period, with a certain confidence level. Historical information was used to train the neural networks and the number of neural networks used is dependent of the number of clusters found on that data. K-Means clustering method is used to find clusters. A study case with real data is presented and discussed in detail.

In this paper, feature vector based methods have been suggested for the classification of wafers and their application to the root cause analysis. Local bin profile has been calculated to generate a feature vector,for a wafer. K-means clustering method has been used to cluster these vectors for the classification of wafers. ANOVA or Kruscal-Wallis test has been applied to one of the components of a feature vector for the yield analysis, depending on its normality. Our yield analysis examples have proven that these analysis methods are very effective and quick in pinpointing the root cause for the various types of failures, especially the equipment-originated ones, including those otherwise would be impossible with the conventional methods.

For instance, the k-Means is one of the most used in the literature, and many authors successfully compare their new proposal with the results achieved by the k-Means. However, it is well known that clustering image segmentation has many problems. For instance, the number of regions of the image has to be known a priori, as well as different initial seed placement (initial clusters) could produce different segmentation results. Most of these algorithms could be slightly improved by considering the coordinates of the image as features in the clustering process (to take spatial region information into account). In this paper we propose a significant improvement of clustering algorithms for image segmentation. The method is qualitatively and quantitative evaluated over a set of synthetic and real images, and compared with classical clustering approaches. Results demonstrate the validity of this new approach.

BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION AND K-MEANS CLUSTERING FOR VASCULAR ARFI IMAGE SEGMENTATION, In Vivo and Ex Vivo	2006 IEEE ULTRASONICS SYMPOSIUM, VOLS 1-5, PROCEEDINGS	ULTRASONICS SYMPOSIUM		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium	OCT 03-06, 2006	Vancouver, CANADA	IEEE			INDUCED LESIONS; RADIATION; FEASIBILITY; TISSUE	Blind source separation (BSS) is a time domain method for signal decomposition previously demonstrated in medical ultrasound for adaptive regression filtering. Just as BSS is relevant to clutter rejection by differentiating RF signals from moving blood versus arterial wall tissue, BSS is useful for distinguishing displacement profiles measured in tissue exhibiting different mechanical responses to radiation force. In concert with K-means clustering, an algorithm for partitioning N data points into K subsets, BSS can be employed for automated image segmentation via mechanical property in Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) ultrasound. We present BSS-based ARFI image segmentation in application to the peripheral vasculature. First, our segmentation method is validated using a synthetic data set with additive noise. Second, our method is demonstrated in an excised atherosclerotic familial hypercholesterolemic (FH) pig iliac artery with confirmation by matched immunohistochemistry. Finally, the method is applied to segmenting in vivo ARFI images in an atherosclerotic FH pig iliac artery as well as a human popliteal vein with no known disease. This work substantiates additional applications of BSS-based ARFI image segmentation.	[Mauldin, F.

Crimes are a social nuisance and cost our society dearly in several ways. Any research that can help in solving crimes faster will pay for itself A bout 10% of the criminals commit about 50% of the crimes. Here we look at use of clustering algorithm for a data mining approach to help detect the crimes patterns and speed up the process of solving crime. We will look at k-means clustering with some enhancements to aid in the process of identification of crime patterns. We applied these techniques to real crime data from a sheriffs office and validated our results. We also use semi-supervised learning technique here for knowledge discovery from the crime records and to help increase the predictive accuracy. We also developed a weighting scheme for attributes here to deal with limitations of various out of the box clustering tools and techniques. This easy to implement data mining framework works with the geospatial plot of crime and helps to improve the productivity of the detectives and other law enforcement officers. It can also be applied for counter terrorism for homeland security.

An evolutionary tabu search (TS) algorithm is proposed to search the optimal solution to the task allocation problem. In this algorithm, TS serves, as the mutation operator in evolutionary algorithm. Evolutionary computation (EC) gives appropriate initial value and TS helps to find a better solution. In order to meet the requirements of task reallocation in dynamic environment, a partially regroup strategy based on K-mean clustering is employed to find the new solutions in real time while keeping the optimality of results. Our algorithm incorporates domain-specific knowledge and takes into account different kinds of mission constraints. Simulation results validate the feasibility and efficiency of our algorithm.

Therefore, according to the particularity of logistic distribution, the improved cluster first/route second algorithm is adopted to get solutions. Namely, the customer group can be divided into several regions using k-means algorithm in first phase. And in every region it can be decomposed into small scale subsets according with some restraint conditions using scan algorithm. In second phase, it is route optimization problems of several single TSP model. Therefore, the study proposes the improved genetic algorithm, which using individual amount control selection game in order to guarantee group diversity, using order cross operator and partial route overturn mutation operator to improve convergent speed of algorithm so as to better solve the inconsistency between diversity and convergent speed In the end the test proves the validity of this improved cluster first/route second algorithm combining with examples.

SAR image classification based on unsupervised learning usually requires optimization of some metrics. Local optimization techniques frequently fail because functions of these metrics with respect to transformation parameters are generally nonconvex and irregular and, therefore, global methods are often required. In this paper, a new evolutionary approach, particle swarm optimization, is adapted for SAR image classification. The new algorithm composes of three main processes: firstly, selecting training samples for every region in the SAR image. Secondly, training these samples using PSO and obtain clustering center Of every region. Finally, output the classification result of SAR image according to clustering center obtained To show the effectiveness of this approach, experiment with simulated SAR image was considered The classification results are evaluated by comparing with two well-known algorithms, K-means and fuzzy K-means. According to the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient, PSO has high classification precision and can be used in SAR images classification.

But people often suppose that the number of source signals is known when they estimate the mixture matrix by the k-mean clustering algorithm. In fact, the number of source signals is unknown or blind, so it is very important to estimate the number of source signals first. In this paper, a new two-step algorithm is proposed, which not only can estimate the number of source signals but also get the mixture matrix instead of k-mean algorithm.

High speed document clustering in reconfigurable hardware	2006 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FIELD PROGRAMMABLE LOGIC AND APPLICATIONS, PROCEEDINGS	International Conference on Field Programmable and Logic Applications		English	Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications	AUG 28-30, 2006	Madrid, SPAIN	Univ Autonoma Madrid, Sch Engn, IEEE Circuits & Syst Soc				High-performance document clustering systems enable similar documents to be automatically organized into groups In the past, the large Amount of computational time needed to cluster documents prevented practical use of such systems with a large number of documents. A full hardware implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm has been designed and implemented in reconfigurable hardware that clusters 512k documents rapidly. This implementation, uses four parallel cosine distance metrics to cluster document vectors that each have 4000 dimensions. The synthesized hardware runs on the Field Programmable Port Extender (FPX) platform at a clock rate of 80 MHz. Although the clock rate on the Xilinx VirtexE 2000 is slower than a CPU, the implementation runs 26 times faster than an algorithmically equivalent software algorithm running on an Intel 3.60 GHz Xeon. The same architecture was used to synthesize a faster and larger design for the Xilinx Virtex4 LX200. This larger implementation can contain up to 25 parallel cosine distance metrics. The implementation synthesized with a clock rate of 250 Mhz and outperforms the equivalent software by a factor of 328.

In the simple k-means clustering algorithm, each point in the dataset is compared with centers of all clusters. This comparison is a very time consuming task, particularly for large dataset and large number of clusters. In order to achieve high performance, we need to filter out clusters which have to be compared with each point efficiently. In this paper, we describe an FPGA implementation of k-means clustering for color images. In our implementation, clusters are filtered out using kd-trees which are dynamically generated on the FPGA in each iteration of k-means clustering. With one XC2V6000, the performance for 512 x 512 and 640 x 480 pixel images (24-bit full color RGB) is more than 30 fps, and 20 - 30 fps for 756 x 512 pixel images in average when dividing to 256 clusters.

While the availability of always on communication has created countless new opportunities for web based businesses, information sharing, and coordination, it has also created new opportunities for those that seek to illegally disrupt, subvert, or attack these activities. We present natural based data mining algorithm approach to data clustering. Artificial ant clustering algorithm is used to initially create raw clusters and then these clusters are refined using k-mean particle swarm optimization (KPSO). KPSO that has been developed as evolutionary-based clustering technique. The algorithm uses hybridization the k-means algorithm and PSO principle to find good partitions of the data. Certain unnecessary complications of the original algorithm are discussed and means of overcoming these complexities are proposed We propose k-means particle swarm optimization clustering algorithm in the second stage for refinement mean of overcoming these complexities is proposed. Our approach allows us to recognize not only known attacks but also to detect suspicious activity that may be the result of a new, unknown attack.

Thus, important relations between Cardiac dimensions (CD) may be misinterpreted. Clustering is commonly used in Data Mining (DM) and aimed to partition data into clusters. The aim of this work was to find possible correlations between CD in order to upgrade and improve diagnostic abilities. This relation was already proved for homogenous populations (and known mechanism) of diseases such as Hypertension. In contrast, in our work the population was heterogeneous (normal and various diseases) with no known mechanism (such as Hypertension). Therefore, clustering algorithms such as K-means (KM), Kohonen (Koh) and TwoStep (TS) were applied on 24,400 data objects of Cardiac Echo measurements. The commercial DM tool Clementine (Clem) was used. Each algorithm generated different clusters. Despite this, between left atrial Area (LA Area) and ascending aortic Diameter (AsAo_Dia), pathological correlations were identified.

Accurate sound scene analysis would be useful in various applications such as home security, surveillance and understanding of a human action and a natural environment. The feasibility of personal identification based on indoor footstep has been confirmed by using feature parameters extracted from footstep[3]. We recorded typical environmental sounds generated by the car, the motorized bicycle(bike), the running footstep (running) and the walking footstep (walking), respectively. Recognition was examined using these experimental sounds. In this paper, we propose a k-means clustering using psycho-acoustic parameters for sound scene analysis. Results show a possibility that a surrounding situation can be predicted from environmental sounds.

Moving objects in a video scene are detected by the MPEG like motion vector search algorithm. Macro-blocks associated with a motion vector are used as image segments that contain moving objects. Feature points defined in terms of salient corners are then determined by the the SUSAN principle of corner detection. The K-means clustering is applied to the obtained feature points. Some variants such as the centroid coordinates and average radius are useful indices that indicate the change of video scene. Preliminary results of scene change detection by this proposed method are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

To expect current groups of slabs that have not classified, a model for the system is needed. For this model, neural network with MLP(Multi-Layer Perceptron) was used. Finally, some sequence of slabs, which affect the life loss, will be represented.

Ultrasonic diagnostics has made possible the detection of cysts, tumors or cancers in abdominal organs. In this paper, the possibilities of an automatic classification of ultrasonic liver images by optimal selection of texture features are explored. These features are used to classify these images into four classes-Normal, Cyst, Benign and Malignant masses. The Texture features are extracted using the various statistical and signal processing methods. The automatic optimal feature selection process is based on the principal component analysis. This method extracts the principal features, or directions of maximum information from the data set. Using this new reduced feature set, the abnormalities are classified using the K-means clustering method. Based on the correct classification rate, a new optimal reduced feature set is created by combining the principal features extracted from the different texture features, to get a higher classification rate.

In this paper we apply Differential Evolution to the problem of generating an optimal colour map for colour quantised images. The choice of entries in the colour map is crucial for the resulting image quality as it forms a look-up table for all pixels in the image. We show that Differential Evolution can be effectively employed as a method for deriving the entries in the map. In order to optimise the image quality our Differential Evolution approach is combined with a local search method that is guaranteed to find the local optimal colour map. This hybrid approach is shown to outperform various commonly used colour quantisation algorithms on a set of standard images.

Our approach hierarchically reduces the redundancy of features with high explanation in PCA for choosing a good subset of features critical to improve the performance of classifiers. Based on this result, we evaluate the performance of intrusion detection by using a nonparametric density estimation approach based on Parzen-Window and k-Nearest Neighbor classifiers over data sets with reduced features.

First proposed by Besl and McKay, the algorithm is widely used in computational geometry where it is known for its simplicity and its observed speed. The theoretical study of ICP was initiated by Ezra, Sharir and Efrat, who bounded its worst-case running time between Omega(n logn) and O(n(2)d)(d). We substantially tighten this gap by improving the lower bound to Omega(n/d)(d+1). To help reconcile this bound with the algorithm's observed speed, we also show the smoothed complexity of ICP is polynomial, independent of the dimensionality of the data. Using similar methods, we improve the best known smoothed upper bound for the popular k-means method to n(O(k)), once again independent of the dimension.

We propose and justify a clusterability criterion for data sets. We present variants of Lloyd's heuristic that quickly lead to provably near-optimal clustering solutions when applied to well-clusterable instances. This is the first performance guarantee for a variant of Lloyd's heuristic. The provision of a guarantee on output quality does not come at the expense of speed: some of our algorithms are candidates for being faster in practice than currently used variants of Lloyd's method. In addition, our other algorithms are faster on well-clusterable instances than recently proposed approximation algorithms, while maintaining similar guarantees on clustering quality. Our main algorithmic contribution is a novel probabilistic seeding process for the starting configuration of a Lloyd-type iteration.

Such facilities are not restricted to being points in R(d), and can represent more complex structures such as linear facilities (lines in R(d), j-dimensional flats), etc. We introduce coresets for weighted (point) facilities. These prove to be useful for such generalized facility location problems, and provide efficient algorithms for their construction. Applications include: k-mean and k-median generalizations, i.e., find k lines that minimize the sum (or sum of squares) of the distances from each input point to its nearest line. Other applications are generalizations of linear regression problems to multiple regression lines, new SVD/PCA generalizations, and many more. The results significantly improve on previous work, which deals efficiently only with special cases. Open source code for the algorithms in this paper is also available.

Medical image segmentation using K-MEANS clustering and improved watershed algorithm	7th IEEE Southwest Symposium on Image Analysis and Interpretation			English	Proceedings Paper	7th IEEE Southwest Symposium on Image Analysis and Interpretation (SSIAI 2006)	MAR 26-28, 2006	Denver, CO				C-MEANS ALGORITHM	We propose a methodology that incorporates k-means and improved watershed segmentation algorithm for medical image segmentation. The use of the conventional watershed algorithm for medical image analysis is widespread because of its advantages, such as always being able to produce a complete division of the image. However, its drawbacks include over segmentation and sensitivity to false edges. We address the drawbacks of the conventional watershed algorithm when it is applied to medical images by using K-means clustering to produce a primary segmentation of the image before we apply our improved watershed segmentation algorithm to it. The K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm, while the improved watershed segmentation algorithm makes use of automated thresholding on the gradient magnitude map and post-segmentation merging on the initial partitions to reduce the number of false edges and over segmentation. By comparing the number of partitions in the segmentation maps of 50 images, we showed that our proposed methodology produced segmentation maps which have 92% fewer partitions than the segmentation maps produced by the conventional watershed algorithm.

These compounds were shown to have significant correlations and associations in their properties after analysis by pattern recognition methods including hierarchical classification, cluster analysis, nonmetric multi-dimensional scaling ( MDS), detrended correspondence analysis, K-means cluster analysis, discriminant analysis, and self-organizing tree algorithm ( SOTA) analysis. Detrended correspondence analysis showed a linear-like association of the 9 homologs, and hierarchical classification showed that each homolog had great similarity to at least one other member of the series-as did cluster analysis using paired-group distance measure. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling was able to discriminate homologs 2 and 3 ( by number of methylene groups) from homologs 4, 5, and 6 as a group, and from homologs 7, 8, and 9 as a group. Discriminant analysis, K-means cluster analysis, and hierarchical classification distinguished the high molecular weight homologs from low molecular weight homologs. As the number of methylene groups increased the aqueous solubility decreased, dermal permeation coefficient increased, Log P increased, molar volume increased, parachor increased, and index of refraction decreased. Application of pattern recognition methods discerned useful interrelationships within the homologous series that will determine specific and beneficial clinical applications for each homolog and methods of administration.

J	Carpenter, KM; Liu, XH; Hasin, DS				Carpenter, KM; Liu, XH; Hasin, DS			The Type A-Type B classification in a community sample of problem drinkers: Structural and predictive validity	ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS			English	Article						alcohol dependence; type I-Type II; subtype	DSM-IV ALCOHOL; INTERVIEW SCHEDULE AUDADIS; GENERAL-POPULATION SAMPLE; NATIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGIC SURVEY; EMPIRICALLY DERIVED TYPOLOGY; USE DISORDER CRITERIA; DRINKING PATTERNS; ABUSE DIAGNOSES; HEAVY DRINKERS; UNITED-STATES	Objective: The Type A-Type B multidimensional classification model has been useful for identifying a subgroup of alcohol dependent drinkers with more severe psychosocial problems and a poor prognosis. Evidence suggests its dimensions may be useful for identifying problem drinkers in the general population at risk for developing alcohol dependence. To date, the model has not yet been investigated for this purpose. The present study investigated the Type A/Type B distinction in a community sample of problem drinkers as well as its predictive validity among problem drinkers with no history of alcohol dependence. Method: Households from a geographically delimited area in the United States were designated via random digit dialing and randomly designated members were screened for eligibility. A total of 876 participants met eligibility criteria and completed a structured interview (AUDADIS) on alcohol and other health related behaviors at baseline and at 1-year follow-up. A k-means cluster analysis was performed to identify subgroups of problem drinkers. Results: A two-cluster solution adequately fit the data and identified two main subgroups of problem drinkers consistent with a Type A-Type B distinction. The group differences held among those with and without a history of alcohol dependence and the subset of Type B drinkers with no history of alcohol dependence were approximately five times (beta=1.56, p <= 0.01) more likely to have an initial onset of dependence than Type A drinkers at 1-year follow-tip. In contrast, a DSM-IV alcohol abuse diagnosis at baseline did not predict 1-year onset of dependence. Conclusions: The Type A-Type B model is useful for identifying untreated problem drinkers at risk for developing alcohol dependence. This model may facilitate the development of more targeted prevention efforts. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While several artificial intelligence (AI) paradigms are addressed for gait analysis, they usually utilize supervised techniques where subject groups are defined a priori. In this paper, we explore to investigate gait pattern mining with clustering-based approaches, in which k-means and hierarchical clustering algorithms are employed to derive gait pattern. After feature selection and data preparation, we conduct clustering on the constructed gait data model to build up pattern-based clusters. The centroids of clusters are then treated as the subject profiles to model the various kinds of gait pattern, e.g. normal or pathological. Experiments are undertaken to visualize the derived subject clusters, evaluate the quality of clustering paradigm in terms of silhouette and mean square error and compare the results with the discovery derived from hierarchy tree analysis. In addition, analysis conducted on test data demonstrates the usability of the proposed paradigm in clinical applications.

Compared to the original Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), QPSO is global convergent, while the PSO is not. This paper focuses on exploring the applicability of the QPSO to data clustering. Firstly, we introduce the K-means clustering algorithm and the concepts of PSO and QPSO. Then we present how to use the QPSO to cluster data vectors. After that, experiments are implemented to compare the performance of various clustering algorithms. The results show that the QPSO can generate good results in clustering data vectors with tolerable time consumption.

So many methods are being proposed all around world and one of them is to use patent information. Moreover, with efforts of governments in many countries, many patent analysis methods have been exploited and suggested usually on the basis of patent documents. However, current patent analysis methods have some limitations. In this paper, we suggest a new visualization method for a patent map, which represents patent analysis results with considering both structured and unstructured items of each patent document. And by the adoption of the k-means clustering algorithm and semantic networks, we suggest concrete steps to make a patent map which gives a clear and instinctive insight on the targeted technology. In application, we built up a patent map for the ubiquitous computing technology and discussed an overall view of its progresses.

Revealing the functional correlated genes with co-expression pattern from microarray data allows us to infer the transcriptional regulatory networks and perform functional annotation of genes, and has become one vital step towards the implementation of integrative systems biology. Clustering is particularly useful and preliminary methodology for the discovery of co-expressed genes, for which many conventional clustering algorithms developed in the literature can be potentially useful. However, due to existing large amount of noise and a variety of uncertainties in the niicroarray data, it is vital important to develop techniques which are robust to noise and effective to incorporate user-specified objectives and preference. For this particular purpose, this paper presented a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based hybrid method for the co-expression gene discovery, which intends to extract the gene groups that have maximal dissimilarity between groups and maximal similarity within a group. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is able to extract more meaningful, sensible and significant co-expression gene groups than the traditional clustering methods such as the K-means algorithm. Besides presenting the proposed hybrid GA-based clustering algorithm for co-expression gene discovery, this paper introduces a new framework of integrative systems biology employed in our current research.

Document clustering has been used as a tool to facilitate the extraction of such information. However, existing clustering methods do not take into account the sequences of the words in the documents, and usually do not have the means to describe the contents within each topic cluster. In this paper, we record our investigation and results using Maximal Frequent word Sequences (MFSs) as building blocks in identifying distinct topics. The supporting documents of MFSs are grouped into an equivalence class and then linked to a topic cluster, and the MFSs serve as the document cluster identifier. We describe the original method in extracting the set of MFSs, and how it can be adapted to identify topics in a textual dataset. We also demonstrate how the MFSs themselves can act as topic descriptors for the clusters. Finally, the benchmarking study with other existing clustering methods, i.e. k-Means and EM algorithm, shows the effectiveness of our approach for topic detection.

We focus on re-clustering an object set, previously clustered, when the feature set characterizing the objects increases. We have developed adaptive extensions for two traditional clustering algorithms (k-means and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering). These extensions can be used for adjusting a clustering, that was established by applying the corresponding non-adaptive clustering algorithm before the feature set changed. We aim to reach the result more efficiently than applying the corresponding non-adaptive algorithm starting from the current clustering or from scratch. Experiments testing the method's efficiency are also reported.

The main advantage of the method is the ability to bypass the problem of overlapping patterns in neighboring positions of sequences by using a Markov random field (MRF) prior. This model consists of two components, the first models the pattern and the second the background. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used to estimate the model parameters and provides closed form updates. Special care is also taken to overcome the known dependence of the EM algorithm to initialization. This is done by applying an adaptive clustering scheme based on the k-means algorithm in order to produce good initial values for the pattern multinomial model. Experiments with artificial sets of sequences show that the proposed approach discovers qualitatively better patterns, in comparison with maximum likelihood (ML) and Gibbs sampling (GS) approaches.

In IHGA-clustering, DHB operation is developed to improve the individual and accelerate the convergence speed, and partition-mergence mutation operation is designed to reassign objects among different clusters. Equipped with these two components, IHGA-clustering can stably output the proper result. Its superiority over HGA-clustering, GKA, and KGA-clustering is extensively demonstrated for experimental data sets.

The process present a multi-strategy mining approach realized by the smooth integration of three distinct data-mining components: clustering (based on a discretized k-means approach), association rules mining, and feature-selection for selecting discrimant genes. The proposed CGKD process is applied on a real-world gene-expression profiling study (i.e., clinical outcome of breast cancer patients).

This new proposal uses one of the well known evolutionary algorithms called Scatter Search. Scatter Search operates on a small set of solutions and makes only a limited use of randomization for diversification when searching for globally optimal solutions. The proposed method discovers automatically cluster number and cluster centres without prior knowledge of a possible number of class, and without any initial partition. We have applied this algorithm on standard and real world databases and we have obtained good results compared to the K-means algorithm and an artificial ant based algorithm, the Antclass algorithm.

S	Pei, J; Hong, J; Bell, D		Yakhno, T; Neuhold, EJ		Pei, Jin; Hong, Jun; Bell, David			A novel clustering-based approach to schema matching	ADVANCES IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Advances in Information Systems	OCT 18-20, 2006	Izmir, TURKEY	Dokuz Eylul Univ Presidents Off, TUBITAK, Gonen Bilgi Teknolojileri Danismanlik Ltd				Schema matching is a critical step in data integration from multiple heterogeneous data sources. This paper presents a new approach to schema matching, based on two observations. First, it is easier to find attribute correspondences between those schemas that are contextually similar. Second, the attribute correspondences found between these schemas can be used to help find new attribute correspondences between other schemas. Motivated by these observations, we propose a novel clustering-based approach to schema matching. First, we cluster schemas on the basis of their contextual similarity. Second, we cluster attributes of the schemas that are in the same schema cluster to find attribute correspondences between these schemas. Third, we cluster attributes across different schema clusters using statistical information gleaned from the existing attribute clusters to find attribute correspondences between more schemas. We leverage a fast clustering algorithm, the K-Means algorithm, to the above three clustering tasks. We have evaluated our approach in the context of integrating information from multiple web interfaces and the results show the effectiveness of our approach.

This method identifies the high density neighborhoods from the data first and then selects the central points of the neighborhoods as initial centers. The recently published Neighborhood-Based Clustering (NBC) algorithm is used to search for high density neighborhoods. The new clustering algorithm NK-means integrates NBC into the k-means clustering process to improve the performance of the k-means algorithm while preserving the k-means efficiency. NBC is enhanced with a new cell-based neighborhood search method to accelerate the search for initial cluster centers. A merging method is employed to filter out insignificant initial centers to avoid too many clusters being generated. Experimental results on synthetic data sets have shown significant improvements in clustering accuracy in comparison with the random k-means and the refinement k-means algorithms.

When data mining techniques are applied to these data, their uncertainty has to be considered to obtain high quality results. We present UK-means clustering, an algorithm that enhances the K-means algorithm to handle data uncertainty. We apply UK-means to the particular pattern of moving-object uncertainty. Experimental results show that by considering uncertainty, a clustering algorithm can produce more accurate results.

Instead of depending on traditional vector space model, this approach represents a set of documents as bipartite graphs using domain knowledge in ontology. In this representation, the concepts of the documents are classified according to their relationships with documents that are reflected on the bipartite graph. Using the concept groups, documents are clustered based on the concepts' contribution to each document. Through the mutual-refinement relationship with concept groups and document groups, the two groups are recursively refined. Our experimental results on MEDLINE articles show that our approach outperforms two leading document clustering algorithms: BiSecting K-means and CLUTO. In addition to its decent performance, our approach provides a meaningful explanation for each document cluster by identifying its most contributing concepts, thus helps users to understand and interpret documents and clustering results.

The algorithm can effectively handle noise, outliers and auto-correlation in the spatial data, for effective and efficient data analysis, and thus can be used for predicting oil-palm yield by analyzing various factors affecting the yield.
